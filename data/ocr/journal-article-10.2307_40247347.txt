<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR THE ARTIST": STEVENS AND FLAUBERT B.J.Leggett Stendhal is a point of reference for the mature, while Flaubert is a point of reference for the artist, and perhaps for the immature. Flaubert takes possession of the immature and almost develops a sense of maturity and of competence and strength. - Wallace Stevens, Letters 505 Michael Riffaterre s concept of ungrammaticality is useful as a strategy for discussing unusually difficult texts - like many of those ofWallace Stevens - since it treats the difficulty itself as a sign of the text s implicit or potential significance. The theory assumes that intratextual anomalies, "obscure word- ings, phrasings that the context alone will not suffice to explain," alert the reader to the possibility of an (absent) intertext. These ungrammaticalities are "traces left by the absent intertext, signs of an incompleteness to be completed elsewhere." l And since the text can be completed only by some- thing found outside it, "the core of significance always remains implicit."2 That is, the intertext (and the "hypogram" or commonplace, cliché, or con- ventional association it contains) may never be identified, but the anoma- lies signal the text's incompleteness, the fact that its full significance must be deferred in the absence of the intertext. Responding to the objection that his theory assumes an enormous store of literary knowledge on the part of the reader, Riffaterre concedes that the identity of the intertext and its hypogram may be a matter of "perception" or chance; "the reader simply cannot identify [the hypogram] unless it has become part and parcel of his culture, unless he already knows the other text wherein it is contained." He notes, however, that "even while the hypogram remains unidentified, the text's troublesomeness keeps pointing to the need; the hypogram must be found, a solution outside the text must be found, in the intertext" ("Interview" 14).

Copyright © 2002 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 223</page><page sequence="2">224 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Ungrammaticalities, then, are not necessarily violations of grammati- cal conventions, but words, phrases, passages whose full significance could be grasped by the reader only if the absent text to which they refer could be supplied. Riffaterre has identified three types of intertextuality, which he labels complementary, mediated, and intratextual. He has also noted that the signal of ungrammaticality may take different forms - grammatical, syntactical, lexical, or figurai, for example - and that the relations between text and intertext may also exhibit different forms.3 1 want to discuss two related instances of Riffaterre s sense of ungrammaticality in the poetry of Wallace Stevens, crucial points in two important texts that resist interpre- tation. I will speculate on the identity of their common intertext, composed of a group of texts from Flaubert, and reread the passages against the pro- posed intertext. The first passage occurs in Notes toward a Supreme Fiction, at the con- clusion of Canto V of aIt Must Be Abstract."4 At the end of the preceding canto, the source of poetry has been traced to the poet's sense of alienation: From this the poem springs: that we live in a place That is not our own and, much more, not ourselves And hard it is in spite of blazoned days. Canto V apparently (and it is the interpretation of the canto that is in ques- tion here) develops this notion further by juxtaposing the language of the young poet, the ephebe, with the natural sounds of the nonhuman world. The canto begins with the roars, blares, and snarls of animals that appear to live in a place that is their own. The lion "Reddens the sand with his red- colored noise, / Defies red emptiness to evolve his match." The elephant "Breaches the darkness of Ceylon with blares," and the bear "snarls in his mountain / At summer thunder and sleeps through winter snow." Furnished the context established by the preceding canto, readers have had little difficulty in interpreting the first half of the canto as an image of animals living in harmony with their world, "their natural adjustment to reality marvellously displayed in the spontaneous noises they make," as Lucy Beckett puts it.5 The contrast between these spontaneous sounds and the difficult utterance of the young poet, suggesting the "pains of composi- tion," the "rigors of adequate realization and expression," in Frank Doggett's words,6 likewise presents no special impediment to reading and Stevens goes out of his way to make the contrast emphatic:</page><page sequence="3">Stevens and Flaubert 225 But you, ephebe, look from your attic window, Your mansard with a rented piano. You lie In silence upon your bed. You clutch the corner Of the pillow in your hand. You writhe and press A bitter utteranace from your writhing, dumb, Yet voluble of dumb violence.7 It is in the lines that follow that the canto becomes relatively unreadable. It ends, You look Across the roofs as sigil and as ward And in your centre mark them and are cowed . . . These are the heroic children whom time breeds Against the first idea - to lash the lion, Caparison elephants, teach bears to juggle. There are two difficulties here, although I am interested primarily in the second. The first has to do with the ephebe as sigil and ward of the roofs. The context of the passage, the sense of what precedes it, does not provide an adequate explanation of its significance. This has led commentators to explain its ungrammaticality by supplying texts to which it presumably re- fers. If nothing else these readings demonstrate that critics have always practiced an informal kind of intertextual criticism, especially in reading obscure texts. The author's statement of intention or elaboration has tradi- tionally been offered as an essential document for interpretation, and Hi Simons obtained this statement from Stevens: "What I mean by the words 'sigil and ward* is that the person referred to looks across the roofs, a crea- ture of the roofs, an image of them and a keeper of their secrets. "8 Many of the commentators who discuss the passage cite this letter, but as Daniel Schwarz points out in connection with Stevens's explanation, "The prob- lem with Stevens's retrospective comments is that he often defines one metaphor in terms of an equally obscure one."9 Robert Rehder proposes, convincingly, as antecedent text a passage from Baudelaire's "Paysage," one of the "Tableux Parisiens" in Les Fleurs du ma/, in which the poet looks out from the top of his mansarde and sees "Les</page><page sequence="4">226 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES tuyaux, les clochers, ces mâts de la cité, / Et les grands ciels qui font rêver d'éternité" [aThe down pipes, the steeples, those city masts / And the big skies which make us dream of eternity."]10 He does not, however, explain the difficulties of Stevens s passage (why the young poet is sigil and ward of the roofs and what that would mean in the canto as a whole); he uses his intertext to locate the scene and establish its mood: The wild animals roam- ing the world are contrasted with the ephebe shut in his attic room 'with a rented piano', living a dimly suggested Bohemian life in an unnamed Paris, solitary and anguished" (232). James Longenbach interestingly moves the locale of the scene to Lon- don and reads the passage in light of what would have been for Stevens in 1942 newspaper accounts of the London blitz. Longenbach points out that Stevens wrote the passage during the height of the blitz. The young poet as sigil and ward is a fire-watcher, "surveying the rooftops of the blacked-out city."11 The significance of the passage is to suggest the violence which cows the poet: "Although the ephebe is intimidated by this violence, Stevens concludes that this young poet will one day master the challenge of a vio- lence within - and that this young soldier will one day tame the animalistic agression of the violence without" (257). For Longenbach, then, the final three lines of the canto, in which the lion is lashed, the elephant adorned, and the bear taught to juggle, suggest the ultimate heroism and mastery of the poet. Longenbach's reading opens up the second difficulty of the canto's conclusion: how are we in fact to read the last three lines - as a triumphant image of the poet's mastery of nature or as an ironic and comic image of the poet's failure of realization? Attesting to the ungrammatically of the pas- sage are the conflicting explanations of Stevens's best readers, and since it is a crucial passage in one of his most important poems, it has attracted scores of explanations. I will cite only a few representative samples. Longenbach is not alone in seeing the passage as triumphant and heroic. For Robert Rehder, aThe metaphor is exuberant"; the poet "triumphs through the strength of his imagination" (232). Ronald Sukenick in his excellent guide to the Collected Poems argues also that the passage suggests the poet's mas- tery of reality, since mankind is "master of the beasts that are part of real- ity."12 Given the incompleteness of the passage it is not surprising to find other readings directly opposed to these. Daniel Schwarz proposes two texts by which to read the lines: a passage from Emerson's "The American Scholar" that uses the image of "the whelping of this lion" in speaking of the need to</page><page sequence="5">Stevens and Flaubert 227 avoid fear, and Yeats s "The Circus Animals' Desertion." Schwarz argues that the animals are identified with Stevens's concept of the "first idea,"13 and by turning them into circus animals the ephebe "violates the energy and purity of the first idea; for aren't the 'heroic children' who (necessarily) cow them ironic?" (167). "I hear little irony in calling the ephebe 'heroic,'" Eleanor Cook says on the other side. "He is right to look across the roofs," since "they belong to structures of belief or supreme fictions" (225), and she offers in support of her reading a passage from Stevens's journal in which he speaks of climbing up the stairs "into the distant company of strange yet friendly windows burning over the roofs" {Letters 67^68). Lucy Beckett does, however, hear irony in the passage, and it derives from the contrast between the spontaneous noise of the animals and the failed music of the poet. "Man, unable to find his proper voice, unable even to sleep, like the bear, at the proper time, can only wage distorting war upon reality. The end of this poem turns its imagery to sudden new account with stunning irony" (143). Helen Vendler, finally, has it both ways. The passage is "at once triumph and deprecation."14 A number of other critics have taken sides on the issues the canto raises and proposed various texts to aid in its interpretation,15 but perhaps these are sufficient to suggest its true difficulty. The second passage to be examined is, I will argue, another version of the first, and it occurs in "The Man on the Dump" {Collected Poems 201), written perhaps three years earlier. The passage begins the difficult last section of a poem which, to that point, had appeared accessible. The man on the dump is surely the poet, saddled with a language that has grown stale, no longer capable of realizing its object. The poem, like the animal canto of Notes, is about the difficulty of poetic realization, the wrestling with words. It is also about those rare moments in which the staleness of language is shed and one experiences the freshness of seeing what in the later poems is called the "first idea." Immediately preceding the passage in question is this description of such an experience in which one "feels the purifying change" and "rejects /The trash": That's the moment when the moon creeps up To the bubbling of bassoons. That's the time One looks at the elephant-coloring of tires. Everything is shed; and the moon comes up as the moon (All its images are in the dump) and you see As a man (not like an image of a man), You see the moon rise in the empty sky.</page><page sequence="6">228 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES The poem might well have ended here, in which case it would have been a poem about the poet's triumph over an intractable and inadequate language. But Stevens chose to add a final section that casts all that has come before it into doubt, since, as in the passage in Notes, the context and the intratextual clues are not sufficient to allow us to read it with any con- fidence. As Riffaterre says about such moments in texts, it shows "signs of an incompleteness to be completed elsewhere" ("Syllepsis" 627). Here is the passage that concludes the poem: One sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail. One beats and beats for that which one believes. That's what one wants to get near. Could it after all Be merely oneself, as superior as the ear To a crow's voice? Did the Nightingale torture the ear, Pack the heart and scratch the mind? And does the ear Solace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace, Is it a philosopher s honeymoon, one finds On the dump? Is it to sit among mattresses of the dead, Bottles, pots, shoes and grass and murmur aptest eve: Is it to hear the blatter of grackles and say Invisible priest, is it to eject, to pull The day to pieces and cry stanza my stone} Where was it one first heard of the truth? The the. Harold Bloom has surveyed earlier inadequate readings of this passage (146-47), and he argues that critics have underestimated its "peculiar dialec- tical complexities" (146). He calls attention to "the disjunctiveness of Stevens's rhetoric generally and particularly in the final stanza of The Man on the Dump" (147). Its disjunctiveness has, as in the passage from Notes, prompted suggestions of numerous texts against which it might be read. The most popular of these, proposed by Bloom (145) and others, is a pas- sage in a preface Stevens wrote for an edition of William Carlos Williams's poems in which he describes Williams as someone living in an ivory tower who has "an exceptional view of the public dump."16 Bloom also proposes as intertexts for the poem Stevens s "The Snow Man," Keats s "Ode to a Night- ingale," and Whitmans "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry" (145, 148). Daniel Schwarz offers John Deweys pragmatic aesthetics, "The Idea of Order at Key West," and contemporary painting, including the works of Thomas Hart Benton and Edward Hopper (88-89). Adalaide Morris suggests a</page><page sequence="7">Stevens and Flaubert 229 biblical passage (John 8.32) that Stevens cites in "The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet,"17 and Barbara Fisher offers as antecedent texts Pope s "The Art of Sinking in Poetry" and a passage from the philosophical writings of C. S. Peirce that discusses "the the?™ To these postulated intertexts for both the passage from "The Man on the Dump" and the passage from Notes (which do not aid our understand- ing so much as suggest the uneasiness readers have experienced with the incompleteness of the texts), I wish to add, most importantly, a passage from Madame Bovary and two supporting texts, passages from Flaubert s letters and from his second novel Salammbô, that together serve as intertext for both poems and reveal the degree to which they are variations on a common theme. The primary passage, from Madame Bovary, furnishes a way of reading both the ephebe s animal training in Notes - teaching bears to juggle - and the poet s beating on a tin can in "The Man on the Dump," which turn out to be components of the same metaphor. In Chapter XII of Part Two of Madame Bovary, Emma expresses her deep love for Rodolphe in a long speech that ends, "Je suis ta servante et ta concubine! tu es mon roi, mon idole! Tu es bon! Tu es beau! Tu es intelli- gent! Tu es fort!"19 ["I'm your slave and your concubine! You're my king, my idol! You're good! You're beautiful! You're wise! You're strong!"]20 The nar- rator reflects on Rodolphe's response to these words: II s'était tant de fois entendu dire ces choses, qu'elles n'avaient pour lui rien d'original. Emma ressemblait à toutes les maîtresses; et le charme de la nouveauté, peu à peu tombant comme un vêtement, laissait voir à nu l'éternelle monotonie de la passion, qui a toujours les même formes et le même langage. Il ne distinguait pas, cet homme si plein de pratique, la dissemblance des sentiments sous la parité des expressions. Parce que des lèvres libertines ou vénales lui avaient murmuré des phrases pareilles, il ne croyait que faiblement à la candeur de celles-là; on en devait rabattre, pensait-il, les discours exagérés cachant les affections médiocres: comme si la plénitude de l'âme ne débordait pas quelquefois par les métaphores les plus vides, puisque personne, jamais, ne peut donner l'exacte mesure de ses besoins, ni de ses conceptions, ni de ses douleurs, et que la parole humaine est comme un chaudron fêlé où nous battons des mélodies à faire danser les ours, quand on voudrait attendrir les étoiles. {Oeuvres complètes 639)</page><page sequence="8">230 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES [He had had such things said to him so many times that none of them had any freshness for him. Emma was like all his other mistresses; and as the charm of novelty gradually slipped from her like a piece of her clothing, he saw revealed in all its nakedness the eternal monotony of passion, which always assumes the same forms and always speaks the same language. He had no perception - this man of such vast experience - of the dissimilarity of feeling that might underlie similarities of expression. Since he had heard those same words uttered by loose women or prostitutes, he had little belief in their sincerity when he heard them now: the more flowery a person's speech, he thought, the more suspect the feelings, or lack of feelings, it concealed. Whereas the truth is that fullness of soul can some- times overflow in utter vapidity of language, for none of us can ever express the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sor- rows; and human speech is like a cracked kettle21 on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars. (215-16)] The passage, one of the most famous in the novel, represents a rare instance of its author's editorial intrusion into the narrative, and it has been fre- quently cited, particularly the concluding trope, as an account of Flaubert's own struggle in the composition of Madame Bovary. David Roe says of Flaubert's presence in the passage, "As a writer he shares, every day, [Emma's] communication problem, and by the end of the intervention the fictional pretext has given way to the novelist s own cry."22 William Berg and Laurey Martin similarly note that "the rare use of 'we' shows that Flaubert is talk- ing as much about the difficulties of writing as about Emma's failure to communicate her desires and dreams," and the passage justifies to some extent Flaubert's dictum "Madame Bovary, c'est moi," they argue, in grap- pling with "the desire to communicate and the inadequacies of language."23 Rosemary Lloyd, who maintains that the "whole question of how individu- als use language" is "central to the novel," concurs that "it is the inadequa- cies of language, or, at least, of our awareness of language, that are centrally at issue here."24 Eric Gans points out that the concluding statement on the deficiency of language was not present in earlier drafts of the scene; "it appears to constitute an irruption of the author's self-consciousness into the fictional world of his creation."25 Flaubert's lament is "as much a commentary on his own labors as on the limitations of Rodolphe's judgment," and his words</page><page sequence="9">Stevens and Flaubert 231 "constitute a complaint about the language not merely in, but of, his novel, about the impossibility of creating an original fictional universe when man is condemned to the endless repetition of clichés without definable origins" (105). As is true of "The Man on the Dump," however, Flaubert's trope manages to describe the staleness of language in a fresh manner. Gans writes, "If Emma cannot rise above clichés, neither can Flaubert himself, the dif- ference being that in his authorial role Flaubert need not live by them. The author alone is in a position to comment on the unoriginality of language without thereby demonstrating his own unoriginality" (106). The three texts are concerned with the difficulty of artistic realization, given the staleness of language, the artist's (always failed) attempt to cap- ture the unmediated experience, and the desire for the kind of radical origi- nality Stevens called the "first idea." Curiously, Flaubert also speaks of Vidée as the pure experience incapable of being articulated. In "Flaubert and the Status of the Subject," Victor Brombert says in reference to Flaubert's early writings, "The unsayable haunts the young writer, struck by the inadequacy of language," and he cites (and completes) a passage from Mémoires d'un fou that reminds us of the struggles of Stevens's young poet in Notes: "Titiful human weakness! With your words, your languages, your sounds, you speak and you stammer' - while the essence of the experience cannot be expressed." Brombert concludes, "This inexpressible experience, often defined as the Idea, is thus surprisingly perceived as beyond words, indeed, as indepen- dent from words."26 Not long after the publication of Notes, Stevens wrote to Henry Church that he would be pleased to have a copy of the poem sent to Andre Gide, "now that his Journal has taken the place of Flaubert s Letters" {Letters 461). Reading the correspondence, Stevens would have been struck, as have all readers, by the account of Flaubert's slow and torturous progress on Ma- dame Bovary, contained in a series of letters to his friend Louis Bouilhet and his mistress Louise Colet. The following report in a letter to Colet is typical, and it can stand for a much longer descriptive system on the diffi- culties of composition contained in Flaubert's correspondence. What is strik- ing is the portrait of Flaubert as Stevens's young ephebe, writhing on his bed in agonizing silence: Avant-hier, je me suis couché à 5 heures du matin et hier à 3 heures. Depuis lundi dernier j'ai laissé de côté toute autre chose, et j'ai exclusivement toute la semaine pioché ma Bovary, ennuyé de ne pas avancer. Je suis maintenant arrivé à mon bal que je commence lundi.</page><page sequence="10">232 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES J'espère que ça ira mieux. J'ai fait, depuis que tu ne m'as vu, 25 pages net (25 pages en six semaines). Elles ont été dures à rouler. Je les lirai demain à Bouilhet. Quant à moi, je les ai tellement travaillées, recopiées, changées, maniées, que pour le moment je n'y vois que du feu Quelquefois, quand je me trouve vide, quand l'expression se refuse, quand, après [avoir] griffonné de longues pages, je découvre n'avoir pas fait une phrase, je tombe sur mon divan et j'y reste hébété dans un marais intérieur d'ennui. Je me hais et je m'accuse de cette démence d'orgueil qui me fait haleter après la chimère.27 [The day before yesterday I went to bed at five in the morning and yesterday at three. Since last Monday I have put everything else aside, and have done nothing all week but sweat over my Bovary, disgruntled at making such slow progress. I have now reached my ball, which I will begin Monday. I hope that may go better. Since you last saw me I have written 25 pages in all (25 pages in six weeks). They were rough going. Tomorrow I shall read them to Bouilhet. I have gone over them so much myself, copied them, changed them, shuffled them, that for the time being I see them very confusedly. . . . Sometimes, when I am empty, when words don't come, when I find I haven't written a single sentence after scribbling whole pages, I collapse on my couch and lie there dazed, bogged in a swamp of despair, hating myself and blaming myself for this demented pride that makes me pant after a chimera.28 Flaubert was thirty years old and unpublished when he began Madame Bovary, and accounts of his dedication to his craft such as the one above, his association with the doctrine of art for art's sake, and his distain for the commercial side of writing and the mass audience have all combined to establish his reputation as a type of the pure artist, as he is depicted, for example, in Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. This image is also a part of the significance he bears in his appearance as intertext in the two Stevens pas- sages.29 The bulk of Madame Bovary was written at the family home in Croisset, near Rouen, but Flaubert lived for a short time in Paris during its compo- sition, and his presence in Canto V of aIt Must Be Abstract" also accounts for what has always seemed a discrepancy in the poem. Why should an account of an American poet lecturing his young apprentice have a French setting, as it appears to? I agree, that is, with Robert Rehder that the pas-</page><page sequence="11">Stevens and Flaubert 233 sage vaguely suggests a Parisian setting - perhaps that is chiefly due to Stevens's use of the word mansard, the kind of roof associated with French architecture and named after a French architect. It may well be that the description of the ephebe looking from his mansard across the roofs aas sigil and as ward" echoes Baudelaire's "Paysage" in Les Fleurs du mal, as Rehder also argues.30 The more significant intertext, however, comes from Flaubert - both the Flaubert of the letters, the young artist in the throes of creation, and the Flaubert who as narrator of Madame Bovary intrudes into the action to comment on the distance between the artist's ideal and his absurd and comic realization. The ideal, which in Madame Bovary is contained in the longing "to make music that will melt the stars," is suggested in Notes by the young poet looking out over the roofs "as sigil and as ward." This difficult passage is partially clarified once we recognize that the roofs of the city constitute the métonymie figure for the poet s urban world that corresponds to the lion's desert, the elephant's jungle and the bear's mountain cave. Ideally the poet is a "creature" of his world, in Stevens's explication of his poem, in a way that the animals are, and "a keeper of [its] secrets," an expositor of its depths. The terms sigil and ward suggest the poet's lofty status in his world; he is its custodian (ward), the keeper of its secrets, the interpreter of its stars (sigil as a device of occult power in astrology). At least that is what he longs to be. "You look / Across the roofs as sigil and as ward," the master poet says to the ephebe, "And in your centre mark them and are cowed." Cowed? What are we to make of this bovine pun? Does it point us to its Bovary intertext, or is it an uncanny coincidence? (Uncanny, that is, in Freud's sense of something that ought to have re- mained hidden that has suddenly come to light.) Leaving aside the ques- tion of intention, the reader who hears the Flaubert intertext can never read "cowed" again in quite the same way. Eleanor Cook catches "the latent bovine sense in 'cowed'" but, despite that, as I noted earlier, doubts that Stevens is being ironic in calling the ephebe heroic (225). She is right per- haps in recognizing that the young poet's intention is heroic; the irony lies in measuring what the poet produces against the intent. The ephebe is intimi- dated, cowed, by his heroic calling, his inability to measure up to it, and he is instructed by the master poet in the concluding stanza on the distance between intention and realization. He longs to represent his world authen- tically but he can only produce a caricature. Stevens's metaphor shifts Flau- bert's dancing bears to juggling bears, but the anti-climactic effect is the same. In Flaubert's figure, composing music that will melt the stars is re- duced to providing comic music for dancing bears. In Notes, the young poet -</page><page sequence="12">234 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES one of the "heroic children whom time breeds /Against the first idea" (my italics) - is reduced to anthropomorphism, an absurd parody of the first idea: "to lash the lion, / Caparison elephants, teach bears to juggle." The lion and elephants also lead us back to the Flaubertian intertext and to the significance of the anticlimactic structure of Stevens's canto. The animals are to be found in Flaubert's second novel, Salammbô. In a letter written three years after the publication of Notes Stevens said that Flaubert is "a point of reference for the artist" {Letters 505), and it is significant that Flaubert, as a type of the pure artist, exhibited the same pattern as Stevens's ephebe in Canto V. After the perceived realism of Madame Bovary, the work that was thought to rescue French literature from romanticism, to capture provincial life as it was, many of Flaubert's admir- ers were surprised by the extravagance of the operatic novel that followed, an epic narrative set in ancient Carthage. The negative response to Salammbô is typified by a long three-part review written by the most influential critic of the time, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve. Flaubert felt compelled to respond to Sainte-Bauve's charge, among others, that "everything in the book [has] a flavor of 'opera, pomp, and bombast/"31 Among the exotic elements in Salammbô to which Sainte-Beuve ob- jected were the lions and elephants that eventually turned up in Stevens's Notes.Tht wild desert lions of Salammbô are not merely domesticated, tamed, but at one point are further anthropomorphized by being crucified. In the desert between Carthage and Sicca, the Barbarians who will eventually battle the Carthaginians see a curious sight. "C'était un lion, attaché à une croix par les quatre membres comme un criminel" {Oeuvres complètes 702). ["It was a lion with his four limbs fastened to a cross like a criminal" (Chartres 22).] Further along the road they see a long row of crosses bearing lions. Ainsi se vengeaient les paysans carthaginois quand ils avaient pris quelque bête féroce; ils espéraient par cet exemple terrifier les autres. Les Barbares, cessant de rire, tombèrent dans un long étonnement. "Quel est ce peuple, pensaient-ils, qui s'amuse à crucifier des lions!" {Oeuvres complètes 702) [It was thus that the Carthaginian peasants avenged themselves when they captured a wild beast; they hoped to terrify the others by such an example. The Barbarians ceased their laughter and were long lost in amazement. "What people is this," they thought, "that amuses itself by crucifying lions!" (Chartres 22-23)]</page><page sequence="13">Stevens and Flaubert 235 Attacked by a reviewer for his treatment of his lions,32 Flaubert referred the reviewer to a passage in Pliny that reported such an incident {Letters of Flaubert 1857-1880 56). Salammbô is heavy with elephants, many of them caparisoned. Capari- sons {caparaçons) appear several times in the novel, and it is Flaubert's ex- travagant descriptions of his caparisoned elephants that underline the absurdity only hinted at in the passage in Notes: [Hannon] perdit encore trois lunes à équiper les cent douze éléphants qui logeaient dans les remparts; c'étaient les vainqueurs de Régulus; le peuple les chérissait; on ne pouvait trop bien agir envers ces vieux amis. Hannon fit refondre les plaques d'airain dont on garnissait leur poitrail, dorer leurs défenses, élargir leurs tours, et tailler dans la pourpre la plus belle des caparaçons bordés de franges très lourdes. Enfin, comme on appelait leurs conducteurs des Indiens (d'après les premiers, sans doute, venus des Indes), il ordonna que tous fussent costumés à la mode indienne, c'est-à-dire avec un bourrelet blanc autour des tempes et un petit caleçon de byssus qui formait, par ses plis transversaux, comme les deux valves d'une coquille appliquée sur les hanches. {Oeuvres complètes 723) [He lost three moons more in equipping the one hundred and twelve elephants that were lodged in the ramparts. They were the conquer- ors of Regulus; the people loved them; it was impossible to treat such old friends too well. Hanno had the brass plates which adorned their breasts recast, their tusks gilt, their towers enlarged, and ca- parisons, edged with very heavy fringes, cut out of the handsomest purple. Finally, as their drivers were called Indians (after the first ones, no doubt, who came from the Indies) he ordered them all to be costumed after the Indian fashion; that is to say, with white pads round their temples, and small drawers of byssus which with their transverse folds looked like two valves of a shell applied to the hips. (Chartres 79-80)] Flaubert also defended the adornment of his elephants by referring a re- viewer to a work called Histoire militaire des éléphants {Letters of Flaubert 1857-1880 56, 60).33 Stevens owned a copy of Salammbô (along with Flaubert's letters and Madame Bovary).34 Did he note, like other readers, the difference between the naturalistic Flaubert of Madame Bovary and the exotic Flaubert of the</page><page sequence="14">236 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES novel that followed it? As a type of the young artist, the ephebe, Flaubert began his career by attempting to capture the reality of his time in his por- trait of Emma Bovary and provincial France, but by his second novel found himself accused of a caricature of reality35 in his failed exotic project ato lash the lion, caparison elephants." In Madame Bovary, as we have seen, Flaubert places the blame for the artist's failure on the nature of language, which in his trope is the faulty instrument, the "cracked kettle" which can produce only the music for danc- ing bears. Eric Gans points out that chaudron is "a familiar metaphor for an inferior musical instrument" (105). Flaubert's musical figure is also a ver- sion of one of the responses to a failed pre-Madame Bovary manuscript titled La Tentation de Saint Antoine. He read the manuscript aloud (for thirty-two hours) to his friends Maxime DuCamp and Louis Bouilhet, and when he had finished, Bouilhet advised him to burn it and never speak of it again. "There are excellent passages, some exquisite evocations of an- tiquity," Bouilhet told him, "but it is all lost in the bombast of the language. You wanted to make music and you have made only noise"36 {Letters of Flaubert 1830-1857 100). The metaphor in Notes moves away from Flau- bert's musical trope, transforming his dancing bears to juggling bears, but the earlier "Man on the Dump" preserves the musical analogy and, as well, the sense of beating on a chaudron as attempting to produce music on an inferior instrument. To return, finally, to "The Man on the Dump," we now see more clearly that beating on an old tin can on the dump is attempting to produce the music of poetry on the faulty instrument of language.37 Stevens's narrator recognizes, like Flaubert's, that no one can ever express "l'exacte mesure de ses besoins, ni de ses conceptions, ni de ses douleurs." The poet's words carry as little resemblance to his reality as the caparisoned elephants and juggling bears to their natural counterparts in the later poem. He can pro- duce only inflated and absurd poeticisms - "aptest eve, a invisible priest? u stanza my stone." Yet Stevens here goes a step further than Flaubert. His poet recognizes the impossibility of realizing his subject in language, of capturing his reality, but he also recognizes that there is no truth for lan- guage to "give the exact measure of."38 "One beats," he says, "for that which one believes," substituting belief for truth. "That's what one wants to get near." Language, as an inferior instrument, can only approximate, get near, that which one believes. But is it possible, the poem asks tentatively, that what one believes and puts into poems and novels, never "true," is in fact superior to that which one is seeking to realize, to express? Did Keats's poem, even in its failure to capture the essence of the experience, transform the</page><page sequence="15">Stevens and Flaubert 237 nightingale s mundane song into something superior? "Did the nightingale torture the ear, / Pack the heart and scratch the mind?" Is it the case that the artist's perspective, unable to realize in words the natural world, is aas superior as the ear / To a crow's voice?" "Where was it," the poem concludes, "one first heard of the truth? The the." This line, which has given readers so much trouble, is only another way of saying that there is no such thing as the truth, and this recognition is in some ways an answer to Flaubert's trope for the necessary failure of the artist, beating on un chaudron fêlé, making music for dancing bears. When Notes toward a Supreme Fiction returned to this figure three years later, Flaubert himself was incorporated as "a point of reference for the artist and perhaps for the immature" {Letters 505). That is, in the more com- plex intertextual relation of Notes, Flaubert appears not simply as a figure of the artist, but of the artist whose appeal is perhaps for the immature, the ephebe, who, like his poet-hero, writhes on his bed in the agony of compo- sition. When Stevens writes, "Flaubert takes possession of the immature and almost develops a sense of maturity and of competence and strength" (505), the statement appears oddly impersonal and incomplete. As in the case of Riffaterre s ungrammaticalities, one feels in reading it that its full significance lies elsewhere, perhaps in a young poet's personal experience, now irretrievable, or retrievable only in the poetry as the absent intertext in Stevens's portraits of the artist.

The concept, much debated by Stevens scholars, suggests at the very least a view of the world purged of customary or habitual seeing, a radically fresh sense of reality, a seeing, as Stevens says in the first canto of Notes, "with an ignorant eye." 14.

A comic version of Flaubert's iconic status as the scrupulous artist may be seen in Dorothy Parker's statement on the ease with which the popular writer Edna Ferber com- posed: "I understand Ferber whistles at her typewriter. And there was that poor sucker Flaubert rolling around on his floor for three days looking for the right word" ("Dorothy Parker," Writers at Work' The Paris Review Interviews, ed. Malcolm Cowley [New York: Viking, 1958] 77). 30. Baudelaire and Flaubert were closely associated for a short time. Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal appeared in 1857, the same year as Madame Bovary. A few months after Flaubert had been acquitted of the charge of offending public morality, Baudelaire was convicted of the same charge. He was fined and ordered to remove six poems from Les Fleurs du mal, judged to be obscene. Baudelaire wrote a favorable review of Madame Bovary, and the two men exchanged numerous letters between 1857 and 1860.</page><page sequence="17">Stevens and Flaubert 239 31. Quoted in SteegmuUer, Francis, ed. and trans., The Letters of Gustave Flaubert 1857- 1880 (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1982) 43. 32. David Danaher sees the description of the crucified lions as a part of a larger motif of sadism that constitutes a technique for "generating description and text, maintaining struc- tural cohesion, and advancing the plot." His argument is that the effacement of the author in Salammbô necessitates the use of other literary devices such as one he terms "focalization" (focusing of the point of view without the intrusion of an omniscient narrator). Sadism, he argues, is frequently used for such an effect. "The sadistic description of the crucified lions, transmitted through the Barbarians' eyes, follows only logically in the context of the mo- notonous journey from Carthage to Sicca across the desert." If the scene depicts sadism, "it is so because the focalization requires it" ("Effacement of the Author and the Function of Sadism in Flaubert's Salammbô, Symposium 46 [1992]: 3-4. Lisa Lowe finds that the novel's fascination with sadism represents "a description of the means by which Others are regarded and objectified in the constitution of the national class and cultural identity." It is an ele- ment of "the process by which the oriental world of Salammbô is produced, and enjoyed as a spectacle of displaced violence" ("Nationalism and Exoticism: Nineteenth-Century Others in Flaubert's Solammbô and L'Education sentimentale, Macro-politics of Nineteenth-Century Literature, ed. Jonathan Arac and Harriet Ritvo [Philadelphia: U of Pennsylvania P, 1991] 227-28). 33. Bears do not appear directly in Salammbô, but, like the bear in Notes, they are referred to as dwelling in the mountains {Oeuvres complètes 759) and sleeping through winter snow: "il rapplelait à ses compagnons un ours qui sort de sa caverne au printemps, pur voir si les neiges sont fondues" (784). The bear was also the animal with which Flaubert identified himself. See Julian Barnes' Flaubert's Parrot (New York: Knopf, 1985) 49-54 for a discussion of Gustave as "Flau-bear." 34. Stevens owned volumes 1-21 of Flaubert's Oeuvres completes (Paris: Conrad, 1910- 1930), now in the Wallace Stevens Archive of the Huntington Library. See Milton Bates, "Stevens's Books at the Huntington: An Annotated Checklist," Wallace Stevens Journal 2 (1978): 57. 35. Mary Rice has argued, however, that what appears escapist or dreamlike in the novel may itself represent a response to the inadequacies of language. She speculates that in places uSalammbos imagery may indicate an attempt to circumvent the nefarious effects of lan- guage, seen in particular in the ex-slave Spendius; the metaphoric images instead substitute a pre-linguistic register of silent, visual signs" ("The Failure of Metaphor as an Historical Paradigm: Flaubert's Salammbô, Modern Language Studies 20 [1990]: 97). 36. Brian Nicholas has recently noted Flaubert's constant fascination with unpleasant noises in his novels, and he relates this feature of his style to his temperament: "He seems to have been extremely sensitive to sounds, possibly as a result of the still mysterious nervous illness which put an end to his law studies" ("Flaubert's Floorboards," French Studies Bulletin 70 [1999]: 5). 37. There may be another association in the passage. Dennis Taylor points out that this final stanza is fourteen lines in length, thus, he argues, approximating a sonnet: "The dump produces its hidden sonnets . . . and the man on the dump discusses them as he unearths them. It may seem odd to associate beating an old tin can with writing a sonnet, but it is by means of the old metrical trash that Stevens hopes to get near to a more real voice" ("The Apparitional Meters of Wallace Stevens," Wallace Stevens Journal 15 [1991]: 213). The Flaubert intertext of course suggest why one might associate beating an old tin can with writing a sonnet, and its implication is the opposite of Taylor's conclusion. It is not that one might find "a more real voice," but that the sonnet form, like language, is inadequate to express the real. 38.This is made clear in the poem that follows, "On the Road Home" (Collected Poems 203), which proclaims, "'There is no such thing as the truth.'"</page></plain_text>
