<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rethinking animism Stringer concludes his article on animism (1999) by discussing, at some length, another study and my Faces in the clouds (1993). Unfor- tunately, he misrepresents what I say. Guthrie, he writes, thinks that animism is giving 'human personality to non-human objects' and that animism can be 'reduced only to those non-empirical entities that appear to have personality or other "human" attributes' (Stringer 1999: 551).That is, I equate animism with anthropomorphism. Actually, I recommend clearly and repeat- edly that these two terms not be equated. 156</page><page sequence="2">COMMENT 157 Animism, I argue, is best defined as attribut- ing characteristics of living things (e.g. sen- tience and spontaneous motion) to inanimate things and events, whereas anthropomorphism is best defined as attributing characteristics of humanity (e.g. language and symbolism) to non-human things and events, including other animals. Among many instances, I write (1993: 39-40),'we animate but do not anthro- pomorphize, for example, if we say that an automobile purrs like a kitten, and anthropo- morphize but do not animate if we speak to our pet turde'. Moreover, the 'non-empirical entities' with which Stringer credits me have no place in my account, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, animism in my book comprises inter- pretations of things and events that are quite empirical, as when we mistake a boulder for a bear. Evidently Stringer has not yet had a chance to read the book carefully. However, because Faces constitutes a comprehensive discussion of anthropomorphism, devotes a separate chapter to a definition and an explanation of animism, and indexes numerous passages care- fully distinguishing these terms, it does bear on his interests. It would repay his closer attention. STEWART GUTHRIE Fordham University Guthrie, S.E. 1993. Faces in the clouds: a new theory of religion. Oxford: University Press. Stringer, M.D. 1999.
