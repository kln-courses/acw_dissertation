A format ordinarily filled with words to be read is now filled with images to be looked at. Richard Misrach has tried to relieve that tension in his second book by ban- ishing all reading matter, including copyright data, to the narrow strip of the spine. Inside, there are only photographic images of the desert, 53 in all - count them - which is what one has to do, for there is no pagination. This tactic gives the book an unfettered feel, as if it had escaped the orbit of those conventions that force photography into an awkward truce with a literary format every time a photogra- pher wants to exhibit his work outside the walls of galleries. Misrach' s freedom is il- lusory, however, for the absence of a familiar tension creates a new one. It's weird to look inside a book and see no words at all, and just as few numerals. But this weirdness seems in- tentional. It certainly is not a fault. It can be read, first of all, as the symbol of Misrach 's sense of his medium, which is quite familiar. He takes photograhy to be utterly and solely visual, not part of a continuity stretching from music and literature at one end to the visual arts at the other. Photogra- phy, in Misrach' s eyes, stands alone, as do the cacti that appear in so many of his photo- graphs. There is a second way to read Mis- rach's weird banishment of language from his book: as an echo of his subject matter, for those cacti are weird all on their own. Prior to any photograph, they are both alien and fa- miliar, and the strangest thing about them is the way they mix the two qualities. Cacti might not seem so odd if the desert didn't feature plants with ordinary leaves, branches, and bark for comparison. In the on- ly environment that permits them to flourish, they are exceptional, outside our sense of what a plant is. Familiarity can submerge their strangeness, but cannot make it go away. A cactus, especially a large saguaro of the kind Misrach photographs most often, always stands apart. At the same time, saguaros are easily anthropomorphized. Viewed as "crea- tions, ' ' artifices of nature, they are clearly fig- urative. Armless ones are phallic or make rigid suggestions of the full human form. Pos- sessed of arms, they gesture. They take on personalities, as do other large varieties. The ones covered with shaggy, spiky fronds seem agitated, as do, more diffidently, the writhing kind that crawls with bristly tendrils. Just as familiarity subdues the oddness of cacti, so a close look at their highly particularized details undermines their "humanness." But that, too, is a quality that refuses to go away. Per- sisting, subliminally, it combines with the plants' biological weirdness and doubles it. In July of this past year, Misrach was inter- viewed for the Photo Bulletin of the G. Ray Hawkins Gallery in Los Angeles. What I gather from the artist's remarks suggests that many in his audience haven't noted the com- plexity of their responses to his work. Looking at his strobe-lit cacti against the dark desert sky - these images of things both strange and familiar - they have judged them "mysti- cal." This word may have attached itself to Misrach 's recent work because, for the most part, it has been seen in California. At any rate, he is at some pains, in the Photo Bulletin interview, to disclaim any mystical intentions. Mysticizing reactions are all right, he suggests with West Coast tolerance, but he keeps try- ing to push the interview in the direction of more down-to-earth matters - including his recent studies of the desert floor, which he says are his current favorites. Misrach stresses two points so obvious one has to be in a particularly clear state of mind to keep them from slipping away. First, photo- graphs don't show what things of the world look like, either to a mystical or an empirical eye. They show what things look like in photo- graphs. Misrach 's interviewer, David Fahey (an earnest Californian, for sure), doesn't let him follow up an implication of this point, which is that the meaning of a photograph has much to do with the way the photographer's intention meshes - or doesn't - with his sub- ject, his target. Thus meaning must be drawn from the print considered as an inherently limited artifice, not from the belief that some- one's really creative lens might reveal the un- adorned truth about something out there in the world. Speaking of the desert "out there," Mis- rach shows his interview style at its best. The interviewer asks him if he has ever had "any psychic experiences during [his] stays in the desert." The answer is yes, but it has to be qualified at lengths that bring Misrach to his second very obvious, very important point, which is that, thanks to the nature of the pho- tographic medium, much of what appears in the image is not intended by the photographer to be there. By accepting this smuggled-in content, the artist grants it an oblique, retrospective sort of intention. But, Misrach implies, we don't really see photographs until we see that the lens, no matter how carefully pointed, maintains its lack of discrimina- tion - its promiscuous acceptance of detail. There is a corollary, which is that the photographer must accept mystical readings of his work when they occur. "I think it's a very interesting response, but it has very little to do with my intentions," Misrach says. It turns out that his psychic experiences in the desert had to do with the place, not the process of photographing it. Misrach works at night, with the lens open and aimed at his subject. He shows receptive- ness at this stage, the passivity of a sheer, un- tested intention to be passive - untested be- cause there is almost nothing to receive, be- yond a glow at the far-off horizon or stars and the moon, which sometimes appear in prints as arcing streaks across the sky. The major presence - whether cactus, palm tree, or rock - is centered and absolutely still, a reve- lation of the 15 or 20 strobe flashes Misrach directs at it in the course of an exposure that can take up to four hours. "Accidents," he says, "are real important. A lot of time it's ex- perimentation. Usually it's at times when I would strobe too many times and get too much light for the effect I had perceived before, and then later go on and utilize it again . . ." - "it" being an unintended result, I think. As the exposure continues, a passive proce- dure is transformed into a generously aggres- sive one, an appropriation of brute appear- ances to the realm of what is meant, intended, willed/ This is generous because it leaves the world untouched and yet renewed by the pressures of Misrach 's interest. Advanced by means of an elaborately original photographic procedure, his interest touches on the medium, the world, and the relation between the two. At each touch point, conventions ad- vance into something like visibility - that is, we are made aware of the ways we use them. This intensifies meaning and transforms it, for the quickest way to change meaning is to become aware of the convention that serves as its vehicle. Misrach 's work is full of transfor- mations along those lines, hence his photo- graphs are in a constant state of flux as looking turns into a profound kind of seeing. This may be what his fans mean when they say his work is "mystical." Or it may not. Anyway, Misrach's cactus pictures over- come a problem so subtle its solution is easy to miss - the danger that picking these objects out of the night with strobe flashes will make them look collaged onto their natural environ- ment. They never do, in part because Misrach always lets some of the light hit the cactus's immediately surrounding terrain. These plants clearly belong where they are. They are natural presences, yet Misrach tinges botanical fact with fictive qualities. An object immersed in darkness is granted the strange power to announce that immersion, to present itself as plain as day in the middle of the night. The plant seems to control its set- ting, to inhabit it on terms that let it stand apart, at least for vision. This fits with Misrach's statement that his photos give one the feeling that he ' 'has control over this envi- ronment [the desert]." Yet this fit can be made only if the viewer deanthropomorphizes the cactus for a moment, shifting control from the artist's subject back to him. This is not a hard thing to do, but its implications raise dif- ficulties. The notion of Misrach in control of the desert goes well enough with the subtlety one sees in his use of the strobe light. On the other hand, it seems to contradict his state- ment that much of an image is accidentad and can only be intended in retrospect, once it has been noticed and accepted. Further, Misrach 182</page><page sequence="3">Richard Misrach, Desert Series, plate §53, toned gelatin silver print, 1976.

So how do his pictures of cacti in the desert "control this environment"? One could say that he controls the environ- ment of the image, its internal premises and their elaboration, but that would run counter to Misrach's repeated rejection of "the modernist ethic, ' ' which he sees as the ' 'work- ing out of formal limits and properties of the medium." It would also fit badly with tex- tures and forms so fascinatingly intricate they'd make Misrach a hyper-realist if his lighting schemes were not also so weird. The eye spends a long time drifting over the sur- faces of his prints. Their tonal modulations are delicate, harsh, and conveyors of inex- haustible information about cacti, palm trees, boulders, and the floor of the desert. But the plants, especially, continue to gesture. (The rocks only pose.) Anthropomorphism cannot be denied forever, and soon even the clearest detail slips out of rational control in this light. But the light never does, so that is where one must look for Misrach's "control," which means the cacti-as-human-presences must be suppressed once again. His power over the desert and its inhabi- tants leaves them untouched and in a way unexamined - no botanist would employ Misrach's findings. So his is not the power to alter the desert or to bring it under the aegis of a conceptual or a "mystical" scheme. He brings it, instead, under the control of his will. Thus he works at night, when his subject is in- visible. The desert that appears in his photographs is the one he finds in the dark- ness, hence it is a visible symbol of his inten- tion, and more: a field where intention can play (or go to work), doing what artists always have it do, which is to find meanings (or devise them). Misrach's desert is less a place than a range of possibility. Given the aggressive style with which he constructs this range, it's not surprising that many of the early images in this book are centered on a single form - one of the cacti, say, that gestures at the artist's surrogate, the camera, and becomes a sur- rogate itself in the process. The solitary cactus wins out. The finished print makes it the stronger symbol of the artist's will. Yet these plants (and the palm trees even more so) look grotesque, even goofy, when seen as stand-ins for the artist. One cannot accept them as en- tirely adequate symbols of Misrach's willing, intending self. So the viewer posits a distance between him and his images. This, ultimate- ly, is what subdues their anthropomorphism. When asked what he does during the long exposures, Misrach says, "that ranges from going to my van and reading, or just kind of sitting out there and meditating, take a walk. . . ." In detaching himself from his subject and his process, he ends up at a remove from his own intention. This does not weaken it - just the opposite, as far as the audience is con- cerned (though the artist is often bored or dis- tressed by finished work, and so feels nagged into engaging his medium once again). For the viewer, the image feels saturated by the artist's intention, to which, after all, it owes its existence. Moreover, the fundamental pur- pose of the image is to make that debt clear and, in so doing, insist on the primacy of in- tention. This is another way of getting at the nature of Misrach's "control" over the des- ert: he appropriates and alters it in a way that draws the eye to the very process, the aggres- sive imposition of his will. Seeing that brings a basic convention into view: in our culture, works of art are those that effect just such a symbolic assertion of the self. But every arti- fact is, to some degree, a vehicle of an individ- ual will. How are we to know when a work is an artwork? That is, how are we to be sure that the primary "art convention" is in force? This question usually isn't asked. A paint- ing appears in a gallery or a collection of pho- tographs is published in a "serious" format, and the audience takes it for granted that it has been exposed to art. The assumption is cor- rect, but unexamined. The fundamental "art status" of the work goes unchallenged. Atten- tion focuses on quickly grasped matters of sty- listic variation, and basic meanings slip by. What I'm talking about is a tendency, which all of us show on occasion, to be satisfied with a quick categorization of the images the art world presents in such steady profusion. Deeper considerations are left to be taken up in some hoped-for future lull. But Misrach's photos resist this treatment. They are so will- fully what the book format claims them to be - works of art - that the most immediately perceived aspects of their style - weirdness, theatricality - are connected with great force to their primary way of being, their "art status. ' ' This is because Misrach does aggres- sively what all artists must do in some fashion or another, which is to activate some specific set of conventions while bringing the general "art convention" to bear. This doubled-up maneuver is necessary because nothing is simply a work of art. It is a photograph, a painting, a poem - the result of an effort made in some particular medium defined by con- ventions of its own. In Misrach's case, these are obvious enough: photographic and documentarian. He invites the exercise of our ability to draw information from flat patterns of gray tone. The difficulty here is that the conventions that make documentary photographs legible need not be accompanied by the basic ' 'art conven- tion," and indeed are often hostile to it. Pho- tojournalists, naturalists, and so on intend to convey some truth about the visible world. The fact that their images assert their individ- ual wills, their intentions, may not be negligi- ble, but it is secondary.

To put it another way: his images present their photographic, docu- mentarían style unencumbered by reportorial trustworthiness or any other dutiful attribute. Thus their references to the world are com- patible with the "art status" they begin to take on when the willfulness of Misrach' s "control" over his desert environment is felt. But there is more than compatibility here. As Misrach uses the conventions native to his medium, he seems to elaborate, directly, the basic convention by which his works become artworks. His documentarían approach is not only accurate but obsessively, ironically, so. Detail doesn't just accumulate in his images. It asserts itself and glows. The weirdness of his light, his anthropomorphism, his ultra-realist textures - all these activate the conventions of photographic legibility with such force that the viewer turns conscious of their workings. And he becomes self-conscious to this degree: he sees himself seeing, or at least he gains an intuition of the great difference between meaning on the photographic surface and meaning in the world it depicts. This is a com- monplace, of course, but one relearns it while learning how Misrach makes use of his medi- um. This provides a view into the nature of consciousness itself; or, rather, a view into the way the culture's conventions open the world to individual consciousness and vice versa. Powerful art has always done this. It is something that must, by the nature of the project, always be done anew. Individuality can only be sustained in the present, and that requires new art. Misrach's recent images of the desert floor show patches of lit ground. Earlier, when he centered his cacti within squared-away prints, symmetries of arrange- ment were induced to comment on the format itself. In the desert-floor photos, such com- ment is even more direct - more self-evident. Symmetry is not only imposed by the format, it belongs to the subject itself, insofar as the format permits it to be visible. As the will con- structs one symmetrical field, the world re- sponds with its own. These photos are among the most extraordinary conjunctions of will and world I've seen in contemporary American art.
