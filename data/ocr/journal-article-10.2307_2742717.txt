<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Paleolithic Ochre and the Early Uses of Color and Symbol by ALEXANDER MARSHACK 4 Washington Square Village, New York, N.Y. 10012, U.S.A. 31 X 80 One of the important, even crucial Acheulian evidences for the early use of red ochre, relevant to the thesis presented by Wreschner (CA 21:631-44) and the discussion that accom- panied it, comes from Becov, Czechoslovakia, ca. 250,000 B.C. The excavation, by Fridrich (1976) and its artifacts are apparently unknown to Wreschner and the discussants. I quote from an earlier note on the origins of language (Marshack 1979a) and add to it some previously unpublished photographs and analytic commentary: At the Homo erectus shelter of Becov in Czechoslovakia ... J. Fridrich excavated a piece of red ochre that was striated on two faces with the marks of abrasion [fig. 1 here] and one flat rubbing stone with a granular crystalline surface that had been abraded in the center [figs. 2, 3], clearly in the preparation of ochre powder. On the floor of the shelter, at the side where the piece of ochre was found, there was a wide area of ochre powder. Seating himself on a rock against the wall of the shelter to study the ochre, Fridrich found that his feet accidentally fitted the only two areas without ochre powder. Homo erectus had sat on this stone, away from other activities in the site, while he made his red powder. 1 ~ 1981 by Alexander Marshack. FIG. 1.

Quartzite stone (15.3 cm) from the Acheulian level at Becov, indicating plane at right used as the surface for abrasion. The manipulative, "extractive" skill involved was perhaps not much different from that of New World cebus monkeys who take pods or beans with an uncomfortable fuzz to another location to rub them against a hard surface before beginning extraction (Chevalier- Skolnikoff 1978), nor was it much different from the skills used by chimpanzees in idiosyncratic acts of curiosity and experimentation on the nature of materials. The difference lies in the adult human use and context of these skills. Pieces of red, brown, and yellow ochre have been found in the Homo erectus site of Terra Amata, France, ca. 300,000 B.P., by H. de Lumley, indicating that what we have here is an early and widespread cultural tradition. The ochre powders would also have had to be contained in a holder of sorts. Leaving out any discussion of possible meaning or usage, it is clear that what we have at the simplest level of discussion are cognitive skills not much beyond Piaget stages four, five, and six of the human child, but which were here used in an adult, nonsubsistence context, one that involved an adult semantic. One part of the meaning and viability of this symbolic activity, one part of its deep structure, would have in- volved an affective, limbic component. In sum, the generalized cross-modal capacities evolving in the hominid line, including the cross-modal cognitive and communi- cative capacities, were potentially effective and adaptive in areas that went significantly beyond subsistence activity, extraction, and food sharing. Symbolically structured relations were perhaps as significant as cutting edges, extractive strategies, or carrying vessels, certainly in the evolution of language .... The quartzite rubbing stone has a somewhat circular plane of abrasion within which the protruding crystals have been worn down to (microscopically) flattened, scratched tops. These reflect light as white spots in the photograph. Microscopic 188 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">4 Q FIG. 3. Detail of the circular plane of abrasion on the Be&amp;ov stone, showing the polished crystals as white spots. examination also indicates extremely faint striations on this plane of abrasion-horizontal as the photograph is published indicating the direction of a back-and-forth rubbing. The piece of ochre has acquired through time a thin cortex of calcite, with evidence of manganese beneath. Portions of this cortex have broken off to reveal a bright-red, soft, powdery ochre. This evidential combination of rubbed ochre, a used rubbing stone, and ochre powder is the only complex of evidence offering proof of an ochre technology in the Acheulian. (The artifacts are being prepared for publication in color.) There is a broader theoretical problem involved here. I had gone to Prague to study the Becov materials because Fridrich had indicated that some of the excavated stone material seemed to have been carved or lightly worked to make crude anthropomorphic images. Microscopic examination of the sand- stone and tuff stones revealed no certainty of intentional carving, but aspects of Acheulian symbol were identified at a nearby site. Mania and Ulcek (1972) had recently excavated a large engraved rib from the Acheulian site of Bilzingsleben, German Democratic Republic, ca. 300,000 B.C. Valoch (1976) has termed the site one of the most important in Europe from this period (and see Valoch 1980). The large bone, in relatively good condition, indicated a long series of clearly intentional engraved "decorative" or symbolic marks. Microscopic exami- nation showed that these were not accidental, random marks or cutting or work marks. (An analysis and description is being prepared for first publication by Mania.) This rare piece of intentional Acheulian engraving is totally different in mode and style from the engraved serpentine image from this period excavated at Pech de l'Aze by Bordes and described by me in an earlier paper (Marshack 1976a:278 and fig. 12). Concep- tually it is closer to the incised linear marking from the Mous- terian site of La Ferrassie (1976a: fig. 6). These Acheulian examples once again caution us that early symbolic modes, whether they involve the use of color or engraving and carving, cannot be subsumed under any prior theoretical concept as to their meaning. Our concern should rather be for the range of such usage. Analogically I need only point to the chimpanzee capacity for "marking" with colors and for engraving and drawing single lines. The genetic capacities are present quite early, but they are not used culturally in anything that might Vol. 22 *No. 2 *A pril 1981 be called a hominoid manner. I have published color photo- graphs (1976b) of the carved mammoth-tooth plaque from the Mousterian site of Tata, Hungary (see also Marshack 1976a: figs. 9, 11), which has evidence of having been covered with red ochre. The intentional carving of a symbolic artifact and its intentional coloring represent different modes of symbolic usage, here closely related. It would be hazardous to state that the ochre represented blood, life, or status. The use of color in the Upper Paleolithic has traditionally been discussed in terms of its use in burials, the coloring of artifacts and figurines, and cave painting. A consideration of the problem of the range of color use has shown that it was also used on the habitation site, for instance, as a notational medium for the accumulation of those sets of marks which had till now been primarily evidenced on engraved stone and bone (Mar- shack 1972). The fortuitous retention of faint rows or sets of painted "notational" marks on a piece of fragmented scapula from a proto-Magdalenian level at the Abri Pataud, the Dordogne, France (fig. 4), indicates that liquid ochre paint had been applied by finger (Movius 1977: 10). This mode of marking in paint is comparable to the rows of engraved dots on the Aurignacian plaque from the Abri Lartet in the Gorge d'Enfer (Marshack 1972:448-49 and figs. 6, 7), no more than a ten- minute walk from the Abri Pataud. This first published photo- graph of the Pataud fragment shows the nature of the painting. Such finger marking is common in the painted caves. The scapula provides evidence that liquid ochre paint was made on the habitation site, contained in a vessel, and used in marking on classes of artifacts that have since disappeared or on bone artifacts from which the surface paint has eroded away. I have often found the microscopic evidence of ochre on Upper Paleolithic bone and stone artifacts that today look clean to the eye. In contrast, I have found that the engraving on mammoth ivory from the Russian plain (Marshack 1979b) was often highlighted by a thick black paste filling which made the images appear black against white. In the Franco-Cantabri- an area this highlighting was always done with red ochre. The Lartet plaque's engraving was filled with red ochre. In these uses one cannot say that the ochre represented blood, life, or status any more than that the black represented death. The search for the range of uses of image and color in the Paleolithic has begun to open up new theoretical perspectives for the study of early symbol. The evidence for painting on perishable and therefore no longer existing materials was, for instance, presented by me in a profusely documented early paper (1969). The data have almost never been referred to in the professional literature, perhaps because of greater general interest in the later research. An exhaustive microscopic study of the engraved artifacts from the late Paleolithic (Romanellian) Italian site of Polesini, ca. 8500 B.C., documented the fact that a number of the engraved darts, many in animals, had their A~~~~~~~ FIG. 4.

An increasing body of such direct and indirect evidence has begun to show that the uses of paint and color in the Paleolithic go far beyond the traditional categories. I am sure that the increasing sophistica- tion of archaeological research will further elaborate the Paleo- FIG. 5.

The "painted" serpentine motifs on the feathered darts from Polesini raise other questions. The engraving of serpentine and zigzag motifs on bone and antler tools in the Upper Paleolithic is well known. The evidence that similar motifs could be painted on the perishable portions of the material technology or the symbolic artifacts is a reminder that the carved and engraved stone and bone artifacts, like the images in the caves, are a skewed, fortuitously retained sample of the total symbolic complexity. Apparently, then, the symbolic uses of ochre and color were early, widespread, and probably variable, occurring in a range of symbolic contexts. The discovery by Wendt (1974, 1976) at the Apollo II cave in South Africa of painted animal images dated to ca. 27,000 B.c.-the period of the early European Upper Paleolithic-with evidence of use of red, black, and white paint indicates that the use of different colors was not confined to Europe or dispersed from there. The use of color was an old tradition by the time it appeared on images at the Apollo cave or on the walls of the European Upper Paleolithic caves. Color could, as Wreschner argues, have been used in contexts relating the color red to life, death, and blood, but there are other possibilities. It could have been used in ritual body decoration, in body decoration to mark rank, status, age, or sex, to decorate tools or symbolic artifacts, to color habita- tion floors or walls, to delimit symbolic spaces (ritual areas, healing grounds, graves, or altars), or simply as a marking material, as on the Pataud fragment. In each case the particular semantics or strategy involved would depend on the cultural context. These uses may or may not have involved color categorization or color symbolism. It may have been color differentiation and contrast that was the operational concept, as in the use of color in drawing images or highlighting engrav- ing.
