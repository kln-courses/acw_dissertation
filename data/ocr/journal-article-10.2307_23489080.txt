The convention enables members of the profession to share their ideas and research with colleagues from other universities and colleges. The many sessions present a range of approaches and examine a variety of languages and literary and critical traditions. Sessions will be held in the Hynes Convention Center (foreign language sessions, comparative litera ture sessions, and exhibits), the Sheraton Boston (English sessions), and the Westin Copley Square (the Job Information Center). Ses sions begin at 12:00 noon on 3 January, with workshops at 8:30 and 11:45 a.m. The last sessions will end at 3:00 p.m. on 6 January. Convention sessions are organized by MLA members, but non members are welcome to attend. All participants—members and nonmembers alike—must pay registration fees. Registrants receive badges, which entitle convention attendees to gain admittance to sessions, the Job Information Center, and the exhibit hall. Regis trants who lose their badges may purchase replacements at the reg istration area. The Program begins with an Individual Convention Program for recording personal schedules. A list of Exhibitors displaying books and other materials during the convention and a Floor Plan of the Exhibit Area allow attendees to locate exhibits quickly. Indexes of sessions open to the public, division sessions, discussion group ses sions, sessions sponsored by MLA committees and MLA programs and offices, and allied organization sessions refer the reader to the number assigned to each event listed in the Program proper.
