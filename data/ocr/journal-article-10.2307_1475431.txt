<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward a Theory of Moral Instruction Gregory A. Daneke Department of Political Science Oklahoma State University Stillwater, Oklahoma In the wake of the current crisis in Amer- ica's moral systems,1 many educational theorists have moved toward the open advocacy of moral instruction in the classroom. Recent years have witnessed a virtual deluge of materials and curriculum indices aimed at somehow enhancing a student's ability to cope with the moral di- lemmas of our mass-urban society. All these various approaches toward revitalizing the moral fiber of American society, assuming that is their more general purpose, tend to either explicitly or implicitly depend upon a certain underlying moral philosophy or ethical point of view. Even those which attempt to deny any metaphysical or metaethical content unconsciously espouse a particular form of ethical analysis, for such a bias is logically unavoidable. Although the various proposed curricula entail multiple variations and elaborate permu- tations, at root we can view them as indirect manifestations of a few basic moral theories. In this regard we can also envision the alterna- tives for moral instruction as alternatives be- tween different philosophical imperatives. Such an exercise is not merely an esoteric adventure, for the underlying moral premises of a given pattern of instruction may well turn out to be the single most important consideration in assessing its applicability to the major moral conflicts of our time. Some patterns of instruc- tion via their philosophical implications could perhaps yield a more pervasive amorality than that with which we are now plagued. Therefore, a careful look at the logical underpinnings would seem worthwhile as a practical as well as intellectual enterprise. We might separate the major trends in moral thought into simple categories: Scien- tific, Humanistic, and Principalistic. These cate- gories may not be entirely mutually exclusive nor completely exhaustive given the array of educational alternatives. Notably, these cate- gories are likely to cut across or subsume sev- eral traditional distinctions such as relativism vs. absolutism, naturalism vs. intuitionism, cog- nitivism vs. non-cognitivism, and perhaps others including the timeless rivalry between Platonism and Aristotelian Ethics.2 Scientific Ethics: Pragmatism and the Demise of Ought We might begin by exploring the most dominant philosophical position in terms of its impact, not only upon morals instruction, but within the society at large. The Scientific ap- proach, due to its close coincidence with various prominent educational trends aimed at develop- ing cognitive skills, has an ingrained respect- ability. This position is somehow associated with the scientific method. This connection, greatly Volume XIV, Number 4 247</page><page sequence="2">oversimplified, boils down to a theory which holds that moral statements are merely modified factual statements. Having been derived from factual assertions they are thus subject to em- pirical investigation. Nevertheless, they are not synonymous with Scientific truths, but more analogous to hypothetical propositions. For ex- emple, "Abortion is bad" is not the same type of statement as "the earth is round," for while to- morrow social convention may change and abor- tion will be good (if it is not already), the earth will remain round despite social convention. Thus moral statements are viewed as societal creations, subject to fluctuations, and true to the extent that a given society holds that point of view at a given point in time.3 These notions about the genesis and status of moral statements say very little about the nature of moral judgment itself; also, they do not illuminate the logic of moral justification, and thus additional patterns of analysis are normally erected upon this naturalistic founda- tion. Individual morality can most easily be ex- plained as a behavioral adaptation to the societal norm, e.g., John feels that abortion is bad be- cause he was brought up in a society which holds that view. The logical process of moral judgment could be much more elaborate. For instance, John has been successfully socialized into a culture which condemns the unwarranted taking of human life; John perceives the facts associated with abortion as the taking of a life, due to predisposed cognitive processes; and therefore John is morally opposed to abortion. As new facts are brought to bear he may well change his point of view in accordance with similarly acculturized members of his society. B. F. Skinner carries this behavioral perspective to its logical extreme by asserting that Western morality and the jurisprudential system which equates responsibility to moral acts are hope- less anachronisms. Skinner boldly claims that behavioral explanations render responsibility ridiculous, for an individual is never free to choose morality or immorality; he is either pro- grammed successfully or unsuccessfully. Fail- ures of course must be reprogrammed, a task Skinner feels his science is equipped to handle.4 Note: The author would like to acknowledge the intellectual and moral support of Professors Larry Jensen (psychology), A. Don Sorensen (political science), and Larry Arnoldsen (education) all of Brigham Young University. 248 Theory Into Practice It is perhaps noteworthy that the Scientific approach to ethics need not entail Skinner's obliteration of responsible morality, but need- less to say the implications and reverberations of behaviorism in educational circles are quite widespread. Furthermore, moral inculcation as social programming is a highly possible method- ological alternative. Some of the work being done with so-called "instructional objectives" call upon students to not only perform in ac- cordance with certain acceptable behavioral pat- terns, but to also somehow internalize certain ideals and undergo certain attitudinal tran- sitions.5 The Scientific school of thought need not indulge in grandiose behavioral presuppositions, and for the most part, its proponents have at- tempted to avoid mechanistic interpretations. Yet, such implications are certainly present and can be logically drawn from some of the basic premises. The real desire of Scientific or Ethical Naturalists such as American logician, John Dewey, was to provide a systematized logic of moral reasoning and a method for resolving moral conflicts. This field of endeavor has per- haps the most profound implications for moral instruction. Dewey attempted to fashion an eth- ical system analogous to the processes of in- quiry in the physical domain (scientific). This analytical method has been called Pragmatism and/or Instrumentalism. Pragmatism or the pragmatic method suggests that moral judgments can be transformed into factual judgments by looking at the consequences of acts which the judgments produces.6 In essence, Pragmatism states that moral judgments are based upon an assessment of the consequences. When conflicts arise between assessments, facts are brought to bear to discover which judg- ment is productive of the most beneficial results. Notably, the ordering and interpretation of the facts also entail elaborate value judgments and such an analysis may often prove quite laby- rinthine. Also the final judgment as to what items are and are not beneficial or conducive to the greatest good, whatever they may be, are once again elaborate value propositions in and of themselves. Justification at this final step in keeping with the pragmatic mechanism is usually Utilitarian involving statements about the great- est beneficial effect upon or for the greatest number.7 Those judgments logically demon-</page><page sequence="3">strable from an original utilitarian construct are considered to have more import. Now it is well to recognize that this final justification, even while very tenuously drawn in real situations, does have a great deal of re- ductionist appeal. It achieves complete resolu- tion by reducing moral judgments to factual assertions, assertions which are either correct or incorrect. All "ought" statements are re- duced to "is" statements. Resolution comes about by looking to see if that is indeed the way it is. When an individual asks, "Why should I do this or that?" the answer assumes that one should do what is conducive to the greatest good, a good which has been determined by this given society at this given point in time, also assum- ing that such a determination can be made empirically. The scientific approach is com- pletely self-sufficient if no further questions are raised about the legitimacy of such pronounce- ments. Unfortunately, several questions about these conclusions have been suggested at the philosophical level by ethical analysts. It is not difficult to imagine several individuals with- in the mass heterogeneous society which would likewise question such absolute edicts. Initially one can see that moral facts are difficult to substantiate. Is it indeed the case that our society abhors homosexuality; how many yes votes entail a consensus about its negative re- sults and what degree of consensus makes it an unquestionable fact? Can it be said that America has a public morality? Perhaps so, but it is rather nebulous to say the least. If moral utterances are in the final analysis merely subtly veiled facts concerning a given state of affairs about which there is perceived to be a general consensus, then what is the source of moral obligation? Utilitarian argu- ments may be useful in gaining moral commit- ment, but the dissidents within an "open society" will legitimately want to know why arbitrary mores emanating from the dominent social struc- ture should be binding upon them, particularly when they either don't agree with the general estimation of impact or don't feel the impact warrants any sanction. Other more egoistic mem- bers of the society will wonder why the social good demands their attention, particularly when adherence to a general standard affords them no personal benefits. One can begin to see that these are genuine dilemmas with which a moral sys- tem must come to grips.8 Alternatives to natural- ism have arisen out of these and other problems which seem to stem from the elimination of "ought" statements. British logician G. E. Moore, while remaining a Utilitarian, evoked what has become known as the "naturalistic fallacy" in order to re-establish the famed "is/ought" dis- tinction."9 Moore actually failed to shore up his refutation of naturalism with any substantial alternatives, but he initiated a revolution in ethical analysis by suggesting fundamental weak- nesses in any attempt to convert moral argu- ments to purely factual arguments. Individuals of dissenting opinion will always ask: "but is that moral?" For instance, a particular funda- mentalist group may think that a societal defini- tion of the greatest good is rather hedonistic, which it might well be. But, if it is simply a fact that what the society feels is by definition moral, their dispute is rendered logically impossible, and yet, we should think that such disputes are indeed empirically possible. At this point the tautological character of naturalism becomes evident, i.e., naturalistic pronouncements can be reduced to arguments which hold that that which is good is most certainly good. R. M. Hare and others of the so-called "Non- Cognitivist" camp have expanded upon Moore's initial criticism by attempting to explicate cer- tain items such as the use of moral language.10 Those concerned with usage focus direct atten- tion upon the loss of "performative force" within scientific ethics. In other words, if moral state- ments are merely factual statements they can- not be used to suggest what ought to be the case, but merely what is already the case.ll The Non-Cognitivists suggest that it is integral to the role of ethics in a modern society that moral utterances have the ability to command, extoll, recommend, and admonish certain patterns of behavior which we identify as moral. These linguistic distinctions may be merely analytical slight-of-hand, rather than indicative of para- mount deficiencies within the scientific approach, as John Searle and other Neo-Naturalists seem to suggest.12 The nexus of the difficulty still seems to rest on the problem of obligation. With no stronger base than certain sociological observa- tions and vague notions of consensus, generating shared morality in our rapidly evolving moral milieu seems virtually impossible, given that the Volume XIV, Number 4 249</page><page sequence="4">conditions for identifying a moral imperative is that it is somehow shared in the beginning. Oddly enough, a major portion of the edu- cational indices aimed at moral instruction de- rive their philosophical foundations from vari- ous positions well within the parameters of the Scientific Ethics. These endeavors can most clearly be seen as logical extensions of Dewey's methodology. Work along Neo-Pragmatist lines was vanguarded by the "public issues" curricu- lum originally developed by Donald Oliver and James P. Shaver in the midst of an era which wore the mantel of the "New Social Studies."l3 Attention was focused on particular aspects of values curriculum by Lawrence Metcalf and Milton Meux.14 It has been the educational move- ment represented by these curriculum develop- ers which has perhaps done the most to carve out a place for moral inquiry in the classroom. Their efforts for the most part follow the scien- tific mode, centering around the goal of increas- ing students' ability to resolve moral conflicts through the imposition of social ramifications. Concern for the problem of obligation alluded to in previous comment is practically non-exist- ent. Since their primary realm of investigation presupposes the existence of an elaborate moral system, questions about the system itself rarely arise in their literature. Yet, in the real world outside the classroom such questions do find articulation, often in the most inarticulate ways, and the issue of somehow grounding the entire ethical enterprise will be one with which educators will eventually be called upon to cope. Humanistic Ethics Humanism has many diverse philosophical origins, and can express itself in a myriad of forms. Thus our discussion of it as an ethical content will be somewhat stipulative. Humanism in educational philosophy has witnessed a re- surgence of late, and its influence has become nearly as pervasive as the scientific format. A good deal of the renewed influence could well be the result of a less antagonistic stand toward the canons of science. Heretofore, humanism and science were largely antithetical with hu- manism serving as a reactionary force to cer- tain unhealthy scientific apriorisms.15 Through the work of psychologists such as Abraham Mas- low and educational theorists such as Jean Pia- get, humanism became integrated into the con- 250 Theory Into Practice fines of scientific endeavor.16 This emergent de- tente allowed humanism to forge its own base of support through positing rather sophisticated theories of human motivation. Humanistic ethics, particularly those which have become popular in educational circles, are fundamentally ontological, i.e., they are linked to unfolding of being. What for Hegel and Marx was the overcoming of alienation from self has become in Maslow "self-realization." Humanistic Ethics in the very broadest sense is an anthropocentric creed, a reaffirmation of humanity's place in the universe. Its con- cept of morality can be either highly natural- istic or border on existential nihilism, but very generally it derives its moral content from the person rather than religious or supernatural en- tities. This does not exclude the possibility that the individual has some sort of divine purpose, but if he or she does it is like Nietzsche's "Over- man," imminent from within.17 Contemporary humanistic ideals tend to reject such teleolog- ical notions, asserting that the results of each person's self-realization are unique. The implications of humanism for the edu- cational process are quite widespread. Gener- ally speaking, the tendency is to engender a free learning environment in which students are encouraged to investigate their own interests and express their own individual personalities.18 For the most part the internalization of moral standards is reduced to an idiosyncratic mech- anism. Taken in its most simplified form, hu- manistic ethics implies that each person must decide independently with which moral princi- ples he or she will assent. In this form, human- ism emerges as diametrically unique from the behavioral tendencies within Scientific Ethics. Nevertheless, humanism may fall back upon naturalistic argumentation when justifying choices. Under other circumstances, humanism may polarize toward the nihilistic position that there is no rational basis for moral decisions, i.e., one person's choice is about as good as another's. Here we see that the continuum spans the distance between cultural relativity (the position compatible with naturalism) to per- sonal relativity. The ingrained relativism, no matter at what point it falls along the spectrum, is very much in keeping with the growing social ideology which holds that moral beliefs are merely conventional.</page><page sequence="5">Contemporary analytical humanists such as Bertrand Russell, have been cognizant of a trend in western thought toward the destruction of ethical moorings, and thus they contend that recognition of the conventional character of ethics need not lead one to accept total amor- ality, i.e., anything goes.19 They tend to for- ward arguments which inspire people toward humane and socially beneficial behavior in the face of burgeoning nihilism. In essence, one should do good even when good is merely a relative social manifestation. Other more ex- istential doctrines would admonish people to choose to do good as an act of self-creation.20 Still other humanstic doctrines link the indi- vidual's self-actualization to notions of social consciousness which make his or her choice to do what is socially acceptable a logical extension of his or her ontological quest.21 Once again the problem of obligation be- comes most evident. If an individual is free to choose, why should he or she choose to do good? The Humanists have several answers, but when all the complexities are unraveled the response is generally because it is the human thing to do. Often utilitarian arguments are ex- panded with the added premise that acts con- ducive to the maximization of moral utility are in keeping with the individual's greatest poten- tialities. Awareness of "self" comes through awareness of others. But still, questions may be raised as to why the unfolding of one's unique being should conform to social standards, par- ticularly when those social standards have no other justification than the fact that they are social. Humanists who are generally anti- conventional might find themselves in a personal dilemma when it comes to arguing about public morality. Humanists may find that it is difficult to counter one brand of relativism with another. Their frustrations are analogous to those ex- perienced by the French existentialist Albert Camus. Camus, in his Letter to a Friend, be- comes painfully aware that his own individual moral system has no means of challenging the Nazi death camp without evoking an absolute principle which demands a respect for human life. R. M. Hare's analytical existentialism brings him to the same relativistic dilemma. Once again in a hypothetical confrontation with a Nazi, Hare finds that his non-cognitive system (recognizing no absolutes) is incapable of say- ing what he really wants to say: simply that his opponent is morally wrong.22 In cases such as these, humanists would be prone to do as Hare does and revert to "attacking the man" arguments, i.e., "only fanatics would choose such an immoral system," or some such thing. Yet, this still implies a morality which their sys- tem of logic cannot verify. Despite this problem of moral verifications, perhaps the Humanists are somewhat justified when they infer that moral principles are not truths in the scientific or religious sense, but rather that they are intangible qualities which rest within each individual and are the logical extension of what it means to be a human being. Yet, while it may be sufficient for the classroom to attempt to evoke moral behavior as an ex- pression of one's individual telos, it does not seem to carry sufficient specificity to alter the dynamics of civility in the world outside. Staunch defenders of humanism would ob- viously take exception to our analysis at this point, for genuine Humanism usually encom- passes a measure of optimistic faith in one's ability to realize potentialities. Unfortunately, such optimism is only justified in those Human- ists who assume, as did the early Greek hu- manists, that all persons have an inevitable and objective telos (end) in common. Moral or evaluative educational strategies reflective of humanistic ideals seem to harbor this enthusi- astic optimism, almost a clandestine Platonism. Meanwhile they tend to foster a highly sub- jective form of morality. The missing premise is that the individual, when left to his or her own devices, will discover personal social ob- ligations and thus instrument a more humane epoch. Along these lines of independent discovery and self-internalization, the humanistic educa- tors, as alluded to previously, attempt to establish classroom situations free from all moral biases. Such is the basic design of latent humanists, Merrill Harmin, Sidney B. Simon, and Louis E. Raths.23 The prevailing tenor of their work suggests that each individual must clarify her or his own system of values. Their emphasis is placed upon providing skills which will aid individuals in their value choices, but the choices themselves must be completely Volume XIV, Number 4 251</page><page sequence="6">free and will only be completely applicable to that particular individual. The apparent existentialism of Raths, Har- min, and Simon is greatly tempered by their reliance upon certain Neo-Deweyist elements within the "process of valuing" which they ad- vocate. They admonish that alternatives be honed down by the conscientious application of facts, and that consideration of alternatives always be based on projected consequences. Nonetheless, their method is more situational than utilitarian. Underlying their approach is the unspoken "Golden Rule," but reference to what patterns of behavior will emerge is con- spicuously absent. One is also cautioned to be consistent in his or her choices and to avoid ca- price, but it is conceivable that within a purely skeletal (vacant of content) system one could be consistently and comprehensively egoistic. Of course their system is not nearly as devoid of content as they would like to believe. The mere ordering and selection of pertinent facts entails initial value judgments. Likewise, the logic of analysis and a structure based upon conse- quences infers certain evaluative parameters. The noticeable art within their formulations is that this leading toward values offers the illusion of being self-motivated. In this regard their en- deavors converge upon the current experimenta- tion with "affective objectives."24 Yet, despite this internal mechanism for promoting morality, our earlier reservations still seem to pertain. Broad guidelines which produce a myriad of moral alternatives, while conducive to and reflective of the values cherished by an open society, are not likely to have a very sub- stantial impact upon the growing amoral miasma. It is interesting to note that under the auspices of such a value system, those values which gave it birth can no longer be justified by the logic of the emerging morality. As Irving Kristol pointed out in his analysis of urban culture, when tolerance becomes the only remaining virtue in a mass society, a system of ethics arises which is incapable of even granting credence to that originating value.25 This is not to deride the potential present within a humanistic doctrine, nor to discount the internalization value of affective methods-it is merely an attempt to point up some of the philosophical ambivalence present within this major approach to moral instruction. 252 Theory Into Practice Principalistic Ethics: The Need for Roots The recognition of certain absolute or ulti- mate principles which serve as a guideline in the construction of moral systems constitutes a formidable philosophical tradition. For the most part, it is variations of the principalistic approach to ethics which have served as the cornerstone to the religious pursuit of moral behavior. Most ecclesiastical organizations re- gard these guiding principles as either the defining characteristics of a cosmic force which pervades the universe or the personal decrees of an anthropomorphic diety. For various reasons, ethical doctrines which encompass such religious overtones have steadily declined in influence. Initially the scientific revolution began to circumvent any and all references to metaphysical mysteries. Later, serious concern was voiced which served to ban all instruction from the public schools which implied any specific religious affiliation. Interestingly enough the demise of religious instruction in the schools need not necessarily have entailed the destruc- tion of the principalistic approach to moral edu- cation.21 But for the most part the ban on pro- moting specific religious doctrines had the ef- fect of discouraging conscious attempts at morals education. The world at large was becoming secular and scientific, and thus the intellectual disdain for moral absolutism of any sort was a prevailing influence. Nevertheless, a decade or more of experi- ence with the hopeless relativism which has as- cended to prominence since the decline of re- ligious influences created a renewed interest in principalistic alternatives. Philosophers, and ed- ucators, as well as theologians have been seeking a way to combat the rampant uprootedness of American society. Ethical Analysts began to focus upon the logical status of religiousity as separate and distinct from myth, magic, and al- legory. Recognition was initially granted to the integral socializing functions of religious insti- tutions, and eventually insights into the role of certain philosophical imperatives conducive to civility were isolated.27 John Wilson and oth- ers heralded a view which suggested that re- ligious ideals without any particular religious dogma were a vital element in education. Their principle claim was that the philosophical baby had been cast out with the rhetorical bath water of Ecclesiastical instruction.28 Most of these at-</page><page sequence="7">tempts at reaffirming certain basic values through the educational enterprise are rela- tively cognizant that such a process does not entail the reinstatement of any particular relig- ious creed, nor does it require any of the in- stitutional apparatus associated with any form of worship. In its humblest form the reintro- duction of moral principles roughly analogous to those portrayed by religious ethics merely involves a logic of justification which encom- passes one's choice of a moral way of life. The arduousness of this task is apparent only when one realizes that certain appeals common to particular religious doctrines are excluded as resources, for those analysts concerned with this task have chosen to draw their conclusions with- out theological assistance. Generally speaking, principalistic analysis begins its trek at the fork in the road forged by David Hume and provided a sign post by G. E. Moore, i.e., the "fact-value distinction."29 The principalistic school begins with the assump- tion that facts and values, while substantially interrelated, are actually distinct entities. Therefore, moral principles, while subject to application of and the clarification through facts, are not subject to a factual criterion of truth. In essence, they are not scientific state- ments as Dewey believed. Often these argu- ments also apply to certain naive religious con- cepts of truth, i.e., those which argue that prin- ciples are facts posited by God. Principalistic viewpoints need not imply any direct measure of truth, as it is commonly known, yet this does not entail that principles are not subject to justification. In a fashion analogous to the pat- terns of justification which verify and substanti- ate the ultimate principles of science, moral guidelines can be shown worthy of assent. For example, Parsimony, Uniformity, and Causality are not truths about the universe as much as they are tautological definitions of what one accepts as scientific truth. Likewise, justice and a respect for human life are not truths about humanity as much as they are criteria for what can be designated as moral. Now the question arises: what makes justice and respect for hu- man life worthy of being ultimate guiding prin- ciples? It is noteworthy that while this question is similar to the famed "why should I be moral" question,30 it is not exactly the same type of inquiry. In essence, the reasons why something is moral are not always identical with reasons why an individual should reject self-interest in favor of that ethic. An individual may still choose to be an egocentric hedonist, but he or she will do so realizing that his or her acts are not the result of moral choices.31 Some prin- cipalistic thinkers attempt to extend the defi- nitions of rationality in order to demonstrate that an immoral choice is also an irrational choice. In general, the various attempts at grounding a moral system entail arguments as to why a rational individual would give assent to that particular "way of life." Arguments leading up to the final choice are usually patterned after those of the instru- mentalist or pragmatist. Paul Taylor, for in- stance, builds upon a moral system which is patterned after Hare's deductive logic of moral inquiry.32 Individual moral situations are an- alyzed and clarified initially by the application of facts and evaluation of consequences, much like Dewey's system. Only when two agents agree on the facts and consequences but still defend opposing moral judgments does an actual moral controversy exist. Under these circumstances the two opposing points of view are again an- alyzed to determine which judgment is most directly demonstrable from an ultimate moral principle, such as life, justice, or equality and so forth. In this fashion that judgment which is deductively derivable from a higher order prin- ciple, realizing that there is ranking among principles, will be regarded as the appropriate moral choice. Taylor's unique contribution comes at the point where justification, or what he calls "vin- dication," of the principles themselves and their particular stratification takes place. Taylor sug- gests, as does John Rawls and other ethical and legal theorists, that under certain hypothetical original conditions, all individuals placed under the constraints of rationality would choose cer- tain moral imperatives.33 Skillfully constructed these original conditions of rationality need not be tautological. Stated simply, they merely insist that an individual choose a system devoid of the knowledge of her or his role or station within that system. Taylor and Rawls feel that it is legitimate to argue that such a choice would exhibit universal commonality. Yet such uni- versal agreement would only be granted to prin- ciples which could withstand the rigor of these original organizational prerequisites. One can not merely say that everyone would consent to Volume XIV, Number 4 253</page><page sequence="8">this or that principle. The Taylor-Rawls form of reasoning gains credence by demonstrating that such a choice is exclusively reasonable through meticulous analysis of alternatives.34 It is noteworthy that although under these original conditions an individual would "con- tract" for morality, in the real world it is still logically as well as empirically possible to be completely rational in one's choice of immoral- ity. In essence, these principalistic arguments have not shown us the logical necessity of acting morally. They merely provide a cappingstone upon a logic of moral reasoning. Such a device can adjudicate between individuals who seek to make choices in accordance with morality, but it cannot absolutely prove in a scientific sense that an individual ought to be moral. Nonetheless, such an individual can be shown the reasons for morality, reasons which a ra- tional being placed in a position of creating a social mechanism could not logically reject. This type of edifice may well provide sufficient con- ditions for a foundation of moral reasoning in the absence of religious conceptualizations. The principalistic, or at least the non-rela- tivistic, point of view has also gained added support from the realms of developmental psy- chology. Lawrence Kohlberg and other psychol- ogists assert that identification with certain ultimate principles becomes stronger as one moves up the ladder of their descriptive hier- archy of moral development. Kohlberg believes, as did Jean Piaget, that moral development pro- ceeds in patterns commensurate with cognitive development. This positive correlation leads one to assume that highly intelligent persons will have a more analytical moral awareness Kohlberg's semi-empirical investigations have for the most part shown this to be the case. Further- more, those of high analytical capability tend to exhibit a realization of and an identification with an absolute concept of justice.35 Kohlberg and others have proceeded from this point to suggest methods by which an indi- vidual may be advanced toward this higher level of moral and cognitive development. The basis of their methodology entails confronting indi- viduals with dilemmas which involve them in reasoning above their present levels, the notion being that if sufficient disequilibrium is pro- duced, the individual will seek relief from anxiety by assimilating the higher level of reason- ing pattern.36 It is reasonable to assume that 254 Theory Into Practice through simulation activities, educators might be able to duplicate certain disequilibrium situa- tions. In the final analysis, the principalistic ap- proach to education does little to distract from the scientism of the naturalists or the benevolent aspirations of the humanists. The tension is still very much upon independent analysis rather than indoctrination. The principalists merely be- gin with certain assumptions about the nature of human morality, assumptions which they feel they can logically justify. Specific content is still a rather nebulous matter. Some educators have argued along with the theologians that even principalistic positions are far too vague to actually serve as a guide to moral behavior.37 This point is well taken. Yet one would think that through the conscientious application of principle guided analysis, a certain degree of positive content would become manifest. As John Wilson, Norman Williams, and Barry Sugarman contend, education can instill morality without stressing dogmatic codes of conduct. Their rather vague approach stresses the dimensions of a moral agent in the hope that general parameters will be conductive to a creative moral character.38 Once again, the faith in human po- tential so evident in the humanists is apparent in certain highly analytical principalistic doc- trines, the distinction being that such a faith is rooted in the realization that rationality and reflective capability will inexorably lead human- ity to specific structures of humane interaction just as science has led to certain prominent notions or educated estimations about the con- figuration of the universe. One must remain mindful of the dynamism implied by this analogy. Just as humanity's picture of the uni- verse will evolve and refine, social morality will remain in flux. Knowledge of moral principles is never sufficient grounds for issuing moral canons. Concepts such as justice only serve to light the path-they are not the end of the search. Conclusion If, as our analysis of the various alternatives culminated, it became evident that a certain bias toward the Principalistic formulations was being exhibited, this bias is admitted. For as we at- tempted to indicate throughout, a system of moral reasoning to the extent that it is found- ed upon a particular logic, implies certain con-</page><page sequence="9">clusions. If such logic is dependent upon ra- tionality, then we are already somewhat com- mitted to the assumption that humanity's ra- tional capabilities will produce certain identifi- able ends. One such end would be a way of life acceptable to all who could follow the logical progression. There are perhaps other less esoteric argu- ments such as social efficacy, but in the end the conclusion remains that if morality is to have meaning at all it must have certain shared aspects, aspects which produce a sense of obliga- tion to the whole. Relativity leads us to a hope- less situation in which even our knowledge of the relative state of affairs cannot be substan- tiated. As for the implications for moral instruc- tion, this analysis has perhaps pointed out the exchange of elements between the various alternatives. From this we might expect that emergent patterns of moral instruction will be synthetic in nature, symbiotically combining many philosophical tendencies. Dewey's prag- matism is certainly a useful device in distinguish- ing moral consequences from non-moral. Cer- tain trends within humanism serve to divorce values from scientific reductionism, and also provide a confidence in human potential vital to educational innovation. Likewise, the inter- jection of notions of morality tantamount to ulti- mate principles provide an anchor for moral sys- tems which became created out of our best re- flections. Hopefully it has been shown that the neglect of any integral philosophical items will render the system impotent as a device for re- ducing moral conflict, conflict which now threat- ens to race us toward the eventual decline of Western Civilization.
