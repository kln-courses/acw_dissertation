Discourse, Cognition, and Chaotic Systems: An Examination of Students' Argument About Density Jeffrey W. Bloom Center for Excellence in Education Northern Arizona University This article examines an extended argument about density among a small, multi-graded, middle school class of 10 students. The argument is examined from several perspectives with the primary focus on (a) the argument as an example of a chaotic and complex system, (b) the emerging development of understandings, and (c) the underlying cognitive structures affecting the students' understandings. Stu- dent talk during the class sessions were audio and videotape recorded. Each group of 3 or 4 students was individually audio recorded. A single video recorder was used to capture excerpts of each group's dialogue, as well as intergroup dialogue. The argu- ment began after students predicted which of an assortment of different objects would or would not float. The specific case of a block of ebony initiated the argument and acted as the initial attractor, which developed into 2 opposing assertions: 1 side pro- posing that the pressure on a larger volume of water affects the density and the other side proposing that the molecules of water cannot be compressed. Extensive concep- tual development occurred as the argument progressed with a variety of bifurcation points leading to new but related conceptual themes and higher levels of complexity. Several underlying structures, which have been referred to as interpretive frame- works (Bloom, 1992a) andp-prims (diSessa, 1993), played a central role in the devel- opment of both understandings and the argument itself. Such interpretive frameworks included (a) uniformity of molecular size and weight across different substances, (b) directionality of pressure, (c) external forces (e.g., gravity) affect pressure, (d) pres- sure affects density, and (e) surface area affects action of external forces on pressure.

Analysis of this argument will help further our understandings ofthe nature and dynamics of stu- dent-to-student discourse and of how teachers can help to foster and promote such discussions. In addition, this article will examine how student controlled discourse can expose underlying, problematic understandings, as well as lead to more complex understandings. In contrast, most studies of classroom discourse in science education focus on the interaction of the teacher with students. Very few studies examine primarily stu- dent-based dialogue. An exception is the extensive look at "Science Talk" sessions with young children by Gallas (1995) and a study by Anderson, Chinn, Chang, Waggoner, and Yi (1997). The study by Anderson etal. looks primarily atthe logical structure of children's arguments. However, this study examines an argument that arose spontaneously after an activity that required a group of Grades 5 through 7 stu- dents to predict which of an assortment of objects would float. This argument spanned five class sessions and was characterized by the students' ownership ofthe ideas expressed and by greatly reduced overt control by the teacher over the content and flow of the discussion. Of particular interest in this article are (a) the structure, content, and processes of student-to-student discourse and how such discourse affects student learning and (b) the development of the students' explanations and understandings as they grapple with their own and the conflicting ideas of others. Although the unit of instruction within which this argument occurred focused on "floating," this article addresses the more general concerns of extracting underlying meanings and understandings as they unfolded during a fairly unstructured and spontaneous argument characterized by the emergent organization, processes, and structures characteristic of chaotic systems. The underlying understandings driving the argument involved two types of interpre- tive frameworks (Bloom, 1992a, 1992b): (a) a phenomenological primitive (p-prims; diSessa, 1993) involving the notion ofpressure and (b) a naive model ofmolecules. This article reveals the dynamics between prior and emerging conceptual un- derstandings during the course of the student-controlled argument. The major questions addressed in this article include the following: 1. How can the argument's emergent organization, structure, and processes, as exemplified by the characteristics of chaotic systems, provide clues to how such arguments can be promoted and facilitated in the classroom? 2. What prior and emerging conceptual understandings are evident in the ar- gument and how can teachers uncover such understandings? 3. What underlying principles or interpretive frameworks influence student thinking, and how do they affect student learning? 4. How can student-to-student discourse assist teachers in identifying such underlying principles and frameworks?</page><page sequence="3">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 449 The particular significance of these questions relates to the current emphasis in the National Science Education Standards on creating classroom communities, con- structing meaningful understandings, and engaging in science talk (National Acad- emy of Sciences, 1995). In creating such communities, children take on more con- trol and responsibility and have an increasing sense of ownership over the ideas, discourse, and products generated in the classroom. The first question deals with the characteristics ofa primarily student-controlled argument, where the students "own" the conceptual content. Addressing this ques- tion is critical to developing understandings ofhow teachers can promote and facili- tate arguments and discussions, which exemplify the kinds of discourse found in communities of active learners. The last two questions address aspects of children's cognition and learning. Developing understandings of these aspects of children's cognition and learning, in turn, provide the knowledge and skills required by teach- ers in assuming new roles. Such roles move away from being the knowledge author- ity and the focal point and controller in classroom discourse. In assuming these new roles teachers need to identify the major conceptual understandings and interpretive frameworks arising from the students' talk, so that appropriate questions, com- ments, and activities can be used to challenge students' inaccurate knowledge claims. From this perspective, teachers become participants in the discourse and ac- tivities of the community in ways that assist students in examining their own under- standings and knowledge claims. Such an approach maintains the integrity of student control and ownership in the classroom community, while providing an ef- fective means of addressing students' alternative or inaccurate conceptions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Attempting to establish a classroom community of scientists served as the founda- tion for the instructional approach that provided the basis for the investigation of student discourse. Within this foundation, three general theoretical perspectives in- form the way in which we can perceive and analyze the data presented here. These three perspectives are (a) language and discourse, in terms of their relation to emer- gent understandings and learning; (b) systems, such as that provided by chaos and complexity theories; and (c) cognition, in terms of learning and the factors that af- fect knowledge construction. Each of these theoretical perspectives will be dis- cussed briefly in the following subsections. Also, throughout this article the term context is used to describe pedagogical situations or settings and cognitive or epistemic frameworks. Language and Discourse Examining children's discourse provides opportunities to delineate the social and individual dynamics of children's thinking and how they contribute to the construc-</page><page sequence="4">450 BLOOM tion of meaningful understandings. When analyzing student discourse, a number of underlying assumptions should be kept in mind. Cortazzi (1993) described five such assumptions, which are consistent with a constructivist framework: 1. "Understanding is a constructive process." 2. "Meaning is actively interpreted." 3. "Understanding occurs concurrently with information input and process- ing." 4. "Understanding activates and uses presuppositions in the form of previous experiences, beliefs and attitudes, motivations and goals." 5. "Understanders and producers use information from events, the situation or context, presuppositions, and existing schemata flexibly and strategically" (pp. 67-68). These assumptions provide the basis for making sense of student conversations and arguments in the classroom. This study examines how the dynamics of student dis- course affect the development of more complex understandings through cycles of information input and processing (as addressed by the second assumption). How- ever, as Gee (1994) contended, the everyday language used by students has a ten- dency to obscure the underlying meaning and reality of their understandings. As Gee suggested, "unfortunately, in science it is often this 'underlying' level which is crucial" (p. 5). Such previously existing underlying meanings and understandings often affect the construction of new scientifically accurate understandings (which is the focus of the third assumption). Addressing concerns at this underlying level, where the depth and extent of children's understandings can be difficult to uncover, requires concerted effort be- yond what is typically required in teacher-directed approaches. Partial statements and vague references and terminology make the task of describing children's un- derstandings more troublesome. Edwards and Mercer (1987) contended that "in- vestigators rarely dig for the roots of misunderstanding in the communicative processes of education, in the meeting of two minds which education is contrived to achieve" (p. 49). Gee's work in this area is particularly illuminating. The pro- cess of abduction, which Gee defined as reasoning that draws on one's own experi- ence to formulate plausible explanations and where aesthetics and taste play a major role, is fundamental to understanding how children express their under- standings of phenomena. This process is fundamental to working in science, but can take on the characteristics of "everyday" abduction. Such everyday abduction relies on everyday language and logic, and on language constructions, which are more typical of story telling. As opposed to the type ofdiscourse describedby Cortazzi (1993) and Gee (1994), most studies of classroom talk have focused on teacher-student interactions, rather than student-student interactions. Such teacher-controlled discourse limits the ex-</page><page sequence="5">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 451 tent to which students can construct more complex understandings and to which teachers can identify students' problematic underlying understandings. The focus on such teacher-student interactions has arisen from the work of Vygotsky (1962, 1978), who saw the role of the teacher as one of helping students move towards higher levels ofunderstanding. As Cazden (1988) noted, Vygotsky's work on the re- lation of speech and thinking focused on the interaction of students with adults and did not consider peer interaction. The situation of student-to-student interaction in the development of discourse skills and thinking was not considered, and has only begun to be considered by contemporary researchers, such as Cazden (1988) and Gallas (1995). The move towards greater student-to-student participation is evident in the recent development of apprenticeship models (Gee, 1994; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), where the roles ofteachers have moved towards facilitating student induction into the talk of learning communities. For students to acquire discourse skills in science, they must be exposed to op- portunities to practice talking about science topics. In her work with young chil- dren, Gallas (1995) formalized such opportunities in the form of regular "Science Talk" sessions. In contrast to the typical classroom, in which "the teacher is in charge of what is said about a subject" (p. 10), Gallas set up situations in which the teacher remains relatively silent while students discuss and argue about their de- veloping conceptions and theories. She suggested that when a community of learners begins with the act of dialogue about the world, and when that dialogue occurs outside of the theoretical and conceptual influence of the teacher, it moves more naturally and vitally toward theory and a readiness for instruc- tion and study. (p. 3) Over time as students engage in such a process, they "take on the voice and the au- thority of scientists" (p. 3; emphasis in the original). As Cazden (1988) suggested, student-to-student talk without the "limitations and rigidities characteristic of most teacher-student interactions" (p. 134) allows students to develop attitudes that bridge the differences between individuals. Such an approach to classroom talk (a) provides students with more control and ownership over their dialogue and learn- ing, (b) allows them to reach and explore the limits of their knowledge, and (c) al- lows them to experience the "kinds" of discourse that can occur in science disci- plines. The kinds of discourse evident in science are not only different from one an- other, but are vastly different from those of other disciplines and of everyday life. Bakhtin (1981, 1986) and Lemke (1988, 1990) considered such variation among discourses in the form of speech genres. Genres are context-dependent ways of talking or writing. They usually have a specific type of thematic content, certain stylistic characteristics, and a particular compositional structure. Bakhtin (1986) suggested two general types of genres: primary or simple and secondary or com-</page><page sequence="6">452 BLOOM plex. Moving from primary genres, typical in everyday talk, to secondary genres, typical of specific disciplines or areas of expertise, is certainly a goal of science ed- ucation. However, to accomplish such moves from primary to secondary genres, we need to recognize that this can only be done through students' interactions amongst themselves and with teachers. The difficulties in developing the skills of talking in ways that are characteristic of secondary genres, which are less ambiguous and follow some of the patterns of reasoning in science, are similar to those encountered in Perkins and Simmons (1988) "frames." These frames include 1. The content frame, where students engage in developing or constructing ac- curate explanations and understandings (e.g., understandings of density, pressure, etc., in this study). 2. The problem-solving frame, where students use effective strategies in reaching solutions to problems (e.g., attempting to solve the problems in- volved in student disagreements over a viable explanation for why ebony sinks). 3. The epistemic frame, where students analyze the coherence of their obser- vations, experimental results, and explanations (e.g., where students exam- ine one another's claims about density, pressure, etc.). 4. The inquiry frame, where students engage in finding and identifying prob- lems, as well as in developing explanations of particular phenomena and so- lutions to problems (e.g., suggesting explanations of density and engaging in investigations in an attempt to support or refute specific knowledge claims). These frames not only point to specific types of science classroom activities, but they also suggest rather specific ways of talking. For example, generating explana- tions in the content or inquiry frames versus analyzing the validity of explanations in the epistemic frame require different types of language and thinking or different secondary genres (types of science talk in this article). The evident dilemma in the contrast between everyday and science talk is compounded if we consider that both types of talk are powerful in their own right and in appropriate contexts (these contexts can include Perkins and Simmons [1988] "frames"), as suggested by Gee (1994). When we examine children's arguments in science, we can develop a sense of the power and appro- priateness of their claims and arguments, as well as the ambiguity and difficul- ties in communicating meaning. Lemke (1990) suggested that using everyday language to soften the potentially difficult task of acquiring science talk can hu- manize the gap between everyday and science talk. In addition, his work helps create a link between language and the construction of conceptual understand- ings, although the development of specific conceptual understandings is not em-</page><page sequence="7">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 453 phasized. However, his approach to identifying and describing thematic patterns provides a useful approach to understanding how meaning forms during class- room discourse: "a thematic pattern is a way of picturing the network of rela- tionships among the meanings of key terms in the language of a particular subject" (p. 98). The implication of thematic patterns concerns how concepts and understandings are grounded in and constructed by the dialogue that takes place in the classroom. As we proceed with this discussion, this notion of a net- work of thematic patterns will prove to be an important basis for examining the emergent patterns of chaotic systems. For the sake of clarity, when referring to thematic patterns, I see these as nearly equivalent to emergent understandings. In other words, as student understandings emerge and develop through the dis- course, they are the thematic patterns to which Lemke refers. Chaos and Complexity in Discourse Although previous research has been informative in terms of helping develop spe- cific understandings of classroom discourse, the nature of discourse from a more holistic perspective is still somewhat elusive. In this study, concepts from cybernet- ics, chaos, and complexity theories will be used to formulate a descriptive model of student discourse. Such a model has the potential to inform the education commu- nity on how student discourse can be initiated and maintained, even though specific initiators and outcomes cannot be predicted (note: unpredictability is characteristic of chaotic systems [Capra, 1996]). In particular, the notion of feedback loops from cybernetics (Bateson, 1979; Capra, 1996; Weiner, 1948) contributes a framework for how the discourse pro- cess interconnects across differing points of view and provides for the develop- ment of more complex and emergent understandings. Such feedback loops characterize nonlinear processes, which work towards either balancing or rein- forcing the particular process. This feedback loop process is depicted in this article as the claim-counterclaim or challenge pattern characteristic of arguments. In the case of the student argument discussed in this article, the process tends to be self-reinforcing, where the continuation of the process (i.e., argument) tends to amplify the effect of the initial disagreement. Such amplifying effects arise out of what Bateson referred to as symmetrical relationships, where the party (or parties) on one side of a relationship compete with the party (or parties) on the other side. This pattern of relationship (or self-amplifying process) can lead to an inescapable divergence. On the other hand, the prototypical classroom tends to operate as a self-balancing system, where the teacher strives to control the action and limit stu- dent-to-student discourse. In addition, the teacher and students tend to lock into complementary relationships (Bateson, 1979), where the teacher is in control and the students are subservient. Although such relationships also tend to diverge, the</page><page sequence="8">454 BLOOM divergence may be less explicitly observable. Ideally, the healthiest relationships are those that are reciprocal, where both parties engage on equal ground and in a negotiative process of give and take. To extend the descriptive base for our understandings of the dynamics of stu- dent discourse and of emergent understandings, chaos and complexity theories provide insights into additional processes involved in classroom discourse as a system. Capra (1996) classified the criteria of systems under three broad head- ings: 1. Patterns of organization, which involve the relationships that provide any particular system's characteristics and include autopoeisis. 2. Structure, which is a system's physical presence (i.e., actual components) and includes dissipative structures. 3. Process, which continually generates the structures that manifest the pat- terns of organization and includes cognition (broadly defined as the process of life by Bateson [1979] and Maturana &amp; Varela [1998]). Autopoeisis is concerned with the patterns of self-generating and self-maintaining systems, which operate through networks of production pro- cesses. At points of instability and at points far from equilibrium, new forms of or- der are generated, which, in turn, lead to higher levels of organization (Maturana &amp; Varela [1998] referred to such organization as circular) and increased diversity (Capra, 1996; Maturana &amp; Varela, 1998). Although autopoeisis is concerned with biological systems, some researchers are drawing links to social systems (Luhmann, as cited in Capra) and specifically to classrooms (Barab et al., 1999). Ongoing arguments tend to display the characteristics of self-maintaining systems, such as circular patterns of organization, over limited periods of time. Dissipative structures self-maintain an organized structure through self-amplifying feedback loops at points that are far from equilibrium. These struc- tures develop around attractors, which are "points" around which activity occurs, such as the center point around which a pendulum swings or the center of the vor- tex of a tornado. As such structures self-amplify, new attractors known as bifurca- tion points may arise. At these points, new structures may develop with an increase in complexity (Capra, 1996; Prigogine &amp; Stengers, 1984). Essentially, such struc- tures maintain patterns of organization, yet are unpredictable in terms of specify- ing precise future events or conditions. Just as a tornado maintains its overall pattern of organization (i.e., characteristic shape), it continually changes its spe- cific shape and may even split into two or more funnels (which are the result of bi- furcation points). In student-to-student arguments, the attractor may be one event (e.g., in this article, the event is ebony sinking), from which student claims or counterclaims (i.e., circular feedback loops) arise and continue to maintain the overall discourse structure as new information is introduced and pursued (i.e., bi-</page><page sequence="9">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 455 furcations points and divergence), and the overall complexity of understandings increases. The processes of chaotic systems are production processes. As mentioned pre- viously, these processes are considered to be cognitive in the broad sense of com- municating information. In terms of classroom discourse, cognition as an individual process and as a communicative process among classroom participants is the process that produces structures, which represent emergent patterns of orga- nization. For instance, as students begin discussing a particular topic (i.e., attrac- tor) patterns of organization in the discussion emerge and produce a structure characteristic of the particular discussion. The more students disagree (i.e., the far- ther they are from equilibrium), the more the processes push the discussion toward higher levels of organization and complexity. Student Cognition In terms of student cognition, there is abundant research in science education, which focuses on children's misconceptions or alternative conceptions. Most of this work identifies and describes children's concepts in specific domains, but does not address issues of the formation of such concepts or how they affect student dis- course in science classrooms. However, two related and key notions of children's cognition in science are significant in understanding the development of concepts. These notions are interpretive frameworks (Bloom, 1990, 1992a, 1992b) and the subset of phenomenological primitives orp-prims (diSessa, 1993), both of which are powerful influences on inferring and constructing new knowledge. Interpretive frameworks describe the broad category of cognitive structures that affect and guide thinking and concept formation. Such frameworks include (a) beliefs, which can range from personal to culturally embedded; (b) common interpretive struc- tures, such as anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism; and (c) experientially based and phenomenon-specific structures, such as diSessa's p-prims. P-prims arise from children's experiences with particular phenomena. Such structures are intuitive explanations of phenomena, which cannot be explained by the holder of thep-prim. From this perspective, students see their explanations based onp-prims as self-evident and needing no further explanation. A simple example of such a p-prim is a young child's explanation of earthworms: "that worm is bigger, it's a male worm" (Bloom, 1992b). From this child's perspective, it is self-evident that males are always bigger than females. From the child's experience, men are bigger than women. This pattern recognition becomes embedded as a guiding principle or framework for explaining new observations. In some cases, as diSessa commented, their influence leads to understandings that are currently accurate. In other cases, however, the result is in faulty understandings. If we refer back to Gee's (1994) no- tion of abduction, we also can see how interpretive framework, includingp-prims,</page><page sequence="10">456 BLOOM can serve as the basis for such dialogic events. From this perspective, however, ab- duction does not have to fall into the story-telling pattern of discourse, but can occur within scientific genres, as well. The data included in this article represent an argument created and maintained by the students. Investigating the flow and development of the argument is particu- larly intriguing, because of the extent of student control involved. As opposed to most studies of classroom discourse, the teacher's role in the argument is minimal. Whereas most studies of classroom activity have investigated either the nature of discourse or student learning (Edwards [1993] is one exception), this study not only examines the interaction of discourse and the development of understanding, but also uncovers underlying conceptual principles (J. L. Lemke, April 19, 1995, personal communication) or interpretive frameworks (Bloom, 1992a, 1992b) that influence student thinking, discourse, and understandings. One of the difficulties in examining classroom discourse is determining whether the ideas being ex- pressed are the students' or whether the ideas and terms used are just being re- peated from interjections by the teacher (Edwards, 1993). What we see being discussed in this article, for the most part, are the students' concepts and under- standings. With the exception of the term "density," the students generated the ideas and terminology in the argument. In summary, this article will address the importance of student-to-student dis- course as a chaotic system in extending our understandings of student learning and in providing teachers with the necessary tools to facilitate and utilize the in- formation arising from student discourse. Although unpredictable in nature, such discourse can help teachers to identify underlying problematic understandings, as well as to promote the construction of more complex and meaningful under- standings. METHOD The study took place in a small, private middle school in eastern Canada, from No- vember 1994 to March 1995. I acted as both researcher and teacher in a multigraded class of 10 students (one Grade 5, two Grade 6, and seven Grade 7 children; four of whom were girls). The class met 2 days a week, for the most part, over a period of 9 weeks (from January to March), for a total of 16 class meetings of 45 min each. The students were organized into three groups. Two of the groups (one of three and one of four students) had two girls each, whereas the third group comprised three boys. The pseudonyms used in this article were assigned according to the grade level (i.e., the name starting with "E" corresponds to Grade 5, those with "F" correspond to Grade 6, and those starting with "G" correspond to Grade 7). The intent of the instructional unit was to have students engage in the process of doing science, including arguing and negotiating their knowledge claims, while</page><page sequence="11">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 457 working towards developing understandings of the concepts involved in floating (i.e., density, pressure, and buoyancy). Part of the first day of the unit was devoted to discussing the nature of science and how scientists worked. The ideas discussed included 1. Negotiate: discuss, argue. 2. Organize: experiments, observations, data, notes. 3. Explanations: of how something works, produce several different explana- tions, narrow down to the one that fits with the evidence from your experi- ments. 4. Justify: support explanations with experimental evidence. 5. Predict. 6. Ask questions. 7. Experiment: design you own experiments, how could your experiment get more accurate results? could you redesign your experiment and make it better? 8. Clarity. 9. Examples. 10. Cooperate. Although the particular argument that arose was not expected, the notion that stu- dents would engage in arguments about their knowledge claims at some point was anticipated and encouraged. The unit on floating was set-up with the goal of each group designing a boat to meet specific criteria. A simulated letter from the Minister of Tourism and Culture provided the details for each group's submission of a proposal for a boat to carry tourists to various natural history sites around the province. The first class meeting was devoted to allowing each group an opportunity to explore the building of a model boat out of aluminum foil. Classes 2 through 9 were focused on teacher-designed investigations. During Classes 10 through 15 the groups worked on their boat designs. Class 16 was used for a self-evaluation activity and a review of the application of a specific concept (how density can be used to predict the water level oftheir boats). The investigations during Classes 2 through9 are outlined next: 1. Class 2: Predicted and tested which objects float (11 blocks of wood, from ebony to balsa; a variety of objects made of different metals, including steel, aluminum, lead, brass, and copper; and a variety of other objects, including a glass ball, bees wax, paraffin, cork, ping pong ball, graphite, and plastic). Calculated density of selected items from the aforementioned objects. 2. Class 3: Investigated the effect of changing the density of the medium on floating and sinking. How can you make ebony float? How can you make rosewood sink?</page><page sequence="12">458 BLOOM 3. Class 4: Investigated "Squidy" and another type of Cartesian diver. 4. Class 5: Built a boat and predicted how much weight it can carry (carrying capacity), based on the density of the object (boat). 5. Class 6: Continued developing predictions of the carrying capacity of their boats. 6. Class 7: Finished the carrying capacity activity with a test of their predic- tions. Investigated water pressure (predicting and testing water flow from 2-liter soft drink bottle with two holes in it-one near the bottom and one near the top). Began developing manometer predictions of water pressure at different depths. 7. Class 8: Reviewed carrying capacity activity. Carried out manometer activity. 8. Class 9: Investigated and measured buoyant force using hook scales and weights. In preparation for this unit, a detailed concept map on "floating" was con- structed as a planning tool. The concept map served as a means for identifying the key concepts to be learned and for the development of investigative activi- ties. However, two ideas that arose during the argument, which are examined in this article, are not addressed in the concept map: (a) compressibility of waterl and (b) molecular explanations of density. The compressibility issue was neither expected nor considered, and the molecular was not addressed because of the grade level (an underestimation on my part). The pattern of interaction normally found in classrooms, the triadic sequence (i.e., IRE-teacher Initiation, student Response, teacher Evaluation) as discussed by Lemke (1990) and Cazden (1988), is used rarely throughout the entire five-class argument. Instead, the typical pattern ofmy interaction, as the teacher, involved pos- ing different ways of looking at particular problems or topics, which often chal- lenged the particular line of thinking of the students. Other patterns of interaction involve focusing or refocusing the discussion on defining or clarifying particular terms, concepts, or ideas. My role tended to be one of promoting the argument and discussion, while exerting little or no authoritarian control (i.e., neither as knowl- edge authority nor as disciplinary authority). Data Collection Procedures The small class size provided an ideal opportunity to monitor a majority of class- room talk. At the start of each class an audiocassette recorder was placed on each The notion of the compressibility of water became an issue among the students. The teacher's goals included encouraging students to debate conceptual issues, and therefore did not interject any state- ments about whether this statement was correct or not. Water is generally considered not to be compress- ible. However, the density of water increases with decreasing temperature to 40 C, at which point the density decreases until the water freezes.</page><page sequence="13">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 459 group's table. A video camcorder was placed centrally in the room, so that it could be moved easily to capture portions of each group's discussions or to capture inter- group arguments. The combined use of these four recording devices allowed al- most all of the classroom discourse to be captured. The only exceptions occurred with voices being drowned out by extraneous noise, by students talking over each other, or, in one case, by a student turning off the microphone part way through the class. All audiotapes were transcribed within a few weeks of the class session. The videotapes were used to fill in details of missed conversations and actions of the students (videotape technical difficulties occurred during three classes: for one class there was no video at all, for another there was no sound, and for the last there was intermittent recording). Within a couple of hours of the end of each class, I recorded field notes prompted by a review the videotape for that day's class. As other thoughts arose in the time between classes, additional field notes were recorded. In addition, each group's work folder was photocopied and kept on record. Additional data on the students' conceptual understandings were collected during pre- and post-unit interviews. The post-unit interviews, utilized in this study, included questions asking students to explain floating, density, pressure, and buoyancy. One set of tasks about density presented students with two draw- ings: (a) one that required an (algorithmic) understanding of the formula for den- sity, by showing a block of wood with its dimensions and weight (mass) and (b) one that required a conceptual understanding of density, by showing a block of wood floating with exactly 5 cm above and below the water. The pre-unit interviews were conducted in December, prior to the January unit. The post-unit interviews were collected during the second week after the conclusion of the unit. All interviews were audio and videotaped, then tran- scribed. Data Analysis The analysis of the data focused on two major areas: (a) the overall structure and processes of the argument as an emergent phenomenon and (b) the students' spe- cific conceptual understandings of density and related phenomena. The first area (i.e., structure and process) presents a holistic view of the entire event (i.e., the ar- gument). The second area focuses in on the conceptual substance that initiated and maintained the argument. Both ofthese areas involved complex analytical issues in identifying, representing, and verifying the data. As a result, the approach to ana- lyzing the data utilized aspects of several theoretical or paradigmatic perspectives generally associated with qualitative research. The major approach taken relates to the study's emphasis on chaos and com- plexity. As described by Patton (1990), analysis based on chaos and complexity</page><page sequence="14">460 BLOOM theories focuses on exposing the underlying order in seemingly disorderly phe- nomena. As opposed to how chaos and complexity theories are used in science with a heavy emphasis on mathematical modeling, the use of these theories in the social sciences is based on the metaphors and assumptions suggested by chaos and complexity. Such metaphors and assumptions include 1. Nonlinearity of processes. 2. Small events can have critical effects. 3. Emergent patterns arise from or are embedded in seemingly chaotic situa- tions or systems. 4. The simplicity of a system can lead to complex outcomes. 5. Dynamic systems and phenomena require nonstatic descriptive ap- proaches. 6. Chaotic systems are unpredictable at various levels of specificity. In this study, the analytical goals involved identifying and describing 1. The dynamics of the processes underlying the argument. 2. The emergent patterns of organization. 3. The emergent patterns of conceptual understandings that initiated and maintained the argument. Because chaos and complexity are fairly new to the social sciences, specific analytical strategies have not been established (Patton, 1990). Therefore, strate- gies from other paradigms and theoretical approaches have been modified and utilized in this study. Grounded theory with its emphasis on emergent patterns (i.e., theory) provides two useful strategies: constant comparison and thick de- scriptions (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1994). In this study, emergent patterns in the stu- dents' discourse and conceptual understandings were compared back to the transcripts, field notes, and videotapes, as well as post-interview data for the re- construction of the underlying meanings of the students' conceptual understand- ings. The thick descriptions, in this study, included the verbatim transcripts of all of the classroom dialogue, interview transcripts, and the researcher's field notes and post-teaching unit modeling and diagrammatic representations. In con- trast to much of Strauss and Corbin's descriptions of grounded theory methodol- ogy in terms of tracing the effects of specific social concepts within a group, the approach in this study traced the development and divergence of specific con- ceptual understandings, as well as the overall patterns of the argument and the effects of various factors (e.g., counterarguments, contradictory evidence, etc.) on the argument's organization and structure. The other major contributing analytical framework involved discourse analy- sis, as described by Lemke (1990). Such analysis was used to identify and describe</page><page sequence="15">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 461 specific thematic patterns and conceptual understandings. However, as opposed to Lemke's analysis at the level of a phrase or sentence, the strategy in this study looked at the whole dialogue, as well as post-unit interviews, for clues to the mean- ings underlying student's particular claims. As diagrammatic representations were developed, they were compared back to the dialogue and interview data. The data analysis and model development (Figure 1) were completed by the re- searcher. As suggested in the previous commentary, the data analysis went through many iterations as new insights from more specific analyses of the argu- ment dynamics and conceptual understandings arose. Challenges arising from the researcher's questions about the validity of particular interpretations always led to reassessments and refinements of specific claims and to modifications in the model. In one particular instance, a manuscript reviewer's challenge to one partic- ular interpretation led to a more thorough re-analysis of the data around that inter- pretation, as well as all related interpretations. if water can be expanded, it can be compressed compressing water with pressure changes density reduce volume -- weight stays , the same but density increases amount of water can affect whether ebony floats End of Argument (increased complexity and diversity of ideas; higher levels of organization) water cannot be compressed size of container does not change density Bifurcation Point N Feedback Loop (argument--counter argument) density is the "closeness" of molecules Beginning of Argument Attractor (ebony sinks) FIGURE 1 A representation of the argument's emergent structure based on elements from chaos theory (i.e., the argument as a self-maintaining dissipative structure).</page><page sequence="16">462 BLOOM Transcript Conventions The transcript conventions used in the excerpts throughout this article are described next. Following Bakhtin's (1986) assertion that the most meaningful unit of speech is an utterance, which is a "complete speech act" (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 264), the tran- script line numbers precede complete utterances, rather than lines of text as they fit on a page. * Line numbering, such as 2.123-The first number indicates the class ses- sion (Class 2 in the example).

Group 1 consisted of George, Gina, Eric, and Gail. Group 2 consisted of Greg, Frank, and Fred. Group 3 consisted of Grace, Gloria, and Graham. Students were assigned to groups on the basis of infor- mation I collected from other teachers in the school. Specifically, I spread particu- lar strengths among the groups (e.g., mathematical ability, writing and reading abil- ity, and leadership). Information on their previous school experiences was limited. The school was in its second year of operation, so the teachers had little direct expe- rience of the students' histories. However, from student interviews none of the stu- dents expressed an interest in science in terms of career aspirations. As much as could be ascertained, the students had not studied density or buoyancy previously, although I assume that some ofthem had experienced the typical "floating and sink- ing" activities earlier in elementary school. Most students were generally attentive and engaged in discussions on the topic. However, the degree of involvement in on-task discourse varied among the stu- dents. The most vocal students were Gina and Greg. Other teachers in the school</page><page sequence="17">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 463 identified both of these students as displaying strong leadership skills, as well as demonstrating strengths in math and language. Both Gina and Greg enjoyed en- gaging in arguments and discussions. Gina, however, sought confirmation (that her ideas were correct and everybody else's were wrong) from the teacher on sev- eral occasions. If she did not receive this confirmation, she tended to withdraw temporarily from participating in class discussions and activities. Greg seemed to enjoy arguing and playing with ideas without any particular need for confirmation. All but one (i.e., Grace) of the other students, whose participation in the argument varied, tended to be attentive to the argument content, while proceeding to work on inquiry activities assigned for the particular class session. RESULTS The presentation and discussion of the results begins with an examination of the general characteristics of the argument, including a description of the activities and initial talk that led up to the argument, the amount of teacher and student talk, and the nature ofteacher talk. Within the sequence ofthe argument, descriptions ofrele- vant classroom activities are included to provide a temporal and substantive con- text for understanding the students' discourse. The second subsection will examine in greater detail the emergent organization and processes from the perspective of chaos and complexity theories, as well as the conceptual understandings that acted as the grounding for the argument, the first indications of the development of con- flicting understandings, and the development of these understandings throughout the argument. The last subsection delves into the students' emergent understand- ings in greater depth. The Argument The intent of this subsection is to provide a description of the instructional con- text that led up to the argument, as well as an overview of the general character- istics of the argument. This overview includes analyses of the frequency and nature of the classroom talk. Such a background provides a sense of the class- room environment that allowed for the development and continued generation of the argument, as well as for the emergence of more complex conceptual content. On the first day of class, the students were excited about designing their own boats. The students displayed a lot of enthusiasm as they worked on an initial boat design. All three groups spent considerable time discussing their designs. All of the groups considered solutions to the problem of stability of their boat in heavy seas, and, to a lesser extent, solutions to the problem of carrying capacity. One</page><page sequence="18">464 BLOOM group (Group 3) spent nearly the entire period discussing and diagramming spe- cific design characteristics for their boat. The second class started off with the task of predicting and then testing which of a variety of objects would float (a list of these objects appears in the Method sec- tion). Most of their predictions were correct, except for the piece of ebony, which sank. During the discussion, the students were asked why they thought the ebony sank. Gina suggested that ebony had more oil in it. Other students suggested that ebony was "a heavy wood," "dense," or "petrified." The teacher asked, "what if I put [in the water] a great big piece of one of these other pieces of wood that is much heavier than that little piece?" Several students responded that it would still float, whereas others continued to suggest that the reason ebony sank was because it was a denser wood. During the discussion that ensued, the argument, which was to re- appear in upcoming classes, began after one student, Gina, said that the reason eb- ony sank was that "it's a denser wood" than water and another student, Greg, suggested that "if you scaled up the big piece of wood, then you have to scale up the water too." Throughout the argument, student talk was significantly greater than teacher talk. Table 1 shows this dominance of student talk, which ranged from 68% in the first class to 89% in the last class. This ratio of teacher to student talk is just about the inverse of the typical ratio of teacher classroom talk (Edwards &amp; Mercer, 1987). Although the argument began with and was dominated by two students (Gina and Greg), more students became involved as the argument extended over the five class sessions. The fact that the argument extended over multiple class ses- sions is in itself significant. The students were not just going through the motions TABLE 1 Percentage of Classroom Talk During Period of Density Argument (Calculated by Number of Words Spoken) Class 2 (%) Class 3 (%) Class 4 (%) Class 5 (%) Class 6 (%) Eric 3 4 5 Frank 5 5 5 18 Fred 5 6 4 5 Gail 2 3 George 2 2 Gina 26 23 35 32 30 Gloria 3 3 Grace 1 Graham 1 4 1 15 Greg 13 23 36 21 20 Unknown 15 2 0.5 1 Teacher 32 25 29 24 11 Total student 68 75 71 76 89</page><page sequence="19">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 465 of participating in class; they were seriously involved. This engagement drew other students into the argument, especially by Class 5. In addition, students other than Greg and Gina who participated in Classes 5 and 6, such as Frank and Gra- ham, made significant and meaningful contributions. Such participation suggests that students were paying attention to the developing argument (as noted by words of agreement or disagreement) during the first few class sessions, even though they were not adding significant information. The extent and dynamics of this student-centered argument brings to light the complexity of children's thinking and understandings. The most common compo- nents of the students' arguments consisted of (a) using examples derived from their personal experiences, and occasionally from their prior school-type knowl- edge, in supporting particular claims or as contradictory rebuttals; (b) organizing statements in condition-result and "if... then" sequences, but with some degree of variation in the completion of the ideas contained in specific arguments; and (c) re- jecting or accepting claims with little or no elaboration. When the teacher did engage in the discourse, the intent was most often to (a) ask students to clarify statements, (b) justify claims, and (c) ask questions to ex- tend or elaborate on the argument. Table 2 provides a summary of my (teacher) questioning during the argument. In general, the percent of teacher questioning decreased over the term of the argument. During Class 2, most of the questions were more typical of teacher instruction, focusing on content recall and confir- mation. However, from the second argument session, the percentage of argu- ment facilitating and conceptual extension questions increased. Such a pattern in conjunction with an overall decrease in teacher talk (see Table 1) indicates a de- crease in my (teacher) control over the instructional agenda, and an increase in my facilitation of the -argument.

As this model is developed, specific instances from the transcripts will be used to characterize each aspect of the model (e.g., attractors, bifurcation points, etc.). The implications of how such a model can help teachers facilitate such dialogue and arguments (i.e., the last part of the first research question) will be addressed in the discussion section. In looking at the overall structure of argument from the perspective of cyber- netics and chaos theory, we see a coherent process that maintains its overall structure and increases in complexity as it proceeds. Figure 1 was developed to represent an overall "picture" of the dynamics. Initial diagrams, extending from Lemke's (1990) specific thematic pattern analysis to a "meta-view" of concep- tual themes, were developed to show the linking and divergence of conceptual themes. Additional facets of the diagram were added to show the interactions among the players, such as, counterarguments as cybernetic loops. The central focus of the argument involves the initial event of the block of ebony sinking. This event acts as the "attractor" around which the entire argument revolves. However, additional lines of the argument branch off as the argument proceeds (many smaller branches occur throughout the argument; only the major branches are indicated in the figure). As the argument continued, one student's claims were countered by another's. These counter arguments were, in turn, met with responses, which often introduced new information to support the original claim. Such a dynamic is shown as a cybernetic feedback loop. Such looping processes lead to an increase in complexity of the argument by initiating a branching off of additional conceptual lines of thought in response to counterarguments. These branches occur at "bifurcation points," which are new (secondary) "attractors." In the context of this classroom argument, the attractors (including bifurca- tion points) are events or statements that do not correspond with previously held concepts, theories, or beliefs. The initial attractor, which was the event of ebony sinking, did not fit with the students' commonly held notion that wood floats. However, this event in itself may not have been enough to start the argument. As in nuclear reactions, you need a critical mass to carry out a sustained reaction. This critical mass was achieved when Greg introduced the notion that the amount of water can affect whether ebony floats: "if you scaled up the big piece of wood, then you have to scale up the water, too.... So, then it would float." In response, I (the teacher) said, "but, even if we took one out into the lake, that lit- tle piece, and put it in the lake." This statement was followed by a number of supportive comments from students and a contradictory claim by Greg. At this point, the entire process was set in motion.</page><page sequence="21">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 467 As the argument proceeded, Gina introduced the notion that density has to do with how closely packed the molecules are: "It means the amount of mole- cules that are in the thing. Like the molecules are closer together and they com- press!" After some discussion, Greg's side of the argument (left side of Figure 1) agreed with the molecular explanation of density, even though Gina contin- ued to use this notion to counter opposing claims about how ebony could be made to float. In addition, Gina's introduction of the notion of "compression" at this early point in the argument is interesting in that the same notion arises as a major bifurcation point and line of argument in support of Greg's claim that ebony "could" float. Here, the feedback loops associated with the molecular explanation of density versus the amount of water affecting whether ebony floats not only serve as a point-counterpoint process, but also introduce infor- mation from one side of the argument into the substance of the other side. In ad- dition, we can see how such feedback loops by serving as point-counterpoint processes (a) push participants to rethink their positions, (b) introduce infor- mation from one side of the argument to the other, and (c) increase the concep- tual complexity. The next major bifurcation point occurs during the same class session (i.e., day 2 of unit and day 1 of argument). The dialogue just preceding this point con- cerned the molecular explanation. Then, Greg stated that, "if you took all this water and put it in a container smaller, it would still weigh the same, but it would have a different density, because the volume is smaller." Although this claim is an elaboration on the previous point about increasing the amount of water for eb- ony to float, the notion of weight remaining constant provides a slight deviation in the line of thinking. Greg's statement not only provides a substantive elabora- tion on the existing theme, but also provides a supposition that underlies the ar- gument through to the end. As the argument continues, Gina's side of the argument bifurcates in response to the size of container changing density issue. Shortly afterward, Greg's side of the argument bifurcates in contending that pressure will compress water and thereby change the density: 5.309 Greg How can density be the same, if you have a whole sea? 5.310 UV Yeah. 5.311 Greg Okay, if you have ... 5.312 Gail The sea has salt water in it. [stands up] 5.313 Tchr: Wait, okay... 5.314 Greg Okay a fresh water sea like in a... 5.315 Gina Fresh water lake. 5.316 Fred That has mud in it. 5.317 Greg And then you put that in a tiny little centimeter cube ... 5.318 Gina You can'tput that [claps while still standing] in a tiny lit- tle ...</page><page sequence="22">468 BLOOM 5.319 Greg Yes, if you compacted it, there would be a lot ... 5.320 Frank You can compress it. 5.321 Gina You can't compress water! [with raised voice] 5.322 George You can so. You can compress water. 5.333 Gina If you took a big tall container and a big thin container [as she made drawings of these containers on the board], the density doesn't change. The water level on here is just higher than it is over here. If you have the same size thing, and a huge thing over here...

Ifyou had a five-ton piece of wood and a five-ton piece of rock, which would float? Now ... you have to think that the wood would float be- cause it has a lesser density than the five-ton rock. So that's how it works. [with ample sarcasm:] I hope you can figure that out some day in your life. 5.353 Greg You can compress it. 5.354 Gina No! I can't pour a full thing of this into a small thing of t [demonstrating with two different size containers] 5.355 Gloria [Laughs.] 5.356 Eric Yeah, I know, but if you had a lot of pressure, you can ...

[loudly] In the middle of this transcript excerpt, Greg is continuing to argue that the density of water changes in different size containers. In lines 5.319 and 5.320, the notion that water can be compressed is introduced (bifurcation point). Throughout the middle part of this excerpt, the students, in the fashion of feedback loops, argue back and forth about whether water can be compressed. Then, in line 5.356, Eric in- troduces the notion that with a lot of pressure water can be compressed (bifurcation point). Each bifurcation point occurs after the conceptual development of the argu- ment reaches a point where a new concept is needed (and introduced) to support or challenge the previously developed ideas. In the previous excerpt, Gina contends that water cannot be compressed. This bifurcation point on her side of the argument is in response and a challenge to Greg's side. Finally, the last major bifurcation point occurs on Greg's side, when Frank and others contend that if water can be "stretched apart" then it can be "compressed": 6.105 Greg Right. I know how you can put pressure on water, Gina. And I have this person to back me up. You know, you know those things that you drink where you use a pump and you get a little rocket? 6.106 Fred Yeah. 6.107 Greg And you pump it up and then it shoots into the air? 6.108 Fred Yeah. 6.109 Greg Well, that you're putting pressure on the water because you're pumping air into this little container. 6.110 Gina No, but, but it's not compacted. The thing is ... 6.111 Graham Yes it is, Gina. 6.112 Greg Yes it is. 6.113 Gina No. What's going on is it's ... so it has to put all that pres- sure that you're giving it up into the rocket. 6.114 Tchr Wait, wait a second. Let ... Okay. Let Graham ... 6.114 Graham Yes. But, that still, you're, this is like ... You're still ... You still put pressure inside the container. [standing and demonstrating with a gallon milk container] 6.117 Gina You're still putting pressure on it. 6.118 Greg Exactly. 6.119 Gina But the molecules won't compact ... 6.120 Graham Yes they will. 6.121 Gina 'Cause they have to shoot out. [stated emphatically, while standing and demonstrating with her arm how wa- ter shoots out]</page><page sequence="24">470 BLOOM 6.122 Graham Yes. But, after, after ... a certain amount of t... 6.124 Frank Yeah, and some air. But, it's because, it's because there, when the rocket ... if it was compressing against the wa- ter, the only thing that would come out was air. And when you shoot the rocket, water comes out. So it must be com- pressed. 6.136 Frank But, air, but, water can be stretched apart, put into a big- ger volume. 6.137 Gina It's not stretched apart. It just fills up the bottom. 6.140 Frank No. But when it's steamed. [emphatically] 6.141 Gina What it can't do, what it can't do. Okay. All right. 6.142 Graham Yeah, steam, steam, damn it, steam. [emphatically] 6.144 Frank If something can decompressurize or whatever you can call it, it can probably be compacted. 6.145 Graham Same with evaporation. Evaporation. It's just ... 6.146 Frank Cause when it's steamed, it's just barely anything. Looking at the argument in its entirety, the overall pattern is one of generating and maintaining itself. In other words, the cyclical patterns (e.g., feedback loops) of discourse tend to feed information from one loop to the next in a spiral pattern. In fact, several spirals related to each bifurcation point thread their way through the temporal sequence of events, where one loop feeds into another loop further along the sequence, such as where "compression" is introduced and is brought up again in a later feedback loop. In addition, the symmetrical pattern (i.e., where both sides are vying for con- trol or, in this case, vying for the correct explanation) of relationship among the participants provides a fundamental characteristic for stimulating a conflict (i.e., argument) from which divergent lines of thought emerge and grow in complex- ity. There is, of course, another critical element to the initial generation and con- tinued maintenance of the argument: Student engagement arises from taking the content of the argument seriously. In other words, students must feel a sense of ownership over the content and process of the argument. Such ownership is evi- dent in the impassioned dialogue during Classes 5 and 6 (as noted in the tran- script segments: lines 5.318, 5.321, 5.333-5.336, 5.343, 5.354, 5.356, 5.358, 6.121, 6.140, 6.142). The production process, which connects the pattern with the structure, is funda- mentally the students' cognition. Their inferring, generating supportive and con- tradictory examples, dismissing others' claims, explaining, providing counter arguments, and so forth are the specific processes. These processes in turn mani- fest as the cyclical and spiraling cybernetic feedback loops. In terms of the structure (emphasis added to highlight key terms), two aspects or levels of structure are evident. The first level involves the actual components</page><page sequence="25">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 471 of the argument: the conceptual content. The structure and organization of the ideas generated change as the argument proceeds. In other words, the structure and organization is emergent. This notion of emergence is important in under- standing the nature of chaotic systems. The specific conceptual outcome of such an argument cannot be predicted, because of the inherent variation in the ideas generated and in the production processes that manifest. However, such varia- tion provides for the possibility of the emergent development of increasingly complex conceptual understandings. At a more holistic level, the structure of the argument as a whole is quite sim- ilar to a dissipative structure. As discussed previously, dissipative structures op- erate far from equilibrium and are nonlinear. The oppositional nature of any argument is an indication of being far from equilibrium. At the same time, the argument, in this article, does not follow a linear path. In fact, the model de- picted in Figure 1 looks much like a tornado, which is a classic example of a dissipative structure. The "production processes" that generate the basic "pat- terns" serve to continually reinforce and perpetuate the overall structure of the argument. In other words, the students' cognition as expressed in the dialogue manifests as circular feedback loops and as spiral patterns that "carry" ideas and concepts forward. The result is the nonlinear, self-maintaining argument that generates increasingly complex conceptualizations. Emergent Understandings and Underlying Principles The discussion in the previous section provides a skeletal outline of the major elements of the argument from the perspective of chaos theory, as well as an overview of the major emergent understandings that run through the argument (see Figure 1). In the following section, we will explore the specific understand- ings for each side of the argument, the conceptual understandings involved, and the underlying principles or interpretive frameworks (i.e., phenomenological primitive and cognitive model) that influenced the emergent understandings. In this discussion, rather than follow the back and forth dialogue, specific lines of thinking will be extracted and examined in detail (see the Appendix for the en- tire transcript). The first line of thinking will involve Greg's side of the argu- ment (referred to as the "pressure-volume problem"). The next will be the "molecular problem," which was initiated by Gina (note that the entire class agreed with and adopted this explanation of density, even though most students disagreed with Gina's dismissal of the pressure-volume explanation). Pressure-volume principles or p-prims. In this section, the conceptual development of Greg's side of the argument will be analyzed in greater detail. Greg's statement contains the word scale:</page><page sequence="26">472 BLOOM 2.601 Greg if you scaled up the big piece of wood, then you have to scale up the water too. You have to make the water ... 2.603 Greg So, then it would float. This notion of proportionality, or "scale," is the central component of the stu- dents' emergent understandings. The contention is that the ability for a piece of wood to float is based on the ratio of the size of the block of wood to the size of the body of water. This sequence is the first indication of the conceptual claim made by Greg, which serves as the basis for the beginning of the argument. At this point, the claim states that the density of the same quantity of water changes when the size of the container holding the water changes. Later, Greg reiterates his claim, but the size of the container is replaced with volume: 2.652 Greg If you took all this... if you took all this water and put it in a container mall, it would still weigh the same, but it would have a different density, because the volume is ... uh ... smaller. In class 3, Greg continues his argument that ebony could float: 3.14 Greg The ebony possibly could float if there was the actual amount of ebony in a larger volume, 'cause it wouldn't be as dense. There is a problem in interpreting this statement, because of the use of a vague word: it. Does it refer to ebony or to water? If it refers to ebony, the claim would be that ebony could float if the block of ebony was expanded to fill a larger vol- ume thereby reducing its density. From a scientific perspective, this claim is ac- curate. Keeping the mass constant and expanding the volume reduces density. If it refers to water, the claim is confusing. If the block of ebony was placed in a larger volume of water and the water (it) was not as dense, the ebony would still sink. At this point, we might think that Greg is referring to the prior meaning of it, which makes more sense scientifically. However, we might want to consider that in the heat of the moment the use of particular words may not reflect what was intended. For instance, Greg may have intended the following: the block of ebony could float, if the block was placed in a larger volume of water, because the water would be denser. In this case, Greg would be asserting that larger vol- umes of water are denser than smaller volumes. Such a claim is consistent with the statement in line 2.652. In line 3.019, Greg states that density relates to how compacted the substance (i.e., molecules) is 3.19 Greg: Well, the theory of volume is that objects are as dense as they are compacted, so ...</page><page sequence="27">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 473 This statement supports the scientific interpretation of line 3.014. This same inter- pretation is again supported in line 3.050: 3.50 Greg: Also, the smallest thing cud float, if it was in a larger volume, because it was the same small thing... However, in line 3.055, Greg's states that the density of ebony cannot be changed, but the density of water can be changed by putting the water in differ- ent size containers: 3.055 Greg: Unfortunately the theory of relativity and physics, uh, will not let us change the density of the ebony. However, we cu change the density of the water, by putting it in smaller or bigger containers. If this statement is reflective of his intent in line 3.014, then the interpretation is that the it in that line refers to "water," and what he meant was that the water ("it") would be "denser" and not "wouldn't be as dense." With the claim made in lines 2.652 and 3.055, that the density ofwater changes in different size containers, the consistency of the emergent pattern of understandings appears to support the "it = water" and "water is denser" interpretation of line 3.014. In Class 5, a key point occurs when the example of the "sea" is introduced to sup- port the idea ofproportionality between volume and density. From this point, the no- tion of pressure becomes a critical factor in the argument. 5.296 Greg No, what we said is ... density ... density changes in a smaller volume [persuasive emphasis on "changes" and "smaller volume"] 5.309 Greg How can density be the same, if you have a whole sea? 5.317 Greg And then you put that in a tiny little centimeter cube .. 5.319 Greg Yes, if you compacted it, there would be a lot ... 5.320 Frank You can compress it. 5.322 George You can so. You can compress water. 5.325 Greg The density will change. 5.327 Greg That's just an example. The pressure will change ... 6.105 Greg Right. I know how you can put pressure on water, Gina. And I have this person to back me up. You know, you know those things that you drink where you use a pump and you get a little rocket? 6.107 Greg And you pump it up and then it shoots into the air? 6.109 Greg Well, that you're putting pressure on the water because you're pumping air into this little container.</page><page sequence="28">474 BLOOM 6.116 Graham But, you're still putting the pressure inside of it. You still have it in there. 6.120 Graham Yes they [molecules] will [compact]. 6.124 Frank Yeah, and some air. But, it's because, it's because there, when the rocket ... if it was compressing against the wa- ter, the only thing that would come out was air. And when you shoot the rocket, water comes out. So it must be com- pressed. Four underlying principles or interpretive frameworks evident at this juncture are the notions (i.e., p-prims) of (a) pressure affects density, (b) directionality of pressure, (c) external forces affect pressure, and (d) surface area affects the de- gree to which external forces affect pressure. These four notions involve differ- ent levels of analytical inference. The first notion, pressure affects density, is based on a low-level inference and is fairly obvious in the transcripts (e.g., line 5.327). Although the second and third notions are less obvious in the transcripts, Greg's response in the post-unit interview suggests such directionality to pres- sure, as well as external forces affecting pressure: JB: Okay. yeah, what does pressure have to do with floating? Greg: Um ... well, the pressure ... um ... I don't ... let me see. I guess it's the pressure on the object, from ... I think, because buoyancy, like the force of buoyancy, is pushing up on it from the water and gravity is pressing down, so there's sort of pressure on the block. The notions of directionality of and external forces affecting pressure also are evi- dent in lines 6.105 to 6.124, where the example used in these lines is one of a rocket, in which a pump is used to increase the pressure inside. Although the air is being compressed, the students contend that the water is being compressed. The key point in this example is the image of a pump to increase the pressure. Our everyday expe- riences with the use of the term pressure suggest directionality to pressure: We press down on a pump, we push down to apply pressure to stop a cut from bleeding, and so forth. Such notions are indicative of diSessa's (1993)p-prims (i.e., based on everyday experiences, have a sense of being obvious, etc.). In addition, certain phrases and terms (such as,pressure on the object, compacted, etc.) point to the oc- currence of what can be called a context marker or a pointer to an underlying princi- ple (such markers or pointers have been discussed by G. Bateson [1979], J. W. Bloom [1990, 1992a], J. Bruner [1986], and J. L. Lemke [April 19, 1995, personal communication, American Educational Research Association annual meeting, San Francisco]). Context, as used here, refers to a cognitive or epistemic domain, in which a particular term marks or points to a greater context of meaning (in this case, a specific p-prim or interpretive framework).</page><page sequence="29">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 475 A higher level of inference is involved in contending with the fourth notion or p-prim: "Surface area affects the degree to which external forces affect pressure." Although Greg's response in the interview indicates that external forces affect pressure, the connection between (a) forces and pressure and (b) water and surface area are not indicated. In fact, his response shows how opposing forces put pres- sure on the block of wood. This interview segment suggests that such opposing forces would increase the density of the block of ebony. Of course, such a claim does not support the contention that ebony could float. However, in the post-unit interview, when attempting to solve a problem (i.e., what is the density of a block of wood, which is 5 cm above and below the surface of the water?), he suggests that the block of wood's presence in the water changes the density of the water (in- terviewer's "okays" and "ums" have been omitted): Greg: Um ... so since the density of the water is one... Greg: then is it ... that it's ... I think it's called water displacement? I'm not exactly sure. Greg: Um ... I'm not sure ... what the density is. I think ... it just .. Well, since the density changes ... let me see ... the water level would rise ... JB: This block's just sort of floating freely ... Greg: Yeah. JB: ... in the water. Greg: It's sort of weird though, because it'd still have the same amount of molecules, but it ... and it's still the same size, but the density changes. I'm not sure how though. JB: What do you mean ... the density of the block changes? Greg: Uh ... yeah. JB: Or the density of ... Greg: Um ... Oh no, wait. It displaces the ... oh, yeah ... it displaces the density of the water, Greg: And so ... it would be, like, say, twenty by twenty by twenty, or whatever ... Greg: So ... but it displaces because it fills up ... it takes out half... it takes out five centimeters of space ... Greg: ... from the water. So the molecules have to move, and they ... it gets higher... Greg: ... so the molecules get further awa ... Greg: ... nd that changes density of the water... from one to, um, higher. In this interview segment, Greg suggests that the presence of the block of wood in the water raises the density of water. Although the logic of his argu-</page><page sequence="30">476 BLOOM ment is somewhat confusing, he does indicate that the density of water can be changed. The same notion is evident at numerous points in the transcript of the argument. However, in line 3.50, where he states "also, the smallest thing could float, if it was in a larger volume, because it was the same small thing..." and in line 5.309, where he asks, "How can density be the same, if you have a whole sea?" he suggests that ebony could float if put in a larger body of water. So, we have two notions: (a) The block of wood changes the density of water and (b) larger bodies of water have different densities. The underlying principle for this second notion is more problematic. Although very tenuous, this notion may sug- gest that the downward direction of gravity (external force) pushes down on the water. The greater the surface area of the water (larger volume) the greater the effect of gravity on increasing pressure downward. Thus, an increase in pressure will compress or "compact" the water and increase its density. These three, possibly four, principles act as interpretive frameworks (Bloom, 1992a) or p-prims (diSessa, 1993), which guide the thinking of the students. Such p-prims act as consistent explanatory mechanisms. Such mechanisms pro- vided the consistency in the development and emergence of the argument, as well as in helping to self-maintain the chaotic system (e.g., the argument as a dissipative structure). Molecular model. The molecular explanation of density was first suggested by Gina in line 2.617: 2.617 Gina: [Interrupting Frank.] It means the amount of molecules that are in the ... thing. Like the molecules are closer together and they .o., 2.621 UV: It's put together tighter... it's like ... squeezed 2.624 Gina: There's more molecules per ... 2.625 UV: ... per s- 2.626 Gina: ... centimeter. 2.627 UV: ... per square millimeter. This claim suggests that the number and proximity of molecules in a particular substance determine density. Although what is described in lines 2.624 to 2.627 is the number of molecules in a particular "area," the intended claim appears to suggest the number of molecules per unit volume, which is confirmed in a state- ment from Class 3: 3.67 Gina: No ... the thickening molecules. The amount of molecules per square ... the volume.</page><page sequence="31">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 477 Shortly after the explanation of density, Gina expresses some uncertainty about the consistency of the number of molecules in water: 2.644 Gina: Does all water have the same amount of molecules in it? Although this question did not evoke any discussion, it points to a level of uncer- tainty in Gina's understanding of molecules and density. This uncertainty arises again later in the argument: 3.71 Gina: Like if you compared, like if you compared one piece of eb- ony to one piece of pine that were the same size ... 3.73 Gina: And you put them on a scale, that ebony might weigh more, and you would know that the molecules are denser in the ebony. 3.75 Gina: But I don't know how they could find out how muh denser, like how many molecules ... 3.82 Gina: Yeah, but that doesn't show how many molecules there is, because... 3.87 Gina: Wait, Greg, Greg. If the pine ... it has the same measure- ments, it'll seem like it has the same amount of molecules, so that wouldn't work. In lines 3.71 and 3.73, Gina works through a problem to support her molecular ex- planation of density. By comparing equal sized blocks of pine and ebony, the weight of a block of ebony would be greater than the block of pine, therefore sug- gesting that the molecules are denser or more compacted in the ebony. In line 3.75, she expresses her uncertainty as to how such a measurement could determine the number of molecules. Again, in line 3.87, she runs into another point of confusion when she tries to determine molecular density by the size of the blocks. By using both weight and size (volume), she runs into difficulty in trying to figure out a way of determining the number of molecules in a substance. The problem Gina encounters relates to her model of molecules, which appears to be shared among all of the students who continue to adopt a molecular explana- tion (some have the added notion of the volume-pressure explanation). This mo- lecular model is based on an interpretive framework of uniformity of molecules. The proportionality of weight to number of molecules (line 3.73) and the propor- tionality of volume to the number of molecules (line 3.87) suggest that molecules are uniform in weight and size across substances (in the excerpts, these two sub- stances are blocks of pine and ebony). Thus, density has to do with the number of molecules in a particular volume regardless of the substance. As opposed to the unidirectional notion of pressure, uniformity of molecules is more of an image or model, rather than ap-prim. The image of molecules, although it guides children's inferences, is not based on personal experiences (i.e., it is not phenomenological)</page><page sequence="32">478 BLOOM in the same way as "pressure" as a phenomenological primitive (where everyday interactions with the world provide the experiences). However, such an interpre- tive framework acts in much the same way as ap-prim, in that it acts as a guide for making inferences. Such a model of molecules is sufficient for explanations within a single substance composed of the same molecules, but the model does not work across different substances or within objects containing a variety of molecules. DISCUSSION The following discussion will look at the four questions posited earlier in this arti- cle and their implications for teaching and learning. The first section looks at issue of emergent organization as characteristics of chaotic systems and the implications for its theoretical applications to classroom arguments and for instruction (i.e., the first research question). The second section examines the implications of prior and emerging conceptual understandings and interpretive frameworks on learning and for instruction (i.e., the last three research questions). The Argument as a Chaotic System and Its Implications for Instruction Traditionally, instructional claims have focused on linear approaches to instruc- tion and on predictable outcomes. However, the unique contributions of a cha- otic systems framework provide a perspective that values nonlinearity and unpredictability. As evident in this study, such a perspective provided the basis for students to engage in an on-going argument, which led to unpredictable, yet increased conceptual complexity. The contention here is that student-to-student discourse needs to be embedded in situational and cognitive contexts (a) that are conducive to and promote engage- ment in classroom arguments (i.e., a safe classroom atmosphere, etc. as suggested by Gallas [1995]); (b) that draw on students' prior understandings, experiences, emotional connections, and so forth; and (c) that address the nature of science. These contexts involve establishing functional classroom communities (Bloom, 1998; Roth, 1998), connecting to students' contexts of meaning (Bloom, 1990, 1992a, 1992b), and establishing Perkins and Simmons' (1988) four frames of un- derstanding. Within such contexts, students are encouraged to engage actively in discussing their work and taking on more authoritative roles (Cazden, 1988; Cortazzi, 1993; Gallas, 1995). Within such classroom contexts, where the teacher becomes another player in student dominated discourse and argument, the nature of the discourse can take on the characteristics of chaotic and autopoietic systems. As seen in Figure 1,</page><page sequence="33">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 479 the feedback loops of student arguments produced bifurcation points, which led to new conceptual strands of the argument. Like the prototypical chaotic and autopoietic system of a tornado, the argument, as represented in the figure, takes on the characteristics of spiraling, while generating new assertions, and leading to increasing conceptual complexity. In other words, as the students argued about specific claims, new avenues of thought spun off into more complex con- ceptual themes. As the teacher, my conflict of whether to control or not to control the, at times, heated discussion was a critical point in what seems at this point to have been an intertwined chaotic system of my own thinking. Had I decided to place constraints on the students' argument, either through confining the limits of the conceptual material or by limiting the behavior of the students, the effect may have been vastly different. Rather than a spiraling, self-generating, self-amplifying, and self-maintaining argument, the results of teacher control may lead to a more typi- cal linear and sequential classroom event. The suggestion here is that teacher con- trol has the potential to limit or negate student ownership over the ideas generated. Predicting that this particular argument would have arisen did not occur and would have been difficult, if not impossible, to do. However, by creating the context in which such an argument can arise and by providing the types of activ- ities where dissonance can occur, the stimulation of such arguments are more likely to occur. In this particular study, the intent of the activity was to provide the students with an event, which had an unanticipated result (for the stu- dents)-that is, the block of ebony sinks. This particular event happened to pro- vide the initial attractor. This initial attractor stimulated a move from relative equilibrium (i.e., students in agreement) to a position of increasing distance from equilibrium. Once the positions of the two primary "camps" of the argument be- came evident, the relationships between the students changed. The division into two competing camps took on the characteristics of Bateson's (1979) comple- mentary (competitive) relationships. Such types of relationships, although poten- tially unhealthy and destructive, appear to be essential in providing the initiating and fundamental pattern of organization for arguments. This fundamental pat- tern of organization is autopoietic. Although seemingly contradictory, the divi- siveness of complementary relationships provides the ground for self-amplifying arguments. This pattern of organization along with the processes provided by the students' thinking produce a dissipative structure, characterized by the feedback loops of the students' back and forth argument. Although the need for the relationships within the classroom to take on some degree of complementarity (i.e., where students are competing with one another to assert the validity of their claims), the ideal is to move toward reciprocal relation- ships (i.e., where students engage in a give and take process of knowledge claim negotiation). This study fell short of reaching this goal. The complementarity led to a continual increase in complexity with no particular agreement by the end of</page><page sequence="34">480 BLOOM the argument. Even though agreement may not always be possible, some sense of mutual understanding of and respect for the particular positions held by other stu- dents may be possible. However, such an autopoietic model of classroom dis- course, as suggested by Barab et al. (1999), "potentiates the learner-facilitator interaction" and provides a "fully contextualized experience in which there is no artificial separation between the act of learning, of participation, and the context in which it arises" (p. 353). Prior and Emerging Conceptual Understandings and Interpretive Frameworks The results of this study unraveled several underlying principles orp-prims of stu- dents' understandings of the relations between pressure, volume, and density, as well as a model of students' understandings of molecules. The following discussion will examine the implications of these results for our understandings of student learning, followed by an exploration of the implications for instruction. The particular emergent understandings evident in this argument arose from a variety of attractors and bifurcation points, as discussed in the previous section. Some of these emergent understandings relate to previous studies of density and related phenomena where the focus was on identifying students' alternative con- ceptions and difficulties in developing accurate understandings. Gennaro (1981) questioned whether student difficulty was one of conservation of volume or of confusing units of mass and volume. Hewson's (1986) research found that accu- rate scientific conceptions of volume and mass were not present. In addition, Hewson, as well as Driver (1989), found that a common conception of density in- volved the notion of "packing of particles" (Hewson, 1986, p. 167). However, none of these studies identified the underlying mechanisms or frameworks that guided student thinking. Following the progression of the argument provides some interesting insights not only into the understandings students hold, but also into the potential for teach- ers and researchers to misinterpret the ideas students express. Looking at Greg's initial comments about density changing when water is poured from a small con- tainer into a larger one can easily be attributed to pre-operational thinking. Such statements are easy to pigeonhole without fully understanding what is taking place. However, as we saw, Greg's thinking and understandings were much more complex than were initially evident. From the subsection Emergent Understandings and Underlying Principles, in the Results section, we have seen how the two positions of Greg and Gina unfold, the underlying meanings and understandings become more apparent. Greg con- tends that the volume of the medium (i.e., water) affects the density. The larger the volume, the greater the pressure, and therefore the density will be greater. Gina's</page><page sequence="35">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 481 position holds that a liquid medium, such as water, cannot be compressed, and that the volume of the medium does not affect the density. She agrees that the pressure might increase, but that the molecules cannot be compressed. Both Greg's and Gina's contentions are based on interpretive frameworks at a fundamental level (Bloom, 1992a, 1992b). Several interpretive frameworks orp-prims are at play in Greg's notions of pressure: (a) pressure affects density, (b) pressure is directional, (c) external forces affect pressure, and (d) surface area affects the degree to which external forces affect pressure. Gina's position is characterized by a model of mo- lecular uniformity across substances-molecules are the same shape and size across substances (solids and liquids) and behave in similar ways (i.e., they can't be compressed). These underlying understandings provided the guiding frame- work, through which examples and new information were sought out and brought to bear in the argument. In fact, in Greg's case, the "pressure is unidirectional" p-prim appeared to bring about the link to the "surface area..." and "external forces (e.g., gravity)"p-prims. In turn, thesep-prims led to the claim that pressure can increase the density of water. Part of the problem of interpretive frameworks orp-prims is recognizing when they are at play. During direct instruction, teachers may never have the opportunity to see them, because most of the talking is being done by the teachers. During classroom discussions, the opportunity is there, but how do you spot interpretive frameworks at work? If we look back through the transcripts, we notice that certain key terms keep occurring during the argument, such as pressure, compressurized, and molecules. Both Bateson (1979) and Bruner (1986) suggested an approach to uncovering underlying mechanisms and meanings. Bateson referred to "context markers" as certain terms or phrases, which point to underlying cognitive or epistemic contexts of meaning. Bruner discussed the notion of "triggers" as certain terms or events that point to underlying meanings and which may evoke certain re- sponses. The recurring terms (i.e., pressure, compressurized, and molecules) marked or pointed to the types of underlying problematic understandings or inter- pretive frameworks suggested by Gee (1994). They also triggered further explana- tions, counterarguments, and so forth based on the interpretive frameworks. Classroom discussions and arguments allow teachers to see the recurring mark- ers during the emerging development of understandings. When such markers are identified, the teacher can begin to probe more deeply for a more complete under- standing of the students' interpretive frameworks. Although p-prims, as diSessa (1993) contended, can be difficult to address in formal teaching situations, it may be possible to do so once such an understanding of the underlying frameworks are developed. The teacher can develop activities and instruction, which address the interpretive frameworks or p-prims. Such activities can either be implemented within the unit or at a later time. In the case of this study, had I been the regular classroom teacher, discovering the interpretive frameworks after the completion of the unit could have led to smaller units of instruction on molecules and molecu-</page><page sequence="36">482 BLOOM lar structure and the dynamics of pressure. However, such a direct approach may not be sufficient without addressing student metacognition (i.e., assessment of their own thinking) and epistemic knowledge (i.e., understanding how their knowledge is structured and how it can be supported or justified). If we consider Vygotsky's (1978) notion of progression from argument to reflection, it is at the point of reflection that teachers can take advantage of opportunities to address the subtleties of student interpretive frameworks and p-prims. At such a point, stu- dents can be encouraged to analyze and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their own frameworks, keeping in mind the key point of being able to justify one's claims.

Now, these blocks of wood are about the same size, right? 2.621 UV It's put together tighter ... it's like ... squeezed 2.622 Greg Yeah. 2.623 Tehr If you take these two pieces of wood, that are about the same size ... what are we saying? 2.624 Gina There's more molecules per ... 2.625 UV ... per s- 2.626 Gina ... centimeter. 2.627 UV ... per square millimeter. 2.640 Tchr So, when you do this, you take how much weight is in the volume, right. That's the density. How much weight is in the volume. How can we figure out the volume, uh, the density of water? 2.641 Gina Uh, we ... 2.642 UV Weigh it. 2.643 Frank Measure it then weigh it. And how much ... 2.644 Gina Does all water have the same amount of molecules in it? 2.645 Gina Like, if you just... 2.646 Gina ... took water from the tap and ... 2.648 Gina No, because water has salt in it. Never mind. 2.649 Frank Uh, H20. No, that's the molecule. Uh, water ... I'm not sure. 2.650 Fred Uh, zero ... 2.651 Frank Well, it can be a lot. It can be a little. 2.652 Greg If you took all this ... if you took all this water and put it in a container smaller, it would still weigh the same, but it would have a different density, because the volume is... uh ... smaller. 2.653 Tchr The volume is smaller? 2.654 Greg If you put it in a smaller container. Then the volume will be smaller... 2.655 Tchr D'you agree with that? 2.656 Greg ... and there's more weight in ...</page><page sequence="40">486 BLOOM 2.657 Tchr So if you just took the same amount of water and put it into another container ... 2.658 Greg Smaller container. 2.659 Tchr ... smaller container. 2.660 Greg The volume would be smaller, that means ... 2.661 Tchr Would you ... 2.662 Greg ... the weight... 2663 Tchr ... agree with that? 2.664 Greg ... but it'd be the same weight. 3.10 Greg But, however, if you had the same amount of ebony that you had in a much larger volume, possibly it would float because it [I assume he's referring to water] wouldn't be as dense 3.11 Greg ... because it wouldn't be as dense. 3.12 Fred No. That's not right. 3.13 Tchr Now, okay, what was that again? 3.14 Greg The ebony possibly could float if there was the actual amount of ebony in a larger volume, 'cause it wouldn't be as dense. 3.15 Tchr Does everybody agree with that? 3.16 [Fred and Frank.] Yeah. 3.17 UV No. 3.18 Tchr Okay, say it again. So, you're saying ... 3.19 Greg Well, the theory of volume is that objects are as dense as they are compacted, so ... 3.50 Greg Also the smallest thing could float, if it was in a larger volume, because it was the same small thing ... 3.55 Greg Unfortunately the theory of relativity and physics, uh, will not let us change the density of the ebony. However, we could change the density of the water, by putting it in smaller or bigger containers. 3.66 Greg No ... the density is the larger the volume the larger the 3.67 Gina No ... the thickening molecules. The amount of mole- cules per square ... the volume. 3.68 Tchr How can we ... How do we measure density? 3.69 Gina Um, by weighing. 3.70 Tchr By weighing? 3.71 Gina Like if you compared, like if you compared one piece of ebony to one piece of pine that were the same size ... 3.72 Tchr Right.</page><page sequence="41">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 487 3.73 Gina And you put them on a scale, that ebony might weigh more, and you would know that the molecules are denser in the ebony. 3.74 Greg Right. 3.75 Gina But I don't know how they could find out how much denser, like how many molecules ... 3.76 Greg You can measure ... 3.77 Gina Like I know on a penny ... 3.78 Greg You can measure ... 3.79 Tchr [To Greg.] Go ahead. 3.80 Greg ... density by length times width times height, because that's volume. 3.81 Tchr Volume ... 3.82 Gina Yeah, but that doesn't show how many molecules there is, because... 3.83 Greg No, it doesn't show how many ... 3.84 Gina ... because ... because look! 3.85 Greg But if you could ... 3.86 Gloria You take the height ... I don't want to get into this argu- ment. 3.87 Gina Wait, Greg, Greg. If the pine ... it has the same measure- ments, it'll seem like it has same amount of molecules, so that wouldn't work. 3.88 Greg I agree. You're right there and I'm wrong. 4.158 Tchr ... Last week we talked about density, and Fred mentioned something about the blocks ... how we get the ebony to float. Do you remember what we said? 4.160 Gina Rubbing alcohol. 4.161 Frank Surface tension! 4.161 Gloria Dense up the water. 4.162 George Drill a hole. 4.163 Eric Drill a hole and ... 4.164 Fred I just have to say, I said ... 4.165 Tchr Let Fred talk. Gina, you can stay and help me clean up, okay? Thank you. 4.166 Fred ... density of the water. 4.167 Tchr [To Fred.] Okay, go ahead. 4.168 Fred I said, density of the water... 4.169 Tchr Would everyone be quiet? 4.170 Fred Density of the water. That's what I said.</page><page sequence="42">488 BLOOM 4.171 Tchr But you said ebony ... the piece of ebony, how could you get it to float? You don't remember. 4.172 Fred Put floats on it. 4.173 Gai 11 remember. 4.174 Tchr Hollow it out? 4.175 Fred Yeah, you hollow it out. 4.176 Eric Hollow it out put scotch tape ... 4.177 Fred And put scotch tape on it. 4.178 Gail [Laughs.] And put scotch tape on it. 4.179 Frank You don't need scotch tape. 4.180 George So the water won't get in the holes, silly. 4.181 Tchr Now that idea ... how does that relate to boats float- ing? 4.182 Greg 'Cause there's air in the hull. 4.183 Tchr What does that do to the density of the object? 4.184 Gina It's hollowed out, the thing that ... the boat is hollowed out. 4.185 Greg Less molecules ... 4.186 Tchr Can you think of anything that ... 4.188 Tchr What about the ships in the harbor? 4.189 George They float. 4.190 Tchr What are they made out of? 4.191 George Metal. 4.192 Gloria Metal. 4.193 Eric aluminum. 4.194 Greg Wood. 4.195 Frank No, metal. There's air in the hull. There's air in the hull 4.196 George They sink like rocks when they (have accidents???). 4.197 Gail They're made out of tin-foil and pipe-cleaners. 4.198 Gina They're made out of metal, but they have a wooden frame. 4.199 Fred They do. 4.200 Tchr Some do and some don't. Some are all metal, some have (???)... 4.201 Gloria They're made out of metal with no holes in it. 4.202 Frank It's the shape of... it's the shape of the hull ... 4.203 Tchr Yeah ... 4.204 Frank ... that helps it float. 4.205 Tchr ... now what happens if you've got this metal hull ... just like the piece of ebony and it's hollow inside.</page><page sequence="43">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 489 What's the relationship of the density of that total ob- ject, including the air in the hull, to the water. 4.206 Gina Oh, I know. Well, if it's heavy on the bottom and heavy on the top, then it might sink. But if it has a hollowed-out space ... on the top, then it's not gonna sink, because it doesn't have as much weight to carry... 4.207 Greg Yeah, but... 4.208 Tchr Yeah, so the weight, I mean density, is the amount of weight you've got in a particular volume. 4.209 Gina So maybe, wait... Maybe ifa piece ofwood had ... had a volume, but had less ... like it was carved out, so it had less density to the volume, then it would float. 4.210 Greg Obviously though, like if... when there's ... it's just a big chunk of ebony, it's not going to sink. I mean it's go- ing to sink, but if it's hollow also, when it ... if it tries to sink in the water, that ... that there's not enough room, 'cause air ... can't be in water, so when the air from the .. inside of the ebony tries to enter the water, the water has to go beside [or, "to the side."], and there's less den- sity. [Rather remarkable stillness in the room as Gina and Greg speak.] 4.211 Tchr Yeah, that's actually called the displacement. 4.212 Greg Yeah. 4.213 Tchr When you put an object into water, it displaces it, pushes it away. 4.214 Gina Like with these things, with these on it? 4.215 Fred I hate those things. 4.216 Gina You squeeze on them, they go down ... 4.217 Tchr Unh hunh. 4.218 Gina ... because some of the air is like taken away ... 4.219 Tchr We're gonna figure that one out. 4.220 George I want the really hard one. 4.221 Tchr Okay, let's ... okay, Frank, yeah. 4.222 Frank And also, you know, when you blow bubbles under wa- ter, the bubbles come up to the surface. 4.223 George? And when you fart. 4.224 Tchr Now what happens when you get into the bathtub? 4.225 Greg Water rises. 4.226 Gail I fart. 4.227 Tchr The water rises. You're displacing the water, and it rises, right? Okay.</page><page sequence="44">490 BLOOM 4.228 Gloria When the weight is spread out more, it's easier to stay afloat. 4.229 Tchr When the ... water's ... 4.230 Gloria When the weight of the boat, is spread out more ... 4.231 Tchr ... spread out more? 4.232 George Yeah. 4.233 Gloria ... then it tends to float. 4.234 Tchr So the surface area has something to do with it. 4.235 George Yup. It does. 4.236 Gloria And ifthere's a hole in one end and it fills with water, that end's gonna go down faster because it weighs more with the water in it. 5.256 Tchr What's the density of water? 5.257 Eric Depends! 5.258 Tchr Depends on .. 5.259 Eric The, uh, density of water. (???) 5.260 Frank [To SB.] What will a pole do? 5.261 Fred It'll do lots. It'll help it to not tip over, or anything. 5.262 Gina No, how much water there is in it. 5.263 Tchr [Directed primarily at Group 1.] But if you change the volume, it's going to (weigh the same???). 5.267 Tchr But if you've got a bucket of water (???) weigh the same as a little cup of water. 5.268 Gina No, (???) little cup of water, and you pour a little cup of water into a big bucket it still weighs the same. 5.270 George It's true. 5.271 Gina If you pour a little cup of water... 5.273 Gina ... into a big basin, you'll have the same amount of water in the big basin ... 5.275 Gina ... than in the little cup of water. 5.277 Tchr Yeah, but is the density the same? 5.278 Gina Yes. 5.279 [Other voices saying, "Yes."] 5.280 Greg Yes, because it changes in a smaller volume, because the density gets... 5.282 Gina Well, I'm sorry... 5.283 Tchr ... but, if you change the volume, you change the weight, too. 5.284 UV Yeah, so (???)</page><page sequence="45">DISCOURSE, COGNITION, AND CHAOTIC SYSTEMS 491 5.285 Gina Well, maybe slightly, but I'm sorry to say, when I drink a glass of water, I don't notice any difference.
