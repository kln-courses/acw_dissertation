<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnicity and cultural politics The illusion of cultural identity. ByJean-Frangois Bayart. London: Hurst. 2005. 303pp. Index. ?35.oo. ISBN I 85065 655 x. In this book Bayart engages in a prolonged, savage, sardonic attack on 'culturalism'-defined variously as an ideology, social scientific proposition or illusion. For Bayart, culturalism is so powerful it even assumes anthropomorphic qualities. 'It commits three methodical errors: it maintains that a culture is a corpus of representations that is stable over time; it sees this corpus as closed in on itself, and it assumes that this corpus determines a specific political orientation' (p. 65). Advocates of culturalism are attacked without mercy in a wide-ranging selection of examples. The disastrous French policy on Rwanda, which failed to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, was based, Bayart says, on a culturalist illusion, as was France's support of Mobutu in Zaire. Missionaries, colonial administrators, Gandhi's notion of panchayat, Marx's idea of primitive communalism, old-fashioned anthropologists and anti-colonialists all worked with a totally erroneous concept of 'village community', another culturalist illusion. As for Huntington's clash of civilizations thesis, it is not worthy of a discussion for it is 'an absurdity'. Bayart sets himself the task of trying to find the connections between culture and politics without being a culturalist. Most of his arguments are centred on the now familiar thesis that nations and ethnicities are imagined artefacts. Naturally Benedict Anderson gets a fair hearing, but Bayart finds a more venerable explicator of the argument in Weber, who is extensively cited. A closer historical and anthropological examination of patterns of trade in many areas, and maritime zones in particular, show that many societies were marked by 'exchange, intermarriage and cosmopolitanism' (p. 60). Such interactions revealed the fuzzy borders between societies and their syncretic and hybrid characters. I000 International Affairs 82: 5, 2006 ? 2006 The Author(s).

Bayart correctly argues that civil wars in Yugoslavia, the Caucasus and Central Asia will 'lead one to worry about the exacerbation of ethno-nationalism' (p. 63), but he immediately downplays this, talking of the dog that did not bark in the night (one up for Sherlock Holmes), the amicable divorce between the Czechs and the Slovaks, and the acceptance of diversity in the European Union. However, the counter-examples are legion. Islamophobia, the continuing wariness of admitting Turkey to the EU, the escalating military conflicts in the Middle East-these and many other examples surely create a major challenge to his anti-culturalist perspective. The problem seems to be that, despite quoting classical sociology, Bayart has carefully skated around the old sociological adage that what is real in the mind is real in its consequences. We can agree that there is no permanent core to each culture, yet the belief that such a core exists can have devastating consequences. More precisely, the manipulation of this belief by cynical or self-deluded politicians can create mind-sets that are as rigid as those of the Nazis in Germany or the many white South Africans who supported apartheid. Of course, these were illusions-notice how fast they disappeared when political and military changes propelled an opposite logic. After liberation, it was difficult to find a Nazi sympathizer in Paris or Berlin and it is now virtually impossible to find anyone who supported the National Party in South Africa. As long as they persist, illusions are potentially lethal: the social scientist's problem is not simply to condemn and mock them (Bayart is very good at providing ludicrous cases), but systematically to investigate why cultural illusions arise, how they are sustained and why they become deconstructed. There are moments in this book when Bayart seems to have grasped this nettle. This is particularly the case in his commendable chapter on the 'political imaginaire'. The French word 'imaginaire' has proved a nightmare for English translators-variously rendered as 'the Imaginary' (with or without a capital letter) or wrongly as 'the imagination'. Bayart's two translators simply give up and leave it in the original French. The best we can do in English is something like 'the collective myth'. Bayart brilliantly explains how a collective myth has to be expressed in various material forms-in hair styles, cuisine, the guillotine (justice has to be quick as lightning) and clothing (the chador, the hijab, the abacost and military uniforms feature here). While this speaks to the issue of how illusions are maintained and replicated, the analysis remains allusive rather than conclusive and often dissipates into whimsical asides. In all, Bayart provides a provoking read if you allow the author his idiosyncratic and somewhat self-indulgent style. Robin Cohen, University of Warwick, UK</page></plain_text>
