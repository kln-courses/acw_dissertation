<plain_text><page sequence="1">They Love and Kill: Sex, Sympathy and Aggression in Courtship and Mating, by Yitus B. Droscher. Published by W. H. Allen, London. Price ?6.50. This book has little to offer serious students of animal behaviour other than to emphasize the variety of reproductive strategies adopted by different species of animals. Several hundred species are referred to in the text, including examples from most of the major taxonomic groupings. The main theme is that the recognition of what the author terms "the social bonding instinct" represents a revolutionary breakthrough in ethology and that our views on human marital and social behaviour will have to be revised in the light of the discovery. The author strives to justify this dubious thesis by reference to a seemingly endless series of sensationalistic, anthropomorphic accounts of animal courtship and mating. His basic ethological frame-work is archaic and simplistic (see for example R. A. Hinde's (I960) criticisms of similar models, Syrnp. Soc. Exp. Biol. XIV: 199-213). Mr. Droschers lack of formal training in zoology is apparent when he describes spiders as "predatory insects" and their mouth parts as "mandibles" and in his innacurate usage of taxonomic nomenclature generally. He believes, for example, that the "black masks" developed by black-headed gulls during the breeding season are so frightening that "as a result it is difficult for the birds to get close enough to mate"! He frequently invokes group selectionist arguments in his evolution ary discussions. The present edition is a translation of an earlier German one and many ambiguities in the text may have resulted from inadequate translation. The majority of the references cited are in German including for example Robert Ardrey's "Der Gesellsdiaftsvertrag" \ I doubt if books of this calibre warrant production other than in the. original form. Unless it is issued as a cheap paperback this book is unlikely to find an extensive readership in this country. t. k. McCarthy</page></plain_text>
