<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM: MATERIALISM IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. By PROFESSOR L. J. RUSSELL, MISS L. S. STEBBING AND PROFESSOR A. E. HEATH. I. By L. J. RUSSELL. (i.) ACCORDING to the old materialism the ultimate reals were discrete particles of matter, which moved freely through a space indifferent to their presence or their motion. These particles were themselves unaffected by their motions; they had pro- perties which belonged to them throughout all time, and which were capable of existing at any instant of time, however short. No occurrences really took place in the spatial universe except movements and impacts of these reals. Empedocles and Anaxagoras put the principle on which materialism is based in its simplest form when they said that what we call coming into being and passing away is really a mingling and a separating of things which simply are; while Kant expresses its rational basis when he notes that change is unintelligible from mere conceptions, but requires the intuition of a movement across space. This view was thus based on a separation of the changing from the permanent. In consequence of the acceptance of G2</page><page sequence="2">100 L. J. RUSSELL. the separation between space and time, the permanent became related to space, the changing to time; the real was thus given only qualities either directly spatial, or directly related to space. There resulted a separation of primary from secondary qualities, and of the material from the mental. But as a general account of the real, claiming theoretical completeness, this view had to deny the reality of secondary qualities and of the mental altogether. Hence many who accepted the view so far as it concerned matter, refused to extend it to the whole of reality; thus a new kind of stuff-substance was introduced, viz., mind, into which were swept all the occur- rences other than mere changes of position of the material reals. But if materialism was inadequate, its patched-up dualistic offspring was no less so, the offspring having inherited all the weaknesses of its parent, with many new ones of its own. The difficulties are an old story; they concern the factual relations between the entities separated by the theory; between mind and matter, secondary and primary qualities, time and space, and, in the end, between material particles and space. The last two are most important for our discussion. On the whole, the view that space was theoretically distinct from matter prevailed over the view that matter and extension were identical. Space was empty, except for the material particles moving in it. The material particles might or might not fill the whole of space; and it was more convenient not to envisage these alternatives too closely, for either by itself brought difficul- ties. The youthful Leibnitz thought it was best to regard space as being " filled as much as was necessary " by a subtle matter, which interacted with less subtle material particles; and in practice this way of considering the situation smoothed out the worst obstacles. But, even then, it was difficult to reconcile the fundamental principles of motion with the description of matter. Why should a permanently unchanging body move in one way</page><page sequence="3">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 101 rather than another through a space indifferent to it, or why, when it impinged on another equally permanent unchanging body, should anything occur rather than something else ? By their definition, the reals were unable to account for anything. Nothing could happen to them; they were permanently un- changing; all changes affected only their relations to other reals. And these reals were nothing to them. In short, all explanation stopped at the outer boundaries of the reals. Material particles were the only dark places in the universe. Explanation concentrated on the complex groups formed by the minglings and separatings of the reals; and it was found necessary to attribute to the reals certain differences of mass, shape, size and (provisionally) certain other properties of gravi- tation, magnetism, chemical affinity, and so on, not all to be regarded as theoretically ultimate, but not actually accounted for on the original basis. And the general trend of investigation was such as to put more and more of the responsibility for changes on to a subtle matter (the ether) in which the material particles were regarded as being suspended; in the end leaving it possible that " matter " was simply a gross manifestation of a state of the ether. But this meant one of two things. Either the new " ether" consisted merely of the old hard unchanging particles with the difficulties conveniently forgotten, or it involved an entirely new conception of " stuff." If a new conception of " stuff " was possible, it was inevitable that it should ultimately supplant the old conception of unchanging material particles, which explained nothing. And the interest of the nineteenth century in the nature of the " ether " can be looked on as due to an attempt to arrive at such a new conception of " stuff," and to use it as a basis of interpretation; the discoveries concerning electro-magnetism, radio-activity, atoms and spectra all helping to break down the old conception.</page><page sequence="4">102 1. J. RUSSELL. But so long as space is separated from time it is difficult to make any radical break with the old conception of stuff. For if space is separated from time, the world can and must be conceived as having a state at a given instant; and how can the states of the world at different instants be distinguished save by the presence of some stuff distinct from space ? But this stuff, which exists in space at a given moment, must, it seems, be made up of ultimate constituents which are themselves the final material entities. And if any ultimate constituent of this stuff has any characters at a given moment which it does not derive entirely from its spatial relations at the moment, it seems as if these characters must simply belong to it, must be its characters ; and, if so, how can these characters ever change ? The only alternatives to this line of argument, so long as space is separated from time, are, firstly, to regard space itself as capable of changing in time, or, secondly, to deny that the stuff in space is made up of ultimate constituents. But both these alternatives seem more obscure than the previous line of argument, and are not willingly accepted so long as the previous line of argument remains possible. It is, in other words, difficult to avoid ultimate unchanging material particles of stuff in physical science, so long as space is separated from time; for if you separate space from time it is difficult to avoid separating space from matter, and matter from time. (ii.) What are we to mean by " not separating space from time " ? How are we to avoid separating them-supposing it is wrong to separate them ? The reply to this must be, " By not following a theory that involves their separation." In other words, if we are to avoid the separation we must hold closely to events as experienced, in the hope of viewing them without such a theory.</page><page sequence="5">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 103 It is perhaps best to begin with the relation between space and matter and work backwards. To avoid separating space and matter it is necessary to avoid separating space from the set of occurrences that we refer to material things. The denial, taken seriously, of absolute space, should help us here. For if we see that positions of entities, and distances between entities, can be expressed in terms of the entities themselves, we can see that the notion of an absolute existing space, in which entities that are not purely spatial can be situated and through which they can move without affecting space itself, is unnecessary. It is possible to think of a space constructed of purely spatial points, between which are purely spatial distances, and for the definition of this space there is no need to refer to material bodies. Again, it is possible to think of a spatially extended material system, in which positions are marked by material points, and distances are marked by material rods. The con- sideration of the pure space will assist you in the consideration of the spatial properties of the material system. But no use whatever can be made of the notion of the material system as being situated in the pure space. Let us see where we are. On the one hand, a world com- pletely empty of matter can be imagined and treated by the mathematician. On the other hand, a world completeiy full of matter would not involve the supposition that besides the matter there is a continuous space in which the matter is placed. So much perhaps we may admit without too great hesitation. But our world seems to present us with a system which contains material bodies separated by tracts of space which cannot be observed to contain any material bodies; and it is this which encourages the separation of pure space from material systems. What are we to do in this case ? It seems clear that if we are to avoid this separation we must consider the material bodies and the apparently empty space</page><page sequence="6">104 L. J. RUSSELL. between them as belonging to one single system. Where there is a material body we must not suppose that there is a uniform space plus some stuff ; and when a body moves relatively to other bodies we must not suppose that it moves through a space distinct from itself, which it fills for a time and then leaves empty. We must suppose, to put it in other words, that when the intervals between a material body and other material bodies alter, there is some significance in our interpreting this as meaning that the apparently empty spaces have altered their configuration as well. But how, then, you may ask, are we to picture such a system, or conceive it as a whole ? The reply is that it is perhaps better at first to refrain from conceiving it as a whole, and to be content with the only things we can use in our theoretical calculations, viz., changes in the intervals between bodies. The determination of the properties of intervals in such a system is the business of the physicist, aided by the studies of the pure mathematician concerning the generalized conception of interval. But the lay- man need not despair of getting some view of the situation. How then am I, as a layman in physics, to make a beginning ? Being a layman, I am extremely likely to make the attempt on wrong lines; and I should prefer to do it in private, and should assuredly be doing it in private were it not for an unguarded promise to open a discussion at this conference. How, then, am I to set about it ? I may, e.g., as an exercise of imagination, picture a quivering mass of jelly with holes in it like a sponge. I may think of the holes as changing shape and position relative to any points on the jelly that may be taken as reference points. I must suppose that the problem of deter- mining the shape of a hole is one to be solved not by putting a measuring rod across the hole at various points, but to be solved entirely by means of elaborate assumptions aided by calculations from measurements made within the quivering</page><page sequence="7">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 105 jelly, with quivering measuring rods. I must try to realize that the effect of putting a measuring rod across a hole is to destroy the hole, not to measure it. I must refrain from placing the jelly as a whole in any empty space. It will be wise for me to refrain from considering my quivering jelly as giving a picture of the actual world, and, indeed, as anything more than an exercise of the imagination in the effort to get rid of the separa- tion of space and matter. Shall I be any nearer to the view which refuses to separate matter and space ? At any rate, something of this sort seems to be needed. But I shall not yet be finished. I have still to consider time. Here, again, I have to avoid following a wrong theory. I can see that the basic experiences might reasonably be taken to be those of (a) simultaneity of two events separated by a small interval, and (b) before and after in relation to events separated by a small interval. In the case of (a) the interval may be theoretically treated as a space interval; in the case of (b) the interval is something more complex. In both cases the conceptions relating to the experiences can be made precise only by a doctrine of limits; but this need not trouble us here. For us the essential point is that, where the interval between two events is not small, the conception of an interval, and the derived conceptions of space-distance and of time-interval are complex, and a matter of the theoretical interpretation of experi- ence. In particular, the notion of simultaneity of two events separated by a large space-distance is a complex one, to be determined by reference to the experiences of the physicist and by such additional theoretical considerations as may be needed for dealing with these experiences. For us the important result emerges from the considerations of the physicist that the conception of a single time sweeping onward, in which events take place, turns out to be a conception which is inadequate to the experience. Our task as laymen, then, will be to recognize</page><page sequence="8">106 L. J. RUSSELL. this, and to refrain from assuming it as self-evident. All this may help us to hold more closely to what we actually experience, and to refrain from importing into what we actually experience assumptions which the progress of science shows to be unwork- able. It may help us to accept a view which merges geometry, chronometry and theoretical physics, so far as these deal with the actual world, into one science. We shall the more readily accept this if we see that here science is simply giving con- firmation to the doubts felt by philosophy in the past as to the possibility of a separation between space, time and matter, however difficult we may find it to get a concrete picture of the situation. (iii.) We can now sum up the results so far reached. On the old conception of matter, (a) matter had its properties in independence of its particular position in space and of its movement through space ; (b) at the same time the fundamental properties of matter were determined in terms of space, while the fundamental interrelations between various particles of matter were determined in terms of movement. The modern experimental evidence shows that the spatial properties of a body cannot be determined independently of its movement; thus we are compelled to give up either (a) or (b). This makes it impossible to hold to the old basic materialistic conception of a persisting stuff with spatial properties moving unchanged through space. If we are to hold to the notion of a matter having its properties independent of its movement through space, these properties must not be defined in terms relating to space. And it seems preferable to follow the lead of physics, and to include the properties of space, time and matter in a single system-in other words, to give up the conception of a persisting unchanging matter or stuff altogether. I shall speak of this conception, which is here rejected, as the conception</page><page sequence="9">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 107 of stuff-substance. And I can sum up what I am arguing in a single sentence: Stuff-substance, that which moves in space and retains spatial properties unchanged in its motion, does not exist. (iv.) What, then, will be the main elements in our conception of matter ? (a) It is clear, in the first place, that we must think of every- thing material as in flux : in the sense that within any spatio- temporal interval, however small, there will be in principle some change, i.e., if we find no change in a particular interval, we shall regard this as a particular case of the principle of universal change. (b) But, in the second place, we need something deter- minate; a universal flux which resulted in the completely indeterminate would not give us a satisfactory conception. Determinateness and flow thus seem to be the two correlative aspects of the conception we require. We may perhaps arrive at a synthesis of these aspects by considering what is meant by a " song," or a " speech," or a " ceremony," all of which we regard as determinate, identifiable, capable of being repeated, and yet as involving a stretch of time in which to exist. The " song " as it is sung does not exist " at " any determinate moment of time; from the point of view of a moment of time the song cannot exist completely until the last note is sung, and then it has ceased to exist altogether. We must think of the " determinate " in the flux in some such way as we think of the " song." It must contain variety within it. An existence shrunk down to a knife-edge of time would have no character. What time does not light up is dark. The singing of the song is, from one point of view, a series of events, a flow; but the song itself (which only exists because of the singing) must be regarded as existing in a sense which allows it to exist " as a whole " (which, it is clear, must no longer mean " all at once "),</page><page sequence="10">108 L. J. RUSSELL. while containing duration within it; and again allows it to exist elsewhere and on another occasion, with an entirely different flow within its duration. The old atom was a song which could be sung all in a knife-edge of time, and which could be eternally the same singing, as well as the same song. (c) But, in the third place, it looks as if such determinate- ness must be able to be found anywhere within the flow where we care to look for it. A pure flux, without any determinate- ness, seems meaningless, on however small a scale we may take it. And hence it seems as if our " determinate" must be regarded as containing within it a number of determinates, just as a " song " can be regarded as made up of verses, and, again, of musical phrases, or of notes, or of vibrations. (d) This view of a " determinate object " seems to involve that the identity of an object is formal rather than material, turning on something analogous to the mode of grouping or arrangement of its constituent objects. We might perhaps illustrate it by reference to Spinoza's account of a finite indi- vidual, as a special mode of spatio-temporal grouping A of con- stituent finite individuals b1, b2, b3, etc., of such a sort that the mode of grouping is more important than the particular indi- viduals b,, b, b3, etc., within it; and go on to conceive any b as a special mode of spatio-temporal grouping B of finite indi- viduals c1, c,, c3, etc., defined in the same way. Proceeding in this way, we should in the end never arrive at a set of individuals z, z, z3, . . . which were not made up of lesser individuals. We should always, in theory, be able to carry the analysis a stage further. The conception of a plastic matter, of a mere flow, would represent the limit of such a series. (e) But a pure spatio-temporal grouping of pure spatio- temporal groupings, ad indefinitum, seems too abstract; we need some conception, such as that of quality, to be used with the proviso that our " qualities " must not be regarded as</page><page sequence="11">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 109 instantaneous, and also with the proviso that we need not suppose that the qualities perceivable by the senses possessed by human beings exhaust the range of the conception. An electron, regarded as a determinate entity, must be allowed to have qualities in the same way as (to take any example) a snail's shell or a spiral nebula has. (f) If we hold fast to the conclusion that any portion of spatio-temporal existence must be capable of being regarded as determinate as well as being in flux, we can admit the possibility of a qualitative distinction between any determinate object and its constituents. Thus we must admit the possibility that as we take our survey over a wider or a narrower stretch of space- time we meet with different qualities. (g) We have to note, as a further complication, that the conception of " quality " (as modern discussion has amply made out) is bound up with that of " appearance," and involves a situation at which appearances appear, varying situations from which appearances appear at the aforesaid situation, and sets of conditions under which these appearances appear. But the situations, and the conditions, all themselves have to be described in terms of determinate objects. Thus the notion of a determinate object involves reference not merely to the determinate objects which form constituent parts of it, but also to a wider field of determinate objects of which it itself forms a constituent. (v.) The above considerations merely illustrate in a preliminary way the new form the problem of matter takes. They are not, it is clear, free from difficulties. We shall consider this point later. Meanwhile it is to be noted that while the old materialism is excluded, a new form of materialism is possible, which contents itself with part of what the old asserted. For the transition</page><page sequence="12">110 L. J. RUSSELL. from the point of view of ordinary life to that of science can be regarded as a simple transition from a macroscopic view of the determinate flux to a microscopic view of the same flux. From the point of view of ordinary life, the world presents itself as an aggregate of things of various sorts, enduring and changing, in spatio-temporal relations with one another, with various qualities of colour and smell and sound, etc., and with various powers of affecting other things. The scientist digs further into this world, analyses its objects into constituents such as electrons, atoms, molecules, fields of force, etc., and by this analysis he is enabled to understand better the changes in the qualities of the objects of the ordinary world. The new materialism, like the old, asserts that these constituents are more ultimate than the objects of the ordinary world; that the objects of the ordinary world are mere results of the complex groupings of these con- stituents. It does not need to assert that the most elementary objects (e.g., electrons) at which it arrives are ultimate in the strict sense. It is sufficient that electrons should be sufficiently stable objects (in the new sense) for the purposes of science. Nor does it need to show that the properties of the complex objects of the ordinary world can be " deduced " from the properties of the constituents which science finds. It is enough if the scientist can correlate variations in the properties of the complex objects with variations in the spatio-temporal relations of their con- stituents. The new materialism, in other words, need not assert anything about the strictly ultimate constituents of things. It is sufficient for it to assert that all the sciences in the end reduce to physics. Whether the present state of knowledge bears this out or not is a question which seems to me to fall beyond the scope of this symposium. A few remarks, however, may be permitted. As a consequence of the rejection of "stuff-substance," we are compelled to seek a more formal basis for our definition of an</page><page sequence="13">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 111 object or a substance. This seems to involve the result that no help against the new materialism is to be gained by introducing any new quasi-" stuff-substances," such as " life " or " mind " or " social or group mind," as we proceed from one kind of object to another. The battle will have to be fought on the question of qualities or properties or functions; to deny mind as a kind of stuff is not to deny mind as a substance. But if all modifications of the behaviour of a " minding-organism " could be correlated completely with variations in the groupings of molecules and atoms, changing according to the laws of physics, then " minding-organisms " would turn out to be simply com- plexes of simpler objects. If, on the other hand, it turns out to be impossible to correlate all variations in the behaviour of " minding-organisms " with variations in the spatio-temporal groupings of their constituents, then we shall be justified in describing " minding-organisms" as new substances, in spite of the fact that they present us with no new stuff, but can be completely analysed into physico-chemical constituents. In a similar way, if it turned out to be impossible to correlate all variations in the behaviour of groups of persons with variations not merely in their spatio-temporal grouping, but in those relations between the individuals in the group that were regarded as specifically mental, then we should be justified in describing the group as a new substance, in spite of the fact that it presented us with no new stuff. The difficulty in this case is clear: it is the difficulty of studying minds apart from groups, so as to determine what characteristics of the behaviour of groups of persons are to be regarded as belonging to minds, and what as belonging to groups. A precisely similar difficulty appears to be involved in the passage from electrons to atoms, from atoms to molecules, and so on; but it is avoided by the conception of spatio-temporal grouping, which applies equally to molecules, atoms and electrons.</page><page sequence="14">112 L. J. RUSSELL. (vi.) It is clear that in all this we are not arriving at solid ground that philosophy can rest on. This mysterious " flow of events," with its still more mysterious " objects " of various types related in a mysterious way to the " flow of events "-is not all this entirely incomplete, hanging in clouds of mystery ? Are objects like boats, floating in the sea of events, tossed hither and thither, or have they rudders and sails and steersmen to guide them- selves; or are they simply the chance patterns that the flow of events forms one moment, to be dissolved or reformed the next, which have been conceptualized by the inquiring mind ? If they are such mere chance results of the flow of events, it is not they, but the flow that we desire to study ; but if they are the moving agents, it may be said, is not your account of their relations to each other and to the flow of events altogether impossible ? And, again, what of appearances, which are said to have the faculty of being " here, from there, under such and such condi- tions " ? Are they in that place, at which they appear, or in this place, from which they appear ? And to whom do they appear ? Do they appear when no one is perceiving them, or do you mean only that they would appear if someone were there to perceive them ? If no one is there, is nothing there appertaining to the object ? Are you not, in short, in all this trying to retain a realism which, in the end, you will find transformed into a thoroughgoing idealism at the slightest touch ? Is it not impossible to understand what you describe, except as elements in and for a consciousness ? I have endeavoured in this paper to steer clear of these questions, and to concentrate on the humbler task of trying to describe the situation which results when the old materialistic conception of substance has been set aside. It is difficult enough to see the tangle as a whole, before trying to take the next step ; and the preliminary analysis of the situation does not involve the wider issues.</page><page sequence="15">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 113 II. By L. S. STEBBING. (i.) IN the opening paper of this symposium Professor Russell has briefly indicated the grounds on which the old materialism, based upon the traditional notion of substance, has been superseded by a new materialism which recognizes that nothing is per- manent, nothing persists unchanged. That " scientific material- ism "-to adopt Professor Whitehead's name for the doctrine associated with Newtonian physics-is incompatible with the recent developments of science will hardly, I think, be disputed. But what exactly this incompatibility involves and what is its philosophical outcome it is more difficult to decide. Professor Russell at the end of his paper raises the question whether the philosophy of nature to which we seem to be led will not in the end involve us in a " thoroughgoing idealism." It is the implications of this question that I propose to discuss as my contribution to this symposium. The terms materialism and idealism are excessively vague and have consequently been much used by philosophers and their critics. As names to describe, for instance, the philosophies of Hobbes and of Leibniz respectively, they have little to do with science. Belief in these philosophies is rendered neither easier nor more difficult by any advances in science. Perhaps the most convenient sense in which the term "idealism " can be signifi- cantly used is indicated by Professor Kemp Smith, who says:- " The meanings attached to the term 'idealism' are so numerous and so conflicting that I have found it convenient to use it in a very wide sense, as covering all those philosophies which agree in maintaining that spiritual values have a determining voice in H</page><page sequence="16">114 L. S. STEBBING. the ordering of the Universe."* But the opposite of such theories is not " materialism" but naturalism. Consequently, the philo- sophical reasons for, or against, either type of theory are not likely to be affected by changes in the scientific conception of "matter." The main respects in which the philosophy of scientific materialism appears inconsistent with modern scientific thought seem to me to be three, viz. : (1) The conception of " stuff "; (2) the exclusion of the secondary qualities from nature ; (3) the conception of laws. Professor Russell has dealt with the change in the scientific conception of matter which has necessitated the repudiation of " stuff " in the form of material substance, and I shall not pursue that topic further. The second point raises some questions of importance, and I propose to deal with it in connexion with Professor Whitehead's rejection of bifurcation theories. There can be no doubt that his recent philosophical writings have not only been regarded as contributing to the overthrow of scientific materialism, but have further been widely interpreted as involving an idealistic meta- physic. It is by no means clear that such an interpretation would be unwelcome to Professor Whitehead himself. However that may be, his language has given rise to serious misconcep- tions. It is at least possible that some of these misconceptions are due to the fact that Whitehead himself is not clear as to the ultimate issues. Two quite different problems seem to me to be confused in Professor Whitehead's philosophy of nature, viz., the problem of value and the problem of the secondary qualities. In The Concept of Nature this confusion was not explicit. It appears clearly in Science and the Modern World in the way in which he treats the appeal to the experience of the poet. I am myself in complete agreement with Whitehead's insistence that colours, sounds, scents, etc., must be included in nature and that their * Prolegomena to an Idealist Theory of Knowledge, p. i.</page><page sequence="17">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 115 extrusion leads to a vicious bifurcation. But in his later exposi- tions of this doctrine Professor Whitehead seems to me quite unwarrantably to stress the notion of value, vaguely conceived, and suggesting even the reintroduction of purpose into the scientific scheme. Thus, in speaking of scientific materialism as " the fixed scientific cosmology which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter, or material, spread throughout space in the flux of configurations," he writes: " In itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless."* Again, in the last chapter of the same book, speaking of the reactions of science upon the " climate " of civilized society, he says : " Its material- istic basis has directed attention to things as opposed to values." t Thereupon he proceeds first to connect this mode of thought with the industrial system of the nineteenth century; secondly, to suggest somewhat vaguely that the repudiation of scientific materialism tends in the direction of the gospel of mutual service. These vague suggestions, difficult to disentangle from his more fruitful conceptions, undoubtedly encourage the belief that somehow modern science is more in accord with our cherished beliefs than was the cosmology of scientific materialism. Is there any sense in which this can be said to be the case ? The answer to this question does not, in my opinion, depend in any way upon the problem of the secondary qualities. I shall, therefore, discuss this latter problem first, and then deal with the third point mentioned above, viz., the conception of laws, which does seem to me to have some bearing upon the answer to be given to our question. (ii.) The concluding section of Professor Russell's paper, to which I have already referred, is intended, I think, to suggest the * Science and the Modern World, p. 24. t Science and the Modern World, p. 284. Italics in the original. H2</page><page sequence="18">116 L. S. STEBBING. problem whether the inclusion of sense-objects in nature is compatible with the closure of nature to mind. In attempting to deal with this problem it is important to keep distinct the two questions which, I have suggested, Professor Whitehead confuses, viz., the inclusion of value, and the inclusion of colours, sounds, and the other secondary qualities. Professor Whitehead's later treatment of his theory may justify the estimate as to its ultimate importance that was reached by a reviewer of Science and the Modern World, who sums it up as follows: " Perhaps its most important effect is to get rid of the idea of an inert valueless matter independent of mind."* Clearly the important word here is " valueless," and Professor Whitehead is, as we have seen, himself responsible for its introduction. What is " value- less " may well be not independent of mind. But considerations of value have nothing to do with the theory of the sense-object as a term in a multiple relation, nor with the consequent rejection of simple location. Professor Whitehead has made not the slightest attempt to reconcile his metaphysic of value with his former theory that " nature is closed to mind." But it is this theory alone that is scientifically based and which will concern us in this section. Does, then, this theory of the multiple ingres- sion of sense-objects entail the dependence of these objects upon mind . Does it justify an idealistic interpretation of modern science ? The difficulty I find in discussing this question is the lack of positive arguments in support of an affirmative answer. Professor Russell says that he is not here concerned to answer the question that he raises. My difficulty is to see why they should be raised. Certainly the assertion that the red patch I see is as I see it and is " there from here " does entail that the red patch would not be apart from-i.e., in complete independence of-the bodily sense-organs. But this is not to say that any term in the relation * Herbert Read, in The New Criterion, May, 1926.</page><page sequence="19">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 117 is either mind or mind-dependent. The working out of the theory is complicated because the facts that have to be taken into account, viz., all that is observed, are complicated. The simplicity of theories based upon the distinction between primary and secondary qualities has certainly gone. But the simplicity of these theories was gained by the hypostatisation of abstractions which no modern theory of sense-perception could accept. It seems clear that we must reject the traditional dualism between the mental, taken as including the secondary qualities, and the physical, taken as excluding them. As Professor Whitehead put it: " The real question is: When red is found in nature, what else is found there also ? "* How is it supposed that the resort to mind would help us in the solution of this problem ? It seems to me that those who think it would are being half- hearted in their rejection of bifurcation theories and are not prepared to carry through the fundamental revision of the traditional conceptions that such a rejection should entail. They are too much influenced by the traditional notion of physical objects as determined by considerations of touch, and are thus led to raise difficulties due to a conception which, in comparative ignorance of the transmissive side of nature, grew out of this common-sense notion of a physical thing. But it was just the inadequacy of the traditional concepts to deal with what is in fact observed that led to bifurcation, with its result, the resort to mind. The acceptance of more adequate concepts and the consequent recognition of multiple relations in nature frees us from both difficulties at once. To Professor Russell's question, therefore, I can only reply: Why on earth should we be led to a " thoroughgoing idealism ? " Perhaps he does not think we should be. Nevertheless, he thinks the question worth asking. * The Concept of Nature, p. 41.</page><page sequence="20">118 L. S. STEBBING. I do not wish to deny that from the first there have been indications in Professor Whitehead's philosophy that his dictum, " Nature is closed to mind," was merely a methodological prin- ciple.* But I should contend that Whitehead's inconsistencies on this point are due to his conception of passage and have nothing whatever to do either with his theory of sense-objects or with his analysis of matter as an abstraction of a high degree of abstractness. Is there anything in this latter conception that justifies an idealistic interpretation of Professor Whitehead's philosophy of nature ? A distinguished philosopher, Professor HoernlA, has so interpreted it. He speaks of Whitehead's " attack on 'matter'" and claims him as a foremost supporter of the " revolt against ' matter,' " which, according to Professor Hoernl6, is the most significant characteristic of modern science. The word " revolt " suggests the attitude which Professor IHoernl6 adopts with regard to the problem and which finds expression in such a statement as the following : " The suspicion that science is committed to 'materialism' arouses misgiving, if not hostility, in many quarters and tends to bring undeserved discredit upon science."t He is concerned to refute the charge and to save the credit of science. In this project he is glad to enlist Professor Whitehead as an ally. But in what exactly does the " revolt against ' matter' " consist ? Professor Hoernl6 points out that " in this whole situation there is much confusion of thought, resulting from the failure to distinguish the different senses of ' matter.' We are all far too apt to take it for granted that we know what the term' matter' means." After distinguish- ing four different senses in which the term " matter " is constantly * I have dealt with this question in an article in Mind, July, 1924, and shall not pursue it here as it is not relevant to the present topic. Doubtless, however, Professor Whitehead's treatment of this problem has done much to lend support to the interpretation I am concerned to reject. t Matter, Life, Mind, God, p. 49.</page><page sequence="21">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 119 used, Professor Hoernle argues that the fourth sense, viz., " the imperceptible cause of our sensations," is now definitely abandoned and with it the older materialism which was to a considerable extent based upon this conception. This is true. But what justification is there for describing this revision of fundamental concepts as a " revolt" against " (matter) " or for suggesting that it should dispel the " suspicion that science is committed to ' materialism'" ? The " dematerialisation of matter," as it has been called, does not aid the " revolt " against materialism in any sense in which materialism can " bring discredit to science " or " arouse mis- givings." It is not the alleged fact that there is an imperceptible and unknowable cause of our sensations that is at the root of such misgivings. Rather it is the claim of the scientist to bring all our " sensations " within the scope of scientific laws that constitutes the main objection to such theories. The point that is important for the opponent of materialism is the con- ception of laws rather than the conception of matter. Doubtless the change in the latter concept has bearing upon the former. But its significance consists rather in a change of attitude on the part of the scientist than in any given analysis of the nature of matter. It is, therefore, the third of the three points I referred to above in which modern science seems to be incompatible with " scientific materialism " that is of central importance for our discussion. (iii.) There can be little doubt that scientific materialism was excessively anthropomorphic and the man in whose form the universe was constructed was the physicist qua physicist. His success in his chosen field of research led him to dogmatize beyond the confines of his science and to feel certain that he knew the characters of everything in the universe. Consequently, he felt completely satisfied that, working from a few ultimate concepts,</page><page sequence="22">120 L. S. STEBBING. he would be able either to deduce, or to reduce to shadows that could be ignored, not only all that we perceive, but also all that we feel and desire, or that could be felt and desired. The pre- vailing fashion extended in the nineteenth century from physics to the science of society. Thus Huxley, the brilliant popularizer of other men's discoveries, wrote confidently: " Anyone who is acquainted with the history of science will admit that its progress has, in all ages, meant, and now, more than ever, means, the extension of the province of what we call matter and causation, and the concomitant gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity. . . . And as surely as every future grows out of past and present, so will the physiology of the future gradually extend the realm of matter and law until it is coextensive with knowledge, with feeling, and with action." He points out that " the consciousness of this great truth weighs like a nightmare upon many of the best minds of these days. . . . The advancing tide of matter threatens to drown their souls; the tightening grasp of law impedes their freedom; they are alarmed lest man's moral nature be debased by the increase of his wisdom."* There is despite the difference of language and the reversal in the method of approach, a surprising kinship between this statement and that of Professor Hoernl6's quoted above. I am not here concerned with Huxley's attempt to dispel the nightmare, which would not, I think, commend itself to-day to any philosopher. Rather I am concerned to indicate the sources of the nightmare in a cocksure dogmatism that not only felt confident that it knew exactly what "matter " was, but also conceived of a huge impersonal Law controlling everything, even the desires of those who were depressed at its omnipotence. Hence, the prevalence of the term the " reign of law " to indicate the scientific outlook of the nineteenth century. It is this * Lay Sermons, 1870, p. 156.</page><page sequence="23">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 121 conception rather than the billiard-ball view of matter that is the basis of that scientific materialism which, to so many men of Huxley's generation, appeared-in their non-professional moments -as a nightmare. We must consider, therefore, in what way the scientific con- ception of law has changed. So much has lately been written on this subject that it is not necessary to say much here. All that I wish to do is to point out the bearing of this conception upon the philosophy of nature. The Newtonian cosmology affords the best example of the reign of law. In the system of Laplace it reached its most perfect formulation. It is true that Newton himself wrote: " This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being." This statement, with much more to the same effect, occurs in a discussion of the theory of vortices in the General Scholium at the end of Book III of the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. But to-day such a statement would be felt to be out of place in a serious work on astronomical physics. Moreover, the belief in God was no part of the evidence upon which Newton based his " experimental " researches. Those researches, whether Newton desired it or not, made possible the ideal of scientific determinism. Theistic scientists who have accepted the Newtonian mechanical system have usually followed the precedent, already established by Boyle,t of appealing to the " concourse of God " to keep the system going. Laplace showed clearly that no such concourse is necessary. The recog- nition of this fact played an important part in the scientific t See The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle, 1744, Vol. III, p. 450. " The laws of motion being settled, and all upheld by his [God's] incessant concourse and general providence, the phenomena of the world thus constituted are physically produced by the mechanical affections of the parts of matter, and what they operate upon one another according to mechanical laws." Cf. also (III, p. 516.)</page><page sequence="24">122 L. S. STEBBING. outlook of the nineteenth century. To-day the situation is changed wholly as the result of the advance of science itself. The geometrising of physics has revealed how abstract is that knowledge of the external world which we call physical science. On this point all recent writers on the philosophy of science are agreed. Evidence of the correctness of this statement can be found in the writings of Professor Weyl, Professor Edding- ton and Mr. Bertrand Russell, as well as in those of Professor Whitehead. They are too well known for it to be necessary for me to quote at length from them now. Two quotations will suffice. Professor Eddington says :- " Leaving out all westhetic, ethical, or spiritual aspects of our environment, we are faced with qualities such as massive- ness, substantiality, extension, duration, which are supposed to belong to the domain of physics. In a sense they do belong, but physics is not in a position to handle them directly. The essence of their nature is inscrutable; we may use mental pictures to aid the calculation, but no image in the mind can be a replica of that which is not in the mind. And so in actual procedure physics studies not these inscrutable qualities, but pointer-readings which we can observe. The readings, it is true, reflect the fluctuations of the world- qualities; but our exact knowledge is of the readings, not of the qualities. The former have as much resemblance to the latter as a telephone number has to a subscriber. .... " Until recently physicists took it for granted that they had knowledge of the entities dealt with, which was of a more intimate character; and the difficulties which many find even now in accepting the theory of relativity arises from an unwillingness to give up these intuitions or traditions as to the intrinsic nature of space, time, matter and force,</page><page sequence="25">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 123 and substitute for them a knowledge expressible in terms of the reading of measuring instruments."* Mr. Bertrand Russell writes :- " The essence of matter appears to be this: We can distinguish series of events in space-time which have a certain kind of close resemblance to each other, such that common sense regards them as manifestations of one 'thing.' But when we look closely at the question, it turns out that what physics offers is something more abstract than this. Take, e.g., the continued existence of a certain electron. This means to say that events in a certain neighbourhood will be such, as can be calculated on the assumption that there is an electric charge of a certain standard magnitude in the middle of that neighbourhood; and that the neighbour- hoods of which this is true form a tube in space-time. " So long as we stick to the standpoint of pure physics there is a certain air of taking in each other's washing about the whole business. Events in empty space are only known as regards their abstract mathematical characteristics; matter is only an abstract mathematical characteristic of events in empty space." Again: - " What Dr. Whitehead calls the 'pushiness' of matter disappears altogether on this view. 'Matter' is a con- venient formula for describing what happens where it isn't. I am talking physics, not metaphysics; when we come to metaphysics, we may be able, tentatively, to add something to this statement, but science alone can hardly add to it."t With regard to the bearing of this changed conception of the * The Domain of Physical Science in Science, Religion and Reality, p. 199. t Outline of Philosophy, pp. 152-153; 165.

STEBBING. nature of scientific knowledge upon the problem of materialism these writers are, however, not in complete agreement. Mr. Bertrand Russell thinks that "materialism as a philosophy becomes hardly tenable in view of this evaporation of matter. But," he adds, " those who would formerly have been materialists can still adopt a philosophy which comes to much the same thing in many respects." Professor Eddington is rather concerned to point out that: "In considering the relations between science and religion it is a very relevant fact that physics is now in course of abandoning all claim to a type of knowledge which it formerly asserted without hesitation. . . . The difficulty does not lie in recognising a wider spiritual reality from which the physical world is a specialized selection. The difficulty is to explain why the physical world, picked out from a more comprehensive world by the criterion of measurability, should be found to constitute a self-contained system; it operates with so little interference from the rest of reality that we often forget that it is only a part." If I understand their attitude aright, both Mr. Russell and Professor Eddington are in agreement that the abstract knowledge of physics stands in need of interpretation. It is in their respec- tive interpretations that their divergence becomes irreconcilable, the one tending to an interpretation that is essentially material- istic, the other to an interpretation, that is clearly idealistic. In what exactly does the contrast consist ? We have just seen that Mr. Russell considers that materialism as a philosophy is not now tenable. But what is essential to materialism is, as Professor L. J. Russell has pointed out above, that " all the sciences in the end reduce to physics."* This seems to me to be equivalent to the statement that old-fashioned materialism is to be replaced by scientific determinism. Hence the central importance of the conception of law. But it is not at all easy to make out what exactly is meant by scientific determinism. As a recent writer, * See supra, p. 110.</page><page sequence="27">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 125 Professor Bridgman, puts it: " Determinism to the physicist is simply a way of stating certain implications of his conviction of the connectivity of nature."* Professor Bridgman, having stated that, " by determinism we understand the belief that the future of the whole universe, or an isolated part of it, is determined in terms of a complete description of its present condition," attempts to determine what we mean by " present condition," and in so doing points out that the physical operations involved in the attempt have meaning only within a " penumbra of uncertainty." He sums up the result of his inquiry in the state- ment: " With this enlarged understanding of what we mean by present state of the system, it seems to me that physical evidence is now rather favourable to the view that the present determines the future, subject to qualification about the penumbra, at least as far as large-scale phenomena are concerned. It appears more doubtful when we come to small-scale phenomena, and in parti- cular it is doubtful whether the principle can be applied to the details of the quantum process, and, in fact, it is not certain that it has meaning. It is certain that if it is true an enormous amount of structure beyond any that has yet been detected is implied." Mr. Bertrand Russell would, I think, be in agreement with this statement; nevertheless, he seems to me to make various inconsistent statements with regard to the universality of physical laws. Thus he says: " We cannot escape from the universality of physical causation," and, on the same page, he writes, " We have seen that, on the basis of physics itself, there may be limits to physical determinism."t Again, he writes: " Mind is merely a cross-section in a stream of physical causation, and there is nothing odd about its being both an effect and a cause in the physical world. Thus physical laws are those that are fundamental." j * The Logic of Modern Physics, p. 211. t The Analysis of Matter, p. 393. I Outline of Philosophy, p. 156.</page><page sequence="28">126 L. S. STEBBING. Professor Eddington takes a different view. Discussing the question of the " direct interference of mind and spirit with the course of events in the material world," he asks, " Is the motion of the editor's pencil to grammatically amend the split infinitive in this sentence simply the automatic response under physical laws of a complicated configuration of electrons to the external stimulus of this smear of ink on paper ? Such an ex*avagant hypothesis might conceivably appeal to the crude materialist who supposes that the world of electrons is the fundamental reality. But we have seen that the external world of physics is in the first place approached by way of consciousness, and that it relates only to certain aspects of the common basis of material and spiritual things. The dance of electrons in the brain is only a material aspect of mental states and resolutions occuning, and there is no reason why it should claim to reveal the whole inner constitution by which one mental state leads to another."* He does not minimise the difficulties in the way of admitting such an interference with the " statistical laws " of physics, but I have no space here to follow his discussion. What is important to note is that Eddington's view depends upon his interpretation of physical laws as gaining actuality only through mind. He sums up his position as follows: " Our thesis has been that the recent tendencies of scientific thought lead to the belief that mind is a greater instrument than was formerly recognised in prescribing * Op. cit., p. 124. Cf. Mathematical Theory of Relativity, §103. " The world which we have to build up from the crude material is the world of perception, and the process of building must depend on the nature of the percipient. Many things may be built up out of G,uv, but they will only appear in the perceptual world if the percipient is interested in them. We cannot exclude the consideration of what kind of things are likely to appeal to the percipient. The building process of the mathematical theory must keep step with that process by which the mind of the percipient endows with nsid qualities certain selected structural properties of the world." Cf. also Space, Time, Gratlitation, p. 201.</page><page sequence="29">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 127 the nature and laws of the external world as studied in physical science; that in exploring his own territory the physicist comes up against the influence of that wider reality which he cannot altogether shut out; and that by its selection of values the mind may indeed be said to have created its physical environ- ment."* Professor Eddington's idealistic interpretation seems to me to depend, therefore, upon two main considerations. First, the conventionality of laws; second, the necessity for introducing actuality into the cycle of definitions that constitutes theoretical physics. How does this bear upon our problem ? It seems to me that even if it be granted that physical laws are only expres- sible in terms of those things for which the human mind has an affinity, it does not follow that mind is not itself an element within that physical scheme, and subject to those laws. Nor does the change from " laws of nature " to " conventions " and " principles " necessitate any such ascription to mind of a dominating position in the universe. On the other hand, it is clear that modern physics is compatible with such a view as Eddington's, and if he were right, mind would have a position with regard to nature much less external and unintelligible than the position ascribed to God by Boyle and Newton.t The pro- blem, therefore, hinges upon the questions: Is nature closed to mind, or does mind itself fall within nature ? Does mind give laws to nature, or is mind itself describable wholly in terms of natural laws ? The discovery that it is no longer possible to answer these questions by a simple Yes, or No, is the main contribution made by recent scientific thought to the problem of materialism. To sum up. Following the lead given by Professor Russell, I have confined my discussion to the bearing of modern thought * Loc. cit., p. 217. t Such an interpretation would, I think, be idealistic in the sense defined by Professor Kemp Smith.</page><page sequence="30">128 L. S. STEBBING. in the physical sciences upon the problem of materialism. Doubt- less there is much of importance to be added from the point of view of biology. I am, however, completely ignorant of biology and could not pursue this topic, even if space permitted. I have endeavoured to show that the respects in which modern science is incompatible with scientific materialism afford us no grounds for an idealistic interpretation of physics. The belief to the contrary is commonly based upon the illegitimate intro- duction of considerations of value into the philosophy of nature. Professor Whitehead's vague language and undeveloped hints have done much to encourage this belief. It seems to me that the dematerialisation of matter in no sense constitutes a " revolt " against matter. To reduce the electron to a complicated equation, or to a logical construction, is not to avoid the difficulties of a materialistic philosophy. Nor does it seem to me that Professor Whitehead's theory of the multiple ingression of sense objects has any bearing upon this problem. What is of central import- ance is the conception of law. It must be admitted that the " reign of law " is a conception much less precise and much less useful for physics than was formerly supposed. The exact nature and scope of scientific determinism is, therefore, still an open question. The recognition of this fact does constitute an important difference between the modern scientific outlook and that of the last three centuries. It is, therefore, not impossible to interpret science idealistically, but there is nothing in modern science that necessitates such an interpretation. Professor Eddington accepts one interpretation; Mr. Bertrand Russell tends to the other. Perhaps all that we can say is that Professor Eddington, mindful of spiritual values, is ready to assert the reality of man's freedom; whereas Mr. Russell, impressed with the importance of physics, would like to assert the universality of physical laws. The final decision does not lie within the con- sideration of science. All that can be said is that the attitude of</page><page sequence="31">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 129 the physical scientist has changed, and so profoundly that the change may even be described as " revolutionary."* Dogmatic certainty and legal precision have given way to the cautious statement of possibilities. But where philosophical scientists hesitate, it is, in my opinion, a mistake for idealist philosophers and theologians to rush in to interpret these cautious statements and to base large hopes upon this change of attitude. * Canon Streeter, Reality, p. 28. I</page><page sequence="32">130 III. By A. E. HEATH. (i.) IT has been quietly taken for granted by my collaborators in this symposium that the science in whose light we are to discuss materialism is physical science. There is much to be said for this limitation (quite apart from the fact that none of us are biologists) since in physics we have, as Mr. Sullivan says in his little book Gallio, " the master science of the present day and the one which has furnished ideals for the other sciences." But (he adds) the old materialistic outlook is still active in many less developed branches of science; so that, at a time when physicists are abandoning materialism, many folk are " accept- ing, as the last word of science, a picture of the world that belongs to the early bad manner of physics."* The question we are to explore is whether physicists are, and if so in what sense they are, " abandoning materialism." Or to put it in a wider and more convenient form, what is the philosophical outcome of modern physical science ? I agree with Prof. Russell and Miss Stebbing that recent developments do not give us an unambiguous lead on this question. The discreet line to take is to disentangle the various possibilities. In his extremely interesting reconstruction of the stages by which 'materiality,' as required in modern physics, may be developed, Prof. Russell claims that while the old materialism is excluded, a new form of materialism is possible which contents itself with part of what the old asserted. In view of the re- placement of 'stuff-substance' by more formally defined but * J. W. N. Sullivan, Gallio, or The Tyranny of Science, pp. 16, 49.</page><page sequence="33">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 131 evanescent determinate objects, the new materialism " need not assert anything about the strictly ultimate constituents of things. It is sufficient for it to assert that all the sciences in the end reduce to physics." To this Miss Stebbing adds that " the dematerialism of matter in no sense constitutes a 'revolt ' against matter." Whilst this expresses a truth, I cannot help feeling that it only leaves us the kind of verbal materialism so pleasantly and modestly expressed by Mr. Santayana: "I wait " he says "for men of science to tell me what matter is, in so far as they can discover it, and am not at all surprised or troubled at the abstractness and vagueness of their ultimate conceptions. . . . But whatever matter may be, I call it matter boldly, as I call my acquaintances Smith and Jones without knowing their secrets."* What, however, is meant by the reduction of all the sciences to physics ? " It is enough " Prof. Russell says " if the scientist can correlate variations in the properties of the complex objects with variations in the spatio-temporal relations of their con- stituents." The main force of this is, I take it, to reduce the problem of materialism to that of determining the range of law. Miss Stebbing's contribution tends in the same direction. After showing that, from the point of view of physical science itself, the supposed idealistic tendencies of modern work only arise if we are half-hearted in our rejection of the ' bifurcation theories ' forced on us by the inadequacy of traditional notions, Miss Stebbing goes on to stress the central importance, for our discussion, of the conception of law. In view of what has already been said, I propose to approach the subject from a slightly different direction and to trace the steps by which the conception of law has come to occupy so much more fundamental a place in modern physics than the conception of substance. We shall then be able to consider the philosophical * G. Santayana, Scepticism and Animal Faith, p. viii. 12</page><page sequence="34">132 A. E. HEATH. outcome of this change; and shall find, I think, that it involves more of a break with the scientific than with the philosophical past. (ii.) Physics, like every other science, is an attempt to disclose the 'order' in a particular domain of fact. The entities used for this purpose, in its early stages, are the concrete things of common- sense thought. But very soon physicists found that their inductive generalizations could be much more simply expressed if they were developed in terms of entities of the same type as common-sense things but " stripped conceptually of any properties that happen in a given case to be irrelevant or inconvenient."* Hence there arose a bewildering variety of entities becoming ever more abstract in proportion as the power and range of physical generalization increased. A comprehensive survey of the history of physics enables us to see that these entities are, in each age, selected from among many possible entities according to some criterion. The actual form of physical theories seems, indeed, to have been moulded by certain 'ideals of explanation,' or 'demands,' as Prof. Russell has elsewhere called them. Thus the change from medimeval to modern science can be described in terms of a change in our ideals of explanation.t M. Meyerson has been able to show, with great wealth of detail, that the 'demand' which underlay the rise of modern physics was a deep-rooted conviction of the human mind that a rational interpretation of phenomena has been reached when apparent differences are reduced to a real identity -that there is something which persists throughout change.4 In short, it was a demand which made ' substance ' fundamental. * T. P. Nunn, " Scientific Objects and Common-Sense Things," Proc. Aristot. Soc.,1923-24, p. 3. t See E. A. Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science. $ E. Meyerson, Identit' et Realite, and De l'Explication dans les Sciences.</page><page sequence="35">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 133 Now what is distinctive of twentieth century physics is the stress laid upon another demand altogether-namely, the radically empirical demand that only observable factors shall be considered as in causal dependence. This demand had already received partial satisfaction in earlier times. Thus Newton successfully attempted to banish some ' occult qualities' from natural philosophy, though he was left with others: e.g., absolute space, absolute time and gravitational force-all of which are 'occult qualities' in the sense that it was impossible to detail the physical operations in terms of which they could be detected.* We had to wait for the genius of Einstein to produce the synthesis which would satisfy this last demand in a more thoroughgoing manner. One consequence of the demand for strictly empirical reference is that it leads to a still greater abstractness in the entities used, because the 'model' type of scientific object, like the common-sense thing from which it arose, still contains more than is necessary. Herein is to be found the reason for the characteristic generality of modern physics. We can now grasp something of the transformation which this demand has worked in physical theory. The older physicist was content to provide a common-sense account of a given field of fact in terms of postulated entities, usually complicated in structure but built up of parts familiar to the ordinary untrained person. Nowadays he is likely to be elaborating all the possible sets of elementary analytical concepts and their relations which when developed will have the given facts as consequences. That is why the older methodology of science fails to provide the right atmosphere for modern work.t It must not be * P. W. Bridgman's Logic of Modern Physics is an interesting treatment of physical theory from this angle: what he calls the " operational point of view " amounts to viewing physical concepts in terms of this' demand.' t Cf. D. Wrinch, " The Relations of Science and Philosophy," Journ. of Phil. Studies, Vol. II, No. 6, p. 155.</page><page sequence="36">134 A. E. HEATH. supposed that this method is applicable only to field physics. Heisenberg, for example, made it the basis of his departure from the ordinary quantum theory of the atom ; he attempts to replace a system involving unobservable quantities, such as the position and time of revolution of an electron, by a much more generalized matrix system involving only what can be observed, i.e. the frequencies of its radiation. In this way physicists have been led to substitute, for persistence of substance, the persistence of causal laws. To put it in a crude fashion, substance is replaced by function: that which behaves in the way charac- teristic of matter is matter ; and so on. A Pickwickian materi- ality is therefore still possible ; there is something corresponding to matter (' disturbance of world structure' or what you will) and something corresponding to material particles (' causal- lines of events,' or Prof. Leonard Russell's 'determinate objects '). But it is stretching language to the limits of even Pickwickian decency to speak of a materialism, since these concepts are no longer fundamental but are derived from a wider ' structure.' The problem of their status is hence bound up with the prior question of the nature of the abstract 'structures' in which they are embedded. (iii.) So far we have considered only what has been happening in physical science. The result of these changes has been to widen the gulf between abstract 'structure' and the observa- tions bo which they are referred. Mr. Bertrand Russell describes the situation with his customary felicity: " From its happy familiarity with the everyday world physics has been gradually driven by its own triumphs, like a monarch who has grown too grand to converse with his subjects."* The problem of * Bertrand Russell, The Analysis of Matter, p. 131.</page><page sequence="37">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 135 bridging such a hiatus, in ordinary life, is a social problem-- that of discovering common topics of conversation. Mr. Bertrand Russell's own solution seems to be curiously akin to this.* What is of concern to us, for our present purpose, is not, however, his solution but the position from which he starts : the dichotomy which regards physics as only giving us abstract structure, leaving the gulf between this and what we actually observe to be bridged by 'Interpretation.' On this view physics tells us nothing about the external world but its structure. In a recent paper Mr. Newman has reminded us sternly that if nothing but structure is known about the external world, then nothing of importance can be said about it. Our knowledge about structure, about things that are not percepts, consists only of the kind of things a blind man could be told about a picture. " No important information about the aggregate A, except its cardinal number, is contained in the statement that there exists a system of relations, with A as field, whose structure is an assigned one. For given any aggregate A, a system of relations between its members can be found having any assigned structure compatible with the cardinal number of A."t Applying this, now, to the structure revealed in physical laws, it is clear that the mere existence of a given structure (indicated, of course, by * For it consists in an appeal to what is common to several observers. The reality of the physical object is argued from the observable fact that if a number of people look from different directions at the same object their experiences are related in a particular way, according to what can be approximately called the laws of 'perspective'; and that since it cannot be fortuitous that percepts form part of a centrally organized structure, constituents other than those perceived are part of the structure. t M. H. A. Newman, " Mr. Russell's 'Causal Theory of Perception,' " Mind, N.S., 146, pp. 137-148. Mr. Newman goes on to argue that, in addition to the parts of perspective structure that are immediately known, there must be direct apprehension of a generating relation (which might be called that of " causal proximity ") if Mr. Russell's causal theory of perception is to serve its purpose.</page><page sequence="38">136 A. E. HEATH. physical observations) in itself tells us nothing about the generating relations. Consider the world as a four-dimensional aggregate of point-events and suppose that there exists a system of relations, with the world as field, giving the particular struc- ture indicated by physical laws. Then systems of relations differing from these can be found which would nevertheless give the assigned structure. A variety of 'interpretation' is there- fore possible, and choice must be made according to some criterion. It was probably considerations of this kind which led Prof. Eddington to suggest that our choice depends on that predilection for ' substantial analysis ' whose r8le in the develop- ment of physics we have already described. From that it is but a short step to regarding substance as categorical in the Kantian sense.* (It also, perhaps, gives the clue to Prof. Eddington's use of 'actuality' as an extra-physical notion required if we are to break through the closed circle of physical structure.t) This, if I am correctly interpreting Eddington's thought, gives a more precise expression to what Miss Stebbing has called his difficulty concerning the 'conventionality' of laws. It should be noted, as Prof. Leonard Russell pointed out in his opening paper, that if this view of physics as giving only structure is adopted nothing need, or indeed can, be asserted about the ultimate constituents of the world; so far as physics itself is concerned they may be material or mental or neutral. It would be better, therefore, to avoid calling this view a " new materialism." It might, I suggest, be more correctly described as a form of Structuralism.t * A. S.

What exactly is implied by his statement that the new materialism, or structuralism, reduces all the sciences to physics ? As he defines the requirements this can only be true, it seems to me, if we assume both (1) that our present inability to achieve complete unity between field and atomic physics is a temporary difficulty to which there is no ultimate barrier; and (2) that the so-called ' emergent ' properties of complexes represent, as Mr. Bertrand Russell believes, mere scientific incompleteness, so that the various sciences will finally form a hierarchy in which the primitive concepts of each science are the derived concepts of the science logically prior to it. There is this to be said in favour of these assumptions: that they seem to be embodied in the working method of most men of science. But the first goes beyond what we know; the age- long contrast between continuity and atomism may reflect an intrinsic character of the universe. As to the second, we lack as yet the material, based on logical analysis of causality and induction, for a proper judgment. I think, therefore, that we ought to call this view Pure Structuralism to distinguish it from the position that there really are emergent properties of complexes.* We can now return to our main line of thought. If our percepts are only particulars which lead us up to the structure whilst accepting the structural character of physical law, rejects the 'bifurcation of nature.' * As in Dr. Broad's 'emergent materialism' and Prof. Whitehead's ' organic mechanism.' I do not imply, of course, that either of these philosophers adopts the position described in the previous note as bifurcated structuralism. It might be added that even if emergence is nothing but a profession of ignorance it will continue to be a useful conception so long as complexes like organisms, and even sciences, remain empirically autonomous. Perhaps it will always be useful, since our knowledge is never final.</page><page sequence="40">138 A. E. HEATH. of law but not to the relational reality generating it, then we are as much debarred from knowing the realities of the world as we were when our picture of it was painted in the early bad manner of eighteenth century materialism. There is, fortu- nately, another way open to us. It is to insist from the outset that, since we are not standing blindly before the picture, but see it, we do not need an interpreter : that, in short, the reality of the external world including our fellows is as much a dat1rm of knowledge as disembodied percepts or isolated structures. This is the way taken by Prof. Whitehead in his radical denial of the " bifurcation of nature." Both particulars and structures are equally abstractions from the concrete flux of the " actual occasion," and we commit the fallacy of misplaced concreteness if we forget their character as abstractions: nevertheless both are as genuine characteristics of nature as the flux out of which they arise. Prof. Whitehead's position (so far as I am able to understand his difficult and developing thought) is a ' struc- turalism ' in the sense that it gives due weight to the information supplied in structure; but it does so without accepting the view that structure is all that science can tell us of the external world. In consideration of the stress Prof. Whitehead places upon 'organism,' it might appropriately be called Organic Structuralism. (iv.) The philosophical outcome of modern scientific thought is not, then, a direct materialism. That has been displaced by various forms of structuralism. This is both a loss and a gain. For whilst the generalized character of what is known makes all forms of structuralism vague as to the possibilities that lurk in the recesses of the universe, it nevertheless awakens us to those possibilities. " Thus while our knowledge of what is has</page><page sequence="41">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 139 become less than it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be has enormously increased."* It is now possible, I think, to justify the suggestion I put forward at the beginning, that recent developments involve more of a break with the scientific than with the philosophical past. In science, the passage to an entirely different order of abstractness has wrought a revolution in our whole conception of the universe; but in philosophy, only the grounds of debate have been changed. So long as physical science adhered to the 'model' type of postulated unobservable entity, discussion centred about theories of representative perception. The con- temporary storm-centre for philosophers of science is the nature of abstraction as a cognitive tool, together with such allied matters as causality and inductive inference. Abstraction is an old subject of philosophical debate, of course. But there are reasons for believing that some of the earlier misconceptions can now be avoided, in light of its more deliberate and thorough- going employment in recent developments, and of the enormous advance in its technique. It is clearly a more pliant instrument than ever before. No one can read Prof. Leonard Russell's account of the conceptions now in use without feeling how much more completely the original flux is reflected in them, though without loss in precision. It is necessary to deal briefly with the function of abstraction in science because this brings out, as nothing else can, the changed intellectual climate of scientific thought. It seems clear, for instance, that abstraction is neither mere increase in our discrimination of what was already known in a concrete setting; nor bare omission, and hence falsification. For in the first place scientific abstraction gives genuinely new knowledge, supplied in experience but not necessarily of itself experienced, in such matters as the atomic constitution of bodies, * Bertrand Russell, An Outline of Philosophy, pp. 307, 308.</page><page sequence="42">140 A. E. HEATH. the pre-human history of the earth, and so on. And secondly, scientific abstraction, as we have seen it at work, is plainly integrative and not separative in character: its fruits are structural syntheses. Philosophers are alive to this. Prof. Kemp Smith, in a recent paper, insists that abstraction is more than a methodological device, like a microscope, for studying the partial features of a whole : it is also a recognition of " identi- ties in experience that would otherwise remain in isolation." In abstraction " we are obtaining a knowledge of more than the separate items that make up the real world; we have made a beginning in the task of deciphering what is equally important, its structural pattern."* So that besides the enlargement of our sense of possibilities which structural knowledge brings, there is freedom from the hesitations induced by unfounded fears that abstractive analysis might be either falsification or productive of only 'partial' truth. Science has become both less dogmatic and more assured. That function of the abstract which plays the really funda- mental part in its fruitfulness has still, however, to be mentioned : namely, that " it makes possible apprehension of its counterpart, the uniquely individual."t Increased knowledge of structure brings in its train deeper sensitiveness to individual differences. We do not start with what is individual: that is as much the product of analysis as structure. We only come to realize the ill-adjusted, untidy character of our own individual experiences, for example, when we have travelled a considerable way along the road of abstraction. Now this sense of uniqueness which is, as it were, a bye-product of abstraction also acts as a further check on dogmatism. It makes men more alive to what Clerk Maxwell called 'singularities' in nature. Perhaps that is * N. Kemp Smith, " The Fruitfulness of the Abstract," Proc. Aristot. Soc., 1927-28, p. 206. t N. Kemp Smith, ibid., p. 214.</page><page sequence="43">MATERIALISM IN LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT. 141 why men of science nowadays can face with equanimity such astonishing possibilities as that electrons may be organisms, or that the main structure of physical law does not wholly apply to atomic phenomena. If singular points do disturb the deter- ministic calm of our equations, it need not mean the breakdown of law but only its limitation to other than the unique. I am not sure, therefore, that I can agree with the identification which Miss Stebbing seems to make between the structure of law and determinism. No doubt obscurantists will find in this situation a ground of appeal against all forms of law: but the reply to them is, clearly, that our sense of these singularities only advances with, and is dependent upon, increase in the range and rigour of our structural knowledge. The deepening of our appreciation of those unique and particular characteristics of the world which give adventitious life and colour to individual experience has another bearing upon our discussion. Miss Stebbing has expressed some un- easiness at the way in which Prof. Whitehead appeals to the poet. She deprecates what she feels to be a tendency to introduce notions of value into the scientific scheme itself. I would not like to say that her fears are groundless; but I suggest that there is another way of looking at Prof. Whitehead's sympathy with the protest of the romantic poets against " the exclusion of value from the essence of matter of fact."* It may only indicate his sense of the contrast between man's structural grasp and his sensitiveness to the unique which we have seen to be a product of abstraction.t For it is precisely when moved by a work of art that we experience most fully that intensifying of consciousness, that encircled satisfaction freed from the tyranny * A. N. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, p. 138. t The same contrast, perhaps, as that drawn in Symbolism its Meaning and Effect between the deep significance of causal efficacy and the decorative show of presentational immediacy.</page><page sequence="44">142 A. E. HEATH. of outside significance, which is the developed form in us of " recognition of the uniquely individual." It is as necessary to include these incommunicable but none the less precious experiences in our picture of the world as it is to include sounds and colours. This is not to say, I need scarcely add, that science itself can deal with them. For they are, as such, unique; although the developed character of aesthetic judgment means that it is related to our structural grasp.* Nor does it mean that value enters into the scientific scheme as a determinant of the world order; for in its character as uniqueness it can scarcely determine structure. AEsthetic and moral values have often, it is true, affected our knowledge of the world order, even in science-as when ideals of explanation such as 'relevance,' 'economy,' ' elegance' and the like have been employed. But the history of science is the story of gradual disentanglement from such normative ' demands ' and of steady progress towards a positive, " ethically neutral " empiricism. For these reasons I do not share Miss Stebbing's repugnance to including values in a philosophy of nature. I feel that their presence gives a surety that it is a philosophy of nature. Value, like everything else, must find a natural place in any scheme of thought presented as an account of this amazing world and all that it contains. Eighteenth century materialism did not achieve this consum- mation. Structuralism may. * I mean by this that our sense of unique quality in a work of art will partly depend also upon our appreciation of its formal significance.</page></plain_text>
