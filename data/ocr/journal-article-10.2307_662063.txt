<plain_text><page sequence="1">Twenty-fifth Anniversary Studies. D. S. DAVIDSON (ed.). (Publications, Philadelphia Anthropological Society. Vol. 1. vi, 235 pp., illus. $2.50. Philadelphia: Univer- sity of Pennsylvania Press, 1937.) This volume consists of eighteen papers on specific problems in archaeology, ethnology, and folklore. The bulk of the material has a New World setting but Australia, Melanesia, and Africa are represented also. The collection presents a neat cross-section of the interests and activities of those associated with the Phila- delphia Anthropological Society. The richness and general high quality of these studies render them at once an important contribution and a fitting commemorative record. The number of contributions makes it impossible to comment upon each. Per- haps a random selection may serve to introduce the whole. D. S. Davidson, the editor, considers "The Relation of Tasmanian and Aus- tralian Cultures," and clarifies many of the knotty problems of racial, historical, and cultural affinity. Davidson's conclusion is that the Tasmanians formerly in- habited Australia and migrated to Tasmania at a time when certain elements of recent Australian culture were as yet unknown. "But has not this conclusion been generally accepted for some time past?" it may be queried. It has, of course, though not on the basis of any exhaustive analysis, but rather upon bits of disjointed evi- dence. It was accepted, that is, until very recently when Wood Jones, H. D. Skinner, and Pulleine reopened the question by arguing for an oceanic origin. This was the immediate stimulus for Davidson's study. He shows that these recent efforts, as well as earlier ones, fail to survive critical examination when the whole picture is viewed, rather than an isolated portion. Frederica de Laguna furnishes a provocative "Preliminary Sketch of the Eyak Indians, Copper River Delta, Alaska," based upon her work in association with Kaj Birket-Smith. This compact summary bristles with fascinating problems of</page><page sequence="2">522 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 40, 1938 cultural relationship. "The material and spiritual culture of the Eyak represents a rich blending of Interior Athabaskan, southwestern Alaskan Eskimo, and Tlingit elements." According to Sapir, who examined a vocabulary collected by the author and Norman Reynolds, the Eyak "phonetic system is suggestive of Tlingit, and the language itself may be a new dialect of the Na-Dene group, coordinate with Atha- baskan on the one hand and Tlingit on the other." Customs which appear to have been recently borrowed from the Tlingit include exogamous matrilineal moieties, potlatch houses, and practices surrounding death. Ranking appears to be absent. Avoidance is practiced between mother-in-law and son-in-law, between grown brothers and sisters, and possibly between father- and daughter-in-law. A joking relationship is recognized between brother- and sister-in-law. Wife lending and ex- change are known. Religious beliefs parallel those of the Eskimo, especially in the extensive application of the anthropomorphic soul idea. Other aspects of the culture are similarly blended, the sketch indicates. The appearance of the full Eyak ethnog- raphy is eagerly to be anticipated. Loren C. Eiseley, under the title "Index Mollusca and their Bearing on Certain Problems of Prehistory: A Critique," examines the available data with particular reference to the American Southwest. He warns that we must not permit over- enthusiasm for a new approach to blind us to its shortcomings. Conchologists them- selves stand divided on the fundamental question of whether minute differences between forms, especially metrical differences, are correlated with variation in cli- mate, habitat, and general environment, or are merely the result of normal varia- tion and overlapping. Until this matter is settled with reasonable finality any ap- plication of conchological data to archaeological problems must remain tentative. Further, the paucity of material from critical areas is especially serious where the reliability of a placement is proportional to the number of specimens on which the norm is based. But, as Eiseley points out, these difficulties should not lead to the abandonment of an approach which still retains promise, especially since the more certain method of pollen analysis is not applicable to a great part of the High Plains. Frank G. Speck resumes his Catawba studies with a description of "Catawba Medicines and Curative Practices." Therapy here consists largely in the use of herbal prescriptions. Ritual curing is apparently quite absent, in contrast to Chero- kee practice. Speck lists the diagnostic categories which are recognized and trans- lates a considerable number of prescriptions. Dorothy M. Spencer contributes psychologically significant data on "Fijian Dreams and Visions," but confounds the reader with an over-use of native terms. For example: "The dream meant that Saiyasi would die without making a mandrali for his luve-ni-wai spirit." The word yajgona is substituted for the familiar term kava; the translation is contained in a footnote (p. 201). "Cross-cousin Marriage in the Lake Winnipeg Area" is discussed by A. Irving Hallowell. This type of marriage is found to be a traditional and still persisting form among many of the Cree and Salteaux. Marriage and kinship practices on the western side of the lake show variations which are interpreted as the result of mod-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 523 ern local conditions. Turning to the larger problem, Hallowell concludes that "north- ern Algonkian kinship systems are likewise intelligible as variants of a basic pattern that has undergone modification as a result of acculturative processes and differ- ences in local conditions" (p. 108). This solution runs parallel to that offered by Eggan for the kinship confusions encountered in the Gulf states.' Other contributors are: W. N. Brown, Mary Butler, J. L. Cotter, Frank M.
