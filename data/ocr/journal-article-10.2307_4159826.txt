<plain_text><page sequence="1">PENGUINS. By John Sparks and Tony Soper. David &amp; Charles, Newton Abbot, 1967. 263 pp., 33 photos, 24 main text illus. by Robert Gillmor. 45s ($4.95 in Great Britain; $8.95 from Taplinger Publishing Company in United States). To write a popular yet accurate hook on penguins can be a difficult task. For the sake of popularity, the temptation is to emphasize anthropomorphic interpretations of penguin stance and behavior. John Sparks and Tony Soper have admirably converted "cute" penguins to real birds. Inaccuracies tend to be minor and limited to missing decimal points (on page 60, only 1.5 per cent of territory-holding Adelie Penguins change rookeries, not 15 per cent), erroneous temperature conversions (on page 76 we find -40?C converted to -30?F), perhaps some unwarranted generalizations about thermoregulation and finally a few confusing phrases (on page 212, Adelie Penguins "nest at the foot of gentle ice-cliff slopes"). After a brief introduction, the authors thoroughly convince their readers that penguins are birds supremely adapted to an aquatic way of life. The two following chapters on breeding behavior and movements seem too brief and ignore many fascinating problems concerning social behavior and population dynamics. In the discussion of feeding habits and predation, the reader finds good illustrations of high-latitude food chains and the depredations of South Polar Skuas, leopard seals, and man. I most enjoyed the final chapters concerning evolution, discovery, and exploitation.

Although there are severe inequalities in what we know about the various species of penguins, the book "Penguins" presents a well balanced picture of all penguins, both their differences and similarities. The combination of easily understood language and wonderfully correct illustrations by Robert Gillmor make this a fine book about a popular group of birds.-R. L. PENNEY.</page></plain_text>
