<plain_text><page sequence="1">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHATUN By Dominic Parviz Brookshaw McGill University, Montreal The history of fourteenth-century Shiraz is one of murder, intrigue and civil unrest. Having been largely spared the destruction suffered by many parts of Iran at the hands of the Mongols in the thirteenth century, following the death of the last great Il-Khan AbM Sa'id Bahadur in 735/1335, Fars and its capital Shiraz fell into anarchy, as rival members of the Injiid family fought against each other and the Muzaffarids and Jalayirids for control of southern Iran. In 743/1343, the Injuid prince Shaykh AbM Ishaq gained control of Fars and ruled from Shiraz for a decade before he was ousted by his chief rival, the Muzaffarid ruler of Yazd, Amir Muhammad Mubariz al-Din. The reign of Shaykh Abu Ishaq, although marred by unsuccessful and bloody campaigns aimed at wresting Yazd and Kirman from Mubariz al-Din, was also characterised by a flourishing of Persian literature not witnessed in Shiraz since the time of Sa'di (d. c. 693/1292). Some of the most famous poets in Iran's literary history (e.g. Hiafiz, 'Ubayd-i Zakani, Khvaju-yi Kirmani) lived in Shiraz during this period and composed poetry for the Injiid court. The reign of Mubariz al-Din (in Shiraz 754-59/1353-58) was not so favourable for Persian belles lettres. The long reign of his eldest son, Shah Shuja' (759-65/1358-64 and 767-86/1366-84), however, created an atmosphere inclined towards the arts and provided sufficient political stability to allow those poets who had been active at the court of Shaykh Aba Ishaq to produce poetry of a comparable (if not superior) calibre to that which they had composed under the Injiids.' Shiraz once again became a centre for poets, who vied with one another for Shah Shuja'"s favour. The most influential of these poets was IIHafiz, champion of the Persian ghazal. It was in such an environment that the woman poet Jahan-Malik Khaftun lived and wrote.2 In this article I hope to show both how Jahan-Malik fits into what we know of the literary scene of fourteenth-century Shiraz, and how her poetry compares with that of some of her better-known male contemporaries. 1. JAHAN-MALIK KHATJN, HER LIFE AND POETRY Until the beginning of the twentieth century, literacy among women in Iran was extremely low. Few women were taught to read and write because it was commonly held that literacy, in the case of women, could lead to perversion and moral laxity. In addition, it was in the interests of men in positions of power to keep women (and the masses in general) illiterate, so that their privileged status in society would not be threatened or compromised. The composition and performance of poetry was considered by many to be improper for women. There were notable exceptions to this rule, however, and in most periods, a number of women of noble birth, who were often actively engaged in the affairs of court, studied and authored works in both Persian and Arabic, and, in a number of cases, composed poetry of a similar calibre to that of their male counterparts. Jahan-Malik Khatfin was one such woman.3 Jahan-Malik Khatun was the granddaughter of Sharaf al-Din Mahmad Shah (d. 736/1336), the founder of the Injoiid dynasty. Jahan-Malik's father, Jalal al-Din Mas'ud Shah (d. 743/1343), was Mahmiuid's eldest son, who ruled Fars c. 736-39/1336-39. Jahan-Malik's youngest uncle, Shaykh Aba Ishaq (d. 758/1357), ruled Shiraz from 743-54/1343-53 and was praised for his generosity as a patron by .Hafiz and other poets active in Shiraz during his lifetime and after his death.4 On her mother's side, she was directly descended from the famous Ilkhanid vizier, Rashid al-Din Fadlallah.5 Her stepmother was the Chapanid princess, Sultan-Bakht bint Dimashq Khvaja, who married Mas'ad Shah Inju in Baghdad in 743.6 Sultan-Bakht's sister, Dilshad Khattin, married Shaykh I.asan Ilkanl (d. 755/1354), and was the mother of Shaykh Uvays Ilkani. This close family rela- tionship to Shaykh Uvays Ilkani may have meant that Jahan-Malik enjoyed financial support and protection, not only from her stepmother, Sultan-Bakht, but also the</page><page sequence="2">174 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Jalayirids.7 Her exact birth and death dates have yet to be ascertained, although her parents appear to have married in 725/1324, so she must have been born some time after that. It seems that Mas'iid Shah had no sons, and that Jahan-Malik was his only daughter.8 This may have meant that she received an even better education than some of the other Injtiid princesses. Her husband Amin al-Din JahrumI was Shaykh Abui Ishlaq's boon companion or nadim.9 The couple married some time between 744-48/1343-47.1o After Jahan-Malik's father was killed in 743/1342, her uncle, Shaykh Abu Ishaq, acted as her guardian and, given his love for literature, he may well have encouraged her to compose poetry. When Shiraz was taken by the Muzaffarid prince Mubariz al-Din in 754/1353, Shaykh Abi Ishaq fled to Isfahan and was subsequently captured, brought back to Shiraz and executed in the Maydan-i Sa'adat in 758/1357.11 After the murder of her uncle, Jahan-Malik appears to have stayed in Shiraz and lived alongside her family's enemies; this cannot have been an easy time for the princess, especially during the harsh reign of Mubariz al-Din. She appears to mock Mubariz al-Din in her poetry,12 and, in contrast, praises Shah Shujac, his eldest son and successor, who deposed his father and ruled in Shiraz 759-65/1358-63 and 767-86/1366-84.13 Shah Shuja was much more inclined to the arts than his late father had been and, during his reign, Shiraz regained its earlier reputation as a centre for poetry.14 It seems that Jahan-Malik lived until the last decades of the eighth century A.H., at least until 784/1382, since in her poetry she also praises the Jalayirid prince Ahmad Bahadur b. Shaykh Uvays, who ruled in Isfahan from that year.'5 In one of her ghazals, Jahan-Malik appears to praise Miranshah b. Timur (d. 811/1408) who was appointed governor of Khurasan in 782/1380 and later governor of Adharbayjan in 795/1393. If this ghazal was indeed written for Miranshah, this could mean that she died some time after 1393.16 She also seems to praise Shah Mansur b. Shah Muzaffar (Shah Shuj~'s nephew) who ruled briefly in Shiraz before the city came under direct Timiirid control in 795/1393.17 Jahan-Malik's takhallus or pen-name (which she uses most eloquently in her poetry) was "Jahan" or "World".'8 As mentioned above, Jahan-Malik Khatun lived in Shiraz at the same time as much better-known poets such as Khvaju-yi Kirmani (d. 753/1352 or 762/1360), 'Ubayd-i Zakani (d. 772/1371), and H. afiz (d. 791/1389). It seems certain that Jahan-Malik was acquainted with 'Ubayd-i Zakani, who, according to Dawlatshah, lampooned her in disparaging and vulgar terms in at least two poems. In one poem, 'Ubayd-i Zakani advises Amin al-Din Jahrumi not to marry her; in the other one, 'Ubayd criticises her and implies that she cannot write good poetry because she is a woman.19 Writing in c. 892/1487, Dawlatshah praises Jahan-Malik Khatuin, calling her a "refined woman" (zarifa) who was the "beauty of her time" (jamila-yi dahr) and renowned in her city (shuhra-yi shahr). He says she wrote most pleasant (dil-padhir) poetry, and that she engaged with 'Ubayd-i Zakani in poetry competitions (mushdaara) and debates (mundzara). She is mentioned in at least one other early anthology, Fakhri Hiravi's Javahir al-'aji'ib, composed in 963/1555. This tadhkira contains the biographies of over twenty female poets (starting with Mahsati) and presents examples of their poetry. In this work, Fakhri Hiravi writes that Jahan was one of the most famous poets of Shiraz (az mashdhir-i shu'ard-yi Shirdz bad) and that she was incomparably beautiful. He says that the zurafd' and the nudamd' always gathered in her majlis, and that she was their leader (u ra'dyat-i in td'ifa mi-karda). Fakhri Hiravi suggests that 'Ubayd was jealous of her thriving majdlis, and that it was this envy that lead to their mushd'ara. He then mentions the same vulgar poem by Ubayd quoted by Dawlatshah, but he says that 'Ubayd composed this poem after hearing that the vizier Khvaja Qavam al-Din (not Amin al-Din Jahrumi) had married Jahan.20 Fakhri Hiravi ends his discussion of Jahan by quoting the opening lines of the same (lost) qasida quoted by Dawlatshah.21 Gulchin- Ma'ani considers the Javdhir al-'ajd'ib as the earliest tadhkira on women poets to have been compiled in Persian.22 The author of the Muntakhab al-tavdrikh-i mu'ini, Mu'in al-Din Natanzi, writing in the early years of the ninth/fifteenth century, describes Jahan-Malik as a most capable women (mustacidda) whose poems were well known (macrih).23 The published edition of Jahan-Malik's divan, which comprises a four-page introduction written by Jahan herself, four qasidas, one tarji'band, a lengthy marthiya, 12 muqaat.ta's, 357 rubdris and 1,413 ghazals, is the largest known divan to have survived from any woman poet of pre-modern Iran.24 Like her famous male con- temporary .Hfiz, she was primarily a ghazal poet, and a prolific one at that.25 The large number of rub'ris in her divdn suggests that she may well have written her poetry for performance at intimate majdlis or at less formal, private wine and poetry parties.</page><page sequence="3">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHATUN 175 In order to assess the degree of influence Jahan-Malik might have had in contemporary Shiraz (whether politically or as a poet), we must look to contemporary sources for insights into the role played by other royal women of her era in the political and cultural life of the city. The famous Arab traveller Ibn Battiita visited Shiraz during the reign of Shaykh Abi Ishaq and provides us with an invaluable contemporary description of fourteenth-century Shirazi women, who, he says, give alms and are upright, religious and chaste. He says that Shirazi women cover from head to toe when they leave their homes and do not expose any part of their body. According to his travelogue, every Monday, Thursday and Friday, the women of the city gathered to listen to the preacher (waiz) in the great mosque (most likely the Jami'-i CAtiq); he estimates the number of women who took part in such gatherings at somewhere between one to two thousand, and states that he has never seen such a gathering of women in any other country.26 In his section on Shiraz, Ibn Batutta also mentions Shaykh AbuO Ishaq's Turkish mother, Thshi Khatun.27 He writes that once, when he went to call on the judge Majd al-Din Ismalil Fall (d. 756/1355), he found the judge's door was closed, since Tashi Khatan and her daughter had come to ask the judge to settle a dispute that had arisen between them over an inheritance.28 Ibn Battita also describes how, when the Chupanid Pir .usayn had arrested Shaykh Abu Ishaq, Shah Masctd and Tashi Khatin in order to deport them from Shiraz, Tashi Khatan uncovered her face as they were passing the bazaar and pleaded with the Shirazis to free them, which they did.29 Fashi Khatufin founded a madrasa, the Khatuniyya (or Madrasa-yi Fashi) in the city c. 743/1343, and later made extensive additions to the Shah Chiragh shrine complex, next to which she built a tomb for herself.30 She also endowed the shrine with villages and farmland near to Maymand, which were in her name,31 and also donated a number of fine Qur'ans in the hand of the accomplished contemporary calligra- pher Yahya JamalI to the Shah Chiragh shrine.32 Ibn Battuita says that Tashi Khatan visited the Shah Chiragh every Monday evening, when the city's judges, jurists and descendants of the Prophet (ashrdf sing. shar/) met, and that she would observe their gathering from a private room overlooking the mosque.33 Malik Khattn bint Maihmud Shah, Jahan-Malik's paternal aunt (and perhaps the daughter with whom TashI Khatun fell out over inheritance matters), also patronised the construc- tion of a religious building in the city.34 Khan-Sultan bint Ghiyath al-Din Kay-Khusraw, Jahan-Malik's cousin, married the Muzaffarid prince Shah Mahmad, Shah Shuja's younger brother and rival.35 In 766/1365 Khan-Sultan took an active role in defending Shiraz in the absence of her husband from the attacks of Shah Shujac's army.36 Khan-Sultan later turned against her husband and almost succeeded in inciting Shah Shujac to attack her husband's army and take Isfahan.37 Khan-Sultan's change of heart came about when she learned that her husband planned to take a new wife. Khan-Sultan's plan failed and, in 768/1367, when Shah Mahmud learned of his wife's treachery, he had her killed; an act that he later regretted.38 This shows that Injiid princesses continued to play a role in the political life of Fars even after the overthrow of the last Injuid ruler, Shaykh Abi Ishaq. These Injuid relatives of Jahan-Malik were not the first royal women to take an active role in the political affairs of Shiraz. During the reign of the Salghurids (543-681/1148-1282), a number of women ruled Fars. Following the untimely death of her husband, Sald II, Turkan Khatan, a noblewoman related to the Atabaks of Yazd, ruled Shiraz as regent for her son Muhammad b. Sald.39 She brought her husband's body back to Shiraz and buried it in the Madrasa-yi cAdudiyya which she had founded in the name of her son.40 When she became regent, she sent gifts and letters to the Mongol ruler Halagu. When Turkan Khatan's son died in 661/1262, control of Shiraz passed to his father's cousin Muhammad Shah, who married Turkan's daughter Salghum. Muhammad Shah ruled for only a year, control of the city then passing to his equally incompetent brother Saljtq Shah, who subsequently married Turkan Khatun. Hulagi had Saljuq Shah killed in 663/1264, but not before Saljtq Shah had killed Turkan in a fit of rage. In that same year Abish Khatan was appointed Atabak of Fars, and jointly ruled the province with her husband, Hulagui's fourth son Mingui Timur, 663-81/1264-82.41 Mingui Timar died in 681/1282, and in 683/1284 Abish Khatun was involved in a revolt against the Mongol governor, and seems to have enjoyed a measure of popular support among Shirazis.42 She was subsequently ordered to the court of the Il- Khan, and she died in Tabriz in 685/1286. Her body was brought back to Shiraz and buried in the ribdit she had built on the edge of the city.43 The thirteenth century Shirazi poet Sa'di praised both Abish Khatun and her mother Turkan Khatun in his poetry; his qasida for</page><page sequence="4">176 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Abish Khatin contains this line: L 9 10u Where in the world is there such a king (khusraw)? And if there is, he cannot be so sweet (shirin)44 Abish Khatfin's daughter Kurdaijin bint Mingu Timir, founded the Madrasa-yi Shahi in Shiraz and married the Qutlugh-Khanid ruler Jalal al-Din Suyurghatmish, who ruled Kirman until 691/1292.45 In that year, Jalal al-Din Suyurghatmish was deposed by his sister Padishah Khatun, who had been given the province by her second husband, the il-Khan Gaykhatti, one year before. Padishah Khtant imprisoned her brother and, when he was recaptured after having escaped with the help of his wife and daughter (Shah-'Alam), she had him killed. In 694/1295 when Baydi, Shah-'Alam's husband, became Il-Khan, he handed over Padishah Khatfin to Kurdajin and Shah-'Alam, who took their revenge.46 In 719/1319, the il-Khan Aba Sa'Id made Kurdfijin sole ruler of Fars, although actual control of Shiraz shifted between Kurdiijin and Shaykh 'Izz al-Din Tibi until 725/1325. With the arrival of Sharaf al-Din Mahmid in that year, effective power passed from Kurdajin to the Injuiids.47 During the reign of the Muzaffarid king Shah Shuja', when Jahan-Malik Khatin also seems to have composed poetry and may have compiled her divan, the king's mother, Khan Qutlugh Makhdim Shah (d. c. 785/1383), was politically influential. Makhdam Shah was the daughter of the last Qutlugh-Khanid ruler of Kirman, Qutb al-Din Shah Jahan, and was married to Mubariz al- Din c. 729/1328. One contemporary court history rather conventionally stresses her piety and chastity, adding that she was an important source of support to her son.48 It is interesting to note that Makhdam Shah's great-aunt was the above mentioned Safvat al-Din Padishah Khadtn, the sixth Qutlugh-Khanid ruler, and that her great-grandmother was 'Ismat al-Din Qutlugh Turkan Khatiin, who ruled in Kirman 655-81/1257-82.49 These brief biographical sketches illustrate the dynamic role played by a number of noble women in the mid-to-late-thirteenth century in both Shiraz and Kirman, who were rulers in their own right. There is sufficient evidence to show that female relatives of Jahan-Malik Khatan were active in the political and cultural life of Shiraz during her lifetime and that Injtid women enjoyed a degree of freedom of expression, access to education and influence at court. Unfortunately, the contemporary sources provide us with few specific details about women's artistic and cultural interests, but focus instead on their religious and political activities.50s We know from Clavijo's contempo- rary account of early fifteenth century Samarqand, however, that Timirid women owned private gardens to which they invited guests and in which the hosted wine parties and other celebrations, both formal and informal.5' Could the situation have been similar in Injuid and Muzaffarid Shiraz? Although they were not Turks, the Injuids and Muzaffarids were descended from families who had long been in the employ of the Il- Khans and who had intermarried with local Turkic dynasties. It is therefore likely that they were influenced by Turco-Mongol attitudes regarding the role played by royal women at court, which some scholars have argued were relatively liberal in comparison with the attitudes of contemporary urban Persians.52 When discussing the role played by women at the court of Uljaytu, Lambton makes the following statement which resonates with the evidence presented here on the political and cultural activities of Injtid and Muzaffarid women in fourteenth century Iran, "The status of the women of the imperial household was a mixture of privilege and authority on the one hand and subjection on the other."53 She goes on to argue that, although the influence enjoyed by women such as Abish Khatun and Padishah Khatin was personal and not institutionalised, their intervention in public affairs was nonetheless effective.54 The first critical edition of Jahan-Malik's divan was published in Tehran just ten years ago in 1995. This would partly explain why her poetry has remained largely unstudied, even in Iran. This edition is based on three of the four extant manuscripts of Jahan-Malik's poetry. The most complete manuscript is in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (no. 1580). This manuscript contains more than 15,000 bayts of her poetry; it appears to date from her lifetime and contains her introduction.5 The second most complete manuscript used by the editors is located in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul (H.867) and is also early, being dated Rajab 840/1437. This manuscript also contains her introduction.56 The third is a short manuscript containing a selection of some 500 bayts of her poetry and is dated to c. 1028/1619. It contains a modified version of her introduction with an inserted section in praise of Shah Shuja'; it was bought by E.G. Browne and is now kept in the University Library in</page><page sequence="5">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHATUJN 177 Cambridge (V.32 (6)).57 In addition to these three manuscripts, there is another manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (no. 1581), which contains a selection of around 214 ghazals and 158 rubadlis by Jahan-Malik, together with 198 ghazals and 15 ruba'is by another (possibly female) poet with the takhallus "BI-nishan" ("Without a Trace").58 Blochet considered the two Paris manuscripts to be very early, no. 1580 being late-fourteenth century (and possibly copied during the lifetime of Jahan-Malik herself), and no. 1581 mid-fifteenth century (going by the style of the calligraphy and illumination). No manuscript copy of Jahan-Malik's divan appears to have survived in the libraries of Iran, another reason, perhaps, why her poetry has received little academic attention to date. The small number of extant manuscripts of her divan would also suggest that her poetry was not widely disseminated. Given Jahan- Malik's royal status, it is possible that her poetry was considered unsuitable for the eyes (or ears) of men to whom she was not closely related (sing. na-mahram). What is clear is that, like the ghazals of many male poets of fourteenth century Iran, her poetry has been over- shadowed by that of HIfiz, perhaps even more so in her case because she was a woman. From studying her divdn, it seems that Jahan-Malik was inspired and perhaps influenced by the earlier Shirazi poet Sa'di (d. 691/1292), to whom she refers directly at least once.59 Many more of her ghazals, however, bear a striking similarity to those of Hafiz. Given that the two poets lived in Shiraz in the same period, it is not unreasonable to assume that they may have influenced each other's poetry; Jahan-Malik's poems are certainly of a comparable quality and style to those of H. fiz.60 It should be noted, however, that her ghazals (in contrast to many of .Hfiz's poems) have, on the whole, little (if any) Safi or mystical content, whether covert or overt. One question often asked about the poetry of pre- modem female poets is whether or not it is possible to detect a specifically female voice in their poetry. From my close reading of Jahan-Malik Khatcn's divan, I would argue that, for the most part, it is impossible to tell that the poems were written by a woman. Unsurprisingly, she generally seems to have adopted the language and style of her male contemporaries and, in so doing, has produced poetry of a comparable standard and complexity; this was surely her goal. Very few of her ghazals could be considered confessional or personal in any substantive way, although the profuse use of her takhallus "Jahan" in her poetry (not just in the final verse, but often throughout a given poem) gives the sense that one is reading about the woman herself.61 The poetic voice in Jahan-Malik's divan is certainly more chaste than that of some of her male contempo- raries (especially 'Ubayd-i Zakani and Khajui-yi Kirmani) and she makes fewer references to wine and the libertine life of the wine taverns (kharabat). This chaste modesty is in itself, perhaps, an indication that we are reading the poetry of a (noble) woman. Other possible clues are references in her poems to the domestic side of life, to kitchenware, e.g. dig ("cooking pot"),62 dig-i hava ("cooking pot of desire"),63 and, tasht-i 'ishq-i ma az bam uftad ("the wash-basin of our love fell from the roof").64 A number of her poems also have an affectionate tone and contain a number of semi- colloquial phrases not commonly found in the poetry of contemporary male poets, such as "light of my eyes" (variously nir-i chashm, nfir-i du chashm, nfur-i dida, nfr-i didagan, nu7r-i har du dida, nfir-i du dida, and nir- i nazar)65 or idiomatic phrases such as pushtam ba-tu garm ast (lit. "through you my back is warmed", i.e. you provide me with constant support).66 The fact that we know Jahan-Malik is a woman makes it interesting to see how she employs the standard male, homoerotic imagery when describing the beauty of her male beloved, especially when describing his long hair, silvery chest or beard. However, the fact that we cannot generally detect a distinctly female voice in Jahan- Malik's poetry is, I feel, a testament to her poetic skill.67 One very interesting feature of her divan is that it is prefaced by an eloquent introduction penned by the poet herself.68 In this introduction, Jahan-Malik (perhaps in order to silence those who might have criticised her for composing poetry) explains why she has committed her poetry to writing. She says that all great men know that, in order for their name to live on after death, they must write poetry or prose. She states that she composed poems now and then in her free moments, in order to busy herself, and that, at first, she was reluctant to compile her verses. She writes that she was aware that great men of learning ('ulama-yi namdar) composed poetry, but because so few Persian noblewomen (mukhaddarat u khavatin-i 'ajam) had done so, she believed there to be some fault (naqs) in women writing poetry, and so strictly avoided doing so. She goes on to say that, over a period of time, she discovered that certain Arab and Persian women did in fact write poetry,</page><page sequence="6">178 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES adding that Fatima, the Prophet's daughter, would not have composed poetry if it was unlawful for women to do so. Jahan-Malik quotes a saying from Fatima in Arabic,69 adding that all Arab noblewomen have composed poetry; somewhat of an exaggeration. Among Persian women poets, Jahan-Malik mentions a certain 'A'isha Muqriya, whose piety she praises before quoting two of her ruba&amp;is.70 At the end of this introduction, she also mentions Padishah Khatun (d. 694/1295), and Qutlugh Shah Khatian (d. 681/1282). Both these women wielded considerable political and military power in Kirman in the late seventh/thirteenth century, and both wrote poetry.71 It is conceivable that Jahan-Malik mentioned these women rulers out of respect for Shah ShujT"s mother Makhduim Shah, who was their blood relative. Jahan-Malik does not mention the more bawdy Saljuq poet Mahsati, perhaps because of the sexual overtones in her verses.72 At several points in her introduction, she plays down her own poetic skill and asks those who read her verses to forgive her short- comings. This introduction to the divan proves that she was both familiar with the poetry of other women and that she was consciously writing as a woman. The inclusion of such an introduction also suggests that Jahan-Malik was herself directly involved in the compilation of her divdn. 2. PRELIMINARY COMPARATIVE STUDY OF JAHAN-MALIK KHATUN AND CONTEMPORARY SHIRAZI POETS In order to gauge the extent to which Jahan-Malik succeeded in composing poetry which was both technically and aesthetically comparable to that of her male contemporaries in Shiraz, I have decided to examine the way in which the beloved is described in her ghazals, whilst providing cross references to descriptions of the beloved in the poetry of 'Ubayd-i Zakani and Junayd-i Shirazi.73 Both these poets lived in Shiraz at the same time as her and wrote ghazal poetry of a similar style and sophistication. 'Ubayd-i Zakiani (d. 772/1371) is the better known of the two. He is best known for his satirical works (e.g. MAfsh u gurba, Akhlaq al-ashra]) and his bawdy tales and poems (e.g. La~tayif Risala-yi dilgusha), but he was also an accomplished poet in the more "serious" genres of qasida and ghazal. Malhjub's edition of 'Ubayd's divan contains 41 qasidas and 140 ghazals (plus a sizeable number of qi.'tcas, mathnavis and rubci's) which are, for the most part, standard examples of chaste, courtly poetry of the period with little (if any) mystical content and are therefore readily comparable to the ghazals of Jahan. As we have noted, Dawlatshah Samarqandi and Fakhri Hiravi say that 'Ubayd-i Zakant lampooned Jahan-Malik on more than one occasion. 'Ubayd seems to have been a very close companion of her uncle Shaykh AbN Ishiiaq (for whom he wrote over twenty-five qasidas), and it seems highly likely that Jahan-Malik Khatiin and 'Ubayd were well acquainted, although it has not yet been possible to ascertain the exact nature of their interaction. By comparing her poetry with that of one of the most successful male court poets of her time, such as 'Ubayd, it should be possible to conclude how well she was able to emulate contemporary court style, which, in turn, will show how well acquainted she was with the literary tastes and fashions of her age.74 Mu'In al-Din Aba 'l-Qasim Junayd-i Shirazi (d. after 791/1389) was a writer, preacher (vad'iz) and poet, and lived in Shiraz during the Injuiid and Muzaffarid periods. His most famous work (written in Arabic and later translated into Persian by his son after his death) is Shadd al-izir fi hatt al-awzar can zuwwdr al-mazdr, which was completed c. 791/1389. This work is a sort of fourteenth-century guidebook for pilgrims to Shiraz who wish to visit the graves of ascetics, mystics, scholars and princes buried in and around the city. It is divided into seven sections (one for each major cemetery), and provides details on 315 such notables buried in Shiraz. The book ends with a description of the tomb of Sa'dI. Junayd does not mention the tomb of Hafiz, so it can be assumed that the work was completed during that poet's lifetime (and perhaps during the lifetime of Jahan, since she too is not mentioned). Junayd composed a number of religious and mystical texts (e.g. Dhayl al-macarif fi tarjamat al-'awarij), but he also composed ghazals, over ninety of which were collected by Sa'Id Nafisi and published in 1941. Many of Junayd's ghazals have a devotional or mystical tone, and he may well have composed them for use in his sermons in Shiraz's main mosque, the Jami'-i 'Atiq. Junayd's published divan also contains, however, a sizeable number of ghazals, which lend themselves to a more earthly interpretation.

THE BELOVED AS DESCRIBED IN THE POETRY OF JAHAN-MALIK KHATON In the ghazals of Jahan-Malik Khatun, the beloved's eyes are described as dark or black (siydh),76 almond- shaped,77 and often both intoxicated,78 and- by implication- intoxicating. His eyes are likened to the narcissus (nargis), primarily because of the contrast between the dark centre and light outer portion of this flower.79 The beloved is also, occasionally, described as having seductively ill or sleepy eyes.80 Very infrequent- ly the beloved's eyes are compared to those of the desert gazelle (dha).81 This comparison is much rarer in Persian poetry than in Arabic poetry, although it is commonly made when poet a is seeking to parody Arabic verse. L= 5 I'm drunk on the wine of your ruby lips, what will be reduced If you break my hangover with your intoxicated narcissi eyes? (28: 8) Likewise in her poetry, the beloved's eyebrows are likened to the prayer niche in which the lover prostrates him/herself,82 and offers prayers.83 As an extension of this metaphor, the beloved is also referred to as the lover's focus of worship and adoration, her ka'ba or qibla; an analogy that to some may have seemed blasphemous.84 Just as frequently, the beloved's curved eyebrows are likened to the archer's bow (kamdn) and his sharp glances to arrows (sing. fir).s85 Jahan-Malik also likens the beloved's eyebrows to the crescent moon (hildl),86 and to architectural features such as arches (sing. .tdq).87 The ideal beloved of fourteenth-century Persian poetry should have delicately curved,88 preferably joined (payvasta) eyebrows.89 The stature of my hope, like your eyebrows, is bent My pained heart, like your eyes, is sick (168: 2) I,,),A1.JI,J J.L4_lJ When I saw the mihiab of his eyebrows, I was obliged to perform my prayer within it.

(62: 8) The beloved's hair should be scented,110 as should his whole body, with musk, ambergris and jasmine flowers,"1 scents evocative of the performance setting of courtly ghazal poetry, the majlis.112 The beloved is a beautifying object that adorns the majlis: his physical beauty spreads scent, scatters petals, and burns musk and ambergris. As in the poetry of Hafiz, Jahan-Malik considers the mole or beauty spot to be an integral part of the beloved's beautiful face,113 and, like his hair, it is both black and mischievous (siyah-kar).114 Your heart-binding cheek is my full moon Your wicked mole is my grain and snare (220: 1) As in much Arabic poetry, the beloved and his or her beautiful face are frequently likened to the moon, normally mdh or mah15 but occasionally also qamar.116 Jahan-Malik's beloved is the earthly embodiment of the full moon;117 he is her moon and Pleiades (Parvin) in one.118 Just as frequently, the beloved's beauty and his face is likened to the sun:119 he is the "sun of the world",120 he is more radiant than the "world-illuminating sun",121 he is the "sun of the east",122 the "world-adorning sun",123 and the "sun of the realm".124 His face shines with such beauty that it puts the sun to shame.125 cZJ1, I 'Al J )4LL J J~j Jm &gt;! j~.) % Pull back the burqa" from your sun-like face For no one ever veils the sun (54:2) In her poetry, it is not only the sun that the beloved rivals in beauty. He also embarrasses nature and her spring garden, both revered in Persian medieval poetry.126 The body of the beloved reflects the beauty of the garden, but here his body is more beautiful than the paradise garden itself. I py 5y l i J M If, with such a scent and hue, you pass by the garden You will put to shame the Judas tree and the wild rose (20: 4) I searched for a sweet smelling rose in the garden and they told me The rose is drenched in sweat, shamed by his beautiful face (840: 5) Unsurprisingly, the beloved's face is likened to the king of flowers, the rose (gui), and his beardless cheeks to the rose's velvety, red petals.127 The beloved's cheeks are, less frequently, likened to the tulip (ldla)128 and his tears to rose water (gul-db).129 Out of love for your rose petal cheek I will continually moan with longing, like the nightingale (68: 5) The boy is a laughing,130 moist rosel3' which has no thorns.132 This rose imagery is not limited to the description of the beloved's face: his body is likened to a "sweet-smelling" rose, and he is "rose-limbed" (gul- andam).133 The beloved smells like a rose,134 and his beauty is as fresh and as colourful as a newly opened rose,135 but it is not as fleeting.136 At the same time, Jahan-Malik reminds us that the "days of the rose" (vaqt-i gul) and the "season of the rose" (mawsim-i gul) will soon come to an end hence one must enjoy this precious time before it is too late.137 These seem to be references to the political instability in contemporary Shliraz. This carpe diem philosophy is a common thread to be found in most ghazal poetry of the period, especially that of 'Ubayd-i Zakani. The beloved's lips are full and juicy,138 and are compared to wine-red rubies (sing. la'l or yaqut).139 His saliva is better than the water of life (db-i h.aydt or chashma-yi h.ayavdn),140 the Kawthar stream in Paradise,141 or than wine itself.142 The beloved's mouth should be tight,143 like a rosebud,144 or a pistachio,145 or the letter "mina".146 Perhaps most importantly, the beloved's mouth, lips, and breath should be sweet.147</page><page sequence="9">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHA TON 181 Imagery related to sugar (shikar or qand) features prominently in the fourteenth-century ghazal and the poetry of Jahan-Malik Khatiin is no exception.148 The beloved's lips are described variously as "sugary",149 "sugar-crunching",150 "dripping with sugar"'151 and "sugar-selling",152 and are more syrupy than the sugar cane field itself (shikaristan).153 The image of parrots crunching on the poet's saccharin verse is to be found in the poetry of her contemporaries, most notably Hafiz and Khvdju-yi Kirman.l154 Less frequently, the beloved's lips are compared to honey.155 Although it is repetitive to speak of sugar Before your lips, what can the sugar of Luristan do? (641: 5) You are sweeter than sugar, O .hrif-bom boy Why do you give me so bitter an answer? (54: 5) The ideal beloved is tall,156 with an elegant stature like that of a cypress tree (sarv)157 or a pine (sanfbar or kaj).158 He is said to be like an erect,159 gliding cypress160 which struts proudly in the garden.161 Less frequently, the beloved is likened to the box tree (shimshdd).162 But it is not enough for the beloved to be tall; he must also have a very thin waist.163 The desir- ability of these unnatural proportions may account for the elongated figures of many ghulams and saqis as depicted in medieval Persian miniature paintings. In the poetry of this period, a kind of descriptive shorthand exists which the poet can use to describe the ideal beloved in a concise manner. For example, it is not necessary to say that the beloved's lips are like rubies (sing. la'l), because the word la'l itself is a metaphorical abbreviation for "red, juicy lips". Similarly, sarv (cypress) stands for "a tall, elegant beauty". These shorthand terms can also be combined to form descrip- tions which are not readily understandable for those less acquainted with this style of poetry, such as sarv-i gul- andam, "rose-limbed cypress",'64 sarv-i saman-bky, "jasmine-scented cypress",'65 or, sanam-i gul-'idhar, "rose-cheeked idol".166 Since the names of plants and flowers are used to describe the human beloved, they often take on anthropomorphic qualities, for example, sarv-i kharamdn "strutting cypress", or gul-i khandan "laughing rose".167 A significant structural feature of Persian ghazals (and that of the fourteenth century in particular) is that they often open with three to four lines in which the beauty of the beloved is described and praised. This seems to be an abbreviated form of the erotic prelude (taghazzul or nasib) of the qasida. cw-uh14# 'iL% 1IJ-4JJ.)iu u4,fJ.

(52: 1) As far as the age of the ideal beloved is concerned, he is generally depicted as a young boy.'69 In most Persian ghazal poetry, a broad age gap between the lover and beloved is hinted at, if not explicitly stated. In some of her poems, however, Jahan-Malik appears to be singing of the beauty of a more mature, physically strong, manly beloved,'70 who sports a newly sprouted, if not fully-grown, beard.17"</page><page sequence="10">182 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Another feature common to most Persian ghazals in the fourteenth century is the likening of the beloved to an idol. Within a Persian context, this may be seen to refer to Buddhist (or Hindu) statues, rather than pre- Islamic Arabian effigies.172 In the poetry of Jahan- Malik, the beloved is frequently described as a beautiful idol (but,173 nigdr(in),174 sanam).175 Within the context of ghazal poetry, these terms do not seem to carry distinct meanings and are often used alongside each other and may, therefore, on the whole be considered interchangeable. Linked to the image of the beloved as an idol, there is the idea that the beloved is so beautiful that he beautifies and adorns not only the gardenl76 and the majlis held there177 but the city178 and the whole world.179 The beloved is at once a passive object to be gazed upon during the majlis party as part of the appre- ciation of beauty (tamdshd), and at the same time his beauty is such that it penetrates the whole earth. This dichotomy of passivity and dominance is repeated in Jahan-Malik's ghazals when she describes her beloved as a wild musk deer from the East,180 which is prized and hunted for its valuable musk, but which can slay a lion with just one glance.'8' There is an implicit irony in this dichotomy; the beloved of Persian ghazal poetry is not normally described as passive: he is active and often aggressive. The beloved takes hold of the lover's heart (which he covets and seizes);182 he has an evil nature and is unkind,183 hot headed, vindictive, base and oppressive.184 Jahan-Malik's beloved has no shame (sharm or hayd), no fidelity (vafd), and no love (mihr).185 By the fourteenth century, Persian ghazals, including those composed in Shiraz, are almost exclusively odes to Turkish youths. From the time of the Ghaznavids, Iran had been ruled by Turkic and Mongol dynasties (or by Persian dynasties who had intermarried with Turko- Mongol houses). Many of these rulers kept large retinues of Turkish soldiers and ghulams. As we know from Bayhaqi's Tdrikh, Turkish boys (and girls) from certain towns and regions in Central Asia were valued for the whiteness of their skin, their rosy cheeks and silky black hair. The fact that Iran was ruled for many centuries by Turkic rulers who kept Turks as ghulcms, soldiers and sdqis, had a profound effect on the imagery used to describe the beloved in Persian poetry. The point being that when a poet praises the beauty of his beloved, who is conventionally a Turkish ghullm, by extension, he can be considered to be praising the beauty of his Turkic patron-ruler.186 This reasoning has led some to argue, for example, that IHafiz's ode to the Shirazi Turk is in fact a panegyric ghazal written in praise of Shah Shujal', whose mother was of Turkish origin. The Injfids, although not of Turkish descent, were sufficient- ly Turkicised to make this rule hold true for the time of Jahan-Malik. Accordingly, Jahan-Malik Khafttin describes her beloved as a Turk from Khata, Chin, Tatary, Khotan or Yaghma,187 and her Turkish beloved is drunken,188 and violent.189 How long will my drunk-eyed Turk inflict cruelty upon my soul? How long will I endure hardship at the hands of that Turk of Khat-? (25: 2) EM ~~ Le 1 4 &amp; Y l You are a Khata'i Turk, a boy; it is not surprising you should act so O Khata'i beloved! Who told you to do wrong? (1154: 6)190 Notable exceptions to this rule are two ghazals which carry the repeated radif "Baghdadi boy", Baghdddipisar.191 It is possible that these were written in praise of the Jalayirids or, more specifically, Ahmad b. Shaykh Uvays who ruled in Isfahan. I will offer up my soul for the scent of his new beard and cheek, if At dawn there comes a breeze from that Baghdadi boy, Your face is like jasmine petals, your stature like the cypress tree The mihirdb of my two eyes is the eyebrow of that Baghdadi boy (763: 1-2) As we have already noted, Turkish slaves were prized in part for their white skin and fair complexion,</page><page sequence="11">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHA TJN 183 that is, for the contrast between their white skin and their dark hair and eyes.192 Accordingly, the beloved in Jahan- Malik's poetry is described as being silver-limbed (sim- anddm),193 or silver-bodied (sim-badan),194 like a silvery cypress,195 or an idol fashioned from silver.196 The ideal beloved has cheeks as white as sheet silver197 or jasmine flowers.198 In Persian ghazal poetry, the beloved is also often described as simin-bar (silver-chested), sim-sdq (silver-legged) and with silver forearms, suggesting that he has yet to grow body hair.199 ,LA1 JA LA pl LE a, That silver-limbed, moon-faced one passed through my door From his face, my cell of misery was illumined (582: 5) The panegyric dimension in many of the ghazals of Hafiz was noted by scholars such as Ghani several decades ago. It is logical that, in fourteenth century Iran, when the ghazal had been securely established as a serious, courtly genre of poetry on an equal footing with (if not superior to) the qasida, a large number of ghazals of this period contain strong panegyric overtones. This is certainly the case with the poetry of Jahan-Malik Khatin. As we have noted already, she was herself a princess of the ruling family, a niece of the Injiid king, Shaykh Abi Ishaq and wife of his chief nadim. She would have associated closely with her uncle and may well have performed her poetry for him, or indeed Shah Shuja', albeit perhaps from behind a curtain or from an adjacent room. Her published divdn contains a mere two courtly qasidas, but, like Ha.fiz, a large number of her ghazals contain strong panegyric elements. J J-1." 3) 6S You are the king of the world and the world is to your satisfaction, For a while, out of kindness, treat this beggar humanely (9: 7) The slave/master, servant/lord or beggar/king dynamic features heavily in Jahan-Malik's poetry. She adopts the persona of servant-slave (banda), beggar (gadd), or mendicant (darvish),200 before the beloved- king. This could be interpreted either as an expression of devotion to an earthly beloved or to the heavenly beloved, God (especially when she refers to her addressee or beloved as khuddvand, a word used to denote both earthly and heavenly master).201 Equally, many of these references can be read as pleas to her patron for his favour, protection and financial assistance, especially since these pleas tend to come near the final or penultimate line of the poem.202 Other references in her ghazals appear to be even more clearly panegyric and patron-related in content. Jahan-Malik likens her beloved to a governor (hdkim),203 she addresses him with the titles Mansir, Muzaffar and Khaqan,204 calls him "King of kings",205 "King of the age",206 "King of men",207 "King, son of a King",208 or, simply, "King".209 This would suggest that Jahan-Malik Khatin was writing for a public, courtly audience, rather than a private ladies' salon. This theory is further supported when she uses words such as thand-khvdn ("praise- singing") and du'd-giy ("prayer-saying"), which are normally used to describe the function of panegyric poets.210 This is also the case when she says that her purpose is to sing the praise (madh) of her beloved,211 the word used to denote praise poetry in Arabic and Persian. Those ghazals which end with the radif"bdd" ("may it be") have the flavour of the du'd or prayer for the well-being and good fortune of the patron found in qasida poetry.212 In keeping with contemporary fashion, in at least one poem, Jahan-Malik describes herself as a parrot (.titi), warbling praise for her beloved.213 She also seems to allude to traditional methods used by patrons to reward their poets, such as scattering pearls, coins or gold.214 It is not possible to ascertain at this stage whether or not Jahan-Malik did perform at court.215 She makes skillful use of her takhallus "Jahan" or "world" in these panegyric ghazals, calling her beloved shdh-ijahdn, padishdh-ijahdn or sultdn-i jahdn, that is to say, both her personal king and the king of the earthly world,216 sarvar-ijahdn ("lord of the world"),217 jahdn- ddr ("world ruler"),218 jahdn-pandh ("world protector"),219 shdh-i jahdn-drdy ("world-adorning king"),220 jahdn-gir ("world conqueror"),221 jahdn-bdn ("world ruler"),222 and, padishdh-i har du jahan ("the king of both worlds").223 In a more metaphorical manner, Jahan-Malik refers to her beloved as the "king of beauty",224 the "king of the land of beauty",225 the "king who rules over the dominion of beauty",226 the "king of the world of beauty",227 the "king of the beauties",228 the "king of the moon-faced ones",229 the "king of love",230 the "king of affection",231 the "king of</page><page sequence="12">184 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES the heart"232 and the "king of the army of love",233 thereby linking the concepts of beauty, desire, and patronage.234 It should be of no surprise that she portrays herself as the most subservient of devotees. This is a standard feature of Persian ghazal poetry, but the frequency and variety with which she presents herself as the undying admirer is noteworthy. She is the dust beneath his feet235 and seeks to kiss his feet and hands,236 and, rather sug- gestively, expresses the desire to be his stirrup (rikdb).237 She says she is base, lower than a dog in his presence238 and as weak as a sparrow, though he is a falcon or a Humay bird.239 Interestingly, she describes herself as her beloved's ghuldm.240 This is ironic, considering that the object of her immediate affection may well be a ghuldm and the fact that she is female. She bows before him like a violet,241 addresses him with the formal you (shumd),242 and brings offerings (pish-kish) before him.243 She desires to be his sacrifice (qurban),244 and announces her blood is licit (hald) for him.245 Connected to this, Jahan's poetry contains what appears to be an unusually large amount of blood-related imagery, e.g. the lover's bleeding heart and eyes.246 One feature common to most fourteenth-century ghazal poetry is the depiction of the beloved not only as harsh, cold-hearted and indifferent but also as aggressive and at times violent. Jahan-Malik's beloved has no mercy,247 is stone-,248 or iron-hearted,249 is unkind,250 unfaithful,251 stubbornly disobedient,252 does not keep his promises (sing. 'ahd or paymdn),253 and knowingly inflicts harshness and suffering (jafa and jawr) on the lover.254 In many ways, the beloved is worse in his treatment of the lover than the lover's most harsh enemies.255 These attributes are common to the beloved in Persian lyric poetry from the earliest times. What appears to be stressed more strongly at this time is the frequent repetition of the idea that the beloved, due to his exquisite beauty, causes commotion in the city where he resides. This is a common theme in the ghazals of Jahan-Malik. The commotion or tumult is generally referred to using the word 7shib, from the verb ishuftan "to disturb, to agitate".256 The beloved is "city-disturbing"257 and "world-disturbing";258 he creates dshi7b in the bazaar, by virtue of his exceptional beauty and exquisite scent.259 This is reminiscent of the sub-genre of Persian ghazal known as shahr- &amp;shtib, in which the object of desire is a young male artisan or worker in the marketplace.260 Other words used to describe this commotion caused by the beloved are ghawgha,261 shi7r,262 qiydmat263 and fitna.264 The beloved's wink (ghamza) and eyes are accordingly described as bewitching and tumult-inducing (fattdn).265 Your hue and scent has sent the world into turmoil Why is our share of the rose garden no more than a thorn? (11: 7) ja ! - d L51 O heart! Beware of his two drunken eyes For because of him there is havoc in the city (86: 6) In addition to the description of the beloved as a merciless "city-disturber", he is frequently described in Jahan-Malik's poems in terms evocative of war.266 The beloved is a "soldier-sdqr", he wounds her with the "blade of cruelty" (tigh-i jafd), wielded by his strong arm.267 Her beloved is variously described as an armed fighter (silah.ddr),268 an archer (kamandar),269 a swift rider (chabuk-savar),270 a foot soldier (pidda),271 and a royal knight (shahsavdr).272 He pillages (tardj),273 and does battle (ma'raka).274 In addition to the militaristic imagery, she frequently employs polo (chawgan) imagery and terminology in her poetry, suggesting that she was familiar with the game; she might have watched matches from secluded balconies reserved for women of the ruling family.275 The ball of my heart fell on to the polo field of his love In the end, that swift-riding idol prevailed (150: 9) The beloved is no more the effeminate boy of much 'Abbasid ghazal poetry; rather, he is a strong warrior, an athlete, a hunter and a king. Jahan's beloved hails from the wine tavern; he is a knave, a vagabond ('ayydr),276 a ruffian from the underworld of Shiraz's lower classes. He is a drunken lout who seeks out brawls (sing. 'arbada).277 On the whole, however, Jahan-Malik refers much less to the environment of the tavern or to the libertines (rinddn),278 and their flagrant disregard for convention.279 This is perhaps because she is a woman</page><page sequence="13">ODES OF A POET-PRINCESS: THE GHAZALS OF JAHAN-MALIK KHA TJN 185 and might, therefore, have avoided such imagery in order to escape reproach from her contemporaries. In contrast (or perhaps as a counter-balance to his violence and aggression) the beloved of fourteenth-century Persian ghazal poetry is also frequently described as jolly, jovial, cheerful and playful (shi7kh or shang(ul)).280 He is a selfish joker and a heart-stealing vagabond;281 he has playful,282 magical eyes,283 mischievous eyebrows284 and a naughty gaze;285 he is a saucy knave, a playful, drunken idol.286 There are many beauties in the world, but reason said There is no one as saucy and gay as that roguish idol (281: 11) 4. CONCLUSION In the absence of more substantial biographical information than that presented here, it is not easy to define the role played by Jahan-Malik Khatiin in the literary salons of the Shiraz of her time, let alone ascertain to any satisfactory degree the extent of her interaction with and influence on contemporary poets. As mentioned above, the fact that several female blood relatives of Jahan-Malik played significant roles in the political and religious life of Shiraz during her lifetime, coupled with the fact that a number of women (most notably in Fars and Kirman) had ruled independently in the late seventh/thirteenth and early eighth/fourteenth centuries, means that it is reasonable to conclude that she could have played an active role in courtly majdlis. I can detect three principal reasons why her role in the literary life of her city does not appear to have been recorded in any significant detail by contemporary historians: first, because she was a royal woman, her composition of love poems may have been considered too risqu6 to be recorded in any detail; second, because most of the contemporary histories which have survived were written by supporters of the Muzaffarids and, con- sequently, tend to view this period of Shiraz's history from a Muzaffarid perspective, and, therefore, would ignore the literary activities of an Injoid princess; and, third, because she was considered a threat by other poets (such as 'Ubayd-i Zrkani) who vied with one another for the favour of the court. This third reason may explain why 'Ubayd attacked Jahan-Malik in such vulgar terms, attacks which were immortalised in Dawlatshah's Tadhkirat al-shucard', and which have clouded our view of her to the present day. In order to better understand Jahan-Malik's place in the literary scene of fourteenth-century Shiraz and her contribution to the genesis of a distinct provincial style of Persian ghazal in this period, we can do no better than to focus on a much more reliable source: her Divdn. I have already discussed the significance of her introduc- tion to this Divdn and some of the conclusions we can draw from it, so here I will confine my remarks to her poetry. It is clear from this preliminary comparison with two male contemporaries of Jahan-Malik ('Ubayd-i Zakani and Junayd-i Shirazi), that her poetry is not only of a similar calibre but that it is also of a similar style and diction. This is particularly true when we compare Jahan's ghazals to those of 'Ubayd. The only two substantive differences between them are that 'Ubayd's poems are much more sexually suggestive and infused to a greater extent with the bacchic atmosphere of the tavern, and that Jahan confined herself almost exclusively to composing ghazals (and rubdcis), while 'Ubayd dabbled (and excelled) in most genres of courtly poetry and prose popular at his time. The apparent sim- ilarities between the poetry of Jahan and 'Ubayd show that Jahan was well acquainted with the literary fashion of the period and that she must have been exposed to much of this poetry as it was performed. In order to assess the extent to which Jahan influenced the male poets around her or indeed contributed to the genesis of the contemporary Shirazi ghazal immortalised by I.Ifiz, it would be necessary to explore in greater detail the similarities in structure, rhyme and metre between Jahan and .HIafiz that have been alluded to, but not fully explored, by Dawlatabadi, Masse, Nafisi, and Saf~a. Another area worthy of greater attention is the extent to which Jahan was drawing on the poetry of the earlier Shirazi poet Sa'di. Sa'di wrote four separate divdns of ghazals, a sizeable number ofqasidas and, perhaps most famously, a work which blends prose and poetry, the Gulistdn. There is no evidence that Jahan wrote prose (apart from the introduction to her Divdn); she wrote few qasidas and she compiled her ghazals in one divdn rather than in four. Her Divdn is much more similar to that of H~fiz, in particular, since she primarily composed ghazals. The fact that Jahan-Malik's Divan contains only two panegyric qasidas is unsurprising if, (a) we conclude that she was not formally employed as</page><page sequence="14">186 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES a court poet, and, that (as suggested in her introduction) she wrote poetry in her spare time, or, (b) if we conclude that she was consciously trying to emulate I.Hfiz. The latter in effect abandoned the qasida as a vehicle for conveying his praise of the ruler-patron, and instead incorporated the madh within the ghazal, thereby composing a large number of "panegyric ghazals". In this regard, Jahan again seems to have emulated HI.fiz and, as noted above, she composed a similar number of panegyric ghazals which have qasida-like features, albeit in a concise form. Having said this, the lack of overt Sufi references in Jahan's poetry separate her from both Sa'di and HI.fiz, and draw her back towards the likes of 'Ubayd. It should be noted that her Divan contains twice as many ghazals as that of Sa'di, almost three times as many ghazals as that of Hafiz and ten times as many as 'Ubayd's Divan. It seems unlikely that she would have written so many poems merely for her own private enjoyment. On the other hand, her Divan contains a considerable degree of overlap between individual ghazals (in terms of rhyme, structure and whole lines in some cases), which would suggest that Jahan-Malik did not spend as much time as some of her male counterparts in editing down her corpus. If she had indeed performed her poetry regularly at court or elsewhere, she would no doubt have amalgamated those poems that overlap with one another and have discarded those of an inferior quality, thereby reducing the size of her Divan. On the topic of Sufi content and meaning in contem- porary Shirazi ghazal, it interesting to note that Junayd, a religious preacher and author of works on Sufi saints and their shrines, composed a good number of poems similar to those of 'Ubayd and Jahan and which cannot readily be given a mystical interpretation. This suggests that in fourteenth-century Shiraz the bawdy, amorous, earthly ghazal style was so prominent and popular that it permeated the poetry of even the most (outwardly) pious. It also raises questions as to why Junayd composed such poems and for what audience. As far as the description of the ideal beloved in Jahan's poetry is concerned, more work needs to be done to ascertain first, how similar her description of the beloved is in comparison to other more important con- temporary poets (especially I.IHfiz), and second (and more important), whether she did in fact add any innovative and novel twists to the standard description of the beloved found in Persian ghazal poetry. In order to define the characteristic and distinctive elements of the description of the beloved that set the Shirazi ghazal of her time apart from Persian ghazals of earlier periods (both in Shiraz and elsewhere, especially in eastern Iran) it would be necessary to compare the descriptions found in the poetry of Jahan and her contemporaries more closely with the ghazals of Sa'di and Sand'i in particular. Whatever the result of future comparative studies of Jahan-Malik's poetry with that of her contemporaries and predecessors may be, if we continue to ignore this poet we shall be denying ourselves valuable insight into the literary milieu of IHafiz and, perhaps more importantly, we will be marginalising one of the most important women poets of medieval Iran. Notes 1 On literary activity in fourteenth century Shiraz, see Browne 1951: 222-99; Arberry 1960: 139-68; and, Rypka 1968: 260-78. 2 It is possible to read the second half of Jahan's given name variously as "Malak" ("angel"), "Mulk" ("dominion"), or "Malik" ("king"); the third possibility seems most plausible. 3 Other such poet-princesses include: the Qutlugh-Khanid princess Safvat al-Din Padishah Khatdn (d. 694/1295), the Safavid-Mughal princess, ZIb al-Nisa' "Makhfi" (d. 1702), daughter of Awrangzib (d. 1707) and the Qajar princess, Diya' al-Saltana Shah Baygum (d. 1873), daughter of Fath-'AlI Shah (d. 1834). On women's literature in the Islamic lands in the medieval period, see Hammond 2003. On literacy among women of the Safavid court, see Szuppe 1998: 329-30. Togan 2003: 26-27 incorrectly states that no literature authored by women dated to before the sixteenth century has survived. 4 For more details on the injUids, see Al-i Davuid 2001; Boyle 1971; Bosworth 1996: 266; and, Ijalabi 1998: 17-34.

Jahan-Malik's Divan contains no qasida in praise of her uncle, which suggests that it was compiled after his death. 5 Natanzi 1957: 170-72: Mas'tid Shah married the daughter of Ghiyath al-Din b.

Fakhri Hiravi seems to be referring to Khvaja Qavam al- Din Hasan, Shaykh Abu Ishaq's trusted vizier, see Limbert 2004: 101, 116. 21 See Dawlatabadi 1988: 106-8 for the relevant excerpts from Fakhri Hiravi's Javdhir al-'ajd'ib. 22 See Gulchin-Ma'ani 1984: 417-20. For a more detailed discussion of Javdhir al-cajd'ib, see Szuppe 1998. 23 Natanzi 1957: 175. 24 There is some evidence that not all of Jahan-Malik's poetry has survived. Dawlatshah quotes the opening bayt of a qasida by Jahan which does not appear in her divdn, see Dawlatshah 1900: 289. This suggests that Jahan-Malik may have originally produced an even larger corpus. 25 For means of comparison, it is interesting to note that .Hjfiz's Divan as edited by Qasim Ghani and Muihammad Qazvini comprises 3 qasidas, 2 mathnavis, 34 muqa(t.ta's, 42 rub&amp;'s and 495 ghazals. 26 Ibn Batttita 1987: 218. 27 It seems that Shaykh Abti Islhaq and Mas'ud Shah shared the same mother. If this is the case, that would make Tashi Khatin Jahan-Malik's paternal grandmother. 28 Ibn Battita 1987: 221. See also Limbert 2004: 83-86. 29 Ibn Battiita 1987: 222. Ibn Battata explains that Turkish women do not normally cover their faces in public, but that Tashi Khatian had done so on this occasion out of shame. Ghani 2001: 96 casts some doubt on the authentic- ity of all the details of this account. 30 Shirazi 1985: 335-37. Most sources stress Tashi Khatun's piety, although it is also said that Shaykh Abi Ishaq killed one of his viziers, Amir Ghiyath al-Din 'AlI Yazdi, suspecting him of conducting an illicit affair with his mother, see Al-i David 1993: 164. 31 GhanI 2001: 126. 32 Ghani 2001: 126. Ghani says that these Qur'ans are still extant in Shiraz, and that they are variously dated either 745 or 746 (1344-45). Ghani quotes two Arabic inscrip- tions in these Qur'ans which mention TFashi Khatuin and which provide an insight into her station in Shiraz during the reign of Shaykh Abu Ishaq. The two inscriptions quoted by Ghani read: "al-Khatian al-A';zam, Malikat Mamlakat al-Sulaynianiyya, 'smat al-Dunyd wa 'l-Din, Tashi Khdtin", and, "al-Khdtfin al-Mu'azzama, Sultdn al- Khawdtin, Lsmat al-Dunyd wa 'l-Din, Tashi Khat7n". 33 Ibn Battita 1987: 225; Mustafavi 1964: 59, 63-64, 347; and, Limbert 2004: 44, 59, 102. 34 Ibn Zarkib 1932: 52, 132. 35 Ghani 2001: 236. 36 GhanI 2001: 266. 37 GhanI 2001: 281-82. 38 See Natanz- 1957: 175, 182, 190; GhanI 2001: 282; and, Limbert 2004: 41, 76, 148. 39 Ibn Zarktib 1932: 62.

This is an elegant allusion to the tale of Khusraw Parviz and his wife ShirIn, immortalised by Nizami Ganjavi in his poem, Khusraw va Shirin. Sa'di (ibid.) describes the pearls of Abish Khatan's "regal crown" (tdj-i khusruvani) and says that, as long as her House rules, no harm will come to the religion.

Kurdijin erected many public buildings in Shiraz, including mosques, madrasas, and a hospital, see Ghani 2001: 64-65. 46 Minorsky 1986: 553-54.

On the giving of brides to cement political alliances between Turkic dynasties, see Togan 2003: 24. 50 One of Shah Shuja's wives (Malik Khatun?) is said to have taken an active interest in poetry. For a description of her interaction with Hafiz, see Fakhr al-Zamani 1961: 89-90. 51 Clavijo 1928: 242-44: Timair's chief wives and daughters had their own separate tents and enclosures; 244-45, a royal woman hosts a wine party attended by both men and women, at which minstrels sing to musical accompani- ment; 258, 260-61, Tim-r's wives and daughters attended official court feasts and celebrations. See also Marefat 1993: 29, royal Timurid women could accrue wealth and assert political influence. They enjoyed the right to own their own property, commission and construct buildings and gardens, and patronise the arts. See also Manz 2003 and Soucek 1998 for information regarding the importance of the public role played by Timurid women in politics. Togan 2003: 26 argues that, "...as late as the beginning of the fifteenth century there was no segregation into h.aram and saldm in the Central Asian court." 52 For information on women in the Ghaznavid period, see Meisami 2003: 81: "Ghaznavids, although ethnic Turks...had inherited the harem system, along with other aspects of Perso-Islamicate court culture, from their Samanid predecessors." Meisami 2003: 81-82 argues that Ghaznavid royal women, although housed in secluded, harem quarters, owned property, had special tents and were politically active, albeit from behind the scenes. For information on Saljiq women, see Hillenbrand 2003, and Lambton 1988: 258-64, 268-69. 53 Lambton 1988: 289. 54 Lambton 1988: 290. 55 Blochet 1928: 222: "Cet exemplaire est l'original du diwan de Djihan, qui avait laiss6 des places en blanc pour des com- positions qu'elle avait l'intention de faire, dont quelques unes ont 6t&amp; remplies par l'un des possesseurs du livre". Blochet adds that Jahan-Malik may have directed the scribe herself. Nafisi 1968: 369 says that the fact that many of the ghazals in this manuscript are preceded by the phrase "damat baqa'u-hd" [sic.] ("may her existence long continue") suggests that this copy of Jahan-Malik's divan was either written in her lifetime, or else copied from a divan compiled whilst she was still alive. Masse 1972: 2 says that this manuscript of Jahan's divan must have been copied under her direct instruction. Masse 1972: 4-5 also proposes that, given the fine nature of the tadhhib, this manuscript of her divan may in fact be a copy which was originally presented to Ahmad b. Shaykh Uvays, a known bibliophile. 56 See Karatay 1961: 215. Karatay dates the Topkapi manuscript to 840/1437, which means it was probably copied around three to four decades after Jahan-Malik's death. Karatay does not give the number of ghazals but gives the number of folios as 375, each folio containing 17 lines of poetry arranged in two columns, which gives an approximate number of more than 6,000 bayts or around 500 ghazals. Karatay also notes that the Topkapi manuscript ends with ghazals which have the radif"tu", suggesting that it is incomplete. 57 See Browne 1932: 237-38 and idem 1951: 233. 58 Blochet 1928: 223 suggests that this luxurious, abridged version of Jahan-Malik's divan may date from the TIimurid period and have been copied at Herat c. 1460. It is unclear who "Bi-nishan" is, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that these poems may also be the work of Jahan-Malik. See Dawlatabadi 1988: 24-25 for similarities between a poem by "BI-nishan" and one of Hafiz's ghazals. 59 ghazal 230. For similarities between the ghazals of Sa'di and the poetry of Jahan-Malik, see Dawlatabadi 1988: 38-39. 60 Although this similarity is not the focus of this paper, it is interesting to note that a noticeable degree of overlap in rhyme, metre and content does exist between the ghazals of Hafiz and Jahan-Malik Khatun. More research is needed, though, to ascertain who is drawing on whom. For preliminary views on the similarities between the ghazals of these two poets, see DawlatabadI 1988: 41-80; Nafisi 1968: 371-72; and Mass6 1972: 6.

Note the added pun on her takhallus. 259 48, 49. 260 Jahan seeks her beloved in the market place: bdzar: 281, 282, 1084 and 1332. Mahsati is best known for her shahr- dshi7b poems.

In Jahan-Malik's poetry, there seems to be little differentiation, if any, between ashzib, fitna and ghawgha.
