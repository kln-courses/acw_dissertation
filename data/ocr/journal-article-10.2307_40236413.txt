<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alex Hardie Etymologising thè Muse* i. Introduction nine canonical Muses enter literature in the hymnal proem to HesiocTs Theogony (77-79), their names individually cata- logued from Clio to Calliope; and the latter, distinguished as 'fore- most\ was to become the Muse most frequently named by Greek poets. * The later fortunes of the other eight, measured in terms of number of namings, vary markedly. In lyric poetry up to the end of the fifth Century, for example, Clio appears seven times, Urania four, Terpsichore two, and Polyhymnia once;2 Erato enters epic and lyric texts in thè Hellenistic era;3 but Thalia, Melpomene and Euterpe make not a single appearance in extant Greek po- etry between Hesiod and thè imperiai era. That the entire Hes- iocüc catalogue remained in the consciousness of Greek audiences is nevertheless plain from archaic and classical vase-inscriptions which name ail nine Muses, albeit again with marked statistical variations.4 The apparent discrepancy between the literary and the iconographical évidence as regards the naming of the 'minor/ Muses will be partly due to the accident of survival. If we had the entire corpus of early Greek lyric, it is perfectly likely that Euterpe, Melpomene and Thalia would turn up in named invocations.

In an earlier discussion, I considered a séries of what I took to be etymological allusions to Thalia in early lyric. 1 It was sug- gested that where an etymological cognate of the Muse-name Thalia' is co-located with thè word Μούσα, it is worth assessing the présence of allusion to the Muse-name.2 The undifferenti- ated or generic 'Muse', it was argued, might in this way acquire individuai colouring akin to Hesiodic «Thalia». The principal text under discussion and illustration was the new fragment of Sap- pho (P. Köln 21351, 1-8), where the generic «Muse» is co-located with festive Φαλί,α. The two words, it was proposed, combine to suggest the présence of Thalia herseif within the text and her ac- tive rôle in securing Sappho's post mortem survival as a 'musical' personality. I now aim to provide a fuller and more systematic exploration of thè phenomenon, to illustrate the wide range of contexts where it appears to occur, and to suggest how identification and analysis can enrich our understanding of the works concerned. This re- mains however an essentially expérimental enterprise. No generai attempt is made to survey the extensive Muse-etymologies avail- able from late-Hellenistic and impérial prose sources; but I do aim to establish thè special place within the more restricted field cov- ered hère of Hesiod's Theogony and of the Muse-name etymolo- gies bequeathed by it. 2. The Hesiodic Catalogue and the Domains of the Muses The Theogony provided the founding text for ail future deploy- ments of the nine canonical Greek Muse-names. Hère is the cata- logue (76-80): εννέα θυγατέρες μεγάλου Διός εκγεγαυίαι, Κλειώ τ' Ευτέρπη τε Θάλεια τε Μελπομένη τε Τερψιχόρη τ' 'Ερατώ τε Πολυμνία τ' Ούρανίη τε Καλλιόπη θ'· ή δε προφερεστάτη εστίν άπασέων. 1 Hardie 2005, pp. 24-27. 2 Ibidem, pp. 25-27; see below, V(a) for identified examples.</page><page sequence="3">Etymologising the Muse 11 nine daughters begotten of mighty Zeus: Clio, Euterpe, Thalia, Mel- pomene, Terpsichore, Erato, Polymnia, Ourania and Calliope; and she is foremost of them ali. The catalogue is located in thè extended hymn to thè Muses that opens HesiocTs poem, a hymn which in scale, framing and content is akin to thè Homeric Hymns to thè major Olympians. 1 It affirms thè Muses' panhellenic status, here celebrated most immediately for thè Heliconian cult that is established by thè hymn itself.2 In thè passage preceding thè catalogue (63-74), thè Muses sing of thè «ordinances» (νόμοι), «manners» (ήθεα) and «honours», «do- mains», or «sphères of activity» (τιμοά) of thè gods, in two distinct contexts: first (63-67, présent tense), in their characteristic perfor- mances on Olympus; and second (68-74, past tense), as a feature of thè 'historic' choral procession they made immediately after their birth (cf. 53-62) to join thè gods at thè summit of Olympus.3 In thè latter, their subject (subsumed into thè narrative of thè postnatal procession, establishing it as thè very first song), is their father's kingship in thè ουρανός, a kingship Consolidated in thè allocation of domains, or sphères of influence, to thè individuai Olympians. Within these two accounts of thè Muses' songs about thè gods' places within thè cosmic dispensation, are a séries of words and phrases that describe what thè Muses do. In other words, thè pre- ambular passage that introduces thè gods' individuai domains also deals with thè character of thè Muses themselves.4 Moreover, a striking pattern of verbal correspondences links thè Muses' activities and thè individuai names in thè Muse-catalogue.5 Thus, Κλειώ (Clio) echoes κλείουσιν (67 «celebrate», «make fam- 1 For thè panhellenic 'Hymn to thè Muses', with its generic similarities to, and departures from, thè 'Homeric Hymn' see Clay 2003, pp. 50-72. 2 I assume thè Homeric and Hesiodic invocations to have been composed in thè period 750-675. 1 do not follow thè arguments given in Wheeler 2002 for 'down dating' to thè sixth Century. 3 For this reading of τοτ' (68) resuming thè narrative from thè Muses' birth follow- ing thè Olympian digression at 63-67, see West, ad loc; also Thalmann 1984, p. 138; for a further reading of thè scene, and the subsuming of the Muse's first song into the poet's narrative, Clay 2003, pp. 68-69. 4 This follows West (on 66) in taking νόμους {66, 74) as «ordinances»: «that is, the τιμά laid down for each of thè gods by Zeus. . . »; cf.

By thus embedding their names within a narrative of the very first song, Hesiod implies that the names, and the activities they denote, were fixed at birth, divinely bestowed at the moment when song itself originated. Names and attributes are inextricably fused both from the divine past and in Hesiod's inspired account of it; indeed the anthropomorphic account of birth is, as it were, rep- licated linguistically in what Thalmann calls the «transformation of descriptive verbs, nouns, and adjectives into proper names».3 We do not know whether Hesiod inherited pre-existing Muse- names (or variants thereof ) or invented them to fit the Muse-ac- tivities he présents. No name-scheme known to us predates him, and he may have been first to name the füll chorus of nine.4 The canonical names may well have been an original component of a revolutionary hymn to the goddess 'Muses', functioning also as a programmane lead to the inspired catalogues that follow.5 Be that 1 The correspondances are : ακρότατης (62) / άκροτάτω ; χοροί /χορούς ; καλά (63) / καλούς ; and "Ιμερος (64) / Ιμερόεντας ; thus, the identification of the Olympian' Mus- es as also 'Heliconian' is carefully prepared from the outset. 2 Cornutus p. 16, 20-17, 1 Πολυμνία δέ έστιν ή πολυύμνητος αρετή ή μάλλον ίσως ή πολλούς υμνούσα. 3 Quotation from Thalmann 1984, p. ΐ38. 4 See Hardie 2006, arguing that the alleged 'earliest' Muse names on Helicon (Me- lete, Aoide, Mneme) are the products of fourth Century invention. 5 West 1966, p. 32 infers that the names are Hesiodic inventions; cf. Maehler 1982, vol. 11, p. 72: «Die Namen der 9 Musen ... sind sehr wahrscheinlich Hesiods Erfin- dungen, da er sie alle aus ihren Tätigkeiten oder Attributen in Th. 36fr. herleitet...».</page><page sequence="5">Etymologising thè Muse 13 as it may, thè issue of Hesiodic invention as understood later with- in thè wider reception of thè name-catalogue is of centrai concern for présent purposes. For those ancient readers who accepted that Hesiod invented thè names (and by thè Hellenistic era, if not long before, his authorship was widely canvassed) référence to his text entailed a return to thè very origin of thè names and to thè fìx- ing or assignation of their individuai identities. * Hesiod's early au- thority in this area is illuminated by thè near-replication of names and ordering within thè Muse-procession depicted on thè François Vase (c. 570). 2 It seems that thè Muse names as ordered and trans- mitted by Hesiod won panhellenic acceptance;3 and it was to Hes- iod and his hymn that thè named Muses owed their fame and their présence in Greek poetry.4 In a later era, when thè participants in Plutarch's Quaestiones Conviviales turn to thè subject of thè Muses, they preface matters with a libation to thè goddesses and thè sing- ing of Hesiod's verses on their birth.5 The fascination that a théogonie poet's assignation of divine names could hold for ancient readers is vividly on display in thè Orphie' commentary preserved in thè Derveni Papyrus.6 In thè archaic era, as later, names were understood to carry etymologi- Murray 2004, p. 367 is agnostic, but she well notes thè programmane fonction of thè Muses' birth in a «poem whose thème is that of création and birth» (ibidem, p. 366).

Herodotus, who crédits Hesiod and Homer with the organisation and naming of the entire Hellenic pantheon, alludes to HesiocTs account of Zeus' distribution of divine domains (τιμαί) as he does so, thereby sug- gesting an analogue between poet and supreme deity.2 It is of espe- cial interest that Hesiod clusters the etymological counterparts of his Muse-names within the Muses' own célébration of Zeus' dis- tribution of divine sphères of influence, for in assigning names to the Muses, he is assigning their first individuai domains. Moreover, hère alone he (twice) uses νόμοι in the sensé «divine ordinances» governing individuai domains;3 and with the catalogue of Muse names following, the inference that Hesiod has correlated νόμοι and ονόματα («names»), as Piato was to do in his treatment of ety- mology in the Cratylus, is almost irrésistible.4 A heterodox position may be advanced: Hesiod, I would sug- gest, is promulgating an early conception of the Muses as god- desses with individuai domains akin to those of their Olympian colleagues and reflected in thè individuai names assigned to them. Such a conception is generally dated to later periods, making its first appearance in Piato and finding its mature expression in the generic spécialisations attributed to individuai Muses in thè late Hellenistic and early impérial eras. 5 But this seems to me to mis- read Hesiod, and also to overlook a Pindaric passage (N. 3, 15-16) in which the Muse Clio appears to possess epinician κλέος («fame») 1 O'Hara 1996, pp. 11, 17-18; Sedley 2003, p. 31; for the application of the Cratylus doctrine to Muse-etymologising, Plut.

Similarly, Plato's désignation of the «name-giver» (the assigner of names to things) as nomothetes (literally, 'legislator'), may hâve been influenced by the Orphie use of the same term for the théogonie poet as the assigner or distributor of divine sphères of influence (PDerv. Col. 7, 10, quoting «Orpheus», following the commen- tator's exposition of his riddling ονομάτων θέσιν). 5 Plat. Phaedr. 259cd (cited below, 3.), with the comments of Murray 2004, p. 375.</page><page sequence="7">Etymologising thè Muse 15 as her divine «share» (αίσα). * Of course, there is a distinction to be made between the divine sphère of a Muse and that of an Olym- pian god like Apollo, Hera or Aphrodite, for each named Muse is both an individuai and a member of the chorus, Standing for a facet of the Muses' collective or choric activity.2 Moreover, the Muses carry assigned 'speaking names' quite différent from those of the major Olympians, inherited from deep pre-history At the choric level, each catalogued Muse name represents etymologi- cally the personification of a facet of 'music' that characterises the activities of all nine. Calliope represents the part of the Muses' activity that involves singing «with beautiful voice» (όπί καλή), for of course, all the Muses sing 'with beautiful voice' and not just Calliope.3 Similarly, Thalia shares her interest in festivity with her eight sisters, Terpsichore embodies the Muses' collective pleasure in choruses, Melpomene in thè performance of song and dance, and so on. The individuai Muse may thus be identified with the plurality and the plurality in turn, with the named individuai.4 1 Pind. N. 3, 15-16, addressed to Clio (named at 83), and evidently playing on her divine «lot» or «share» (ie the bestowal of κλέος) against Aristodeides' name ...ούκ έλεγχέεσσιν Άριστοκλείδας τεάν έμίανε κατ' αίσαν... Pfeijffer 1999» ΡΡ· 626-630 accepts Negris' emendation of τεάν, read in all mss, to έάν (with emphatic référence to Aristodeides himself). In my view this is unnecessary: first, thè word order indi- cates that the result ascribed to the Muse is not so much the victory (yet cf. 0. 14, 2o) as the victor's avoidance of disgrâce to the «old-famed agora» of Aegina (14-15), the achievement being framed as the continuation of ancient fame; second, there is no awkwardness in direct address to the Muse as continuation of the opening invoca- tion; and in a unitary ode, it is no objection that we only learn the Muse 's identity at thè end (rather, the juxtaposed Άριστοκλείδας τεάν acts as a preambular due to Clio as the addressed Muse); thirdly, κατ' αίσαν may modulate between the divine share bestowed on the Muse and the share bestowed by her on Aristodeides. For the Muse 's αίσα, see below on Apoll. Rhod. Arg. 3, 1-5; and for a broadly comparable 'share' in the Muses, cf. Bacchyl. 3, 71; also 1, 41 and Lyr. adesp. 1001 pmg. 2 Cf.

Closely related is the conception of the Muses as individuals who are simultaneously members of a cho- rus, articulated by a late Byzantine commentator (Tzetzes) on the opening of Hesiod's Theogony, in particular the doctrine that «in each can be found ail»: Μουσαι δε εκλή- θησαν ώς όμου άεί οΰσαι-μίαν γαρ άρμονίαν έντεινάμεναι συνάδουσι και συγχορεύουσι άλλήλαις,μηδέποτε άπ'άλλήλων χωριζόμεναι.εί γαρ καΐ ίδιον κλήρον εκάστη εΐληχεν,ή μέν αστρονομίας, ή δέ γεωμετρίας, ή δέ καλλιέπειας, ή δέ ωδών, και ετέρου ετέρα, άλλ'έν εκάστη πάσας έστιν εύρειν . Themistius draws on the same ideas at Orationes p. 255cd H.</page><page sequence="8">i6 Alex Hardie And each individuai Muse has a prototypical domain that is shared with her sisters. Hesiod's assertion of the Muses' individuality within the choral collective offered poets a new way of engaging with 'the Muse(s)', including new opportunities to develop the Μοΰσα of epic invoca- tory convention into an inspiring figure with an individuai name, identity and character;1 and that in turn helped poets develop Ί/ thou' interaction with individuai Muses in cultic invocations that rapidly evolved away from the rhapsodie hymnal Starts of the epic singer.2 This Hesiodic legaey, and its postulated rationale within divine 'shares' or domains, is illuminated, and indeed validated for the Hellenistic era, in Apollonius' naming of Erato (Arg. 3, 1-5): Ει δ' άγε νυν 'Ερατώ, παρ' έμ' ίστασο και μοι ενισπε εν&amp;εν δπως ες Ίωλκόν ανήγαγε κώας Ίήσων Μηδείης ύπ'ερωτί,- συ γαρ και Κύπριδος αίσαν έμμορες, άδμήτας δέ τεοίς μελεδήμασι θέλγεις παρθενικάς· τω και τοι επήρατον ουνομ' άνήπτοα. Come now, Erato, stand by me, and teli me how Jason brought the Fleece back from Kolchis to Iolkos for love of Medeia; for you yourself had a share of of Cypris' divine lot, and you bewitch untamed virgins with love-cares; and for that reason a lovely name has been attached. Erato is asked to teli a tale of έρως («erotic love» 3); she has received a share of Aphrodite's sphère of influence (3-4); and, in terms that precisely recali Hesiod on Aphrodite's divine 'share', she bewitches virgins with her μελεδήματα («love-cares», with play on bewitch- ing musical μέλη).3 «And therefore to you», says the poet, «a lovely name has been assigned» (5), an overt name-etymology that echoes one of the two Hesiodic etymological cognâtes for Erato, επήρα- τον, from Theogony 67 (same metrical sedes).4 In assimilating Aph- rodite and Erato, Apollonius recognises that that Hesiodic context had to do with the Muses' célébration of Zeus' allocation of the Olympians' sphères of influence (above) and by extension with the Muses' own domains. Building creatively on the Hesiodic concep- tion, he suggests that in acquiring her Hesiodic name, Erato had 1 Cf. Kambylis 1964, pp. 153-154. 2 Hardie 2008, p. 82.

If άνήπτοα («attached») raises a question as to thè active agent of 'at- tachment', thè question is left in thè air, for at one level (thè fiction of thè Musogony) thè name-giver will be thè Muses' own parents; but on thè scholarly level at which Apollonius can be assumed to be operating, thè name-giver suggested by his text is Hesiod. 3. Identifying thè Generic Muse The principal pattern of allusions to be documented in thè sections that follow involves etymological play on thè nine Hesiodic names, in conjunction with thè word 'Muse'. This pattern will have been informed by thè universal Greek interest in thè origins and associa- tions of names, and in thè etymological content of thè early poets, in particular their understanding of thè names of divinities. * But distinctions need to be drawn between poetic name-etymologies as they generally occur (and are currently dassified for method- ological purposes) and most of thè Muse-etymologies to be dis- cussed here.2 As was stressed earlier (2.) thè names of thè Muses are made-up 'speaking names', more or less explicitly correlated to their activities and their audience impact, and in that sense they are différent from inherited divine names like Apollo or Aphrodite or Ares to which poets might attach explicit or implicit etymologies of a speculative kind: thè Muse-name résides in thè word denoting thè activity, as does thè activity in thè Muse-name; but that said, thè principle stili holds that thè name of thè deity denotes thè es- sence of thè deity. A second distinction has to do with thè relationship between thè generic 'Muse' and thè Hesiodic Muse-names. Poetic name- etymologising typically involves a given name, placed in thè text as such, accompanied either by an explicit statement as to its déri- vation or by an etymology or etymological play that is implicit in thè words and lines that immediately follow.3 By contrast, thè texts under discussion here do not cite thè name being etymolo- 1 Feeney 1991, p. 21; Dawson 1992, pp. 23-52; O'Hara 1996, p. 18; cf. 67-69 on Ver- gilian etymologies of gods; cf.

This does not in itself raise methodological difficulties, since ancient poets and their readers were familiär with the etymologising of words that are absent from the text, or only implicitly présent. * Yet the Muse-etymologising considered hère remains unusual: a canonical Muse-name, it will be argued, may be latent or embedded within the generic term Μούσα itself; and it may be susceptible of iden- tification on the basis of such verbal hints and pointers as the poet might choose to vouchsafe in the vicinity. The notion of thè individuai Muse as 'latent' within the generic requires some illustration and validation. In the first place, it pré- supposes the active interest of ancient audiences in identifying thè individuai Muse who is invoked or alluded to within the ge- neric 'Muse' who lies on the surface of the text. There is useful évidence of just such a pattern of ancient interest in Eustathius' comments on Homer's &amp;εά («goddess», Jî. ι, ι). He observes that Homer «wished to address her as Calliope», but instead used the more elevated, generic term &amp;εά, with référence, of course, to the Muse).2 He adds that Homer «leaves it to the sophisticated listener to enquire who this is», a comment that implies learned enquiry as to the identity of this 'goddess-Muse', and by extension other 'ge- neric' Muses. Similar readings can be traced in the ancient scholia, as can the identification of Homer's Muse as Calliope.3 The latter also appears as Homer's mother in the Vitae; and the Neronian epigrammatist Lucillius names her as his Muse (A. P. 9, 572, 4).4 As a subject of scholarly enquiry, the identity of Homer's 'god- dess-Muse' may be traced back at least as far as thè Hellenistic era. The évidence lies in Apollonius' second Muse-invocation, at Argo- 1 Thus the phenomenon dubbed «suppression» (or antonomasia) by O'Hara 1996, pp. 79-82. 2 Eustathius on JL 1, 1 πάντως δέ και ό ποιητής τήν Καλλιόπη ν _θέλων ι έπικα- λέσασθοα ούκ εκφωνεί αυτήν, άλλα σεμνότερον ονόματι γενικώ τω θεά χρήται και άφιησι ζητεϊν τον συνετον άκροατήν,τίς αν εΐη αύτη,έμφήνας μόνον, Οτι Μουσαν καλεί· Μούσης γαρ το άείδειν. 3 Schol.

Do you yourself now, goddess, tell of thè toil and plans of the Colchian girl-Muse, child of Zeus; since, for my part, my mind revolves within me in speechlessness, as I ponder whether I should say that it was misery of unlovely infatuation or shameful panie through which she left the na- tions of the Colchians. (transi. Feeney, adapted) The Iliadic&amp;ea, combined with the Odyssean Μοΰσα, is summoned to speak 'herseif ' about a subject on which the poet is himself un- able to speak through mental indécision. The emphatic αύτη («you yourself...») accentuâtes the Odyssean verb of speaking (εννεπε), and thus the Muse's traditional speaking role relative to that of the poet. * Yet thè Muse is asked to do no more than she is at the start of the Odyssey («speak of»), and the intensification equally suggests audacious address to an especially powerful goddess, as in a Sapphic Muse-appeal to the principal Muse Calliope (fr. 124 V) αυτά δέ συ Καλλιόπα («you yourself, Calliope»).2 We do not know how that appeal proeeeded; but Sappho's lyric intensity and dramatic audacity in addressing the senior Muse helpfully parallels Apollonius* emotional anguish and dumb-struckhelplessness as he addresses (not the Odyssean «man», but ) the plight of a Colchian κούρη. No Muse-name is given; but the question of Muse-identity is implicitly raised by αυτή , and an answer is heard at thè end of the invocation in the key matter of Medea's departure: κάλλιπεν (5).3 1 Combined Muses: see Livrea 1973, p. 3. Feeney 1991, pp. 90-91 may overstress the requirement for the Muse's personal entry into the narrative (see below, and [n. 2 on p. 20]); see also Hunter 1993, pp. 105-106, who sees in the proem the poet affecting to lose control of his narrative, and retreating from his brash self-confidence vis a vis the Muse in the first proem into «an archaic dependence on the Muse». 2 Cf. A. P. 9, 189, 5-6 (after a summons to the Lesbides to hymn Hera, led by Sappho) ή γλυκύν ύμνον / είσαΐειν αυτής δόξετε Καλλιόπη. For αύτη in audacious personal appeal cf. also Sapp. fr. 1, 27-28 V συ δίαυτα / σύμμαχος έσσο (Aphrodite); and for. Apollonius, Arg. 3, 11, with Hunter's note. Did Sappho perhaps summon Calliope by inviting her to 'leave* some habituai haunt? 3 Green 2007, pp. 291-292 rightly poses the question «which Muse?», and on other grounds suggests a choice between Calliope and Melpomene.</page><page sequence="12">20 Alex Hardie In this implicit paranomasia, Apollonius signais his view that the Homeric Muse, hère invoked, was indeed Calliope and therefore did not need to be named; * indeed like Eustathius' Homer, he may 'wish' to invoke Calliope but in exaggerated déférence to her se- niority chooses instead the two elevated epic addresses, combined with the emotional, intensificatory αύτη of lyric invocation (with a possible antécédent in Sappho's treatment of her own emotional turmoil). Apollonius thereby supplies a 'Homeric' name to match thè explicit naming of thè 'Hesiodic' Erato in the third proem.2 In persuading her to help, moreover, he implicitly reminds his Muse that in Hesiodic terms, as Διός τέκος, she too is a κούρη (Theog. 60, the birth of the Muses) ή δ'ετεκ'έννέα κούρας («and she gave birth to nine daughters») Behind the Apollonian invocation lies an earlier pattern whereby invocation of the generic Muse is followed immediately or after an interval by thè name Calliope.3 Alcman fr. 27, 1 Μώσ' αγε Καλ- λιόπα exemplifies the pattern; and its interest for présent purposes is underlined by the single 'Homeric' address to a named Muse (again, Calliope), at H. H. 31, 1-2 Ήλιον ύμνεϊν αυτέ Διός τέκος άρχεο Μούσα / Καλλιόπη («do you now, Muse, child of Zeus, Calliope, start a hymn to Sun...»); clearly influenced by lyric in- vocations, this offers the only parallel for Apollonius' Διός τέκος of a Muse.4 For a deferred 'identification' of the generic Muse in Pindar, we may compare Olympians 10, where the early vocative ώ ΜοΧσ' (3) is picked up by the Locrians' care for Calliope (14). Again, in Nemeans 3, the invocation of the generic Muse is followed by verbal dues to her identity and this is explicitly confirmed as Clio at the end of the ode.5 A further, equally allusive, illustration of the same phenomenon appears at the start of the fourth Pythian: 1 A learned Calliopean allusion, now lost, may underpin κάματον as headline sub- ject: cf. Prop. 3, 2, 16 nec defessa choris Calliopea meis; and in this Homerising context, with contrast between ability/inability to speak, the motif may play upon Theog. 39 (the Muses singing) φωνή ομηρεΰσαι, των δ* ακάματος ρέει αύδιη... 2 Oppian studied Apollonius' invocations dosely (Livrea 1973, p. 3): for a possible learned reprise, cf. Cyn. 1, 16-17 τοιγαρ έγώ εραμαι θηρης κλυτα δήνε'άεΐσαι. /τουτό με Καλλιόπη κέλεται, τοΰτ' "Αρτεμις αυτή (for programmatic έραμαι and Erato, cf. Pind. Pae. 6, 58, analysed below, 6.). 3 Cf.

Apollonius* κάλλιπεν) and explicit in Calliope. 4 Διός τέκος at Λ. ι, 202, etc. is conventionally, with one other exception, used of Athena. 5 Above, 2 (with [n. 1 on p. 15]); below, 4. 1.</page><page sequence="13">Etymologising the Muse 21 Pindar invokes thè generic Muse that she may «swell thè breeze of hymns owed to thè Latoidai and to Pytho» (P. 4, 3-4 Μοίσα, Λατοί- δαισιν όφειλόμενον Πυ/θώνί τ'αυξης ουρον ύμνων): thè reader interested in identifying thè generic Μοίσα, has a due to hand in ουρον («wind»), souncüng as it does like the first two syllables of Ourania'; and its significance is confirmed in the final triad, where ούρου (292, in ring composition with ουρον) is co-located with ού- ρανω (289). 1 Pindar, I would suggest, is hinting at the celestial in- terests of his generic Muse and at her identity with Ourania. What thèse passages, taken together, seem to indicate is that once the Muses had acquired acknowledged individuai identities, lyric poets started to experiment with the relationship between the generic and thè individuai Muse, both explicitly and allusively or implicitly, and that that lyric expérimentation later, through the work of the Alexandrian Mouseion, acquired a more formai, schol- arly, status represented for us in Apollonius, the Homeric scholia and, most explicitly, Eustathius. Scholars and readers wanted to know the identity of the generic Muse. And thè game of identify- ing the Muse extended to Muse-iconography, as may be inferred from Propertius' visual évocation of the Muses, and his judgement from théories («appearance») of one that she was Calliope (3, 3, 38, below, 4.). 4. Etymological Play around Named Muses Some examples of conventional name-etymologising, where the individuai Muse-name is stated and is the subject of etymological play, like Erato at Argonautica 3, 1-5 will illustrate the kind of etymo- logical play that poets found interesting, and the range of etymo- logical cognâtes, both Hesiodic and otherwise, that might be de- ployed. First, in a first Century ad epigram by Honestus on Thalia inscribed at the Mouseion on Helicon (Gow and Page, gp, 2444) βάλ- λει, επ' ειρήνης σοφίης καλά («the beauties of poetry flourish in peace»), plays etymologically on Θάλεια in the second line (a non-Hesiocûc etymology). In the same group of Muse-epigrams 1 ούρος («wind») seems to hâve no attested etymological relationship with ουρανός ; but that the Pindaric juxtaposition is etymologically significant is near-guaranteed by an attested etymology of ουρανός from οδρος in the sensé 'guard' (Achill. Tat. Intr. Arai. 5); and cf. Hesych. 0 1859 ούράνιον νέφος· κατ' ούρανον έρχόμενον. ή υπό ούρων έλαυνόμενον. For the rôle of the long-distance écho in ring composition identifying the Muse, see below, 7. on Pind. O. 6, 21 and 105.</page><page sequence="14">22 Alex Hardie (gp, 2446-2447), Terpsichore is twinned with Dionysus, the latter equipped with a pipe whereby he is τερπνότερος ('more pleasing' ; again, non-Hesiodic). More sophisticated is Pindar's deployment of Clio in Nemeans 3, already touched on (above, 3.), where the 'Muse' is invoked at thè start and is named at the end; the audi- ence may be momentarily deceived by the référence to her «voiee» (δπα 5) into suspecting allusion to Calliope; but hints as to her true identity are vouchsafed in etymological reflections of her name, notably in the name of the victor, Aristodeides who has won fame for Aegina (εύκλέι 68) and in the «famed» (cf. κλυτάς 23) pillars of Héraclès (Ήρακλέος 2ΐ). Explicit etymologising on the names of the Charités works in very much thè same way in Pindar's cult hymn in Olympians 14 where the άγλαος άνήρ («splendid man» 7) who caps a list of three distinguished qualities dépendent on the Charités reflects the character of Aglaia, named at line 13. Again, as might be expected, Latin poets engage in etymologising around named Muses: Horace offers Clio juxtaposed with celebrare (Odes 1,12, 2) and Calliope juxtaposed with voce (Odes 3, 4, 3); Propertius recognises Calliope from her facies (Greek δψ, «face» 3, 3, 38); and Ovid etymologises Erato from her nomen Amoris (Ars 2, 16). Creative etymological play is evident within Empedocles' invo- cation of Calliope to come to his side (fr. 131 D-K): εύχομένω νυν αύτε παρίστασο, Καλλιόπεια, /άμφί θεών μακάρων άγα&amp;ον λογον εμφαίνοντι («now again, stand by me in response to my prayer, Calliope, as I make manifest a fine discourse about the blessed gods»). In a play upon divine epiphany, Empedodes lit- erally identifies thè goddess Muse with thè poem he is «making manifest». l This further involves etymological play between Καλ- λιόπεια and a near-synonym (αγαθόν λόγον), of the έπεα that flow from the kings on whom Calliope attends (Theog. 84) :2 af- ter Hesiod, Calliope is associated with έπεα in Alcman fr. 27 (cited below, 6.), and she is later the patroness of καλλιέπεια («beauti- ful speech»).3 Empedocles suggests the extension of that interest 1 For this passage and parallele for the Muse in epiphany as the poem/song, Hardie 2008, pp. 83-84. 2 Barmeyer 1968, pp. 149-151 for Calliope's pre-eminence within the Muses patron- age of kings and their έπεα. For etymological play through synonym of thè word etymologised, see Cairns 1996, p. 27: «Type 3: A is derived from C, a (near)-synonym or (near)-antonym of B». 3 Cornutus N.

This same exten- sion to λόγος is reflected in what Piato has to say about her in thè Phaedms (below).1 None of thè above examples deploys etymological cognâtes found in thè Theogony. Fourth Century awareness and creative de- velopment of thè latter do however appear in Plato's myth of thè cicadas that report to thè Muses who among men honours which Muse (Phaedr. 259cd): Τερψιχόρα μεν ουν τους εν τοις χοροίς τετιμηκότας αυτήν άπαγ- γέλλοντες ποιουσι προσφιλέστερους, τη δε ΈρατοΙ τους εν τοις έρω- τικοίς, και ταις άλλαις ούτως, κατά το είδος εκάστης τιμής- τή δέ πρεσβυτάτη Καλλιόπη και τή μετ' αυτήν Ουρανία τους εν φιλοσοφία διάγοντας τε και τιμώντας τήν εκείνων μουσικήν άγγέλλουσιν,αι δή μάλιστα των Μουσών περί τε ούρανόν καΐ λόγους ουσαι θείους τε και ανθρωπίνους ιασιν καλλίστην φωνήν. They announce to Terpsichore those who hâve honoured her in the cho- ruses and make them her favourites; to Erato, those in matters erotic, and to the rest similarly according to the form of worship offered to each. But to the most senior, Calliope, and after her Ourania, the Muses who in their especial concern for the ουρανός ['heaven'] and for accounts of gods and men send out the most beautiful voice, they report those who spend their lives in philosophy and who honour the μουσική of those Muses. In an intensely etymologising passage, the names again reflect the essence of the Muses, hère related explicitly to their several sphères of influence (το είδος εκάστης τιμής). Piato deploys two Hesiodic Muse-etymologies, Τερψιχόρα /χοροίς and Ουρα- νία /ούρανόν. But he develops the other two: καλλίστην φωνήν varies the Hesiodic όπί καλή and ΕρατοΙ /ερωτικοίς goes beyond Hesiod's έρατος into the higher workings of έρως.2 Piato is of course appropriating the Muses as patronesses of philosophy as τεύοντοα και δήμοις προσφωνουσιν, άγοντες αυτούς πει&amp;οΐ και ου βι' εφ' Οτι αν προαιρώνται, Cf. Schol. Hes. Theog. ι (on Muse's children) Καλλιόπης δέ Όρφεύς, ώς καλλιέπειας ποιητικής εύρετής, και ύμνων των εις τους θεούς... (on the sphère of each Muse) κλήρον έκαστη εΐληχεν, ή μ ν αστρονομίας, ή δέ γεωμετρίας, ή δέ καλλιέπειας... For Muses (and Charités) singing a καλόν έπος, cf. Theogn. 15-18. 1 For a careful and persuasive account of the évolution of the Muses' interest in logos, noting Empedocles and the Phaedrus, see Murray 2004. Although very late (e. iv ad), the etymologising in Manetho Apoteksmatica 17 may écho an earlier text: Κύπρι- δά τ' εύπλόκαμον καλή λέγε Καλλιόπεια. 2 φωνή is however Hesiodic, of the Muses (Theog. 39); Berlinzani 2002 contains a füll account.</page><page sequence="16">24 Alex Hardie the highest form of μουσική ; * and in doing so, he proceeds from, and adapts, the early conception of the Muses and their sphères of musical interest embedded in the Hesiodic names and etymolo- gies. Erato and Terpsichore had appeared together (fifth and sixth) in the Hesiodic catalogue, and they here recali the preceding myth (246a-249d) of the charioteer, with its focus on the higher έρως (cf. Erato) and on aspiration to membership of the divine chorus (cf. Terpsichore). Urania and Calliope are the final two names, eighth and ninth; paired here, they both «utter the most beautiful voice» (jointly alluding, via thè etymology of Calliope and the celestial Ourania, to the cosmic music of the celestial Muses);2 and again, their partnership now focuses not on kings' επεα, but on philoso- phers' λόγοι.3 Four old Muse names, functions and etymologies are thus creatively blended in ways consistent with their Hesiodic origins but developed and shaped around their new context. 5. Etymological Play around the Generic Muse 5. 1. Thalia This extended section addresses the central matter under review, implicit etymologising around the generic 'Muse'. Thalia will serve as a helpftil introduction, to illustrate the antiquity of the phe- nomenon and the cumulative weight of comparative évidence in validating its présence in spécifie contexts. Thalia will also help es- tablish awareness of thèse allusive procédures among Latin poets. In a line attributed to Terpander (Plut. Lyc. 21, 5; pmg, p. 363), it is claimed «there [se. Sparta] flourishes the spear of youth and the clear-voiced Muse» (ενθ' αίχμά τε νέων θάλλει και μοΰσα λί,γεια); θάλλει is chosen for its figurative association with flour- ishing 'youth' and, we may suspect, for its etymological proximity, illustrated above (4.) from the imperial-era Honestus epigram, to the Muse-name Thalia. Thalia's présence may again be considered within Bacchylides' address to the ageing Hieron at 3, 88-94: 1 Barmeyer 1968, pp. 185-186. 2 They are twinned at Macr. Somn. 2, 3, 2 (Calliope, Ourania and the music of the sphères, again with prominent cosmic référence to the etymology of Calliope). The two Hesiodic seniors are already separated from the remainder in their placement on the François Vase. Cf. Bacchyl. 5, 13 and 176. 3 αι δή μάλιστα των Μουσών περί ...λόγους ουσαι θείους τε καΐ ανθρωπίνους would fairly summarise the main produets of Hesiodic Muses, the Theogony and the Works and Days: Clay 2003, passim.</page><page sequence="17">Etymologising the Muse 25 άνδρί S' ου θέμις, πολι,ον π[αρ]έντα γήρας, &amp;άλ[εια]ν αδτις άγκομί&lt;σ&gt;σαι ήβαν.

The radiance of virtue does not diminish in strength with thè body of mortals, but the Muse nurtures it. Hiero, you have displayed to mortals the most beautiful flowers of wealth. In rejecting rejuvenation as a recourse for the ageing tyrant, Bac- chylides juxtaposes vegetai flowering and increase (θάλειαν) with bodily decline and the permanence of Muse-tended virtue and fame. The adjective θάλειαν and the tending «Muse» might to- gether suggest allusion to Thalia, whose Hesiodic name Θάλεια is also in the adjectival form and who was closely associated in antiquity with thè divinised power of growth and flowering.1 There might indeed be an earlier juxtaposition of «flourishing» Hieron with Muses at 69-71 if the restoration [εύθα]λή φί,λιππον άνδρ' («flourishing, horse-loving man», of Hieron) is correct and if [εύθα]λή can be associated with [ίοπλό]κων τε μέρο[ς έχοντ]α Μουσαν («who has a share of the dark-haired Muses»). Around a Century earlier, the ageing Sappho, aspiring to a post- mortem existence in Hades, had invoked the présence (within the performance of the poem itself ) of festive θαλί,α and had juxtaposed that invocation with dependence on the favour of her «Muse» for a musical afterlife as an extension of présent music- making. Festive &amp;αλία, with terrestrial music-making personified in the «Muse», will be life-giving, will sustain the old poetess and will translate her to the flourishing existence of the pious musician after death.2 Again, we may suspect the présence in the text of the Muse Thalia, presiding goddess over festivity and, as in Bacchy- lides, flourishing permanence. A similar etymologising procedure had earlier been observed by David Young in relation to Thalia qua 'Charis': in Pindar's seventh 1 Usener 1896, p. 134; Parker 2005, p. 435; Roscher 4, 451-452; re, va,i2O4-i2o6; Har- die 2005, pp. 18-19, 26-27.

But there are a number of borderline cases where it is less than certain that Muse-allusion is présent.3 One such is the open- ing of Pindar Isihtnians 6 (1-3): θάλλοντος ανδρών ώς δτε συμποσίου δεύτερον κρατήρα Μοι,σαίων μελέων κίρναμεν Λάμπωνος εύαέθλου γενεάς υπέρ... As when a drinking party of men is thriving, so we are mixing a sec- ond bowl of the Muses' songs in honour of Lampon's prize-winning off- spring... (transi. Race) Hère βάλλοντος . . . συμποσίου is «a transfigured écho of the Ho- meric δαίτα θάλειαν» (Bury; see below, 5. 2. for résonance with Thalia) and certainly recalls festive θαλί,α; Thalia herseif was closely associated with thè symposium and so we might reason- ably consider whether the Muse herseif is présent.4 Yet Μοισαί,ων might seem to suggest all the Muses, and indeed we encounter them, associated with another drink-poem metaphor, at thè end of thè ode (74-75). Again, however, an invocation to the Singular 'Muse' appears at thè start of the third triad, linked to the speaker's 1 Young 1968, pp. 75, 96-97; Isth. 3/4, 6-8; 01. 9.16 (θάλλει), 19 ( στεφάνων), 27 (Χα- ρίτων νέμομαι καπον). Ariphron's paian to Hygieia (Athen. 7Oif-7O2b; ig, iv. 1.132) speaks of «flourishing with the voices of the Charités» (τέ&amp;αλε ... Χαρίτων όάροις). Similar name allusions are found with the Sirens: below, 5. 4. 2 For the détails, Hardie 1998, pp. 254-255.

Etymological Play on the Rôle /Performance of the Generic Muse(s) This sub-section focuses on etymological play on a range of names where invocations to, and /or performances of, the generic Muse(s) are the subject of etymological play with cognâtes, both Hesiodic and otherwise, of individuai Muse-names. These will be of the kind ενίΚαίχμά τε νέων Φάλλει και μούσα λί,γεια, (above, 5.1.) where μούσα as subject of θάλλει suggests Thalia. But as with Thalia, not all the examples cited are likely to be equally persuasive, and to each is attached an assessment of its possible or probable valid- ity. Three reasonably secure instances are presented first, followed by three passages where allusion to Muse-names is less dear eut. In Alcman fr. 28 pmgf, we read «Muse, daughter of Zeus, heav- enly one, I shall sing clearly...», Μώσα Διός σύγατερ λίγ' άεί,- σομαι ώρανίαφι, where ώρανίαφι is presented in our sources for thè line as an adjectival form meaning ουρανιά. Calarne translates «Muse céleste fille de Zeus...» and suggests that the adjective may be substantival in force, with référence to the Muse-name.4 That 1 The same movement from adjective to invocation of singular Muse in a festive context appears in the New Sappho (P. Köln 21351, 1-8), if West 's inspired restoration of MotaejLov at 5 is indeed correct; there again, the «Muse» is Thalia. The victor's name Φυλακίδα echoes the same name in die same strophic sedes in the first triad, and thus connects komoi with symposium and crater; for the drinking crater (2) as common feature of both symposium (1) and komos (58), see Lissarague 1990. 2 0. 14, 15-17 (Thalia the Charis) with Verdenius 1987, p. 118 (on 15); and cf.

Page 1951, p. 127 rejects the adjec- tival form as corrupt and proposes as possible readings ώρανόφιν or ώρανία φίλα ; this does not materially affect the présent argument, since some word signifying 'heaven', and therefore cognate with Urania, evidently stood in this position.</page><page sequence="20">28 Alex Hardie Urania, «daughter of Zeus», is referred to through an etymologi- cal cognate is scarcely open to doubt. * Pindar speaks of Cadmus and Peleus witnessing choric Muse- performances: they «heard the Muses making music on the moun- tain and in seven-gated Thebes» (P. 3, 90): μελπομεναν εν δρει Μοισαν και εν έπταπύλοις οαον Θήβοας. Melpomene will of course be participating in this performance, and it seems probable that an ancient audience would hâve heard her (participial) name within this quintessential activity of the choric Muses (μελπομεναν, «making music») and such an allusion would in turn strengthen the analogue between Muses and the maiden chorus (κουραι) that is earlier (78-79) said to celebrate (μέλπονται) the Great Mother in choric dance and song.2 In Peace, Aristophanes' chorus seeks the Muse's epiphany and favour in a festive dance (775-780): Μούσα, συ μέν πολέμους άπωσαμένη μετ' εμού του φίλου χόρευσον, κλείουσα θεών τε γάμους ανδρών τε δαιτας και θαλίας μακάρων σοι γαρ τάδ' εξ άρχης μέλει. Muse, drive out wars as a thème and dance in the chorus with me as your beloved celebrating the weddings of the gods, the banquets of men, and the festivities of the blessed ones, for thèse hâve been your concern from the first. The hymnal objective is to persuade the Muse to exdude war (as a subject) from the sacred choros but to include the choric speaker, as a sign of favour to one who is her beloved, within the 'peace- fuT context which he daims was her first concern. In doing so, the chorus embeds two complimentary echoes of Μούσα within the rejected and sought-for subject matter: πολέμους _άπωσαμένη and γάμους Ανδρών. An attested debt to modeis in Stesichorus (210 pmg) accentuâtes the return to thè archaic or Original' Muse; and εξ αρχής recalls Hesiodic Statements about the first, or quintes- sential, characteristics of various figures, and possibly also the Hes- iodic Muses' professional interest in divine «beginnings».3 The epi- 1 Alcman elsewhere (fr. 27, 1 pmgf) addresses Calliope by name, again as daughter of Zeus. 2 For a clear instance of participial allusion to Melpomene, see below, 5. 4. on Apoll. Rhod. Arg. 4, 898. 3 With τάδ' εξ άρχης μέλει of primordial divine interests, cf. Hes. Theog. 203 (Aphro-</page><page sequence="21">Etymologising the Muse 29 cising κλείουσα and thè jingle with Μούσα arguably combine to create an etymological référence to Κλειώ (Clio) and thè présence of etymologising is confirmed in δαίτας . . . θαλίας («banquets . . . festivities») which alludes to, but splits, thè epic formula δαίτα &amp;άλειαν (Λ. 7, 745, etc.), where adjectival θάλεια is common to the name-form of Hesiodic Θάλεια, θαλίας itself is the Hesiodic etymological cognate for Θάλεια.1 The 'Muse' is not to be identi- fied literally as either Clio or Thalia; but the return to the Muses' origins takes us (directly and /or via Stesichorus) to the origins, the Hesiodic names and functions; and it is difficult to think that etymologising is not intended. Hesiod himself présents a more problematic passage, in his re- prise of thè Theogony at thè start of the Works and Days (Erg. 1-3): Μουσαι Πιερίηθεν άοιδησι κλεί,ουσαι, δεύτε Δί' εννέπετε, σφέτερον πατέρ'ύμνείουσαι. δν τε δια βροτοί άνδρες όμως άφατοι τε φατοι τε, Muse who celebrate in song, come hither from Piena and sing of Zeus, hymning your own father, through whom mortai men are likewise famed orunfamed... Echoing the proem to the Theogony, Hesiod offers two parallel participles, vertically juxtaposed at their line-ends, each ending in -είουσαι, each creating a rhyming jingle with Μουσαι, and each recalling a Muse-name etymological cognate.2 We are confronted with a central issue of methodology: do the participles here re- fer simply and solely to the functions of the choric Muses, or are we also to hear/understand the Hesiod's own Muse-names with- in these choric activities? What might allusion to the individuai Muses add to the choric références? And why in any case should the poet refer to individuai Muses in an address to the plurality? These issues will feature again in what follows, and they are hardly susceptible of a clear-cut response on the basis of a single passage, even one by Hesiod himself. We can be clear that Hesiod is referring to the originai Muse- dite) ταύτην δ' εξ άρχης τιμήν έχει ήδέ λέλογχε. For the Muses' interest in divine beginnings, Theog. 45-46 (the Muses) θεών γένος . . . κλείουσιν ... / έξ άρχης ... ; cf. 115. 1 For etymological marking of this sort, see Maltby 1993; O'Hara 1996, pp. 86-88; Cairns 1996. The significance of these participial jingles is underlined by Plato's at δή μάλιστα των Μουσών oükiÄt (i.e. Μουσαι ... ούσαι); cf. the reported (Schol. Hes. Theog. 1) etymology of Μουσαι from όμου άεί ούσαι· 2 For the verbal echoes of the Theogony see West 's notes on Unes 1 and 2.</page><page sequence="22">30 Alex Hardie fonctions established in the goddess' very first, postnatal, hymn to Zeus, as narrated in the Theogony (above, 2.); and there the Muses were conceived in both choric and individuai ternis. Thus, plural address should not be problematic for allusions to individuai Muse- names. Again, there is etymological play on Zeus* own name (Δι', ôv . . . δια), allied to the attribution to Zeus of thè power to confer mortai fame/obscurity that properly lies with the Muses' celebra- tory fimctions invoked in Unes 1-2. Hesiod highlights and combines two fiinctions of the Muses that in the Theogony had supplied the basis for two Muse-names (involving, in the case of Polyhymnia, repeated use of the participle ύμνεΰσοα).1 Whether we take the additional step of personalising the two participles as références to Clio and Polyhymnia dépends very much on our judgment as to Hesiod's intentions: does he mean his audience to hear thè indi- viduai Muse-name within the activity? In my view, it is difficult to suppose that Hesiod intended any such thing. The Theogony pro- vided Greek poetry with the basis for Muse-name etymologising, and it would be nice to think that Hesiod himself invented the pattern;2 yet the évidence assembled thus far suggests that it was the early lyric poets who developed the individuality of the named Muses, and it may well be that conscious allusion to Muse names through etymological cognâtes put down its first roots in lyric and not epic. Stesichorus is credited with this invocation (278 pmgf) άγε Μοΰσα λίγει' άρξον άοιδας |ερατών υμνους| / Σαμί,ων περί παίδων ερατα φ&amp;εγγομένα λύρα («Come, clear voice Muse, be- gin your song . . . about Samian boys, singing on your lovely lyre»). The corruption in ερατών ύμνους has not been satisfactorüy re- solved; at ali events, the invoked Μούσα is followed by a Hesiodic etymological cognate of Erato used once or twice. ερατος however is a common word, well-paralleled of «lovely» sound efFects.3 Does juxtaposition with the generic «Muse» suffice to create an allusion 1 For the Hesiodic pairing, cf. Lucian, Hes. 1 (asking Hesiod why the Muses' didn't grant him the power of prophecy) εκείνο δέ άπορησαι άξιον, τί δήποτε προειπών υπέρ σαυτου ώς δια τούτο λάβοις τήν_ ^εσπέσιον έκείνην φδήν παρά των θεών Οπως κλείοις καί^ύμνοίης τα παρεληλυθότα... 2 The only other extant instance of ύμνείουσαι, at Antimachus fr. 115, îM. (62, 1 SH), is in a proem that probably dealt with the dispute over who mothered the Sirens (on which, below, 5. 4.); clearly intended to recali Erg. 2, it probably reminded readers of Hesiod's Muses (three of whom are recorded as Siren-mothers) as a group; référ- ence to Polyhymnia, who is not recorded as a Siren-mother, seems unlikely. 3 Cf., e.g., Bacchyl. 17.129 νέοι παιάνιζαν ερατα όπί.</page><page sequence="23">Etymologising the Muse 31 to Erato? Here, thè context might suggest a positive answer, for thè stated subject matter, Samian boys (παίδων), is patently erotic, so that ερατα carries dual référence, to thè quality of thè music and to thè présence of έρως. * That these cross bearings should co- lour thè identity of thè generic Muse who is herseif to 'perform' seems at least possible. Philodamus' fourth Century Delphic paean for Dionysus indudes a description of thè Muses singing a paean for thè god as he first arrives on Olympus;2 they are dressed as mainads, in Dionysiac ivy and dance in a dithyrambic circle, but they do so at Apollo's com- mand and in honour of a Dionysus who is himself given Apolline attributes and who 'becomes' Paian through thè paeanic singing of thè Muses (58-62) :3 Μουσοα [δ'] αύτίκα παρθένοι κ[ισσω] στε[ψ]άμεναι κύκλω σε πασοα μ[έλψαν] άθάνα[τον] ες άεί Παιαν' εύκλέα τ'ό[πί κλέο]υ- σοα· [κα]ταρξε δ'Άπόλλων. Then thè virgin Muses, ivy-wreathed / Encircled you about,/Sang your immortaïity/ Paian, glorious for ever,/And Apollo himself led the dance. (transi. A. Stewart) There is much that is traditional in this picture of Apollo leading the Muses on Olympus, yet thè scene may specifically recali two earlier divine arrivais on Olympus, by Apollo and by the Muses. In the Pythian section of thè Homeric Hymn to Apollo, «immedi- ately» (αύτί,κα ι88; cf. Philodamus, 58) the god reaches Olympus, the Muses all sing «withbeautifiilvoice» (189) Μουσοα μέν &amp;' άμα πασαι άμεφόμεναι οπι καλή, and Apollo plays his cithara. The Muses' own first arrivai on Olympus of course occurs within the key etymologising passage in the proem to the Theogony (above, 2.), and three Hesiodic etymological cognâtes, in three successive Unes, are présent in Philodamus' text: with the latter's μέλψαν, όπί, κλέουσαι and also ά&amp;άνατον, compare Theogony 66-68: 1 For this combination, again with έρατός, see below, 6., on Anacr. Eleg. fr. 2.3-4 W. 2 Philodamus may have had in mind Eur. Bacch. 410-411, a passage which recalls Theog. 62-65. 3 Text and Commentary in Furley, Bremer 2001, pp. 52-84; exchange of attributes: ibidem, 72; for Dionysus becoming Paian through the Muses, Käppel 1992, pp. 246- 248.

They then went to Olympus, de- lighting in their beautiful voice. . . The düster of Hesiodic vocabulary is striking; but is it significant in etymological terms? A sceptic might well point out that μέλψαν is an obvious lexical choice, fits metrically and so on. The fram- ing participial jingle Μουσοα . . . κλέουσαι offers more encourage- ment: thè unique combination with όπί, is of especial interest, as an apparent variant of thè Hesiodic άοι,δησι κλείουσαι (Erg. ι): if όπί, recalls Calliope (for thè single word, cf. Orph. Arg. 253, citedbe- low, 5. 3.; and note also thè 'Calliopean' όπί καλή in both 'arrivai' antécédents), then thè phrase may direct us through thè Hesiodic narrative to thè catalogue, evoking its first and last items, Clio and Calliope, and hence by extension 'all' thè Muses. * So this difficult case may on analysis yield name-allusions that replicate thè origi- nai, Hesiodic, fìinctions established in thè Muses' very first hymn to Zeus. In a Pythian dithyramb, that first performance is blended with replication of thè first Olympian performance by Pythian Apollo as Musagetes. 5. 3. Etymological Play on thè Generic Muse(s) in Human Performances There is arguably a distinction beween thè use of etymological cognâtes in relation to Muse-performance on thè one hand, and to human performance on thè other, since in thè former thè indi- viduai Muse will be présent and participating in thè performance. Here are some passages where human performance is compared to thè Muses. The Scutum (204-205) represents Apollo as citharode with thè Muses as singers: θεαΐ δ' εξήρχον άοιδής / Μουσοα ΠιερΙδες, λιγυ μελπομένης εικυΐαι («and thè goddess Muses of Pieria took up the song, just like clear-singing women»). The illustration of a 1 εύκλέα may itself carry independent authority as a cognate of Clio: cf. Pind. N. 3, 68; and for εύκλέα, Bacchyl. 13, 183-184 (cf. Clio at 9 and 228) and Orphie hymn 76, 16 (Muses).</page><page sequence="25">Etymologising the Muse 33 core Muse-activity by référence to dancing women, is somewhat paradoxical, for thè Muses were themselves thè divine paradigm for thè terrestrial (even if that paradigm was itself extracted from thè characteristic activity of iemale choruses). The paradox is evi- dently intentional, even humorous, and it may be explained by thè poet's need to convey thè shield-representation of thè divine scene in terms that could readily be visualised by thè audience on thè ba- sis of its own expérience. At ali events, thè référence to thè Muses' resemblance to these terrestrial 'Melpomenes' is not unlikely, and is thè more interesting for being thè first plausible example in early epic. In thè Orphie Argonautica, Orpheus speaks thus of his mother Calliope (251-253): Αύταρ έγώ φόρμιγγα τιτηνάμενος μετά χερσί, μητρός έμής έκέρασσ' εύτερπέα κόσμον άοιδής, καί οι άπό στη&amp;έων όπα λείριον έξελόχευσα· But Ι, having tuned my phorminx with my hands, harmonised [lit. «mixed»] a pleasing adornment of song from my mother, and from my heart brought forth a delicate voice. Within this complex and rather weird mix of musical imagery (tuning/mixing/harmony, then Calliope [μητρός έμής] as Or- pheus' mother and Orpheus giving birth to his voiced song) the adjective εύτερπέα will arguably allude to the Muse Euterpe: the adjective is unusual, and where it appears elsewhere in poetry (be- low, 5., 6.) allusion to the Muse may be surmised. Hère again, Hes- iod is intertextually présent, for we are taken back to the Theogony through Apollonius Rhodius: δπα λείριον, quotes Argonautica 4, 903 (of the Sirens) ϊεσαν έκ στομάτων δπα λείριον («they ut- tered a delicate voice from their mouths»); that passage looks back to Hesiod's Muses (Theog. 40-41) έκ στομάτων ... θεαν όπί λειρι- οέσση («from their mouths . . . with the delicate voice of the god- desses»); and in this context, δπα will part-etymologise Calliope herself. Finally, the Hesiodic/ Apollonian έκ στομάτων is replaced by άπο στ_ηΦέων, with apposite wordplay (άπό/ δπα) and reflect- ing a further Hesiodic Muse-phrase (Theog. 61, of the Muses after their birth) -ξσιν άοιδή μέμβλεται έν στή&amp;εσσιν («for whom song was a care in their hearts»).1 We thus have two probable 1 For similar άπό /δπα wordplay, combined with the maternai Muse (there Clio), cf.

Blended and Twinned Muses A lyric poet could name more than one Muse in the same poem: Bacchylides is attendant of Ourania at 5, 13-14 and later [176] in- vokes Calliope. We hâve also encountered twinned Muses, and the blending of characteristics, in the Phaedrus (above, [4.]). This sub- section considers the phenomenon in greater détail. One instance of Bacchylidean allusion to Thalia ofïered above (5. 1.) occurs in an ode (3) that opens with invocation of Clio (3). Another Bacchylidean instance of the combination of invoked Clio and allusion to Thalia appears at 13, 228-231: ταν είκ έτύμως άρα Κλειώ πανθαλής εμαις ενέσταξ[εν φρασίν,] τερψιεπείς νιν ά[ο]ιδαί παντί καρύξοντι λα[ω.] If after all it was truly all-flowering Clio who instilled it [antécédent un- known; possibly metapoetic charis] into my mind, delightful-worded songs will prodaim him to all the people. Bacchylides had invoked Clio's help (9) in an opening kletikon now otherwise entirely lost, an appeal reflected etymologically in 'fame' as a running motif (κλέος 65, άγακλειτα[ίς 90, Εύκλεία δέ φιλοστεφ[άνω] 183-184). * Here, he ends the epinician with a modest conditional assurance of its encomiastic efficacy in broad- casting Pytheas' name (and thus kleos) if Clio has indeed inspired him (se. and has truly answered his kletikon). Just a little earlier however Bacchylides stressed his reliance on «the Muses» as a plu- rality (πίσυνο[ς] ... Μούσοας]), and the possibility that (an) indi- viduai Muse(s) other than Clio is/are, as it were, blended in with her is fiirther suggested by Clio's epithet παν&amp;αλής. The word echoes earlier praise of the victor for his share of kleos (cf. 65), crowned (69-70), «with garlands of luxuriant flowers» (παν&amp;αλέων στεφάνοισιν / άν&amp;]έ[ων]) and (71-75) bringing musical komoi to the streets of Aegina; but beyond its linkage with the running mo- tifs of flowers, flourishing and victory garlands, πανθαλής addi- 1 For the verbal effect, cf. Pind. N. 3, 15-16, 20-22, 67-68 (where the opening «Muse» is identifiée! at the end as Clio); Pindar's poem, also for a pankration victor from Ae- gina, is the later of the two poems.</page><page sequence="27">Etymologising thè Muse 35 tionally echoes thè θαλίαι («festivals») that Aegina is now said to enjoy (187). And herein lies its concluding rationale, for thè poet seeks the heralding of the victor, with pleasurable impact by his songs, «to the whole people» παντί ... λα[ω.], that is, to a commu- nal gathering (or panegyris, a term later associated with thè word θαλία).1 The loud echo of πανθαλής in παντί signposts the con- nections between Clio and «whole people» and between «whole people» and &amp;αλίοα; and the latter, as we saw, are the Hesiodic province of the Muse Thalia. Bacchylides présents a carefully ex- tended conception of thè individuai Muse of his invocation, a Clio now coloured by thè festive spirit of her sister Thalia in the public gathering before which thè ode was performed and which (in its pleasurable reaction) will validate and authenticate Clio's response to his kletikon.2 For a quite différent example of allusive 'twinning', we may turn to Apollonius Rhodius on the Sirens (Arg. 4, 892-898): Άν&amp;εμόεσσαν έσέδρακον, ένθα λίγειαι Σειρήνες σίνοντ* Άχελωίδες ήδείησι θέλγουσαι μολπησιν δτις παρά πείσμα βάλοιτο. τας μέν άρ' εύειδής Άχελωίω εύνη&amp;είσα γείνατο Τερψιχόρη, Μουσέων μία, καί ποτέ Δηους θυγατέρ' ίφ&amp;ίμην, άδμήτ' ετι, πορσαίνεσκον άμμιγα μελπόμεναι· ...they saw Anthemoessa, where the dear-voiced Sirens, daughters of Achelous, used to beguile with their sweet songs whoever cast anchor there, and then destroy them. Them lovely Terpsichore, one of the Mus- es, bare, united with Achelous; and once they tended Demeter's noble daughter still unwed, and sang to her in chorus; (transi. Seaton) 1 Zonaras Lex. P. 1022, 8 Θάλεια, ευωχία, πανήγυρης, καί δ*νομα Μούσης. Hesych Θ46 θαλία- εύθηνία. ευωχία, πανήγυρις. τέρψις, ευφροσύνη. 'Panegyric' is a fourth Century coinage. 2 The punning πανθαλεων στεφανοισιν / αν^]ε[ων] (69-70), also cross refers to the flower-crowns of the maiden cuit chorus hymning Aegina (91-94) ταί δέ στεφανωσάμε[ναι φοιν]ικέων / ανθέων δόνακός τ' έ[πιχω]ρί/αν άθυρσιν / παρ- θένοι μέλπουσι ; and that chorus is in turn colour-associated with the Muses (222) φοινικοκραδέμνοις [τε Μούσαις]; thus, we may detect an analogue between indi- viduai Muse (Clio) and the chorus of Muses on the one hand and the single member of the female chorus first picked out (κό[ρα ] 84), before her «famous companions» (i.e. fellow virgin choreutai) are introduced (90). The analogue between Clio /Muses and κόρα /fellow choreutai would be clearly marked if κόρα were indeed singing of the κλέος of Aegina (94), but the supplément has lost support as being slightly too short.</page><page sequence="28">36 Alex Hardie μελπόμενοα denotes thè singing of thè Sirens, and not of the Mus- es; yet the explicit naming of Terpsichore as the Sirens' mother encourages considération of a référence to Melpomene, and this is confirmed by the external évidence for a variant version of the Sirens' parentage, with Melpomene as their mother. l Apollonius names the former, but like Bacchylides (above) he encourages the reader to recali the sister Muses (Μουσέων μία) and transparently alludes in μελπόμενοα (same sedes as Terpsichore) to the alternative version (an assured example of participial allusion to Melpomene). Apollonius does this to explain the attractions of the Sirens' μολπαί, (the combination only hère in extant poetry), a quality they share with Melpomene's own attested capacity to beguile and lead the listener.2 μολπαί, moreover, alludes to Molpe as an attested Siren name; so that hère we hâve an example of double-etymologising, of Siren- and Muse-name. 5. 5. The Metonymie Muse The word 'muse' may be used metonymically to signify a per- formed aspect of music, 'song' as it might be, or 'song and dance', or instrumental music. Such metonomy represents a very old and well-documented way of thinking of music and the Muse, where the Muse may at one and the same time stand outside the per- formance as inspiring goddess, and act as the divine embodiment of the music itself as performed.3 The following example of mét- onymie etymologising cornes from Euripides' Phoenùsae, and it in- volves the verb μέλπεσ&amp;οα^ηά thè Muse Melpomene.

Can we give this métonymie muse /music, coloured as it is by thè governing μέλπη, a divine identity akin to Melpomene? Euripides vouchsafes a pointer to personification in thè présence, literally within thè music (μοΰσαν èv ά), of thè Charités; and thè language of 'inspiration* used of Ares' war-storm (επιπνεύσας, 789 - cf. 794 - echoing πνεύματα of thè Muse-strain) suggests that thè goddess Muse stands in thè background as thè inspiring musi- cal ideai of which Ares is thè divine antithesis.1 Together with thè choric dimension, this offers encouragement for reading thè παρά- μουσος Ares as antithetical to that part of the Muses' activities that was represented by Melpomene.2 6. Hesiod's Legacy Hesiod's Theogony supplied the founding texts for Muse names, as also for Muse-name etymologising and for the identity of Muse- names and Muse activities (above, 2., 4. 2.). It is unlikely that he himself introduced the practice of of intertextual Muse-allusion (see above, 5. 2. on Erga 1-2), but his direct intertextual influence is evident in several examples considered in previous sections. This section considers four further examples, two from early lyric and two from late epic and epigram.

Come, Muse Calliope, daughter of Zeus, lead off lovely spoken words, and lend desire to the hymn and charm to the chorus. The request to «lead» (άρχ9) is formulale of the Muse in early Greek lyric; but as addressed to Calliope might more specifically evoke her Hesiodic choric leadership rôle.1 With the invocation may be compared Hesiod Theogony 63-65 (immediately after the 'erotic' narrative of the Muses' conception and birth near thè sum- mit of Olympus): έν&amp;ά σφιν λιπαροί τε χοροί και δώματα καλά, παρ 8'αύτης Χάριτες τε και *Ι μέρος οίκί'εχουσιν έν &amp;αλί.ης· ερατήν δέ δια στόμα δσσαν ΙεΤσαι ... There are their [se. the Muses'] sleek choruses and their beautiful dwell- ings; and by them the Charités and Himeros have their homes, amidst festivities; and projecting through their mouths their lovely voice. . . The overlap of words and motifs is cumulatively impressive, but might it be coincidental, reflecting the common stock of the lan- guage of divine song and dance? After all, Hesiod's juxtaposition of χοροί with χάρις /Χάριτες is not unusual. 2 Yet one parallel, Od- yssey 18, 194 Χαρίτων χορόν ίμερόεντα, is close to both passages, and specifically to Alcman's χαρίεντα ... χορόν, and it is tempt- ing to infer that the latter spotted the Homeric/ Hesiodic parallels and blended the two passages, taking personified "Ιμερος from the Theogony. 3 The ερατήν . . . δσσαν of Hesiod's singing Muses would thus be directly relevant to the ερατών επέων of Alcman's chorus; and the specifically erotic implications (so Calarne, ad loc.) will thereby be enhanced.4 If that is accepted, should we then think more specifically in terms of Erato? Or to put the question a differ- 1 On άρχ', Calarne 1983, p. 463 cites H.

Collins 1999.</page><page sequence="31">Etymologising the Muse 39 ent way, if Alcman had HesiocTs έρατήν . . . δσσαν in view, might he also have had in mind thè Muse named from thè «lovely» sound that arose both from thè Muses' voice (Theog. 65) and from their dancing feet (Theog. 70)? Alcman's interplay of song and dance of- fers some encouragement, as does thè identity of έρατών επέων with «hymn», for Hesiod's second deployment of thè epithet is juxtaposed with the participle ύμνεύσαις («hymning»). That Καλ- λιόπα should be asked to lead επεα is unsurprising (cf. Theog. 84, and above, 4.); but Alcman is patently enhancing her leading role to embrace éléments associated in Hesiod with her sisters and in- deed more generally with their divine environment on Olympus, induding personified Himeros and the Charités. Allusion to Erato would be consistent with this hymnal strategy. Pindar's sixth paean (for the Delphians) includes, at thè end of the first triad, an elaborate invocation that portrays the plural Mus- es as children of Zeus and Mnemosyne and as agents of a cosmic informing ordinance, akin to the informing function of the Del- phic oracle itself, but directed towards «poets» (σοφούς 52). We are thus directed more or less explicitly towards Homer and Hesiod, and to their founding évocations of the Muses: in the first place to the Iliadic catalogue invocation, which is cited almost Verbatim. l Hesiodic influence appears a little later, after Pindar's concluding appeal to the Muses to «listen» (that is, both to respond to his de- sire for knowledge and to hear his song).2 He goes on to say (58-61): ερα[τοα] δέ μο[ι] / γλώσσα μέλιτος άωτον γλυκύν [ ] / αγώνα Λοξία καταβάντ'εύρυν/ εν θεών ξενία («mytongue longs [to pour] the sweet essence of honey . . . having corne to the broad gathering of Loxias in the guest feast of the gods» (transi. Race, adapted). Pindar is thinking of the Muses' own gift of speech as described by Hesiod (Theog. 83-84, describing the Muses' gift to the favoured king): ...τω μεν έπί γλώσση γλυκερήν χείουσιν εέρσην, /του δ' επε' εκ στόματος ρεΐ μείλιχα («on his tongue do they pour sweet dew, and from his mouth flow honeyed words»); that Hes- iod himself was thinking of «sweet dew» as honey distilled from heaven is documented in Martin West's note on the lines, and is etymologically implicit in the favoured king's επεα ... μείλιχα.3 1 Cf.

In this context, then, it would be appropriate to read ερα[τοα] as an allusion to thè Hesiodic Erato. Such a Muse-allusion gains in at- traction from the Hesiodic context of the king entering a (populär) άν' αγώνα (91; compare Pindar's entry to the Apolline αγώνα of the Theoxenia) to caini dissension (νεϊκος 87); for if άθαν[άτων ερις (Diehl, following Bury ; adopted by Maehler but not Rutherford) is indeed the right restoration at the opening of the Muse-invocation (50), and Pindar is seeking the origins of strife among the gods, we should hâve an elegant pairing of ερις and Erato the Muse of έρως at thè start and at the end. 1 The force of this pairing may be seen from a parallel etymologising passage in Anacreon (Eleg. fr. 2, 3-4 W., where the poet says he dislikes the man who speaks of quarrels and tearful warfare at the symposium): άλλ' Οστις Μουσέων τε και άγλαα δώρ* 'Αφροδίτης συμμίσγων ερατής μνήσκετοα ευφροσύνης. . . .but whoever blending the splendid gifts of the Muses and of Aphrodi- te, remains mindful of lovely festivity...2 ερατής appears to recali and further combine both Eros (Aphro- dite) and Erato (the Muses). HesiocTs praise of the Muses' gift of éloquence to kings was of course very well known. Référence to this same passage appears in two poets of late antiquity, in com- bination with etymological allusion to Hesiodic Muses. The first involves Euterpe, and is by Nestor of Laranda (A. P. 9, 364): Σπείσατέ μοι, Μουσοα, λιγυρήν εύτερπέα φωνήν, ήδύν άπο στομάτων Έλικωνίδος ομβρον άοιδής· οσσοι γαρ ροφέουσιν άοιδοτόκου πόμα πηγής, υμετέρων επέων λιγυρη τέρπονται άοιδή. Pour for me, Muses, your clear, delightful, voice, sweet from your mouths, the rain-shower of Heliconian song. For ail who drain thè drink of the spring that gives birth to song, are delighted by the clear song of your words. 1 For the cosmic opération of Hesiodic έρις and έρως in the Theogony, noting the relevance of Empedoclean φιλία and νείκος, see Clay 2003, pp. 19-20. Rutherford 2001, p. 309 adopts Jurenka's αθάνατος πόνος, but does not deal with Maehler's obervation «πόνος longius spatio». 2 For the socio-literary attitudes underlying this rejection of songs that arouse con- tention' in favour of «songs of peaceful festivity», see Ford 2002, pp. 42-43.</page><page sequence="33">Etymologising the Muse 41 In this appeal to Μουσαι, thè allusion in εύτερπέα to thè Muse Euterpe is clearly signalled. She will herseif be présent within thè choric Muses' «delightful voice» which thè poet asks to be granted to him. As it happens, thè adjective is rare, and where it is used else- where in poetry, in Pindar and in thè Orphie Argonautica, allusion to thè Muse Euterpe is either evident or may be surmised (below, 7.). Further confirmation of thè Muse-allusion is offered by Nestor's imitation of Hesiod. He echoes and varies thè Hesiodic praise of thè Muses* gift of sweet éloquence (Theog. 83-84) including these éléments: interplay between Muses' and speaker's «mouth» as thè source of voice and words (άπο στομάτων, cf. Theog. 40 and, of thè mortai speaker, 84 and 97); thè replacement of thè speaker's «words» (επέα, Theog. 84) by those of thè Muses; and variation of thè «dew» placed by thè Muses on thè tongues of kings (Theog. 83), to «rain». Again, thè «delight» (τέρπονται) of thè poets in re- ceiving thè Muses' words varies thè delight of thè Hesiodic Mus- es' divine audience in their performance (Theog. 37, 51). Nestor's aim is to blend his voice with that of thè Muses, and central to that opening strategy is thè 'delight' embodied in thè Hesiodic Euterpe. A further echo of Hesiod from late antiquity cornes from a sixth Century ad encomium by thè Egyptian poet Dioscorus (fr. 3, 27-29 H.): Μούσα [&amp;]εορρή[των έτ]έρην [δ]ρόσ[ο]ν [ε]ύεπιάων άμμι νέης μέ[λπου]σα δίδ[ου]τινα κ[α]ρπόν άοιδής, τον νέον ηγεμόνα προφερέστατον ύμνοπολεύειν Muse, uttering further song-dew of divinely-uttered beauties of diction, grant me fruit of a new song, to hymn thè new leader first and fore- most. . . The question this passage immediately raises is whether μοΰσα, followed by thè active form μέ[λπου]σα might create an etymolo- gising allusion to Melpomene. Clearly, thè Μούσα . . . μέλπουσα jingle is suggestive of dose interplay between Muse and singing action; and Melpomene is elsewhere associated with «beauty of diction» (here [ε]ύεπιάων, cf. A. P. 9, 505, 16 Μελπομένην, ερατής ΐστορα εύεπίης). Scarcely decisive on their own, these features are reinforced by a cluster of allusions to Hesiod: the intertext προφε- ρέστατον, transferred from Calliope (Theog. 79, same sedes) to the poet 's subject as his professional priority ; Calliope as Muse of kings (Theog. 80); the association of the new leader with justice (30; also</page><page sequence="34">42 Alex Hardie 11, 16; cf. Theog. 85-86); and the Muses* «dew» and flow of eloquent words transferred from kings (Theog. 83-84) to the poet who sings of the just king. Hère, the poet's engagement with Hesiod and the Hesiodic Calliope means that we can be more confident about a référence to Melpomene. * We saw this same technique of allusion to Hesiod in Nestor (above), and it again illustrâtes the importance of Hesiod's hymn to the Muses as a founding text, its basis for the entire later process of etymologising Muse allusions, and the familiarity with the hymn that could be assumed in late antiquity. Of course, Muse-name etymologies occur in contexts where there is no direct référence to Hesiod or the Theogony. Yet as was suggested earlier, that text had a special place in relation to the Muses, their functions and their identities, because it presented their origins, the first act of naming, and the corrélation of cho- ric functions and individuai identity. Intertextual référence to the Theogony may thus act as a return to first principles in illuminating or underpinning etymological allusion to Muse names. 7. Methodology and Etymological 'Marking' At this point, it may be helpful to address directly some questions of methodology. What criteria might the reader bring to bear in assessing the présence or otherwise of etymologising Muse-name allusions? It will already be clear enough that the simple juxtaposi- tion of «Muse(s)» with, for example, common musical term such as ύμνείν or κλεί,ειν would not in and of themselves constitute etymologising allusions, even though the verbs appear as Hesiodic etymological cognâtes. Thus, to take an obvious example, there will be no référence to Polyhymnia in the conventional hymnal opening Έρμην υμνεί, Μοΰσα (H. H. 4, 1). The aim of this sec- tion is to gain a slightly doser sensé of the textual conditions in which the présence of etymologising is worth serious considér- ation. This will involve référence to méthodologies for the analysis of etymologising in Latin poetry, induding the phenomenon of 'marking', whereby the poet signais the présence of implicit ety- mologising by a range of verbal, metrical or stylistic indicators. A well-recognised etymological marker in Latin poetry is the use of words such a 'first' or 'old' that explicitly or implicitly evoke the 1 For blending of Calliope (named) and Melpomene by the same poet, cf. also fr. 23, 1 H. "Ιστασο, Καλλιόπη, καΐ μέλπεο, μήτερ άοιδής.</page><page sequence="35">Etymologising the Muse 43 first assignation of a name to a thing. * In Muse-name etymologis- ing, the same function may be served by référence to the Muses' 'originar function, such as we find in Aristophanes' choric hymn at Peace 780 (σοι γαρ τάδ' εξ αρχής μέλει), an appeal to first principles that may derive ftom Stesichorus. Intertextual allusion to the Theogony may, by returning to the first naming (above, 6.), serve much the same marking rôle. The near-collocation of thè word 'Muse' with etymological cog- nâtes (both Hesiodic and non-Hesiodic) may for présent purposes be regarded as marking the présence of Muse-name etymologis- ing. But the status of the Hesiodic cognâtes in this respect is not clear-cut. Some, as we saw, are simply too common to be usefully invested with any spécifie etymologising force on their own. θαλί,α («festivity») by contrast, can operate independently with 'Muse' to mark allusion to Thalia, έρατός («lovely») seems to occupy an intermediate position, and certainly requires careful assessment of possible etymologising when found by itself. Unsurprisingly, where poets wished to convey a Muse-name allusion with a single cognate, they tend to draw in rarer (and non-Hesiodic) terms, dos- er in sound /formation to the Muse name, for example εύτερπής («delightful») and (below, 8.) πολύυμνος («much hymned»). But where two or more Hesiodic cognâtes are found together, they may work like cross bearings and at least encourage considér- ation of etymologising, though they do not guarantee its présence. Examples include Aristophanes' κλείουσα ... θαλί,ας (Peace 777- 778) and Philodamus' όπί κλέουσοα; and where the combination of terms is strikingly rare or unique, as in thèse two cases, the like- lihood that etymological significance attaches to it is increased. To thèse grammatically integrated examples can be added Dioscorus' μέλπουσα, taken with the intertextual (but grammatically inde- pendent) προφερέστατον (above, 6.) Ail thèse instances are further marked by participial jingle (thus, Moumat μέλποιισα). Another sub-set illustrated extensively above is the collocation of an etymological cognate with a named Muse other than the one to whom thè cognate relates. We also occasionally find clusters of etymological cognâtes in contexts where thè word 'Muse(s)' does not appear at ail but where thè poet may nonetheless al- lude to individuai Muses through combinations of etymological cognâtes. A particularly interesting example is Oryhic Hymn 55, a 1 Cairns 1996, pp. 31-44.</page><page sequence="36">44 Alex Hardie kletikon summoning Aphrodite to an annual festival. It divides into two equal parts, the accumulation of attributes (1-14), and the summons proper, from the goddess' customary haunts (15-28). The first part includes four Muse-cognates (some Hesiodic, some not) which, taken together, appear both to écho the ordering of Muses in Hesiod's catalogue and to suggest Aphrodite's proximity in character and interests to Muses among her many other attib- utes: thus, ουρανιά («heavenly») and πολύυμνε («much-hymned» 1) match the co-location of Urania and Polyhymnia at Theogony 78; then τερπομένη &amp;αλίαισι («taking delight in festivities» 8) match- es the co-location of Euterpe and Thalia at Theogony 77, together with Melpomene, who is arguably echoed in the participle. These two pairs occupy roughly the same metrical sedes at thè start of the distinct first (cosmic) and second (sexual) quarters of the hymn, a distribution of cognâtes that seems most unlikely to be coinci- dental. In the second last line (27), the propitiatory hymnist asks the goddess to corne έπήρατον είδος έχουσα («possessing lovely form» 27), a formulale Hesiodic phrase.1 The ambient description of virgin choruses that annually «hymn» Cyprian Aphrodite (24- 26) echoes the «polyhymnal» opening (thus, ύμνοΰσιν [26] / πο- λύυμνε [ι]) and it links forward to the hymnist's concluding plea for the goddess' présence in response to his hymn. The passage has verbal similarities to Aphrodite's séduction of Anchises at H. H. 5, 82 and also, though this may be coincidental, to Apollonius' kletikon summoning Erato at Argonautica 3, 4-5. 2 This example highlights the importance for ancient poets of the ordering of the Hesiodic catalogue, and of the Muse-juxtaposi- tions within it. The same sensitivity was detected in Plato's pairing of Terpsichore and Erato and of Ourania and Calliope; and again, Philodamus' όπΐ κλέουσαι dépends for its effect on évocation of the first and last items in the catalogue. Aside from Orphie Hymn 55, 9, however, I hâve not found a certain example of allusion to triple collocation in the catalogue, although Bacchylides 13, 228- 230 (above, 5. 4.), with Κλειώ, πανθαλής and τερψιεπείς might be thought significant in relation to the first three Muses, Clio, Eu- terpe and Thalia. 1 Hes. fr. 25, 39; cf. 136, 2 M-W. 2 Thus {Arg. 10. H.), Κύπρι,δος (Arg. 3, 3)/Κύπρω (Ο. Η. 55» Μ)&gt; άδμήτας ... παρ- θενικάς (4-5) /παρθένοι άδμηται (25), έπήρατον ούνομ' (5) /έπήρατον είδος (27). Cf. Η. Η. 5, 82 (Aphrodite) παρθένψ άδμήης μέγεθος και είδος όμοίη. The concluding debt to the H. H. is not in doubt (the hymnist substitutes Adonis as current lover).</page><page sequence="37">Etymologising the Muse 45 Another well-established feature of Latin etymological marking is significant placement, where two words that are etymologically related are placed in such a way as to highlight thè connection be- tween them, for example in thè same sedes in consecutive Unes, or at thè beginning and end of a line or group of Unes. * A secure example is ApoUonius' Τερψιχόρη and μελπόμεναι (Arg. 4, 896; 98, in each case before thè caesura). The same principle can oper- ate within an etymologicaUy significant intertext, as for example in ApoUonius' έπήρατον (Arg. 3, 5), placed after thè caesura, as is its model at Theogony 67; similarly at Orphie Hymn 55, 27 above). A particularly exciting example involves strophic correspondence within a Pindaric epinician (Olympians 6): at thè end of thè ode (105-106) Pindar says εμών δ'υ/μνων άεξ'εύτερπές άνθος («make thè well-pleasing flower of my hymns grow»). The adjective looks back both to Μοισαν at thè end of thè final strophe (91), and to Μοίσαι at thè end of thè first epode (21), and thereby suggests Euterpe at thè ode's conclusion.2 Still grander in its overarching structural reach is Pindar's Muse-etymologising in thè sixth Paean, where thè first triad ends with etymologising on Erato (above, 6.) and thè third on ThaUa (above, 5. 1.); moreover each picks up a pair of etymological 'cross bearings' (see above) at thè end of thè first strophe, where thè chorus of Delphides perform song and dance (μελπόμενοα 17) at Apolline θαλί,αι (14). In a smaU number of cases, confirmation of thè présence of ety- mologising (and understanding of thè way it enriches thè text) dé- pends on récognition of a learned allusion external to thè text. Thus, ApoUonius' allusion to Melpomene at Arg. 4, 298 dépends on recol- lection of thè alternative version of the Sirens' parentage; a further example of learned allusion will be considered in the next section. 8. POLYHYMNIA Polyhymnia appears only once in extant Greek lyric (Lyr. adesp. 942 pmg), but is among the most populär Muses in named icono- graphical représentations (above, 1.). Hère then is something of a test case for her impUcit présence in Greek poetry, and for the true prominence of the Muse of 'many hymns' in the consciousness of Greek audiences. 1 Cairns 1996, p. 33. 2 For thèse correspondences, cf. Hutchinson 2001, p. 425.</page><page sequence="38">46 Alex Hardie In the sixth Nemean (32-33), Pindar claims that thè Bassaridai are «able to supply many a hymn to the ploughmen of the Pierians» (Πιερί,δων άρότοας / δυνατοί παρέχειν πολύν ύμνον); afterllie- ρίδων, πολύν ύμνον might suggest an etymologising allusion to Polyhymnia. The final line of much later poem, the Orphie Hymn to the Muses (76, 16) reads as follows: ευκλειαν ζήλόν τ' ερατον πολύυμνον άγουσοα («[come...] bringing good fame and lovely glory abounding in hymns»); set together in a hymn that names ali nine Muses, the epithets allude clearly enough to Erato and Poly- hymnia. Similarly, in the Orphie Hymn to Aphrodite (55, 1), the opening ουρανιά πολύυμνε introduces the goddess' assimilation to the Muses, through Ourania and Polyhymnia (above, 7.). πολύυμνον is not Hesiodic. * It appears as an attribute of Diony- sus at H. H. 26, 7 and again in Euripides' Ion (1075). 2 The Dionysiac connection is further evident from the god's descent to the under- world in search of Semele, under the guidance of 'Polyhymnos', evidently a reflection of an Orpheus-like katabasis of Dionysus 'Polyhymnos' and perhaps also of Orphie hymnal poetry at Eleu- sis itself.3 The 13-line Homeric hymn deploys the epithet at its ex- act centre, and indeed the hymn provides the aetion for Dionysus as a hymnic subject, in terms of his upbringing by nurse-nymphs who then provided his worshipping maenadic entourage.4 This can be connected with the présence among Dionysus' Dodonaean nurses of «Polyhymno», so that the passive divine attribute «much hymned» has its counterpart in the active «much-hymning» iemale attendant.5 Moreover as Arthur Cook saw long ago, there is a sig- nificant interface hère with the identification of Dionysus' mae- nadic nurses as Muses;6 and Cook was surely right to draw into 1 Ibycus' δή]ριν πολύυμνον (S151, 6 pmgf) is not treated here ; in my view, Ibycus' hymnal agenda (cf. ύμ]νήν i2), taken together with his évocation of, and allegiance to, the Heliconian Muses (24), and the 'Calliopean' epithet πρ[οφ]ρέστατος (32, of Achilles; cf. Diosc. fr. 3, 29 H., above, 6.) in strophic correspondence with πολύυμνον, is strongly encouraging for référence to Polyhymnia; but discussion of this complex poem would be disproportionately long and would not advance the overall argu- ment. 2 Cf. also Nonn.

We may compare Philodamus' assimilation of Muses to maenadic followers (above, 5. 2.).</page><page sequence="39">Etymologising thè Muse 47 considération Polyhymnia herself as mother both of the (Diony- siac) Orpheus and of Triptolemos, hence an association with the Eleusinian Mysteries and their grounding in the growth of crops. 1 If this is correct in essentials, then Dionysus 'Polyhymnos' as the subject of choric hymns sung by his entourage has female atten- dants (nurse-Muses) whose names speak of their «much-hymning» fiinction (that the hymnist himself is thinking of Polyhymnia at H. H. 26, 7 is however doubtful). Euripides (Ion 1074-1075) refers to the mystery Iacchos-Dionysus as τον πολύυμνον Φεόν («the much-hymned god»). The adjective, unique in extant tragedy, is elaborated by choral imagery, with référence to the god's Eleusinian entourage and to its dementai counterparts.2 It thus carries quasi-cultic force, as in the Homeric hymn. Additionally, it catches the hymnic thèmes that permeate the play3 It recalls the hymnic évocation of the Delphian Diony- sus and his entourage of Bacchai at 714-717, where (as at 1074-1076) the chorus of Athenian women prays that Ion will not come as a usurper to Athens. It can also be contrasted with Creousa's vitu- pération of Apollo as unfeeling rapist and father of Ion (881-922; below). Certainly, the positive treatment of the Delphian and Athe- nian Dionysus stands in pointed contrast to the disrespect shown to Apollo, and the contrast is presented in hymnic terms. τον πολύυμνον θεόν («the much-hymned god») opens the sec- ond strophe of the third stasimon. The second antistrophe opens (1090-1092) with an attack by the chorus of Athenian women on those who «advancing down the path of the muse [κατά μουσαν ίόντες], sing discordant hymns [δυσκελάδοι/σιν ... υμνοις] of our [se. womens] love affairs» (transi. Lee, modified). «Muse» and «hymns» (1091) are in strophic correspondence with τον πολύυμνον &amp;εόν ; and the processionai choric music of the Athenian myster- ies (strophe) contrasts with discordant processionai music attack- ing female sexual misconduet (antistrophe). The women propose their own processionai song-Muse attacking men (1095-1097): «let recoiling song and discordant muse advance against men» (μοΰσ' εις άνδρας ΐτω / δυσκέλαδος), and they proceed to vilify Xouthos for his forgetfulness (άμνημοσύναν) and infidelity. 1 Cook 1914-1940, vol. 11, p. 1022.

The mytho-cultic hinterland adumbrated earlier provides good grounds for such a personalised reading, and in that context, there is distinct encouragement in Eu- ripides' stress on worshipping (hymnic) choral entourages. Again, thè «Muse» is both metonymy ('song'; 'music'), identified with «hymns», and thè personified goddess, since άμνημοσύναν in prox- imity to Διός (1099) suggests Mnemosyne as Muse mother, here in positive correspondence with thè mystery mother /daughter fig- ures (1086-1087) of thè strophe. But thè overall case for seeing thè Muse Polyhymnia in πολύ- υμνον needs to embrace one further instance of interplay between 'Muses' and 'hymns'. Here is thè opening of Creousa's denuncia- tion of Apollo (881-884): ώ τας έπταφ&amp;όγγου μέλπων κιθάρας ενοπάν, άτ' άγραύλοις κεράεσσιν εν άψύχοις αχεί μουσαν ύμνους εύαχήτους, Ο you who make thè voice of thè seven-toned cithara sing, as it sounds melodious hymns [consisting] of muses on thè lifeless horns of country créatures... The interplay of lifeless instrument and Irving voice suggests that thè Muses are présent within thè divine sound of thè cithara, and that they are hymning Apollo himself (se. as Musagetes, «leader of thè Muses»). The god's instrumental play as an act of hymnal self-celebration is confronted with Creousa's vituperative reversai of thè hymn form; and thè point is rammed home in her accusa- tion that Apollo, untouched by thè (supposed) fate of their son, continues to «sound out on thè cithara, performing paeans» (905- 9θ6)τλαμον, συ Sé &lt;καί&gt; κιθάρα κλάζεις / παιάνας μέλπων.1 The echoing reprise of μέλπων and κιθάρας (88i and 884) connects παιάνας with μουσαν ύμνους. The Muses (μουσαν) of 884 thus once again combine metonomy («hymns consisting of [métonym- ie] muses /music») with personification («hymns of the goddess Muses [se. to Apollo Musagetes]»). Apollo, whose music/Muses hymn himself but who is thè target of Creousa's vitupération, is 1 There may be an écho of the founding text for Greek paeanic hymning of Apol- lo, at Ü. 1, 472-474 (the Greeks singing the paean and hymning Apollo).</page><page sequence="41">Etymologising thè Muse 49 then contrastée! in thè third stasimon with thè Athenians* beloved, and «much-hymned» Iacchos-Dionysus. 1 Within this extended interplay of 'Muses' and 'hymns', centrai to thè poetics of Ion, I would suggest that πολύυμνον carries personifying allusion to thè Hesiodic Muse, underpinned by learned allusion to thè cult hymns sung in honour of Dionysus by his worshipping entourages. At around thè same time, or perhaps a little later, Timotheus deployed thè same adjective in thè Persae (229-235): νυν δέ Τιμόθεος μέτροις ρυθμοίς τ' ένδεκακρουμάτοις κίθαριν έξανατέλλει, θησαυρον πολύυμνον οί- ξας Μουσαν θαλαμευτόν Μίλητος δε πόλις νιν ά $ρέψασ' And now, Timotheus causes thè cithara with eleven-stringed measures and rhythms to spring into life, opening the hidden treasure store of Muses, abounding in hymnoi; and Miletus reared him. . . Replying to Spartan charges that he 'dishonoured thè older Muse with his new hymns' (211-212) and as part of an appeal to Paian Apollo to assist his hymns «nurturing thè new-wrought Muse with golden cithara» (202-205), Timotheus places himself in the tradition first (221-224) of Orpheus, who is son of Calliope and «fathered» the chelys, and second (225-228) of Terpander, who is «born» of Antissa and «yoked» the Muse to the ten string lyre. As successor in each respect to both (229-233, cited above), Timotheus gives new life (cf. Orpheus) to the eleven string (cf. Terpander) lyre; he is «nurtured» by Miletus (cf. Terpander); and he «opens» a «hidden treasure store abounding in hymns (consisting) of the Muses». In addition to thè named Muse Calliope, the word «Muse(s)» thus appears three times in singular and once in plural, and it is used si- multaneously in the sensé of personified (goddess) and métonymie (music) Muse. Timotheus is personifying citharoedic music as the Muse /Muses; and at thè same time, he is aligning himself through verbal and conceptual responsions with each musical and bio- graphical élément of his Orphie /Terpandrian tradition.2 Against 1 For the choric/ astral symbolism, see Lee 1997, p. 277; Hardie 2004, pp. 23-24. 2 For responsions between Timotheus' personal sphragis and Orpheus /Terpander, including the important perception of personified citharody, see Hordern 2002, pp. 242-243, 245.</page><page sequence="42">50 Alex Hardie- this build up, within the key phrase (232-233) 9ησαυρον πολύυμνον οίξας Μουσαν Φαλαμευτόν, θησαυρον ... οίξας yields a physical image of opening and entering a treasure house (se. in a sacred space or temenos);1 Φαλαμευτόν («set within a chamber») shades «treasure house» into its precious, concealed, content, hère figura- tively identified with Timotheus' music; and Μουσαν yields both the personified «Muses» whose sacred space this is and métonymie «muse-songs».2 Within this complex amalgam of sacred building, figurative song-content, goddess and métonymie Muses, πολύ- υμνον caps the earlier références to 'hymns', brings them into the frame as the figurative treasure and helps negotiate the figurative équivalence of «treasure (house)» and «Muses». It is thus a natu- rai, indeed almost inévitable, step to take πολύυμνον additionally as alluding etymologically to Polyhymnia. This carries the further attraction of supplying an individuai 'Muse' corresponding to Or- pheus' Calliope who otherwise lacks a counterpart in Timotheus' carefully responsive Statements. It is tempting, moreover, to sup- pose that Timotheus was writing with Ion in view, not simply in the matter of technique and the deployment of métonymie and personified Muses, but also in his pious treatment of Paean Apollo, πολύυμνον contains a further programmatic point: its usuai sensé is 'much sung of; but that scarcely fits Timotheus' «open- ing» of what is self-evidently new treasure, and so we are to take it as descriptive of the content of the treasure, in what appears to be a new sensé «with many hymns». The new sensé, in contrast to the old, carries a further nuance of reaction against populär, and thus hackneyed, subjeet matter. Timotheus may hâve been familiär with a passage of Anacreon (446 pmg) who variously de- scribes a 'prostitute' asKavSoalav («all-giving»), λεωφόρον («public highway») and πολύυμνον («much-sung»); there are intriguing an- técédents hère for the well-known Callimachean imagery linking the promiscuous lover with hackneyed poetry (A. P. 12, 43); and 1 The cuit /temple allusion picks up the cuit exclusion of corruptors of the Muses articulated at 213 ss. (see Hordern 2002, ad loc, citing the closely analogous Hor. Odes 3, 1, 1-4) έγώ δ'ούτε νέον τιν'ού/τε γεραον ούτ' ίσήβαν/είργω τώνδ' έκας ύμνων/ τους δέ μουσοπαλοαολύ / μας, τούτους δ' άπερύκω, For opening of Muse-temple as an image of accessing new material, Hardie 2007, pp. 581-582. 2 For the simultaneous référence to the plural Muses (in genitive case) as the songs themselves and as the goddesses who inspire the songs, see Hardie 2002, p. 193, on Verg. Georg. 2, 475-476 Musae, quarum sacra fero, citing Theocr. là. 22, 221-223 (the μειλίγματα Μουσέων carried by the poet as his hymn-offering to thè Dioscuri).</page><page sequence="43">Etymologising thè Muse 51 similar implications of indiscriminate favour appear to underpin Plato's association of populär, πάνδημος έρως with Polyhymnia (distinguished from celestial έρως associated with Urania), in the Symposium (i87de). Timotheus, writing a little earlier, seems thus to be making daring use of an adjective/Muse associated with the indiscriminate and hackneyed to assert his own originality and in- novation within a defined tradition. 9. Interim Conclusions No attempt has been made to treat the subject historically (though for ease of référence, a chronologically arranged index of pas- sages discussed is given in the Appendix). The article does how- ever document the criticai rôle played by Hesiod's Theogony as the founding text for the named Muses and its immediate impact on the treatment of the individuai Muses in lyric poetry. On présent évidence, Alcman présents the most striking and creative early de- velopments, although that may do less than justice to Stesichorus. Certainly, it is no coïncidence that lyric material bulks largest in the index of passages, and that Pindar is by some distance the poet most often cited. Two fifth Century developments may be highlighted. First, Em- pedodes' creative deployment of Calliope within a hexameter poem as the personified/ métonymie embodiment of his «fine discourse» (above, 4.); and second, the appearance of Muse-ety- mologising in Euripidean lyric (alone among tragic poets) plus the contemporary interplay with Timotheus.1 Perhaps surprisingly, the text of Callimachus offers nothing of apparent relevance.2 By contrast, the Argonautica citations testify to Apollonius' keen inter- est in Muse names, in Hesiod's name-giving role and in the iden- tity of Homer's Muse. His associated wordplay and etymologising suggests that all this was the subject of lively interest within the Alexandrian Mouseion, where he had been Librarian.3 1 For Euripidei treatment of the Muse in Hypsipyle, see Battezzato 2005 (I owe this référence to the anonymous referee); I intend to deal elsewhere with etymologising allusion there. 2 Theocritus does contain relevant material, which I intend to deal with else- where. 3 Apollonius as head of the Mouseion library: Fraser 1972, pp. 330-332; Hunter 1989, pp. 3-4.

It is unlikely that ail the pas- sages offered above as possible examples of thè phenomenon under discussion will be equally persuasive, and with more refined meth- odology some may well fall away. Yet enough has perhaps been said to show that Muse-name etymologising represents a new and useful approach to thinking about the Muses in literature. If even a proportion of the examples put forward hère are accepted as valid, the pattern of allusion will help show how ail nine Muses, and not just the major names, are embedded within the texts of lyric and epic poets. We may thereby achieve a doser sensé of the Muses' présence within the poetry they inspired and embodied.
