<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ideology of Form in Verga's "La Lupa": Realism, Myth, and the Passion of Control Gregory L. Lucente Verga's "La Lupa" appeared as the second novella in Vita dei campi (1880), six years after the publication of Nedda, the "bozzetto siciliano" 'which had inaugurated verismo's Sicilian stil novo.' It is true that the novella's natural descriptions are generalized and very brief, betraying the "scissors" which drew D. H. Lawrence's objec- tions.2 Moreover, the language has been homogenized into the standard forms of the recently unified kingdom, purged of the local expressions of Nedda and even the few remaining sicilianisms of "Cavalleria rusticana" (the collection's opening narrative). Nonetheless, at its appearance "La Lupa" was regarded as so strik- ingly realistic to be utterly unlike its predecessors in nineteenth- century Italian fiction. Indeed, Luigi Capuana, Verga's Sicilian friend and verismo's most active polemicist, claimed to have had personal knowledge of the central character. And he later bes- towed upon this story, one of his favorites, the borrowed badge of French Naturalism's programmatic approval: "La Lupa si potrebbe dire un semplicefatto diverso.

And the utiliza- tion of unified mythic structures to shape the novella on both diegetic and discursive levels serves realism's ends as a method of reinforcing the ideological foundations of its discourse. In general, Verga's narrative furnishes especially useful examples of the dynamics of this combination thanks both to his technical mastery and his choice of subject matter. Nineteenth-century Sicily re- mained one of the places in Europe where in the minds of the populace as well as in the image presented to the outside world even the old myths seemed to retain a measure of their power. "La Lupa" is therefore an especially relevant text for realist aesthetics not despite but because of its depiction of meridionale passion and the extraordinarily basic nature of the oppositions which organize it. Moreover, as is true for all realistic presentation, the reader has access to the network of mythic elements only through their nec- essary combination with the structures of realism. Though the specifically Sicilian aspects of Verga's narration have been suppressed, or more accurately, translated into literary Ita- lian, all evidence of the justly renowned siculita has not been re- moved from the surface of the text. As in the narratives following "La Lupa," Verga's language has undergone only a partial trans- formation from regional caste to national class, retaining in literary discourse the remnants of generally meridionale popular and rural linguistic register on the level of lexicon ("gna Pina .... una lupac- chiotta... lingua a strasciconi," pp. 145-48) as well as grammar and syntax ("Cosa gli date a vostra figlia Maricchia? ... Andro dal brigadiere, andr6," pp. 146-47). This slight shift in emphasis is also evident in the proverbs embedded within the narration, which ap- pear as normalized versions of locally characteristic figures of thought.4 with Capuana. For an account of these conversations and their effects on Verga's writing, see Corrado Di Blasi, Luigi Capuana originale e segreto (Catania: Giannotta, 1968), pp. 73-75. 4The complexity of this operation does not always lead to happy results. Russo, for one, is less than pleased with Verga's "academic" translation of the central proverb ("In quell'ora . . ."). See Giovanni Verga, Universale Laterza, 47 (1919-20; rpt. Roma-Bari: Laterza, 1976), p. 108. Though it is difficult to determine exactly what Russo finds disturbing about the proverb, it may be the irony of its repetition as much as its form.</page><page sequence="3">106 GREGORY L. LUCENTE The partial nature of this transformation is important. Even though the forms are standardized, the knowledge which the proverbs express is presented as especially Sicilian, a fact indicated both by the methods of temporal reference ("fra vespero e nona," pp. 146-47) and the tacit belief in the supernatural ("il diavolo quando invecchia .. ." p. 146). In this way, Verga manages to broaden the area of his subject matter without losing the aura of authenticity in terms of specific populace as well as moral precept. In Verga's text, both regional and class elements are thus presented as contributing factors in narrative representation. But neither class nor region is finally determinant, since human destiny is seen as universal and prior to all categories of individual existence and action, including, as we shall see, literary narration itself. Whereas physical and material details are not lacking in the story, there is only a trace of the photographic accuracy that linked verismo to other European realist programs like Zola's Naturalism and late nineteenth-century schools of European painting. Moreover, when particular mimetic details do appear, they are unfailingly turned back into the symbolic framework of the story. In this way, the notation of the "seno fermo e vigoroso da bruna" functions initially as a marker of class and sexuality rather than as primarily personal individuation, and the realistic redness of the "labbra fresche e rosse" leads to the openly symbolic "papaveri rossi" -once again accompanied by the eyes "che vi mangiavano"-of the narrative's conclusion. In similar fashion, as Giovanni Sinicropi has shown, the striking depictions of the natural environment, the burning stones and stubble of the immense fields stretching toward Etna, serve to extend and reinforce the correla- tive passion constantly aflame within la Lupa, "sotto al fustagno del corpetto."5 The frame of temporal reference within the narrative is deter- mined more by social and religious customs (Natale, Pasqua) and by the passage of the seasons than by hours and days. The story first creates a generalized aura of perpetuity, punctuated only by brief encounters, and then suddenly narrows the dramatic focus of spa- tial and temporal orientation in the final scene.6 Although the reck- 5"La natura nelle opere di Giovanni Verga," Italica, 37, No. 2 (June, 1960), 89-108 (especially pp. 89-90). 6 See Fredi Chiappelli, "Una lettura verghiana: 'La Lupa,'" Giornale storico delta letteratura italiana (Torino), 139, Fasc. 427 (1962), 370-83. Alberto Asor Rosa claims-and I agree in part-that the story's descriptive effects created an aura of vagueness and thereby protected the sensibilities of the nineteenth-century bourgeois public, which enjoyed titillation but only within certain bounds.

In this way, individual acts, no matter how strong, are reintegrated into the established pattern of rhythmic recurrence, portrayed now as authentically cultural as well as conventionally literary. Far from abrogating this pattern, action itself only reaffirms the predeter- mined logic of Verga's carefully constructed wheel of destiny. Of particular interest is the narrative's apparent suppression of direct historical reference. There are occasional indications of the political and economic institutions of post-Risorgimento Sicily: the continuation of the feudal system of ownership and production, now in the hands of the bourgeoisie ("e mieteva il fieno con lei nelle chiuse del notaro," p. 145); the militarization of the state with the consequent increase in travel and social experience ("un bel giovane che era tornato da soldato"); the increasingly complex legal apparatus, officially extended to cover women and peasants ("-No!-rispose invece la Lupa al brigadiere-Jo mi son riserbato un cantuccio della cucina per dormirvi, quando gli ho dato la mia casa in dote. La casa e mia," p. 148); and the continuing importance of the Church. However, these references find their way into the text only indirectly. Whenever indications of historical institutions do occur, they are immediately subsumed within the functions of localized social and cultural verisimilitude, so that they appear to originate and remain as individual and local phenomena instead of indices of national or even regional (provincial) developments. Al- though Verga's language is recast in nationally conventionalized forms, his depiction of political and economic phenomena in "La Lupa" remains either universally human (in the affective responses of the characters) or strictly localized (in the individual reactions to village institutions). And the resultant suppression of class and na- tion in favor of either individual or universal moral analyses marks not only "La Lupa" but also the rest of the 1880 edition of Vita dei campi. primo e l'ultimo uomo del mondo.

I My conception of the ideological emphasis as falling on individual and universal phenomena at the expense of the factors of class and nation is somewhat broader</page><page sequence="5">108 GREGORY L. LUCENTE Rather than making the extremely limited world of the story appear deficient, this meticulous suppression of external reference give the village itself an integrity that it would not easily retain if put in direct comparison with the outside world. Nanni's return from the military may thus be seen as significant not in reference to the official militarization of Italian society but as an indication of his own virility and social freedom. This explains in part the ab- sence of any notation of Nanni's family even in the midst of a culture organized around the stability of the "focolare." As a young demilitarized soldier, Nanni enjoys perhaps the greatest breadth of sanctioned choice in popular Sicilian society, at least during the transitional period of his unmarried manhood; whereas Maricchia, as a maiden, is utterly bound by the will of her mother and the legal inheritance from her father. As an aspect of cultural verisimilitude, la Lupa's use of the law in connection with the dowry and the house demonstrates not only her singular will and "sagacia contadinesca" but also the great dis- tance between herself and the social norms that organize the vil- lage.8 As opposed to Nanni, she utilizes the law and the "true" servant of God as an outsider, driven away from the sustaining sympathy of social life by the anathema on her activities as a sexu- ally aggressive widow spurred by an all-consuming passion. De- scribed repeatedly as "diavolo," "spiritata," "satanasso," enchan- tress, vampire, and succubus, she nonetheless does not fulfill even the socially acceptable role of strega, since she has no clients, only victims (herself included). Indeed, as Maricchia becomes fully socialized into the adult life of the community ("coi figli in collo"), even she turns on her mother in the exact moral and religious terms of the rest of the community:"-Scellerata.... Mamma scel- lerata! ... Ladra!" (Latin s/celestus, barred from the heavens). Here as elsewhere, the indirect reference to religious and social institu- tions serves less as concise analysis than as a convenient means of thematizing the pervasive powers of patriarchy and Catholicism than that of Romano Luperini (to whose analysis of Vita dei campi and I Malavoglia I am indebted), who claims "Verga non vede mai l'interesse di classe ma sempre quello dei singoli individui." See "La natura, la societa, l'esclusione nel mondo di Vita dei campi e dei Malavoglia" in L'orgoglio e la disperata rassegnazione: natura e societa, maschera e realta nell'ultimo Verga, La nuova sinistra, Saggistica, 61 (Roma: Savelli, 1974), p. 68.

The narrator of the story establishes positions both inside and outside the parameters of village knowledge, shaping the localized perception of characters and events while not appearing to evaluate or judge those perceptions except through the selection and organization of his own discourse. Verismo's program of "dis- passionate" impersonality, similar to that of Zola and even Flaubert, tended to distance the narrator from the events he de- scribes at the same time as it permitted his authentic, seemingly objective knowledge of the characters and milieu.9 Although much of the narration is introduced as originating in village sources ("Al villaggio la chiamavano La Lupa"; "la gente andava dicendo. . ."), each of the two major sections begins with statements of "fact" independent of privileged village knowledge ("era alta, magra"; "La Lupa era quasi malata"). And though Verga often uses sensory notation to establish the internal perspective of presentation ("Nanni spalanco gli occhi imbambolati"; "La Lupa lo vide venire"), this is by no means always the case. Moreover, the constant use of dialogue serves again and again to break up the easily attributable origins of presentation. Through the appearance of objectivity combined with the inti- mate knowledge of event and social custom, the narrator of "La Lupa" manages to focus the essentially contradictory perspectives of the story without becoming openly subservient either to la Lupa's driving passion, Nanni's repeated expressions of ambivalence, or patriarchal Catholicism's sustained condemnation. Though the characters are passionate and the events violent, as elsewhere in Verga's italianized depiction of Sicilians' self-perceptions, the nar- rator himself appears removed throughout. He eschews even the technical closeness of the full style indirect libre, which would clearly be available and is so much in evidence from the opening para- graphs of "Cavalleria rusticana" ("Dapprima Turiddu come lo seppe, santo diavolone! voleva trargli fuori le budella dalla pancia, voleva trargli, a quel di Licodia! pero non ne fece nulla . . .").10 But this is not to say that the narrative is in fact flatly objective, 9 See the preface to I Malavoglia (1881) in Opere, pp. 177-79, and the dedicatory epistle to Salvatore Farina in "L'amante di Gramigna" (first published as "L'amante di Raya"), in Tutte le novelle, I, 199-201. 10 Tutte le novelle, I, 139.

This mitigation of objectivity is demon- strated in the selection and organization of the language itself, and especially in the proper nouns. The function of naming in Verga's narrative is perhaps more complex than it may first appear. Of course, la Lupa receives her name because of her devouring pas- sion, which forces her to wander "con quell'andare randagio e so- spettoso" like a hungry wolf, "la sola anima viva che si vedesse errare per la campagna." That her passion is a force which has totally possessed her and over which she, as gnat Pina, has no control, is indicated by Verga himself in a letter to his Swiss translator 1douard Rod, in which she is described as subject to a "passione cieca, carnale, brutale anche se volete, ma quasi fatale."11 Whereas Verga habitually associates passion with the process of creation and creation with life itself (in the introduction to "L'amante di Gramigna" and elsewhere), in "La Lupa" it is seen as a blindly destructive force, past all hope of control and leading to death ("quasi fatale"). Just as it has consumed la Lupa, so she must con- tinually devour others for its momentary appeasement. Moreover, once this chain of events has been set in motion, there is no ap- parent escape except through subjugation of the force itself, through repeated and violent contest with the destroying power. As Vittorio Spinazzola has remarked, la Lupa thus represents the greatest conceivable threat to the patriarchal community, "la di- voratrice di uomini." 12 Both the blood-red lips and the continual reference to the eyes "che vi mangiavano" support such a denomi- nation. This connects her immediately to superstitions of posses- sion (lycanthropy, vampirism), as her dual naming would also in- dicate: "ella si spolpava i loro figliuoli e i loro mariti in un batter d'occhio, con le sue labbra rosse." And it shows her affinity to the femmesfatales of the nineteenth-century feuilletons and their gothic predecessors as well as to a host of Mediterranean and European figures (Lilith, the Sirens, Theocritus' Sicilian Sorceress, La Belle Dame sans Merci). But why, with all this painstaking thematic de- velopment, should Verga risk choosing a name that carries conno- tations which, far from strictly negative, are at the least profoundly ambiguous in Italian tradition? Of course, it is no explanation to say that the narrator exculpates himself in the choice of such an obviously symbolic name by using a " Lettera CXXXIX, Catania, Jan. 29, 1908, in Lettere al suo traduttore, ed. Fredi Chiappelli (Firenze: Le Monnier, 1954), p. 245. 12 Spinazzola, pp. 84 ff.</page><page sequence="8">M L N i favorite strategy of the realist text, denying complicity in the matter by attributing the function of naming to the authoritatively hypos- tatized communal voice: "Al villaggio la chiamavano la Lupa ...." Nonetheless, the ascription to a communal origin is of particular interest. Indeed, the positive Italian connotations of la Lupa, from Roman to Sienese, are all connected with the founding and nurture of the patriarchal community. A solution to the dilemma presented by these interfering meanings may perhaps be found in the won- derfully mythologized pages of Livy's History. Livy describes the typically heroic two-fold salvation of Romulus and Remus, first by the she-wolf who gave them suck and cleansed them with her tongue, and then by Faustulus, the king's herdsman who took the twins to his wife Larentia to care for in his hut. But then Livy is unable to restrain himself from offering a more logical variant of the story, reporting that some thought the origin of the fable was the circumstance that Larentia was a common prostitute and was called "wolf' by the shepherds: "Sunt qui Larentiam volgato cor- pore lupam inter pastores vocatam putent; inde locum fabulae ac miraculo datum."13 As in the thematic development within Verga's novella, the op- positions underlying Livy's account are clear. The natural hunger of the she-wolf to achieve self-gratification while subordinating external stimulus to her own needs represents a positive benefit as long as it is controlled and organized, in its second stage, by the sustaining values of patriarchal society. This is accomplished not through the annihilation of animality but through the transforma- tion of its energy in service to the patriarchal order. Verga dis- sociates his "heroine" from the potentially positive connotations of her epithet by turning her repeatedly against that order, in a ma- neuver similar to Livy's second, ideologically rationalized reading of the foundation legend. The positive attributes of the she-wolf do occur in Verga's narrative, but they are not clustered around gnat Pina. Instead, they accrue to Maricchia, though only after she has accepted Nanni as a husband and begun to produce and protect potentially patriarchal offspring: "Maricchia piangeva notte e giorno, e alla madre le piantava in faccia gli occhi ardenti di lagrime e di gelosia, come una lupacchiotta anch'essa," p. 147). And just as in Livy's first version, the stabilizing power of the she-wolf is em- phasized by direct transformation of her powers in obeisance to '3Ab Urbe Condita. Vol. I (Books I-IV), ed. R. S. Conway and C. F. Walters, cor- rected ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), I, 4, 7.</page><page sequence="9">112 GREGORY L. LUCENTE patriarchy, with Livy's notation of the motherly tongue- neutralizing the otherwise destructive teeth-and Verga's playful combination of suffixes ("lupacchiotta"). The ideological systems basic to Livy's and Verga's narratives should be apparent, when irrational, female passion is seen as leading to the death of society unless taken over and channeled by rationally ordered, male-dominant institutions (male royalty in Livy: the Church, laws, and town in Verga). Again the dispute over the ownership of the house is of primary significance, since la Lupa uses the law not to sustain but to thwart the values of patriarchy. Yet it is clear that this is only a holding action. La Lupa has in fact sown the seed of her own destruction by submitting to Nanni's initial demand and sacrificing her daughter to the socializing in- stitutions of the established community ("l'amava anche lei quel marito che le avevano dato per forza"). Over the long term, Maricchia's socialization represents, in a very special way, la Lupa's defeat. But as we shall see, it does not and in fact cannot represent la Lupa's destruction. It is important, then, that legal institutions in and of themselves are by no means ade- quate to win this battle. Beyond the utilization of social forms and community support, "volonta" will also be required, as Nanni eventually discovers and as the others in the village ("tutti i vicini e i curiosi") appear to have known all along. Moreover, in both Livy and Verga, the supposed repository for this knowledge lies pre- cisely in the time-honored sayings of popular (though again, ideologically male-dominant) discourse: "called 'wolf' by the shepherds"; "Al villaggio la chiamavano la Lupa." Traces of popular discourse are also apparent in the expressive effects of oral narration ("due occhi grandi cosi"; "Una volta la Lupa"), in the "ritmo binario" of the descriptive passages, in the structural trebling evident throughout the narrative, and in the proverbs!4 Of the two proverbs that serve major functions in the text, the elements of the principal one are repeated three times: "In quell'ora fra vespero e nona, in cui non ne va in volta femmina '4 That such rhythms extend throughout the entire text is demonstrated by Chiappelli, p. 372. For a discussion of the structural effects of repetition-entailing significant difference as well as similarity-see Wido Hempel, Giovanni Vergas Roman "I Malavoglia" und die Wiederholung als erzihlerisches Kunstmittel, Studi Italiani, 4 (Koln: Graz Bohlau, 1959), pp. 25-33. Verga's writing continued to demonstrate the effects of popular models. One of the clearest examples of this occurs in "La roba" (Novelle rusticane, 1883), in which the introductory paragraph is framed by the familiar, thrice-repeated motif of "Puss in Boots" (Basile's "Gagliuso"): "-Qui di chi e? . . .-Di Mazzar6."</page><page sequence="10">M L N 113 buona... .-No! non ne va in volta femmina buona nell'ora fra vespero e nona!-singhiozzava Nanni... .Quando tardava a venire anzi, nell'ora fra vespero e nona, egli andava ad aspettarla. The proverb itself repeats and organizes the thematic elements already present in the characteristics of naming: the hunger per- petually driving la Lupa to wander "in volta" at all hours, in the traditional imagery of lust (cf. Inferno, V); the separation from ecclesiastical and social mores, "nell'ora fra vespero e nona," when women should be tending to their duties in the home away from the overwhelming power of the burning sun; and the major an- tagonism underlying the binary structure of the proverb, secure patriarchal Catholicism in opposition to straying woman.'5 Once again, within the proverb and the entire narrative, only women are presented as irredeemably errant, and only certain pejoratively de- nominated women at that ("femmina"). The earlier proverb embedded in the narrative ("il diavolo quando invecchia si fa eremita") also carries the distinctive linguis- tic turn of localized custom while organizing themes that extend beyond the limits of contemporary village life. In this way, it, too, serves to sanctify the prevailing moral and religious ideology with the authenticity of timelessness. Besides the continued emphasis on the dangers represented by the solitary, non-socialized and non- productive recluse, this proverb also embodies a second notation which gains particular significance in the symbolic organization of the story, that of age. It is important that la Lupa is so vexing to the village, and especially to "le donne," precisely because she is long past the stage of effective socialization. She thereby represents a unique threat for the elaborate yet precarious structure of social constraints to which the other women have, at least in appearance, submitted themselves. The proverbs thus combine with the other effects of popular discourse to lend the narration an aura that is at once popular and universal, established in time and place yet transcending the very boundaries which help create its authenticity. Moreover, once the knowledge implicit in the proverbs has been depicted as emanating from legitimate communal sources, the narrator then repeats this 15 Russo explains the apparent inconsistency in the time scheme as stemming from the traditional calculation of the hours in rural Sicily: "e qui pero bisogna intendere le ore bruciate, che sono dominate dagli spiriti maligni," in his edition of Verga's Opere, La Letteratura Italiana, storia e testi (Milano: Ricciardi, 1968), p. 126 n. 1. Although wolves wander at night, la Lupa appears perpetually in motion.</page><page sequence="11">114 GREGORY L. LUCENTE knowledge in connection with la Lupa as though it were a timeless and necessary given rather than an attribute deriving from her previous activity: "la gente andava dicendo che il diavolo quando invecchia si fa eremita," p. 146; "E meglio sarebbe stato per lui che fosse morto in quel giorno, prima che il diavolo tornasse a tentarlo e a ficcarglisi nell'anima e nel corpo . . ." p. 148. This assumption of the predetermined givens of the individual personality is, of course, a part of the nineteenth-century Darwinism which also in- fluenced Zola and the Parisian Naturalists. However, it is important to note that even though Verga was subject to a profoundly stoical pessimism, he was not so fully deterministic as this depiction might imply, since the transmittable phenomena are always seen to be matters of essence but not of form, as the distinguishing force of the lupacchiotta's inherited will clearly indicates. Moreover, the repeated progression of belief from popular attribution to unquestioned essence-or from identification to identity-is not the only move- ment which the proverbs of the text undergo. The central proverb is formally stressed through italicization and repetition. Though this progression reproduces and sustains com- munal knowledge, it does so in a very strange way, affirming the idealized unity of belief in relation to la Lupa and creating the distance of pointed evaluation in regard to her imperfectly socialized victim.16 In this way, Nanni's very freedom works against him, since the special separation from village restraints which makes him desirable also renders him vulnerable to la Lupa's temptations. The proverb is presented initially (italicized) as cul- tural knowledge. It is then repeated by Nanni himself as an indica- tion of his inability to contend with the very force which he, too, has at last come to recognize ("-No! non ne va in volta femmina buona. . .-singhiozzava Nanni"). By the third time, the elements of the proverb are thoroughly melded to the narrative, originating no longer in village or character perspectives but in the supposedly objective and otherwise unidentified narrator: "Quando tardava a venire anzi, nell'orafra vespero e nona, egli andava ad aspettarla." This progressive repetition, leading from implicit warning to open thralldom, is accompanied by another set of recurrent phrases. These derive from Nanni himself and indicate not resolu- tion but helplessness: "Andatevene! andatevene! non ci venite piu 16 Cecchetti sees this proverb, in its repetition, as a developing symbol of both la Lupa's power and Nanni's failure. See "IT 'carro' e il 'mare amaro,"' in II Verga Maggiore. Sette studi, Collana critica, 83 (Firenze: La Nuova Italia, 1968), pp. 95-96.</page><page sequence="12">M L N 115 nell'aia! ....Andatevene! andatevene! Non ci tornate piu' nell'aia!" Again the subjective presence of the narrator is indicated only by the ironic juxtaposition of discursive and diegetic elements and the apparently innocent but in fact condemnatory notation, "e le ripeteva ogni volta." The terrific power of la Lupa is reaffirmed by Maricchia's protests in the subsequent paragraph, these, too, uselessly repeated "ogni volta." Moreover, the entire movement is set against the recurrent mockery of Nanni's early-and now so obviously misplaced-self-confidence: "-O che avete, gnat Pina? .-Che volete, gnt Pina?" As a returned soldier, a man of the world, he had thought to be able to accomplish what no one else would or could have. He intended to make a simple gain out of la Lupa's daughter, a gain which a regular girl, and her attached re- sponsibilities, would not have afforded. But even Nanni's early victory appears short-lived. In fact, he secures the two things which will work against him in his battle with la Lupa by binding him to her, the dowry and the marriage to Maricchia: "Ed io invece voglio vostra figlia, che e zitella." It should be clear, then, that the continued repetition of prover- bial elements and popular naming merely affirm and extend the text's symbolically unified presentation of la Lupa. At the same time, the emphasis on these elements, in relation to Nanni's mis- taken perception of his own situation, gives rise not to the unity of unquestioned belief but to the disjunction of irony. During the middle portion of the story, the contrasts between Nanni's percep- tions and the narrative's descriptions, as well as between Nanni's acts and his own words, indicate a basic incongruity between the character's cognitive and pragmatic functions. In regard to Nanni, the formal repetition of the proverbial material proceeds away from identity into the irony of difference. This difference, which is perceived by the reader only across the advancing barrier of what Levi-Strauss terms irreversible narrative temporality, creates an essential and increasing disjunction in the category of belief. Each time the central proverb is presented, the narrative moves further from the assumptions implicit in Nanni's initial perceptions and thus reconfirms the reader's knowledge of la Lupa by establishing an informed skepticism in regard to her victim. Finally, it should be noted that even the apparent movement from identification to identity with respect to la Lupa carries, for Nanni, the detachment of progressive difference, since the clause used to reaffirm the seemingly objective knowledge within the earlier proverb ("prima che il diavolo tornasse a tentarlo") is based not only on the proverb</page><page sequence="13">116 GREGORY L. LUCENTE but also on elements of Nanni's own mechanically ineffectual pro- testations ("Non ci tornate piu nell'aia! ... e la tentazione dell'in- ferno!"). And these same elements are again present as prelude to the final scene: "e poi, come la Lupa tornava a tentarlo...." These progressive interactions of the characters, in the narrative "phrases" of diegetic structure, thus create fundamental textual attitudes through repetitions of identity and contrast. These atti- tudes are signaled on the superficial level of shifting narrative tones, or verbal attitudes,both by the regular recurrence of popular epithets (coupled with occasional expressions of guarded admira- tion for la Lupa: "Proprio come un uomo"; "trecce superbe") and by the subtle barbs turned against her victims ("un vero servo di Dio"; "-Andatevene! Andatevene! non ci venite piui nell'aia! Ella se ne andava infatti . . ."). Such notations give rise to the spontane- ous effects of verbal irony even as they signal an underlying struc- ture which is complex but not disunified, and to which they ulti- mately bear a relationship not of disjunction but of developing unity. It is around this seemingly infinite play of discursive and diegetic elements that the narrator constructs the coded system of attitudes making up the supposedly objective, impersonal narra- tion. And the exact understanding of this play will prove especially important in reading the story's concluding lines. In terms of both the ideological underpinnings and the plotting of the novella, the effect of this unity of discursive and diegetic elements is to give the appearance of necessity, of destiny. The seemingly inevitable completion of la Lupa's designs is signaled not only by her naming and introductory description but also by the apparent innocence of her initial interaction with Nanni, presented as randomly realistic composition of place but including significant proleptic details ("una volta la Lupa si innamoro di un bel giovane che era tornato da soldato, e mieteva ilfieno con lei nelle chiuse del notaro"). Nanni's subsequent seduction, followed by his and Maricchia's inability to escape la Lupa even under the protection of the civil law, again reinforces the narrative's original perceptions of la Lupa's powers. This is especially true during the scene in front of the "brigadiere." Both the careful organization of la Lupa's re- sponse and the seemingly coincidental nature of her claim (Nanni had asked to be sent off himself, not to have her sent away) indicate the same preconceived series of events that Nanni has seen too late and still cannot escape, and which has now become the irony of his own destiny. In part he creates this irony himself, in his attempts to</page><page sequence="14">M L N 117 resist his share of destiny, just as la Lupa avoids direct irony by actively accepting hers. However, it is important that destiny effec- tively entangles them both, since she too is caught in the net of passion which holds Nanni. As is generally true in nineteenth- century realism, ironic structures thus cluster around certain characters at the expense of others, but the dominance of ironic recuperation is reserved for only one position within the text, that of the narrator himself (which is to say, the author implied within the dual narrative functions of diegetic and discursive organiza- tion). The irony in Verga's text permits the narrator to know this de- stiny and even to continue his narration under its sentence, but not to escape it. Finally, he, too, is implicated along with the objects of narration in the labyrinthian logic of desire. But if this is the case, how can we, as readers involved in the logic of the realist text, hope to gain enough detachment to see that the irony governing Nanni's presentation is due not so much to his helplessness against external forces as to the continual misapprehension of his own progressively internalized desire? How can we see that the powers which the moral ideology of the patriarchal community characterizes as ex- ternal are in fact internal phenomena, corrupting the social values underlying the perceptions not only of Nanni and the village but also of the narrator's realist discourse. Indeed, it is only through a resistance to these uncontrolled powers that the moral code of the village is constructed. And this same process of construction holds for the reader, who find himself inscribed from the very beginning within the communal discourse of patriarchy not as impartial ob- server but as victim: "due occhi grandi cosi, e delle labbra fresche e rosse, che vi mangiavano." II The most efficient solution to this predicament of evaluation is provided by the text itself, in the elaborate and patently symbolic structures which combine with the elements of realism to form its discourse. Like other texts of classical realism, Verga's novella utilizes mythic structures to organize the seemingly contingent as- pects of the narrative. The coherence of naming, the simple syn- tactic organization which lends the text the appearance of adopting the logic of its characters while depicting their world from their own perspective, and the air of primordial superstition hanging</page><page sequence="15">118 GREGORY L. LUCENTE over the entire text all contribute to the realistic portrayal of life in nineteenth-century rural Sicily. But at the same time they point to the primary, prediscursive oppositions which give rise to the nar- rative and which govern all of its aesthetic structures, mythic and realistic alike. This is true both for the individual characters and for the special type of desire which drives them. As is often the case in Verga's most dramatic fiction, the psychological development of the characters in "La Lupa" remains elementary. Moreover, it is provided for the reader as much by external description and concise, illustrative action as by internal analysis. Even the interior phenomena of specifically named emo- tions are always correlated with externally verifiable sensual effects ("quello che si dice innamorarsi" = "sentirsene ardere le carni sotto al fustagno del corpetto, e provare ... la sete che si ha nelle ore calde di giugno .. ."). As in Condillac's fable of the sensitive statue, two codes are established and correlated in Verga's texts through a series of interrelations. One of these is for the faculties of sensual perception, the other for those of intellectual, or in Verga's major texts preeminently affective, response. The potentially complex psychological developments of affect and intellect thus retain the uniformly coded comprehensibility of typically delimited external results. In this manner the sensual perception of concrete particu- lars may seem to dominate in Verga's narrative. However, such a conclusion is too facile. Far from subordinating the combined powers of affect and intellect to that of the senses, this maneuver increases the force of all three through the economy of active metaphorical union. Indeed, the text provides the first full depic- tion of la Lupa's motivations not through internal analysis but in the indirect reflection of the habitual behavior and "choral" discourse of the village, presented in the temporally expansive manner which Genette terms the iterative:17 Al villaggio la chiamavano la Lupa perch6 non era sazia giammai-di nulla. Le donne si facevano la croce quando la vedevano passare, sola come una cagnaccia, con quell'andare randagio e sospettoso delta lupa af- famata; ella si spolpava i loro figliuoli e i loro mariti in un batter d'occhio, con le sue labbra rosse, e se 1i tirava dietro alle gonnelle solamente a guardarli con quegli occhi da satanasso, fossero stati davanti all'altare di Santa Agrippina. La Lupa's seemingly transcendent power is demonstrated by the defensive reflexivity of the women she passes ("si facevano la 17 Gerard Genette, Figures III, Collection "Poetique" (Paris: Seuil, 1972), pp. 14749 et passim.</page><page sequence="16">M L N 119 croce") and, more significantly, by their shared fears for their hus- bands and male children ("si spolpava i loro figliuoli e i loro mariti in un batter d'occhio"). Furthermore, once the symbolic order of cultural expectations has been established, a tone of knowledgeably subdued irony may be created by playing within that order's bounds ("fossero stati davanti all'altare di Santa Agrippina"). But exactly what does it mean to be la Lupa, to never attain satisfaction no matter how great or how frequent the attempts ("non era sazia giammai-di nulla")? And why is it that all the normal institutions of social control-marriage, the Church, the concerted actions of the villagers themselves-prove inadequate to contain this force which has appeared among them as the unnatural union of ani- mality and humanity, wolf and woman? And finally, why should la Lupa's passion always seem to arise from a lack which is neither derivative nor dependent but timeless and absolute ("giammai ... nulla")? To be in a position to answer these questions we must first con- front two others, which in terms of the narrative precede them and which we have already begun to approach: what is lycanthropy in Verga's text, and what is passion? The lyk I anthropos is an ancient superstition, doubtless arising both from the material cir- cumstances of primitive man's encounters with his especially skilled competitors and from fear's subsequently ritualized reverence. As we have seen, rather than putting the village's perceptions in ques- tion, Verga's text takes them over for its own with only the subtle reservation of irony. This procedure is evidenced by the develop- ment of the narrative's proverbs, the progression of la Lupa's re- lationship with Nanni, and the setting of her first verbal expression of desire ("Una sera ella glielo disse . . ."). The darkness of "la vasta campagna nera," the sounds of the dogs that "uggiolavano," and the separation of Nanni from the group of men sleeping "nell'aia" all indicate the contest between the male-dominated band and the external, man-eating threat. In the transitional time of evening, la Lupa wants one thing "-Te voglio! Te che sei bello come il sole, e dolce come il miele. Voglio te!" The central phrase is the transla- tion of a common Sicilian saying, "beddu comu lu suli." But occur- ring within la Lupa's own discourse it serves as a privileged textual reaffirmation of her symbolic function in the narrative. Driven by the demands of sexual appetite to consume everything that is not her, she seeks out all that is foreign-provided she can locate an accessible point of internal similarity such as the symbolic honey of concupiscence. As a creature of night and darkness ("aveva soltanto</page><page sequence="17">120 GREGORY L. LUCENTE un seno fermo e vigoroso da bruna ... era pallida"), she takes as her object the most vulnerable and literally the most brilliant prey, whose very enticement ("dolce come il miele") derives both from its role of wild sustenance and from its intimate relationship with the golden sun.18 Moreover, she seeks not just to attain but to conquer and repeatedly devour this solar brilliance, under whose counte- nance she alone may wander without fear, in "quell'ora fra vespero e nona." As noted earlier, lycanthropy is a superstition of possession. Whether gnat Pina had ever been a participant in communal village life, as her propagation of offspring would appear to indicate, is a problem posed but not openly resolved within the text ("Maricchia ... [aveva] la sua bella roba nel cassettone, e la sua buona terra al sole, come ogni altra ragazza del villaggio"). However, by the im- mediate period of the narrative, it is clear that the power which has possessed gnat Pina will brook no counter, even to the point of savaging her own daughter ("Se non lo pigli, ti ammazzo!"). La Lupa's willful renunciation of the ties of blood between mother and child finds its complement in her violation of the social and moral order (canon law) with Nanni, whom even the supposedly objective text twice insists on calling "suo genero." On the level of character as well as social organization, this transgression of the incest taboo resides at the very core of the narrative. Although la Lupa desired Nanni prior to the marriage, she does not have him until after- wards. Moreover, her only loss of vitality during the narrative is determined not exclusively by her overactivity, as might be as- sumed from the fears of "le donne," but also by her frustration at the inability to express the passion of this specifically barred desire (though not to satisfy it fully, since that would be impossible): "La Lupa era quasi malata...." By describing la Lupa's sickness in the proverbial terms of the 18 The Sicilian phrase, as well as the connection between the images of sun and honey, is discussed by Gino Raya in La lingua del Verga, Biblioteca del saggiatore, 16 (Firenze: Le Monnier, 1962), pp. 32-33.

As in the scene of la Lupa's early declaration of desire, the entire middle portion of the narra- tive organizes this simple opposition of nature and culture, with la Lupa and Nanni serving as transitional figures and the "aia," situated between the village and the burned stubble of the open countryside, serving as the transitional place, the "sanctified" spot for what is to become the profaned rite of sexual encounter. Al- though the eventual dispute over the house indicates the progres- sive weight that the narrative places on the village's socialization of Nanni (like the second confrontation in Grimm's version of "Little Red-cap"), the outcome of the contest is by no means clear until, or more precisely through, the concluding scene. The motion indicated by the superstition of possession-or the active reversal of rationality and social control-permits the village to organize itself in opposition to la Lupa through insistence on the supernatural character of her power. In this way, the threatening forces are excluded from the sanctity of the "focolare" but not from village life. And their necessary anteriority to that order, constructed only in relation to them, may thus remain hidden. La Lupa had been "gnat Pina," had lived in the village and produced offspring. Though that very offspring is now irreparably tainted by continuing connection with the offensive spirit, the legitimacy of Maricchia's birth as gnat Pina's child is indicated by the narrator's otherwise inexplicable sympathy for her present plight, which she, too, understands so well ("Maricchia, poveretta, buona e brava ragazza, piangeva di nascosto . . ."). As in Levi-Strauss's treatment of the transitional figure of the South American Jaguar, la Lupa is thus seen as a character that had possessed culture but lost it ("brutale anche se volete"). Again, this is parallel to Livy's second reading of the foundation legend (wife--whore) and opposite the first (she-wolf---surrogate mother). By suppressing the progressive temporality and difference of metaphor in favor of the repeated identity of unquestioned nam- ing, both the village and the narrator are able to present la Lupa, the very incarnation of irrational passion, as having completely possessed the human figure. This maneuver permits them to name the essence as well as the body by first freezing the shifting arbi- trariness of the proper noun and then connecting it in a necessary relationship with the fated power. Human culture, and specifically patriarchal Catholicism, is thus seen as either coexistent with or</page><page sequence="19">122 GREGORY L. LUCENTE prior to the aberration of uncontrolled animality rather than pro- ceeding from and in reactive opposition to it. The belief in lycan- thropic possession is, indeed, concerned with origins. But it is about them only through the ideological effacement of their true nature. Within the village gnat Pina exists no longer, except in the mistaken perceptions of Nanni. And even he uses that appellation only prior to the confrontation amidst the gathering evening and the whining dogs. By invoking the transcendent power of the cross and fearing for the menfolk despite the protection of "l'altare di Santa Agrippina," the women of the village affirm the oppositional nature of the supernatural power even as they effectively gloss over the tempor- ality of gnat Pina's possession and the contingency of her corporeal existence. The fundamentality of the sacred/profane opposition is perhaps emphasized by the verbal interplay of naming (Agrip- pina/Pina), but this is not the only manner in which the lexical elements of narration are utilized to underscore the conflict's nec- essary and transcendent nature.19 The spirit's eyes, and the will they express, appear to transcend the bounds of time and place in precisely that communal figurative language which both the village and the narrator repeatedly adopt to portray them ("occhi grandi cosi... .occhi da satanasso... .occhi da spiritata... .occhi neri come il carbone .... mangiandoselo con gli occhi"). Furthermore, it is around these eyes, and the unified image of possession they present, that the narrator himself organizes two of the text's rare inventories of descriptive details, one at the novella's opening, the other at its conclusion. In terms of the perceptions of the narrative, then, la Lupa represents a singularly abhorrent figure, sexually active but non-productive, possessed by a seemingly uncontrollable force, beyond domestication or socialization because neither truly natural nor fully human, offensive to nature and culture alike and therefore utterly alone, supernatural: in short, lykanthropos. The narrative's recurrent description of the eyes of the possessed has an interesting postscript in Verga's letter to Rod, in which the agent of possession is described as a "passione cieca." Nonetheless, '9 In all his later writing Verga was extremely attentive to the details of naming. In the version of "La Lupa" written for the stage (1896), Nanni's child-significantly male-was called Agrippino. See Opere, pp. 857-58. Besides the resonance of its Roman origins-both Agrippinas were intimately involved in the ruling of the empire-this name also has an authentically localized Sicilian significance (see Russo's note to the novella in Opere, p. 125 n. 1.).</page><page sequence="20">M L N 123 these same eyes, which express but do not see, filled not with the image of the outside world but with aggressive desire, are able to locate the object of that desire in a figure who is also subject to at least transitory blindness ("Nanni spalanco gli occhi imbambolati, tra veglia e sonno ... e stese brancolando le mani"). It is clear, then, that la Lupa's seemingly blind passion is made up of two inextricable components, desire and will. It is important that in connection with la Lupa Verga's conception of will is somewhat closer to Nietzsche's than to Schopenhauer's, since her violent power works not in con- junction with but in direct opposition to the entire social edifice of rational control.20 Or in the terms of orthodox theology (following Bonaventure's system), her will derives all its energy from affect rather than reason and finds its only outlet through the senses. She is thus cut off from the divine intellect and remains, in theological as well as popular discourse, "scellerata." Although she may dem- onstrate rational cunning, affect always precedes and follows. As a figure existing in time and place, la Lupa has not only the finally unappeasable "fame da lupo" but also the force and the means to attempt appeasement, no matter how illusory satisfaction might prove. With respect to character configuration, then, la Lupa represents a realistic figure (gnat Pina) as well as the demonic force which has overtaken that figure. Although this power is insatiable and inde- structable, it is cyclically strengthened and weakened ("Una volta la Lupa si innamoro.... La Lupa era quasi malata"), and in the per- ceptions of the village and the narrator, the character has now become inseparably fused with it. In this light, the narrative can be said to depict la Lupa as the personification of libidinal energy, just as the established and only slightly less vigorous moral strictures of the Church and village represent the patriarchal superego. La Lupa's "masculine" and therefore unnatural aggressiveness indi- cates the polemical nature of patriarchy's depiction of her be- havior; and it demonstrates Verga's ideologically motivated antici- pation of Freud's claim that there is only one libido, which is mas- culine by nature.21 20 For a brief assessment of Nietzschean themes in "La Lupa" see Guy Dumas, "A Propos de la fin de la 'Lupa' de Giovanni Verga," Revue des Etudes Italiennes (Paris), 7, Nos. 2-3 (1960), pp. 241-49. 21 See Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, in Vol. 7 of The Standard Edition of the Complete Works of Sigmund Freud, trans., ed.

LUCENTE La Lupa's primitive unity is permitted in part by the symbolic merger of sexual desire with the constant need for sustenance, in the imagery of the ravenous wolf. For la Lupa, desire cannot re- main unbound, but neither can it find its outlet in the liberating imagination, which could then give way to the fully human interac- tion of pity, admiration, and love. Instead, it both begins and ends in the necessary destruction of its own relentless need. Her impos- ingly inhuman unity of passion forbids imaginative creation, which would require control as well as energy. La Lupa's desire thus leads only to continual attempts at appeasement or to death. Or more properly, since "fulfillment" in this case can only represent the power's temporary and incomplete cancellation ("quasi fatale"), it should be said that such attempts lead both to appeasement and to death. Nonetheless, they do so in terms of the same cyclical logic which makes reaching these limits an a priori impossibility- since gnat Pina can die, but the timeless spirit that is la Lupa cannot-and thus turns every approach toward death into inevita- ble rebirth. It is especially significant, therefore, that the force possessing the body of gnat Pina has its origin in a forbidden realm ideologically depicted as beyond both nature and culture. Her desire has be- come the externalized desire of the Other, just as, through the transferring will of her passion, it becomes Nanni's, too. But as long as it retains its locus within her, that is, within the supernatural and thus outside of fully established social discourse, it can never be sanctified as truly human. On both the individual and social levels, then, la Lupa functions in the semantics of narrative content and the syntax of structure as the hypostatized recognition of desire, or in Lacan's terms, the discourse of the Other. The village's motivated misapprehension of the prior force of passion, which is attributed to a realm that is profane yet barred only in a very precise sense (i.e. it may come here, we may not go there), corresponds to the village's denial of the contingency and temporality of naming itself ("gnat Pina" = "la Lupa"). In regard to social organization, this process parallels the village's depiction of the strictures of Christian truth and moral law as absolute and unquestionable rather than ideologically motivated. As Rousseau saw in the Social Contract, the social code arises only in response to the perception of a threatening force which is then termed external and contemporary but which in fact is also internal and perma-</page><page sequence="22">M L N 125 nent.22 The development of social convention gives rise to the ac- cepted lie of metaphorical truth in the language of contractual law (as in the dowry, the battle for the house), which effaces worldly difference in favor of legal uniformity. Only as the language of this law is established do the categories of individual freedom (cutting across communal restraint) and epistemological validity (cutting across difference) come into being as concepts. Moreover, true social liberty (civil and moral) is then seen as possible solely in conjunction with control itself.23 Although this control derives its initial energy from a source not its own and is therefore fully accessible to the shaping interpreta- tions of ideology, its oppositional relation to the prior power of passion is seen not as capricious but as essential if society itself is to survive. This is the reason for the extraordinary irony of la Lupa's legal acumen, since the very uniformity of the legal code may be used to protect her, as a nominal if negative member of society, even though all her power is directed against the fundamental values of that code. By utilizing the legally recognized title of prop- erty in relation to the house, she manages to retain the presocial "right" of aggressive possession ("la force ou le droit du premier occupant") in relation to Nanni.24 Her battle is not against Nanni, butfor Nanni against "il Signore." In the terms of Rousseau's ar- gument, she manipulates the lower order of the civil law and thereby overturns socialized man's highest achievement, creative moral liberty ("la liberte morale, qui seule rend l'homme vraiment maitre de lui; car l'impulsion du seul appetit est esclavage, et l'obiissance a la loi qu'on s'est prescritte est liberte").25 La Lupa thus represents a return to a quasi-natural state of compulsive expression. However, for both her and Nanni, this movement outside the bounds of 22 On the passage from nature to society see Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Du Contrat social ou principes du droit politique, in Vol. III of the Oeuvres completes, ed.

LUCENTE society leads finally not to freedom but to slavery. And this is true in the logic of Verga's analysis as well as in Rousseau's ("passione cieca"; "1'impulsion du seul appetit"). Within the social world of Verga's text, the basic opposition of passion and control (irrational/rational, nature/culture, libido/superego) is pushed to a transcendent realm in terms of pure expression (the power possessing la Lupa) and absolute repression (the Catholic deity). The regular, day to day activity of society is established in the field of battle between these two opposing ex- tremes. Though this maneuver effectively obscures the source of the fundamental opposition, which has its origins in the passion that is initially grounded in both desire and need, it cannot erase the ef- fects in language. These effects take form as metaphors for the prior energy, which has been externalized as the ideologically in- terpreted discourse of the Other. These metaphors then combine in the forms of individual and social discourse, both of which have come into being only across the transforming barrier of misap- prehension which effaces their origins. The complexly referential language of realist narrative then claims legitimacy by hiding the motivated perception of difference necessary to its origins, be- coming, in Verga's term, "spassionato," or, as he says in the intro- duction to "L'amante di Gramigna," cleansed of all trace of the subjective "peccato d'origine." Once again, the interaction of realistic and mythic structures in Verga's text leads to the predetermined logic of destiny. Even the irony that dissociates verismo's narrator from the objects of his own supposedly impersonal discourse serves to permit this dual illusion to proceed, since the apparent disjunction in regard to Nanni leads not to rupture but finally to degrees of recuperation at every level. Just as the possessing agent of desire represents the Other for the possessed, so la Lupa in toto represents the personification of the Other both for Nanni as an individual and for the village as a whole. What Nanni needs to do, and society through him, is to channel the seemingly external discourse of the Other into his/its own discourse. By means of this procedure, the ideological order of the patriarchal community is reaffirmed at the same time as the village's communal and otherwise "parentless" son situates himself fully within the code of its "timelessly" ordained law. The village thus conquers the lie at the conceptual origin of social freedom by momentarily subordinating the force of the threatening power to its own order. Human society severs its connection with the of-</page><page sequence="24">M L N 127 fending entity through programmatic misapprehension of the power's source, which, far from supernatural, is in fact the self- regenerating taint of its own "original sin." Passion repels, then, but it also attracts, in the complex mixture of admiration and hatred which the narrative demonstrates for its Girardian scapegoat. It is important to note that in Verga's texts, as in Dostoevsky or in Freud's early and middle works, the scapegoat is not just a figure but more fundamentally a function, not only Christ, Oedipus, or even the Devil but also the Unconscious itself. In Verga's novella, la Lupa's profane form is banished once more in society's endless struggle to authenticate its moral order. But her energy, masked and controlled by the illusion on which society absolutely depends, is again reinstalled as the driving force of life itself. As a figure intervening between la Lupa and Nanni, Maricchia bears a unique relation to both of them and to the village. She is depicted initially as a victim of guilt by association and then as a pawn in her mother's designs. Since the narrative's economy admits internal analysis only in terms of external reactions, it may appear that Maricchia remains a static rather than a developing character. But close examination of the text shows this not to be the case. Although it is possible to read Maricchia's initial recalcitrance as either a meager attempt at independence, an expression of bitter- ness at continuing maltreatment, or both, it is clear that at first she wants nothing to do with her mother's schemes or with Nanni ("Nanni era tutto unto e sudicio dell'olio e delle olive messe a fer- mentare, e Maricchia non lo voleva a nessun patto"). As I have already argued from another perspective, it is precisely by suc- cumbing to her mother's demands that Maricchia eventually gains her freedom through the very socialization which permits her to channel the inherited strength of her will against her adversary. Moreover, once she has been ushered into the communal order, her early feelings of disgust with Nanni turn to love. This is true despite the fact that the physical markers associated with the object of her newfound passion do not change ("l'amava anche lei quel marito che le avevano dato per forza, unto e sudicio delle olive messe a fermentare"). Like Nanni, then, Maricchia moves across the symbolic space between the inexhaustible forces of individual passion and social control. As long as her emotional attachments and material cir- cumstances restrict her to functioning merely as an appendage of her mother and her absent father ("la roba di suo padre"), sexuality</page><page sequence="25">128 GREGORY L. LUCENTE evokes feelings of aversion and disgust. Although these feelings take the external characteristics of the object as their mask, they are in fact connected with the threat of sexuality itself. But once the early attachments are broken, to be actively transformed in a sanctioned union with a socially appropriate object, disgust is able to give way to the fully mature expression of love, in a process generally similar to the one Freud described in the Three Essays of 1905.26 Though only sketched, this progression in "La Lupa" is clear. And once again it leads to the observation that although the will to freedom begins in the natural drive of primitive affect, true liberty, and its moral fulfillment in Verga's text, is seen as possible solely within the established structure of the social law. Even given the novella's extremely abbreviated form, Nanni re- mains a problematical figure. La Lupa takes possession of him by turning his initial vulnerability to her full advantage and subsum- ing the other within the orbit of the self. As we have seen, the aura of available affect associated with Nanni is appropriate to his social position as a young unmarried male "tornato da soldato" as well as to the symbolic nature of his task with la Lupa in the Notary's fields. Verga's directions to the stage version (1896) reaffirm these points of similarity as well as Nanni's fundamental narcissism: "Nanni Lasca, bel giovane-tenero colle donne, ma piu' tenero ancora del suo interesse... .denti di lupo, e begli occhi di cane da caccia."27 These introductory notations would seem to point to a contest between exclusively primitive emotions in which libido would indeed speak only to libido, as, for example, between nymphomania and satyriasis. But this is not the situation. As we have seen, the story gains its momentum not through equal oppositions but through a series of contrasts which are necessarily uneven, just as the basic prediscursive confrontation libido/superego gains its generative power through the fact of temporally unequal and therefore pro- gressive origins. The discursive resolutions of these mediated and constantly regenerated oppositions, on the level of theme as well as character interaction, build the novella's compact though far from unambiguous plot. At the beginning of the narrative Nanni is depicted as active but only secondarily productive; in the middle portion he is essentially passive; whereas by the end he is shown as both active and, in the hysteron proteron of the narrative's logic (first procreation of the 26SE 7: 177-78, 191-92, 225-28, 231. 27 Opere, p. 836; my italics.</page><page sequence="26">M L N 129 children, then socialization of the parent), fully capable of social productivity. This development involves redirecting Nanni's active male energy to society's ends, in the reaffirmation of the incest taboo. Outside the limits of this fundamental law, and the circula- tion of sexual partners which it regulates, society itself is seen to be impossible. But at the same time, the violation of the law is also inevitable as soon as Nanni thinks he can have things both ways. And this narcissistic inability to reconcile the rules of pleasure with those of reality gives rise to the violence of the tragedy's denoue- ment, in the forced conciliation of what is in fact a permanent struggle. The threat to Nanni's masculinity which the incest transgression entails is apparent in the text. The underlying fear of castration which the symbol of the wolf represents has been discussed in many contexts and was pointed out by Freud as early as his case history of the "Wolf Man" (1918).28 The specific indications of the effects of succumbing to la Lupa's enticements recur throughout the narra- tive: "delle labbra fresche e rosse, che vi mangiavano .... Te voglio! Te che sei ... dolce come i miele .... mangiandoselo con gli occhi." Moreover, it is during the period of Nanni's helpless passivity that la Lupa consummates her relationship with "suo genero," becom- ing, in deed as well as in wish, the sexually dominating phallic mother. Only by reclaiming the right to the phallus for himself can Nanni gain his freedom from la Lupa through voluntary submis- sion to the patriarchal law. The slavery of unrestrained passion is thus exchanged for the restrictions which are now seen as prerequisites to the true freedom of moral liberty. Nanni accomplishes this first by raising the axe, the symbol of his own phallic potency as well as the agent of de- struction, and then turning that agency against the externalized embodiment of the prior sin of desire. The raised axe thus effaces the mark of Nanni's own transgression at the same time as his continuing expression indicates the true location of the supposedly cancelled drive: "-Ah! malanno all'anima vostra!-halbettM Nanni." La Lupa's energy, as well as the forces which work to redirect it, live on in the play of internal/external, retention/expression, which becomes the stutter of Nanni's own discourse. La Lupa's pre-narrative regression out of culture is matched within the narrative by the arc of Nanni's retreat into nature and his subsequent rebaptism into culture, now fully sanctified under the 28 "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis," SE 17: 1-123.</page><page sequence="27">130 GREGORY L. LUCENTE aegis of the social law. By defending both his own position and the communal health of "l'egoismo collettivo," Nanni restores what Vittorio Spinazzola terms "l'ordine del patriarcato."29 This restora- tion is accomplished not in the "aia" nor amidst the scorched stub- ble of the countryside but in the place of work itself, in the vineyard bordering the now carefully tilled "seminati verdi." Through Nanni, the psychic energy of the outcast is once again bound within the social order, at least for the moment. As Lawrence perceived, Nanni finally "recoils" against the damage done to communal life "at its sexual root."30 However, a measure of caution is necessary in assessing the novella's conclusion, about which so many conflicting opinions have been ventured. It is easy to concur in Fredi Chiappelli's statement that as long as Nanni stands alone he remains weak, even through the concluding scene, whereas within society he finds the communal strength of public penitence (among il brigadiere, il parroco, his fellow com- municants, and even the participant souls in purgatory).31 The end- ing scene, with its violence of ritual slaughter, would thus repre- sent not so much Nanni's individual renunciation as a reaffirma- tion of the strength of the communal law, seen as residing in the axe. This reading is undeniably correct as far as it goes. By the end, the depth of Nanni's feelings for Maricchia and his sense of shame are clear (' "La povera Maricchia non fa che disperarsi. Ora tutto il paese lo sa!" '), as is his understanding of the seriousness of his transgression. He has seen for himself that this particular law is not only social and temporal (il brigadiere, il parroco) but also absolute ("il Signore"). Yet his attempts to evoke pity or shame from la Lupa are useless. During the illness subsequent to his accident, he ap- proaches death (' "Jo ho visto la morte cogli occhi" '), and the mem- ory adds a special urgency to his fears. This is the second mention of illness in the story, and it is as symbolically significant as the first. In part, Nanni's sickness represents the influence that his con- science is gaining in his socialization. The illness itself thus indicates the cure which is in fact taking place. It would be tempting, there- fore, to read the story's concluding lines as an affirmation that Nanni's restoration is at last complete, that he raises the axe which Verga's stage directions openly term "la scure omicida" and de- stroys his tormentor without further delay.32 It is impossible to 29 Spinazzola, p. 94. 30"Translator's Preface," p. 19. 31 "Una lettura verghiana: 'La Lupa,"' p. 380. 32 Opere, p. 872.</page><page sequence="28">M L N 131 agree with Guy Dumas that in fact the opposite takes place, that this scene is merely a recapitulative confirmation of Nanni's continuing failure. But it would be equally rash to claim that the axe falls, since in both the narrative and the drama that is precisely what does not happen.33 It is significant that in the previously cited letter to Rod of January, 1908, which was written in response to the staging of the concluding scene by the Grasso Company in Paris, Verga did not suggest reworking the conclusion to clarify his intent.34 He com- plained openly about Grasso's treatment, which presented Nanni falling into la Lupa's arms at the end ("figuratevi!"). But Verga stopped short of requesting reorganization of the movement to show that the axe actually falls, nor had he seen fit to alter a single word of the conclusion of the novella when he revised Vita dei campi for Treves' 1897 deluxe edition.35 Verga's decision can perhaps be explained by the surprisingly intricate symbolic interaction of the characters themselves. It must be remembered that in terms of character configuration Nanni's socialization entails not only his renunciation of la Lupa's form but also full internalization and redirection of her energy. Like Maricchia and all the other characters (even those only transition- ally human, such as gnat Pina and the pointedly vulnerable priest), Nanni's movements are restricted within the bounds of the oppos- ing powers of pure expression and total restraint. The narrative itself is an outgrowth of this prediscursive opposition, and it thus exists solely as the representation of the temporal compromises 33 Dumas, p. 246. Despite the importance of this scene in the story, David Woolf claims that whether or not la Lupa is killed is "immaterial," in The Art of Verga: A Study in Objectivity (Sidney: Univ. of Sidney Press, 1977), p. 101. 34 Lettera CXXXIX, pp. 244-45. On this intentional suspension of the narrative dialectic as one of Verga's standard concluding techniques, see Giacomo Debe- nedetti, Verga e il naturalismo.

The only major alteration in "La Lupa" was in Nanni's initial designation of Maricchia, from "vitella" to "zitella" (Cecchetti, p. 55).

LUCENTE between these forces, or in psychological terms, as both the product and the depiction of the functional ego. La Lupa, in her symbolic unity, is a hapax even among the extraordinarily basic figures which populate Verga's Sicilian stories. Only the fully supernatural powers are permitted to demonstrate such purity in their imposing unity of attributes. And Verga's text, as realism, is not primarily about them but instead about the complexly human mediations of their struggle. In order to live and function in society, Nanni may not become, even for a moment, the symbolically pure and unified superego. It is true that for society to exist the axe must fall; but in order for the dialectic of life itself to continue, the purifying act has to occur "off stage." The energy represented by "il diavolo" can and will reappear. At the same time, Nanni must be thoroughly implicated in the act's performance. In this way, he continues to be possessed by the will of the Other, but the affect behind that will is passed through the patriarchal social order rather than emanating unin- hibited from its source. Through his rebirth out of physical and mor- al abomination into mature contrition, followed by the defeat of the phallic mother and participation in the communal law, Nanni shares symbolically in his own fatherhood. In order to complete this progression, Nanni depends on the support of the rest of the village. But to establish his masculinity within society, Nanni must demonstrate, even though in ritual fashion, the ability to act on his own volition. Again, the basic opposition underlying the narrative remains unbalanced and therefore fully capable of generating the progressive relationships of renewed discourse, though by the end the weight has shifted within the ideologically organized text to the side of patriarchal control. The unity of presentation which had been threatened both by the continuing power of the "wicked witch" over the village "children" and by the narrator's irony is thus reestablished in the motion of the predestined act. Or in the terms of Verga's texts, the plot concludes not with Nanni or even la Lupa, but with the symbolic expression of social enforcement, "la scure omicida" and the internalized Word's continuing stutter into only momentary silence. III Nanni's story, then, lies in the development of his ego in relation to the triad of forces among which it must arbitrate, the libido, the</page><page sequence="30">M L N 133 superego, and the phenomenal world. Moreover, it is important for the thoroughgoing verisimilitude of realism that these forces organize not only the formation and interaction of the characters and their society but also the production of the text itself, through the anthropomorphic agency of the narrative voice. Though Verga's text demonstrates pity for Maricchia and an ironically guarded sympathy for Nanni's predicament, there is only one character who evokes admiration, la Lupa ("Ella se ne andava in- fatti, la Lupa, riannodando le trecce superbe . . ."). How can this be explained within the text which we have characterized as so thoroughly patriarchal? It is true that as a character la Lupa bears a fundamental similarity to the logical situation of the narrator, who establishes positions both inside and outside the parameters of vil- lage knowledge while remaining the sole master of his own narra- tion. But the basis of their similarity may be discovered on a level that precedes even the logical organization of the narrative, in the nature of discourse itself. By the period of Vita dei campi, Verga's aesthetic theories had crystallized. For both Verga and Capuana, verismo provided a means of depicting material and psychological phenomena with scientific accuracy ("[il] fatto nudo e schietto"). To quote further' from the introduction to "L'amante di Gramigna": II semplice fatto umano fara pensare sempre; avrA sempre l'efficacia dell'esser stato, delle lagrime vere, delle febbri e delle sensazioni che sono passate per la carne; il misterioso processo per cui le passioni si an- nodano . . . nel loro cammino sotterraneo ... costituira per lungo tempo ancora la possente attrattiva di quel fenomeno psicologico che forma l'argomento di un racconto, e che l'analisi moderna si studia di seguire con scrupolo scientifico. (emphasis in the original) For Italian verismo, this "scientific" process did not entail the elimination of the intertwined passions giving rise to the entire history of human behavior. Rather, for Verga, as for Zola, realism meant describing the elements of human emotion and behavior so precisely as to permit interpolation of the hidden causes that motivate action "in their subterranean journey." It was the process of depiction itself, not the represented behavior, which was to be dispassionate. Nonetheless, even as Verga insisted on the appearance of ana- lytical objectivity, he was able to see that such a goal was in fact illusory. Furthermore, this very pretense is seen to distinguish realistic art in its essential and finally ineradicable nature as a sym-</page><page sequence="31">134 GREGORY L. LUCENTE bolic representation which claims truth by means of the meticulous obliteration of its own factitiousness. Only through the success of this maneuver can art, and specifically verismo, appear "to have made itself," without any trace of the "original sin" of authorial contact. Moreover, this play of passion and control is regarded as shaping not only the artistic metaphors for character and society, but also the very production of art itself: Quando nel romanzo l'affinita e la coesione di ogni sua parte sara cosi completa, che il processo della creazione rimarrA un mistero, come lo svolgersi delle passioni umane, e l'armonia delle sue forme sara cosi perfetta, la sincerita della sua realta cosi evidente, il suo modo e la sua ragione di essere cosi necessarie, che la mano dell'artista rimarrA as- solutamente invisibile, allora avra l'impronta dell'avvenimento reale, l'opera d'arte sembrera essersi fatta da se, aver maturato ed esser sorta spontanea come un fatto naturale, senza serbare alcun punto di contatto col suo autore, alcuna macchia del peccato d'origine.36 Artistic creation, then, like all fruitful endeavor, is seen to derive from the "mystery" of initial passion which is tempered at its very source by willful as well as rational control. The author thus situates himself within the subjective discourse of his text even across the theoretical barrier of objectivity. The goal of objectivity remained only an ideal. But the ambition to achieve it and the position of unchallenged dominance which it brings as its reward continued to recur as figures for artistic cre- ation in all Verga's theoretical texts contemporary with Vita dei campi. Indeed, it was Verga's rigorous pursuit of verismo's objective ideal which makes it necessary to look beyond the narratives themselves for clarification of his methods, to the prefaces and introductions which border the fictional texts and establish a dialogical relationship with them. In certain respects, these texts provide tentative theoretical models for reading the contiguous narratives. Although these texts are often confusing and at times contradictory, their complexity is due to the logical difficulties in- herent in the theory and practice of realist illusionism rather than to their indecision or artistic uncertainty, as has been suggested from time to time, perhaps most recently by Giacomo Debe- 36 Emphasis in the original. Various elements of this theory extend from Flaubert and Zola to Stephen Dedalus' often cited theories in Joyce's Portrait (1916). See A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, ed. Chester G. Anderson (New York: Viking, 1968), p. 215.</page><page sequence="32">M L N 135 nedetti.37 In all cases, passion is seen as the synthesizing force which cuts across and eliminates differences in favor of identity and which thus opens up the very possibility of artistic expression while providing the metaphors essential to all unified perception. The intimate connection between ambition and artistic creation, along with the careful deconstruction of analytical objectivity, was made most concisely in the much discussed preface to I Malavoglia (1881), in which Verga described his master plan for the characters in the cycle of novels to be called I vinti: Ciascuno, dal pi6 umile al pi6 elevato, ha avuta la sua parte nella lotta per l'esistenza, pel benessere, per l'ambizione-dall'umile pescatore al nuovo arricchito-alla intrusa nelle alte classi-all'uomo dall'ingegno e dalle volonta robuste, il quale si sente la forza di dominare gli altri uomini; di prendersi da se quella parte di considerazione pubblica che il pre- giudizio sociale gli nega per la sua nascita illegale; di fare la legge, lui nato fuori della legge-all'artista che crede di seguire il suo ideale seguendo un'altra forma dell'ambizione. Chi osserva questo spettacolo non ha il di- ritto di giudicarlo; e gia molto se riesce a trarsi un istante fuori del campo della lotta per studiarla senza passione, e rendere la scena nettamente, coi colori adatti, tale da dare la rappresentazione della realta com'e stata, o come avrebbe dovuto essere.38 It should be noted that in this reduced version of the preface Verga devoted the greatest space to discussion of the central character of the project's last novels, which he eventually aban- doned without having published a line. The description of this impressive figure crowns the presentation of the projected series: the man of willful intelligence who strives to dominate others not despite but because of the public's prejudice against his "unlawful" origins. This characterization then leads directly to the figure of the artist, who is seen to be caught on the same wheel of ambition. Moreover, this "ambition" is made up of the very mixture of lack, desire, and will which links both the character and the hypothetical creator to la Lupa. In each case, the driving passion gives rise to expression, for one in the realm of sexuality, for another in that of government, for the third in artistic creation. 37 See Verga e il naturalismo, p. 17; but see also pp. 31-33. Though only recently published, these comments were made in the course of Debenedetti's lectures at the University of Messina in 1951-52. 38 Opere, pp. 178-79; my italics. This published version, of January 19, was notably shorter than other discussions of the planned series. (There was also an unpublished preface dated January 22.) Of the five projected novels, only the first two were completed (1881; 1888-89).</page><page sequence="33">136 GREGORY L. LUCENTE However, as distinct from the characters, the creating artist suc- cumbs to his passion only at the expense of creation itself. The objective control of form is seen as absolutely necessary to artistic production, and without it truly realistic art cannot exist ("e gia molto se riesce a trarsi un istante fuori del campo della lotta per studiarla senza passione . . ."). Since his production remains indi- vidual, the creative artist must find the mechanisms for objective control himself, rather than depending on the social imposition of form. At the same time, even the writer's strategic withdrawal into objectivity is spurred by the passion possessing him, since the drive to produce in form is itself forged in the cauldron of desire ("all'ar- tista che crede di seguire il suo ideale seguendo un'altra forma dell'ambizione"). For both Verga's narrator and his characters, then, control en- tails the passage of energy into form. However, unlike the charac- ters, verismo's artist is necessarily condemned to know this illusion. For la Lupa, trapped in her own need and therefore never free, the imposition of social control means form's end; whereas for Verga's hypothetical writer, form is the key which permits imagination's liberation from need and thus represents the control which allows productive fulfillment of artistic desire. As in the synthetic creation of the metaphors for character and society, for Verga writing em- bodied the true freedom which only analytic control could bring. This view of creation was not new. In its mingling of analysis and synthesis, rationality and affectivity, it derived from late En- lightenment and Romantic theories of language. However, ver- ismo's aesthetic bears the seal of authenticity in the programmatic insistence on depicting the world as it is, since society, in the com- petitive post-Darwinian universe, is now viewed as constantly changing in a determined if imperfectly known fashion. The artist himself and all his perceptions are also involved in those changes. At the same time, art's synthetic powers permit the freezing of change in formal illusion. Although the irony in "La Lupa" allows the narrator to know the temporal and representational illusions which form entails, just as it frees his imaginative faculties for pity and admiration, it cannot permit him to escape the fundamental logic of illusion itself. More than any of his characters, the narrator of realistic fiction-and through him, his objectively self- knowledgeable author-finds himself implicated in the semi-willful misapprehension of the falsehood at the conceptual origins of realistic art. It is this distinctive combination of willful desire and objective knowledge which allows the ordered discourse of repre-</page><page sequence="34">M L N 137 sentational fiction to begin. However, once this clear awareness has been stated, it is only the continuing misapprehension of the in- teraction of knowledge and desire, in the constant regression into affectivity and return to control, which permits realist discourse to continue in the necessary meconnaissance of its own program ("tale da dare la rappresentazione della realta com'e stata, o come avrebbe dovuto essere"). For the realist, to borrow a formula from Nietzsche, only within the artistic expression of fantasy can the forces of Dionysus actively commingle with those of Apollo, and then only in art's inevitable deception. However, once purified in form and so raised to a higher order, this same child of illusion is rechristened truth ("allora avra l'impronta dell'avvenimento reale"). For verismo's artist, the objective withdrawal essential to artistic creation provides a privileged position straddling the boundaries of his own society. At the same time, sympathetic knowledge of the passion necessary to creation gives rise to the guarded and pro- foundly ambiguous admiration that Verga's texts repeatedly har- bor for emotionally charged borderline figures and outcasts, such as the illegitimate "uomo di lusso," la Lupa, and 'Ntoni Malavoglia. Moreover, Verga's own behavior as a member of the lesser Sicilian aristocracy presented analogs of this same process. In his taste for existing at the edge of socially permissible affectivity, he consis- tently preferred active philandering to the bonds of marriage. It should be clear, then, that "La Lupa"'s characters, their soci- ety, and the production of the text itself, as well as the novella's diegetic and thematic configurations, are all generated by the struggle between passion and control. The narrative creates a log- ical universe developing out of this struggle. The idealized unity of la Lupa as both possessed and possessor permits her identity with passion, whereas the negative strictures of the Church and State may be located exclusively within the position of control. The functional ego, the daily activity of free society, the productive pairing of Nanni and Maricchia, and literature itself arise in the struggle between these forces. Although rational culture and irra- tional nature are portrayed in necessary opposition, actual society exists only in the battle of mediations between them, with one force victorious at one moment, the other at the next. In this way, Verga's text retains the driving energy of passion even as it es- pouses control. Ideological valuation may therefore be traced on the most basic level of textual generation as well as in the full development of character and plot.</page><page sequence="35">138 GREGORY L. LUCENTE By taking both literary and social structures as its basic texts, Verga's novella establishes a mode of intertextuality giving rise to a discourse at once contemporary and timeless, authentically new yet adapted and recoded from the past. The question of male versus female dominance runs throughout all the major texts following Vita dei campi, yet the symbolic oppositions of Aphrodite and Adonis, or even of the Devil and Christ, remain active struggles with at best forced conciliations rather than clear standoffs. The unending battle of social life, with all its hopes and fears, may thus be read as Verga's true subject, at once realistic and mythic, incor- porating a distinctive aura of timelessness as well as a constantly renewed urgency for critics and readers alike.
