<plain_text><page sequence="1">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE: VARIETY OF WIT IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES By BARBARA E. STIRRUP Variety is a keynote of Ovid's Metamorphoses: variety of myth is complemented by variety of structure and style to create a sym- phony of sophisticated versatility. From this arise complex tech- niques of wit and it is the purpose of this paper to investigate these within myths which are basically similar. It is our purpose to examine comparatively three myths in order to elucidate the particular form of wit which predominates in each. The stories of Alpheus-Arethusa, Jupiter-Europa and Apollo- Daphne all deal with the same basic theme, that of a god intent on rape; all include a journey and a metamorphosis. Similar stylistic devices are employed and literary and linguistic irony, mock-heroic techniques, visual descriptions, and ambivalence are recurrent features. In the stories of Alpheus-Arethusa and Jupiter-Europa the use of metamorphosis is integral to the narrative structure of the main and central section. In neither story is the act of metamorphosis of importance in itself except in the case of Arethusa, whose gra- dual transformation provides an element of ironic suspense and contributes to the wit of the finale. Both stories depend essen- tially on the function of the metamorphosis. The key to the significant use of metamorphosis in the story of Alpheus-Arethusa (5. 585-641) is barely implicit in the opening. But it is ironic that Arethusa, hot and weary from hunting, comes, unaware and unsuspecting, upon the river Alpheus. The river is a refuge for her from the intense heat and this is indicated the more emphatically by the use of contrast. The intensity of the heat is conveyed by the structure of line 586 where the doubling, or gemination, of the heat is conspicuously demonstrated in the polyptoton aestus aestum placed at either end of the line: aestus erat, magnumque labor geminaverat aestum. The river provides a cool and idyllic retreat: the waters are sound- less (sine murmure euntes, 587), every pebble deep down can be counted (numerabilis alte/ calculus omnis erat, 588-9), the charm of the river is enhanced by poplar and willow:</page><page sequence="2">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 171 invenio sine vertice aquas, sine murmure euntes, perspicuas ad humum, per quas numerabilis alte calculus omnis erat, quas tu vix ire putares. cana salicta dabant nutritaque populus unda sponte sua natas ripis declivibus umbras. (587-91) She is tempted by the water but her approach is cautious; she wets first the soles of her feet, then her legs up to the knee. This is not enough: she undresses, hanging her soft garments on a curving willow: molliaque inpono salici velamina curvae. (594) The implication is that her clothes are so delicate that they even cling to the curving willow branch. The gentleness of 594 is the prelude to her entry into the water; she dives in and swims strongly: nudaque mergor aquis. quas dum ferioque trahoque mille modis labens, excussaque bracchia iacto . . . (595-6) The strokes are delineated (ferioque traboque and excussaque braccbia iacto); all is apparently innocent and only mille modis raises by literary reference the possibility of ambivalence.' But her activity meets with an unexpected response from the depths of the river:2 medio sensi sub gurgite murmur (597) The ironic incongruity is underlined by the use of murmur, re- calling the description of the quietness of the river (sine murmure euntes, 587). This is on a note of comic fantasy but the address which follows is human: 'Quo properas, Arethusa?' suis Alpheus ab undis, 'quo properas?' (599-600) She flees and he pursues; although this is nowhere made explicit until line 637, there is no doubt that the river has now adopted anthropomorphic form. Previously a refuge for her from the heat, now he burns with passion (ardet, 602); her nakedness is an un- intended provocation, its innocent cause deliberately explained in 598 (territaque insisto propiori margine fontis) and in 601-2 (fugio sine vestibus; altera vestes/ ripa meas babuit), its effect succinctly conveyed in 603 (quia nuda fui, sum visa paratior il i)7 . His anthropomorphic identity is sustained: he presses upon</page><page sequence="3">172 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE her (sic me ferus ille premebat, 604); he is no swifter than she but capable of longer endurance (longi patiens erat ille laboris, 611). He even possesses a shadow-unless it is fear which invents this: sol erat a tergo: vidi praecedere longam ante pedes umbram, nisi si timor illa videbat. (614-15) The reservation nisi si timor illa videbat is a casual and witty re- minder of his alternating form. His physical and anthropomorphic presence is immediately reasserted: sed certe sonitusque pedum terrebat, et ingens crinales vittas adflabat anhelitus oris. (616-17) She prays for help to Diana, who immediately enshrouds her in the cloud3 which is the prelude to her metamorphosis. The development of the story in lines 621-38 centres on the metamorphoses. It is as a river that Alpheus seeks her (amnis, 623) but it is still the god/man who calls to her: et bis 'Io Arethusa, io Arethusa!' vocavit. (625) He watches and waits. Action is suspended, first by analogies for Arethusa's fear and then by the gradual process of metamorpho- sis which is carefully described. In a continuous action stressed by enjambement sweat breaks out all over her body and dissolves into beads of moisture; her watery form is anticipated in the use of frigidus and caeruleae.4 occupat obsessos sudor mihi frigidus artus caeruleaeque cadunt toto de corpore guttae. (632-3) The ground is running with water where she treads, moisture drips from her hair: a sequence of cola conveys the details: quaque pedem movi, manat locus, eque capillis ros cadit. .. (634-5) More detail would be superfluous; Ovid breaks off with an appro- priately vague comparison: et citius quam nunc tibifacta renarro, in latices mutor. (635-6) Ironically, the masculine amnis (637) in his anthropomorphic form recognizes as his beloved the feminine water (amatas ... aquas, 636-7) and accordingly transforms himself on the spot in- to his identity as a river in order to fuse with her: vertitur in proprias, ut se mihi misceat,s undas. (638)</page><page sequence="4">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 173 The very casualness of the metamorphosis is enhanced by the comic intrusion of the narrator Arethusa, who corrects, with plain prosaic construction, her omission of reference to the ori- ginal metamorphosis from river to man: positoque viri, quod sumpserat, ore (637) They are united as rivers. Diana opens up the earth and they journey underground and together emerge in Sicily. The use of metamorphosis is similarly integral to the Jupiter- Europa story (2. 846-75). A situation of comic incongruity is foreshadowed by the opening sententia: non bene conveniunt nec in una sede morantur maiestas et amor: (846-7) It is developed in the epic description of Jupiter which is con- trasted with that of the bull.6 His title (ille pater rectorque deum), his accoutrements (sceptri, 847, cui dextra trisulcis/ ignibus ar- mata est, 648-9), and his function (qui nutu concutit orbem, 849) are structured in epic style only to be deflated in a half-line colon (induitur faciem tauri, 850) by the simple act of meta- morphosis: sceptri gravitate relicta ille pater rectorque deum, cui dextra trisulcis ignibus armata est, qui nutu concutit orbem, induitur faciem tauri. .. (847-50) The deflation is extended in the correspondences of role: Jupiter, king of the gods (deum, 848), is armed with three-forked fire (trisulcis/ ignibus, 848-9) and thunders (nutu concutit7 orbem, 849); the bull, mingling with the bullocks (iuvencis, 850), is equipped with small horns (parva cornua, 855) and bellows (mugit, 851). Further elaboration of the description of the bull is relevant only to the subsequent episode. It is as a bull that he intends to seduce Europa and it is thus appropriate that in seven and a half lines (851-8) his charms are described in detail. His beauty is re- markable (formosus,8 851) and the picture of him in the field nicely heightened by the word-play in teneris formosus ... herbis (851). The reference to his whiteness is expanded: quippe color nivis est, quam nec vestigia duri calcavere pedis nec solvit aquaticus auster. (852-3)</page><page sequence="5">174 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE Neck, flanks, and horns are described in a tricolon and the refer- ence to his horns correspondingly expanded: cornua parva quidem, sed quae contendere possis facta manu, puraque magis perlucida gemma. (855-6) Above all he is gentle; this is affirmed by the use of negatives: nullae in fronte minae nec formidabile lumen (857) So far he is the lover, handsome enough to seduce his girl- friend but at this point the situation is reversed: we are presented not only with a ridiculously fantastic relationship but, as the ulti- mate absurdity, with a reversal of roles. Europa, described with epic elevation Agenore nata (858), falls in love with the bull be- cause of his beauty and gentleness, and after initial timidity pro- ceeds to woo him. Ambivalence adds to the fun of the episode: Jupiter is alternately bull and god but it is at the moment that one identity is established that the other is reintroduced. She brings him a lover's gifts of flowers and the connotations of candida' (861) prepare for the language of sexual love: mox adit et flores ad candida porrigit ora. gaudet amans et, dum veniat sperata voluptas, oscula dat manibus-vix iam, vix cetera differt! (861-3) The fantastic reality of the situation is restored by the ambivalence (854) of adludit . . exsultat: et nunc adludit viridique exsultat in herba. It is the bull which lays his snowy flank on the golden sands, a picture of visual seductiveness intensified by the colour contrast in the juxtaposition of fulvis niveum: nunc latus in fulvis niveum deponit harenis. (865) It is a nice reversal of the human love relationship that it is he who offers his breast to the hand of his lover and the fantasy is asserted the more explicitly by the stress on virginea (867) after enjambe- ment and in juxtaposition with plaudenda (867), suitably vigorous; it is he who offers his horns to be adorned with flowers: modo pectora praebet virginea plaudenda manu, modo cornua sertis inpedienda novis. (866-8) The climax is reached when Europa, again elevated to epic stature (regia virgo, 868), as ironically befits the situation, sits on the back of the bull only to be carried away by him.'0 This final episode is</page><page sequence="6">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 175 a parody of the deductio of the marriage ceremony. Carrying her on his back, the bull enters the sea instead of the home; frightened, she holds on carefully with both hands so that she will not fall off, meanwhile looking back to the shore she has left:" pavet haec litusque ablata relictum respicit, et dextra cornum tenet, altera dorso inposita est; tremulae sinuantur flamine vestes. (873-5) The emphasis on the function of metamorphosis in both these stories involves the importance of visual description, irony, and ambivalence. Alpheus is described in detail as a river (5.586-91) and as anthropomorphic pursuer (5.603-17): this is important as the story depends on the alternation of his two roles. The bull is described in detail in the Jupiter-Europa story in order to estab- lish his central role. Irony and ambivalence are in both instances subordinate to the central function of the metamorphosis. The essential difference between the two stories depends on the application of metamorphosis. The story of Alpheus-Arethusa is basically the narrative of a pursuit in which the alternating iden- tities of the protagonists provide the heart of the wit; the story of Jupiter-Europa depends upon the reversal of a fantastic love- relationship based upon a metamorphosis. The movement of the stories is markedly different, pursuit being an integral part of the one and the journey the finale only of the other. An analysis of the story of Apollo-Daphne (1. 490-567) in conjunction with those of Alpheus-Arethusa and Jupiter-Europa may serve to illuminate a further technique of wit. Daphne and Arethusa are both chaste and modest nymphs fleeing from gods who wish to rape them. There are similarities of theme and style in the descriptions of flight. Both are desperate to escape. Arethusa flees the more urgently, as she is conscious of her nakedness: her dilemma is ironically heightened by polyptoton vestes vestibus: sicut eram, fugio sine vestibus: altera vestes ripa meas habuit. (5.601-2) She is exposed to her pursuer and it is his passion which is at first stressed (rauco mihi dixerat ore, 601; instat et ardet, 602; ferus ille, 604). But the epic simile, doubled, which clinches the inten- sity of pursuit and flight, alters this emphasis:</page><page sequence="7">176 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE sic ego currebam, sic me ferus ille premebat, ut fugere accipitrem penna trepidante columbae, ut solet accipiter trepidas urgere columbas. (604-6) The balance is precise, pointed by the anaphora of sic (604) and ut (605, 606), and by the reversal and duplication of the simile, but the polyptoton trepidante trepidas, in tension with accipitrem accipiter, appropriately stresses the fear of the fugitive. Nymph and god cover a vast distance; the epic catalogue of places passed on the way provides a degree of comic hyperbole heightened by the erratic course plotted'2 and only to be de- flated by the negative indefiniteness of the last area covered: usque sub Orchomenon Psophidaque Cyllenenque Maenaliosque sinus gelidumque Erymanthon et Elim currere sustinui... (607-9) per tamen et campos, per opertos arbore montes, saxa quoque et rupes et, qua via nulla, cucurri. (612-13) The evening sun accounts for the long shadow which precedes her feet so far that it is obvious that he has almost caught up with her: the sound of his feet terrifies her, his breathing is in her hair. Ex- hausted, she utters a prayer; Diana is swift to respond (mota dea est, 621) and the metamorphosis which saves her from rape in human form takes place. This narrative is thematically close to that of the flight of Daphne which occupies 1.502-47. Epic simile is a feature of this flight too and is developed with careful correspondences.13 The pursuit by Apollo is compared with that of a Gallic hound chasing a hare: the parallels are stated in lines 5 33-4 and 5 39 with the repetition of bic ille/bic illa to bind the comparison linguistically: ut canis in vacuo leporem cum Gallicus arvo vidit, et hic praedam pedibus petit, ille salutem; (533-4) sic deus et virgo est hic spe celer, illa timore. (539) The contrast between booty and safety (praedam/salutem, 534) is paralleled by the contrast between hope and fear (spe/timore, 539); the sexual connotation of praedam'4 bridges simile and con- text. Spe also picks up sperat (536): the hound is on the very point of seizing the hare just as Apollo is on the point of seizing Daphne. The closeness of the pursuer is the focal point and is stressed:</page><page sequence="8">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 177 alter inhaesuro similis iam iamque tenere sperat (535-6) tergoque fugacis imminet (541-2) Physical proximity is explicit: et extento stringit vestigia rostro (536) crinem sparsum cervicibus adflat. (542) Apollo breathes on Daphne's hair as Alpheus breathes on Arethu- sa's. The proximity of the pursuer is parallel and, like Arethusa, Daphne prays for help. The river god Peneus is no slower than Diana in his response (vix prece finita torpor ... occupat artus, 548) and the metamorphosis is immediately effected. The structure of metamorphosis in the two episodes is closely parallel. As in 5.632-3, two single-line cola introduce the mecha- nics of the operation: vix prece finita torpor gravis occupat artus, mollia cinguntur tenui praecordia libro... (1.548-9) She has been running; now she is numb. The key to the metamor- phoses is established by the nouns placed in correspondingly cen- tral positions in the respective two opening lines: sudor (5.632) and torpor (1.548) indicate the mode of metamorphosis and appropriately govern the same verb and accusative (occupat artus 5.632, 1.548); the second lines continue the process of trans- formation with the verbs cadunt (5.633) cinguntur (1.549) corres- pondingly placed before the main caesura. After the introduction details of change are depicted in corresponding, brief cola: quaque pedem movi, manat locus, eque capillis ros cadit... (5.634-5) in frondem crines, in ramos bracchia crescunt. (1.550) At this point the parallels cease. Ovid has a different purpose in describing in detail the metamorphosis of Daphne from nymph into the shape of a laurel. It is relevant that her transformation is visually portrayed in specific detail, culminating in a reference to the extremes of head and feet: pes modo tam velox pigris radicibus haeret, ora cacumen habet: (1.551-2)</page><page sequence="9">178 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE In contrast to her running, she is now fixed and the significance of her being rooted as a tree is suggested by the placing of pes baeret at either end of line 551 and by the antithetical juxtaposition velox pigris; she loses her power of speech as her head becomes the treetop which in 567 will grant consent by a nod: ora cacumen habet adnuit utque caput visa est agitasse cacumen. It remains only to reassert in conclusion that her beauty alone is unchanged. The statement is simple and unadorned: the beauty of Daphne becomes the sheen of the laurel leaf: remanet nitor unus in illa. (552) The way is prepared for the wit of the finale. The descriptions of the flight and metamorphosis of Arethusa and Daphne correspond in characterization of the nymphs, mock- heroic techniques, and visual metamorphosis. The essential differ- ence lies in the narrative structure: there is no long speech in the Alpheus-Arethusa story to compare with Apollo's appeal to Daphne (1.504-25) and in Apollo's pursuit of Daphne the story does not depend on the play of alternating identities. Further correspondences of theme and style link the stories of Apollo-Daphne and Jupiter-Europa: Apollo woos a tree (1.553- 6); a nymph woos a bull (2.861-9). Both episodes centre on the lover's advances and the response of the beloved in a fantastic situation and both lead to a ludicrous finale. In 1.55 3 Apollo loves and places his right hand on his beloved, now a tree; the reinforced association of feeling and touch by juxtaposition (amat positaque) is ironically strengthened by the incongruous juxtaposition of stipite dextra: amat positaque in stipite dextra He feels the heart, quickened by her running, beat but it is beating now beneath the thin bark (tenui libro, 549); the juxtaposition cortice pectus conveys the absurdity: sentit adhuc trepidare novo sub cortice pectus (554) The reference to novo ... cortice is a nice reminder of the act of metamorphosis; we are momentarily jerked from illusion to rea- lity, or at least a narrative reality. Common sense is sustained in the following line: he embraces the branches but he has no illusions: complexusque suis ramos ut membra lacertis (555)</page><page sequence="10">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 179 The apparent rationality of the line is dropped. Passion prevails and he kisses the tree: oscula dat ligno; refugit tamen oscula lignum (556) The line marks the climax of his fantasy: he accepts reality. The comic incongruity of his approach is conveyed by the polyptoton and juxtaposition oscula ... ligno/oscula lignum with oscula .. . lig- num at either end of the line, respectively preceding and following diaereses; the absurdity of the final rejection is stressed by the cen- tral position of refugit which, strengthened by the prefix re-, picks up fugit (502, 507). The episode of Apollo wooing the tree, like that of Europa wooing the bull, depends on the comic incongruity of the relation- ship which is conveyed by the ironic use of juxtaposition and word-play, devices of prosody, and the witty application of the love convention. The essential differences between them derive from the different applications of metamorphosis so that in the Apollo-Daphne story it is the beloved who is transformed in order to escape her lover, whereas Jupiter adopts the guise of a bull in order to seduce his beloved; there is furthermore the ironic reversal of the love re- lationship in the Jupiter-Europa story so that it is Europa who appears to be seducing the bull rather than the reverse. The investigation of the similarities and differences existing between the story of Apollo-Daphne and those of Alpheus- Arethusa and Jupiter-Europa points to a different emphasis in the narration. There are elements in the story of Apollo-Daphne which have no part in the other two narratives: in neither the story of Alpheus-Arethusa (narrated in the first person by Arethusa) nor in Jupiter-Europa is there any build-up of a love relationship at the beginning; the story of Apollo alone contains a long address to the beloved and alone contains a climactic sequel to the meta- morphosis. The importance of structure in establishing the central wit of the Apollo-Daphne story may be clarified by a closer analysis. The story of Apollo-Daphne may be divided into four sections. His love is established in lines 1.490-502; it is raised to the level of hyperbole in his address (504-25); his pursuit is described (524-46) and the resultant metamorphosis (548-52) provides the introduction to the final section (55 3-67). Apollo falls in love and desires sexual union. Lines 490-502 depict the growth of his love by the use of epic similes rendered witty by their correspondence not to a literal but to a</page><page sequence="11">180 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE metaphorical context. Thus, just as the stubble is burnt and the hedges set on fire, the latter simile being expanded in Virgilian style, so the god bursts into flames: utque leves stipulae demptis adolentur aristis, ut facibus saepes ardent, quas forte viator vel nimis admovit vel iam sub luce reliquit, sic deus in flammas abiit, sic pectore toto uritur . . . (492-6) The metaphors in flammas abiit (495) and uritur (496) pick up the verbs of the simile adolentur (492) and ardent (493). In line 496 Ovid switches from the imagery of fire to that of nourish- ment and sexual nourishment at that: et sterilemis sperando nutrit amorem. (496) Physical attractions have sparked off desire: he looks at her loose hair and speculates 'quid, si comantur?' (498); the comment pin- points a binding motif which recurs throughout the narrative. He looks especially at eyes and mouth; spectat (497) is followed by videt ... oculos (498-9), videt oscula (499). But looking at her is not his intent; Ovid plots the growth of desire: non est vidisse satis; (499-500) And, as the climax of erotic thought: si qua latent, meliora putat. (502) She flees and does not wait to listen. This speech has no counterpart in the Alpheus-Arethusa story and its function is to contribute by near-burlesque and mock- heroic techniques to the wit of the narrative. It opens on a note of irony with a tricolon of incongruous analogies summed up in a brief maxim: non insequor hostis; nympha, mane! sic agna lupum, sic cerva leonem, sic aquilam penna fugiunt trepidante columbae, bostes quaeque suos. (504-7) He compares Daphne with a lamb, hind, and dove. But he is no enemy: it is not hostility but love which prompts his pursuit. The incongruity of the analogies is pressed home: non insequor hostis (504) is picked up by amor est mihi causa sequendi (507). The subsequent ejaculation me miserum (508) introduces a</page><page sequence="12">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 181 series of ridiculous entreaties: he urges her to flee more slowly so that she may not fall and hurt herself and in a gallant anaphora, heightened by coincidence of accent and ictus, undertakes to moderate his own speed: moderatius, oro, curre fugamque inhibe, moderatius insequar ipse. (510-11) Burlesque now enters with a catalogue of the credentials which should earn for him a welcome as a lover. First he explains all that he is not; the anaphora of non and repetition of nescis underline the fact that he is no country yokel: non incola montis, non ego sum pastor, non hic armenta gregesque horridus observo. nescis, temeraria, nescis quem fugias... (512-15) Next he enumerates his advantages in epic style. His possessions come first: mihi Delphica tellus et Claros et Tenedos Patareaque regia servit (515-16) Next his genealogy and his achievements: his birth could not be nobler (Iuppiter est genitor, 517) and he is both prophet and musician. Yet despite these advantages he admits defeat by Cupid: certa quidem nostra est, nostra tamen una sagitta certior, in vacuo quae vulnera pectore fecit! (519-20) The polyptoton nostra/nostra and the shift from the positive to the comparative adjective certa . . . certior underline ruefully the fervour of his passion and the appeal ends on a self-pitying note. The appeal of Apollo to Daphne covers as many lines as the subsequent pursuit. Her panic is commensurate with his urgency and agitation is conveyed by zeugma in line 527: fugit cumque ipso verba inperfecta16 reliquit Agitation only inflames his desire: in his eyes her beauty is even enhanced: auctaque forma fuga est. (530) The motif of her hair, which first attracted him, is resumed: et levis inpulsos retro dabat aura capillos (529)</page><page sequence="13">182 TECHNIQUES OF RAPE He wastes no more time talking; the chivalry of 510-11 is forgotten in the passion of 5 31-2: utque movebat ipse amor, admisso sequitur vestigia passu. At the moment of near-capture he is actually breathing on her hair: crinem sparsum cervicibus adflat. (542) All this importantly contributes to the visual metamorphosis and the aetiological sequel of the story. Five lines depicting her metamorphosis are followed by four in which Apollo makes overtures to the laurel. At the climax of his passion, he accepts that she is a tree: 'quoniam coniunx mea non potes esse, arbor eris certe' dixit 'mea!' (557-8) The statement is direct and only mea is markedly dramatic. His address in 557-65 is conspicuously different in tone from the absurd appeal in 504-25. It is mock-heroic, deriving much of its witty effect from its social reference to the Roman practice of using the laurel in civic life, in triumphs, and as an emblem of protection. With triple anaphora of te he apostrophizes her as his future symbol; his hair, his lyre, and his quiver will bear the leaves which once were her hair: semper habebunt te coma, te citharae, te nostrae, laure, pharetrae; (558-9) He specifies the functions she will fulfil and the local and contem- porary references contribute to the mock-heroic tone; she will be present, crowning the victorious general in his triumphal procession to the Capitol; she will grow as a protection outside the house of Augustus:17 tu ducibus Latiis aderis, cum laeta Triumphum vox canet et visent longas Capitolia pompas; postibus Augustis eadem fidissima custos ante fores stabis... (560-3) The mock-heroic tone is dropped in the final two lines of his ad- dress and the motif of hair, incongruous link uniting them, is revived to explain the aetiology:'8</page><page sequence="14">TECHNIQUES OF RAPE 183 utque meum intonsis caput est iuvenale capillis, tu quoque perpetuos semper gere frondis honores! (564-5) Her response is splendidly ironic. Now that the metamorphosis is completed (factis modo... ramis, 566) and she is safe from his advances, Daphne consents to his wishes. In acceptance of her civic role she nods (adnuit, 567) and the moment of personifica- tion completes the incongruity of the occasion: factis modo laurea ramis adnuit utque caput visa est agitasse cacumen. (566-7) This finale gains its effect mainly from its structural signifi- cance: it at once parallels the onset of love in lines 490-502 and it provides an ironically appropriate climax to the story, the wit of which is further heightened by the social and contemporary reference. Comparative analysis of these three basically similar myths thus serves to highlight different preoccupations in Ovid's treatment. The story of Alpheus-Arethusa focuses on the alternating identi- ties of Alpheus and Arethusa and the mode of metamorphosis is essential for the movement of the narrative; the story of Jupiter- Europa is focused on a fantastic and reversed love relationship in which the metamorphosis of the god plays the central role; the story of Apollo-Daphne depends for its effect on its structure. Such variety of techniques of wit within the self-imposed limita- tions of the basic framework is indeed indicative of the high degree of intellectual ingenuity and vitality which are characteristic of Ovid's poetry.

Frecaut, L 'Esprit et l'humour chez Ovide (Grenoble, 1972), p. 252, suggests that Alpheus takes Arethusa's innocent antics in the water as an invitation; but surely Alpheus' response is more immediate, a sexual reaction. 3. This wittily recalls the epic motif, cf. Virgil, Aen. 1.411-14. 4.
