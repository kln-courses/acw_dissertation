<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIAN SCIENCE HEALING WALTER I. WARDWELL Department of Sociology and Anthropology University of Connecticut THE limits of rationality in human ac- tion have never been plotted. Yet it would be valuable to know just how rational a man or a society can be. Such a notion suggests the hypothesis that there may be a quantum of non- rational action in any society which cannot be reduced. In America the high valuation of empirical science and technology is well- known. Recourse to the supernatural and reliance on fate or on luck have been pushed into the background. In- deed, few other cultures approach the American in the extent to which def- initions of the situation call for rational action. The masterful American, cap- taining his own soul, is expected to cope with his environment and its prob- lems to as great an extent as possible by means of rational scientific techniques. Thus it is no accident that the term science-Christian Science-was chosen to designate one of the most non-rational forms of healing ever to appear in American culture. It blossomed in prag- matic New England during the latter part of the "enlightened" nineteenth century, and it still flourishes. Moreover, it has attained its greatest acceptance in precisely those sectors of human so- ciety that would usually be considered the most scientifically enlightened-the urban middle classes of Western, especial- ly Anglo-Saxon, society. How can we ex- plain the prevalence of Christian Science healing in a culture dominated by ra- tional and scientific values, in particular, in the "enlightened" middle classes of such societies ? Most scientific investigations of Chris- tian Science have studied its development as a religious sect, rather than its heal- ing.' And yet the latter needs study, although it cannot be divorced from its religious basis. Christian Science denies the existence of matter, sin, death, and sickness, and asserts that all is mind, spirit, God, and good. The goal of Christian Science is authoritatively stated as "full salvation for mankind ... from all that denies the perfection of God and of man in His image and likeness," including "sin, sickness, lack, sorrow, selfishness, ignorance, fear, and all ma- terial-mindedness.... The word 'healing' as used in Christian Science extends to the healing of family and business problems, of social injustices, intellec- tual limitations, psychological tensions, 1 Bryan R.

Unlike forms of spiritual and faith healing which may be used in conjunc- tion with orthodox medical treatment, Christian Science insists that its healing should be divorced completely from scientific medicine, only rarely and re- luctantly permitting the use of surgery and drugs as concessions to the weakness of mortal flesh. Furthermore, its tech- niques are remarkably unlike those of much other spiritual healing. Although it emphasizes prayer and mental work, together with reading the Bible and Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, the group ceremonials and emotional ecstasy that accompany most primitive and con- temporary faith healing are lacking.3 Even the function of the practitioner himself is minimized, for he does not have to be physically present with the patient but he can mentally handle the patient's problem while remaining in his own home. Or he can be dispensed with altogether, since the patient is competent to attain correct belief by himself and is strongly encouraged to do so through studying what has been 2 Facts about Christian Science, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, 1959. 8 William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, New York: Modern Library, 1902; Jerome D.

In principle, Chrstian Science is a church of laymen any one of whom can attain the status of reader, prac- titioner, or teacher provided he attains correct belief. However, practitioners help a person afflicted by a "claim" (i.e., an illness) and play a significant role in most "demonstrations" (i.e., cures). Some practitioners have, in fact, achieved notable reputations as successful healers. The path to becoming a recognized practitioner is to take "primary class instruction" from a qualified teacher. Such instruction is based on the chapter entitled "Recapitulation" in Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health, lasts two weeks, and costs one hundred dollars. There are no educational prerequisites but students are expected to "have good past records and promising proclivities toward Christian Science."' Pupils who have received primary class instruction may put C. S. (Christian Scientist) after their names, and many list themselves in the Christian Science Journal as prac- titioners. There are some 6500 practi- tioners in the United States, with another 1500 or so distributed around the world. Not all who take class instruction become practitioners, and some who practice do so only part-time. After three years of successful full- time practice, practitioners may apply for the Normal Course, which is given only once every three years to a limited number of pupils under the auspices of the Christian Science Board of Education, which continues the work of Mrs. Eddy's original Massachusetts Metaphysical Col- lege (formally dissolved in 1889). The Normal Course lasts six days, costs one hundred dollars, and merits the degree C.S.B. (Bachelor of Chrisitan Science). A graduate of the Normal Class is certified as a "teacher" and may give primary class instruction to not more than thirty pupils once a year. According to Braden: bIn actual practice there is very little 4 Wilson, 1961, p. 166.</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIAN SCIENCE HEALING 177 difference, if any, between the Primary and Normal class teaching, as can be readily discovered by reading tran- scripts of both Normal and Primary classes given by the leading teachers. An objective study indicates that the Normal class serves chiefly as a re- fresher course, bringing back into line any who might be harboring unorthodox ideas, and is probably far more val- uable as a control mechanism than for educational purposes." Nevertheless, "certification is a privilege greatly cov- eted."5 Class instruction of practitioners has always been surrounded by secrecy despite the fact that in principle any Christian Scientist can educatehimself solely through study of the Bible, Science and Health, and other Christian Science texts. For example, note-taking in class has been either forbidden or severely restricted. Discussion of theological questions other than with one's teacher or at meetings of the "association" of students of one's teacher is discouraged. The mystique of class instruction serves to heighten stu- dent's emotional involvement in the training, to prevent open dissension re- garding official doctrine, and to protect individual teachers from official re- prisals for minor divergencies from doc- trinal purity.6 In addition, less publicized subjects are covered which are con- sidered vital for the practitioner. For example, "teachers are required to teach pupils to defend themselves 'against malpractice'."7 The possibility of "men- tal malpractice" is a logical extension of Christian Science's emphasis on the real- ity of mind and thought. Just as a practi- tioner's thought can produce benefit for a person, so also, if not handled carefully, it can do evil, intentionally or unintentional- 5 Charles S.

When intentional, it is "malicious men- tal malpractice," or M. A. M. ("malicious animal magnetism"), which is what Mrs. Eddy blamed as the source of her own bodily ills in her latest years, post- ing aides as mental guardians near her bedside to serve tours of duty protect- ing her from the mental attacks of her presumed enemies.8 (Her secretary re- ports that she made him promise to say after her death that she had been "mentally murdered.") Braden states that although M. A. M. may be "less emphasized in the present day, . . . it has not disappeared by any means."9 The student "comes more and more to the conclusion that correct handling of ani- mal magnetism is the real crux of Chris- tian Science practice. . . One prayer ... is certainly taught to many class-in- structed students at some time; it is a form of 'handling' error, part of the individual's 'defensive work,' and typical of several such statements which Chris- tian Scientists use as semi-esoteric de- vices of protection: 'Malicious animal magnetism does not know where I am or what I am doing: it does not know God's plan or purpose for me, nor the work that God has given me to do; nor can it perpet- uate any lies about me; for 1 live, move and have my being in God, in Spirit, in the secret place of the Most High'."10 Such techniques for countering the ef- fects of malicious mental malpractice are as close to using white magic to negate witchcraft as one is likely to find in the educated circles of Western culture. Thorner, in fact, concludes that "Chris- tian Science is a set of magical prac- tices.""n Class instruction is entirely metaphys- ical or spiritual. The course in "Meta- 8 Edwin F.

"Destroy the belief and the sensation disappears. "13 According to Braden there are actually "three levels of practice. "14 The first level involves overt "affirmation and denial," con- frontation of false belief with vigorous audible argument as to man's inner perfection. "The practitioner must ascer- tain the type of ailment, even get its name" and conform his argument to the particular part of the body which is "er- roneously" believed to be diseased. In the early days physical manipulation of head and solar plexus was also some- times used to produce "a state of recep- tivity," since, as Mrs. Eddy said, be- cause the belief to be rubbed out is located in the brain, "you lay your hands where the belief is to rub it out forever. " At the second level strictly mental (i.e., inaudible) argument is introduced. The patient is silently told that he is well and he knows it. This mode of treatment does not require house calls if the metaphysical problem of thought transference is resolved, which is easily accomplished since all is mind and since space is only a false belief. Silent con- tact with the patient's consciousness is known as "addressing the thought" and ordinarily should be done only with the person's formal consent; otherwise it constitutes "mental malpractice." A con- scientious practitioner avoids "promis- cuous mental treatment." M. A. M. is presumably used only by the enemies 12 Braden, pp. 101-102. 18 Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston: Christian Science Publishing Society, 1934. 14 Braden, pp. 336-355. of Christian Science, never by true mem- bers of the faith. At the third level of treatment the practitioner works at self-correction rath- er than at correcting the patient. "The patient is healed not when he sees the truth, but when the practitioner sees it." This stage, called "impersonal treatment," is not attained by all practitioners. Although approved doctrine states that there must be a response by the patient for "impersonal work" to be effective, those who work at this level believe that if the practitioner is thoroughly persuaded in his own mind of the truth, the patient is thereby healed. Such a metaphysical position eliminates some of the difficulties involved in Christian science dualism (e.g., between perfect truth and mortal error) and the require- ment for thought transference. However, it also tends to become solipsism in which the patient recedes in importance and the therapist himself becomes the recipient of treatment. One Christian Science ad- vocate of impersonal treatment states: "It does not matter what someone else is thinking, but it does matter what I am thinking. What is going on is pure Mind-my Mind. And all that appears to be going on will undergo redemption if, called to a case, I know that the only man there is is already well.... You correct belie! through divine real- ization-a wholly impersonal operation. Where else could you correct it but where it is appearing-which is where you are and what you are thinking? . . . The practitioner arrives at this point, where nothing is left but divine Mind declaring its own divinity."15 Even if this third level of treatment is not attained by all practitioners, it throws much light on the function and meaning of the healing role for the Christian Science practitioner at any level. It thus may provide a better clue to understanding the meaning of 15 Ibid., pp. 351-352.</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIAN SCIENCE HEALING 179 Christian Science healing than will study of the social and psychological charac- teristics of Christian Science patients and believers, since practitioners appear to possess to a higher degree the charac- teristics of the rank and file. Certainly the spread of Christian Science as a re- ligious movement has largely resulted from the tireless dedication of teachers and practitioners motivated to propagate the faith throughout the United States and to most other parts of the world as well. But the social characteristics of those affiliated with the movement have un- doubtely also been important, as has been the striking compatibility between the practical, this-wordly ethos of Chris- tian Science and the American middle- class ethic, particularly that of the late nineteenth century. All observers agree that the center of social gravity of Christian Science has been in the urban middle classes.16 It is not difficult to see why "manual workers, factory workers, the poor and the uneducated are not drawn to Christian Science, which demands something of a will- ingness to attribute poverty to the wrong set of mental attitudes."117 "To paraphrase Marx, it is an opiate for those whose lives are already sheltered," DeNood comments.'s Less obvious per- haps is its emphasis on the self-reliant individual rather than on supplicating an anthropomorphic God. Thorner notes that Christian Science "rejects the tra- ditional idea of prayer .... God is a principle, not a person.... The In- dividual must act to improve himself, not depend on God."' "It is only- verbally that the literature describes man as submissive to and dependent onthe will of an omnipotent supernatural person- ality, while verbally and In action the believer proceeds upon the other view, 16 Cf. DeNood, Thorner, Wilson, opera cit. 17 Wilson, 1961, p. 201. 18 DeNood, p. 302. that this 'personality' is an impersonal force which is at man's disposal." He concludes that, "Christian Science is the polar development of ascetic Protestant tendencies toward the transformation of the omnipotent and transcendental per- sonal God of the Old Testament into a dependable impersonal and immanent force available for man's disposal." The net result is a "thoroughly self-reliant and responsible ... type" of person who di- rects his energies in a pragmatic, this- worldly direction. "The most obvious common element is the empirical nature of the benefits achieved: sickness, loneli- ness, poverty, oppression, alcoholism, un- happy social and business relations. . ."19 Fifty years ago Janet observed that Christian Science had "an eminently practical character, well adapted to please persons of an ambitious and active type and whose main concern was with material success. It is not a religion for weaklings and repiners.... Christian Science has a message of joy for all; it exalts health, vanity, and material prosperity, as lofty virtues.... It thus ministers to the sense of satis- faction and well-being characteristic of the prosperous classes of the United States."20 These interpretations seem some- what incompatible with the "wishful mysticism" which Wilson attributes to Christian Science.21 The key question relates to the nature of the means employed to achieve Chris- tian Science goals. In particular, how does Christian Science cure? Janet states that "the patient must be made to feel contempt for his disease; must be convinced that his disease is neither dangerous nor important; that the disease is nothing, that he himself, the patient, is great, a superior being, able to con- 19 Thomner, pp. 327-336. 20 Pierre Janet, Psychological Healing (trans. by Eden and Cedar Paul), New York: Mac- millan, 1925, p. 88. 21 Wilson, 1959.</page><page sequence="6">180 CHRISTIAN SCIENCE HEALING quer this contemptible malady. "22 But how is this accomplished? "It has been estimated that sickness, suffering, sin, and death are denied at least three thousand times in the pages of Science and Health."23 Similarly, during treatment the patient is told, or tells himself, over and over again that sickness is not real and that he is well and whole. Such ritualistically repeated denial of objective reality must carry great meaning not only for the patient but for the participating practitioner as well, espe- cially at the third level of practice where there is an unmistakable tendency for even the reality of the patient to be denied and for attention to shift to what happens in the practitioner's mind. Denial probably occurs at several different psychological levels. The prac- titioner denies his own weaknesses and inadequacies and finds opportunities to treat them nurturantly in patients. Any Christian Scientist who insists on man's inner perfection, goodness and spiritual- ity, in effect denies his own aggressive (and other) impulses, which he may then project, according to well known psychodynamic mechanisms, onto others who are perceived as dangerous. Mali- cious animal magnetism (referred to, quaintly enough, as "the big red dragon") resembles nothing so much as delusions of persecution by imaginary enemies. De- nial, repression and projection to the "outside" of all hostility, sickness, and evil is a tenuous psychodynamic "so- lution" that needs continual reinforce- ment by repetitious denial of the reality of evil. The mask-like composure of many Christian Scientists, especially not- able in practitioners, is perhaps related to such denial and projection. Psycho- logical suggestion appears merely to sup- plement and intensify these basic proc- esses. Lacking group ceremonials and the emotional ecstasy usually present in 22 Janet, p. 84. 2 Wilson, 1961, p. 129. faith healing, Christian Science intellec- tualizes denial through an abstract and impersonal metaphysics. The reason why Christian Science sug- gestion achieves denial so effectively seems to be that ritualistic repetition of a plau- sible intellectual argument is particularly congenial to middle class persons so- cialized to repress and deny impulses. If the technique works, as if often does, it provides its own justification. If it fails, alternative explanations are avail- able: "(1) The technique has not been employed accurately or one's life has not been wholly impeccable . .; (2) God is a person who in His wisdom withholds that which is asked, knowing that it would not be for the best interest of the Christian Scientist. This explana- tion ... relieves the individual of ulti- mate responsibility for his failure."24 However, such explanations probably only partially relieve the unconscious feelings of depression and guilt believed to re- sult from repression and denial of basic impulses. According to theoretical spec- ulation,25 such depression and guilt may be causally related to the high incidence of deaths from cancer reported to exist among Christian Scientists.26 Women have always played an es- pecially prominent role in Christian Science, both as leaders and as members; and they have nearly monopolized Chris- tian Science healing. In 1953 seventy- seven percent of all full-time practi- tioners were married women and another eleven percent were single women, a 24 Thorner, pp. 333-334. 25 WV. A. Greene, Jr., L. E. Young, and S.

Mary Baker Eddy re- ferred to herself as "a God-like woman, God-anointed,"28 and evidently consi- dered herself the feminine representative in Christianity equivalent to Jesus as the masculine representative. A most significant fact is the reference to "Fa- ther-Mother-God" contained in the re- writing of the Lord's Prayer for Chris- tian Science use. Identification of the church as feminine is not unusual, for symbolically the church can be a mother as well as a pillar of strength ("rock of ages"); but the feminine emphasis seems strongest of all in Christian Scd- ence-in its founder, in its theology, in its practitioners, and in its overt rep- etition of loving sentiments in inter- personal relationships. Emphasis on the gentle, more feminine virtues Is cer- tainly consistent with the denial of 27 Wilson, 1961, p. 173. 28 Braden, p. 359. evil of all sorts In the world and with repression of more masculine, aggressive sorts of behavior. And both are com- mon in those strata in which Christian Science has attained its greatest success, the urban American middle class in which, as Mead and Gorer have asserted, there is unusual psychological dependence of men on women and considerable con- fusion over sex roles generally." Thus far scientific studies of Christian Science have dealt mainly with such ex- ternal factors as the growth of the movement and the social background of its adherents, paying little attention to the personal meaning of its therapy. The way in which their religiously structured attitudes toward health and sickness interrelate with the social and per- sonality characteristics of Christian Sci- ence patients and practitioners should be the focus of future empirical research on Christian Science healing. 29 Geoffrey Gorer, The American People, New York: Norton, 1948; Margaret Mead, Male and Female, New York: Morrow, 1949.</page></plain_text>
