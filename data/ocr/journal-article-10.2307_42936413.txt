<plain_text><page sequence="1">Physical ani Earth Sciences ani Archaeology G. G. Mujumdar The beginnings of ' Archaeological Chemistry ' as an impor- tant branch of the Archaeological Survey of India date back to 1917. In the early years much of the work of this branch consisted of chemical preservation of monuments and paintings. To a lesser extent this branch was called into service when archaeologists felt the necessity of getting materials and objects recovered from exca- vations chemically analysed. Even then, nothing more than giving the analysis asked for was attempted. The studies by Marshall and Mackay in the wake of their excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Chanhu-daro clearly break a new ground. Their researches in the technology of the Harappans open- ed new possibilities and imparted an altogether new significance to what even now continues to be termed, rather euphemistically, ' Arch- aeological Chemistry For, as matters stand today, it is more an application of the various physical and earth sciences to archaeolo- gical investigations and problems. Thus we have specialists dealing with pedology, sedimentology, minerology and petrology, geomor- phology and geology, technology, whereas at a much higher and speci- alised level physicists are using their knowledge and techniques to give us carbon- 14 dates, thermoluminiscence calculations and so on. The latter sciences are not so much in the picture in India as the former ones. The major achievement of the period under consideration can therefore be summed up as a steady but definite change in archaeo- logical methodology, from the purely comparative, deductive to the inductive. Stone Tool Techniques- Prehistoric Techniques : Sankalia has studied and described the techniques prevalent during the Stone Age ( Sankalia 1964, 1970 ). The Stone tool tech- niques and their development in India do not differ from those from the rest of the world although the two may not be contemporary. B-ll</page><page sequence="2">154 G. G. Mujumdar Although there is no clearcut stratigraphical development in the flaking of stone tools in India, it is generally agreed that the earliest of the most wide-spread techniques is the ' Block-on-Block technique ' which is best evidenced on the Narmada in M. P., the Sohan in the Punjab and the Liddar in Kashmir in Early and Middle Pleistocene periods. Simultaneously ' Stone-Hammer Technique ' Controlled or Step-Method Technique ' and ' Cylinder Hammer Technique ' were practised in various parts of India. The ' Prepared core and platform ' technique was in use all over India in the closing stages of Early Stone Age and during the whole of the Middle Stone Age. In addition Sankalia noticed the occasional use of the following techniques in Early and Middle Stone Age cultures but regularly in the Upper Palaeolithic culture of India. ( a ) Blade-flake Technique. ( b ) Crested Ridge " ( c ) Pressure Flake " ( Sankalia 1964 : 33-47 ) As regards the grinding and polishing techniques Sankalia carried out experiments in preparing a polished stone axe resembling the Neolithic polished axes encountered in all the major neolithic cultures of India. ( Sankalia 1964 : 106-107 ). Sankalia further put these prepared axes to actual use, in cutting Babul ( Acacia ) trees, after proper hafting. All these technological studies have con- firmed or modified the earlier ideas as regards the preparation and use of these polished axes. During his tenure as Jawaharlal Nehru Fellow, ( 1968-1971 ) Sankalia further extended his studies in the technology of the stone tools, with the help of Ansari, when the various stone tools, especia- lly the Acheulian hand axes of the Early Stone Age period and scra- pers, borers, points, engravers etc. of the Middle Stone Age period of India were put to various actual uses viz. killing an animal, cutt- ing the flesh and removing the skin, scraping off flesh and hair from the skin and boring a hole into it etc. as also for cutting and boring wood. These studies enabled Sankalia to understand the functional role of the stone tools of Prehistoric India, an aspect very much negl- ected so far ( Sankalia 1970 b )</page><page sequence="3">Physical and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 155 Stone Tool Techniques : Proto historic Techniques. Although the prepartion and the use of stone tools continued in the Chalcolithic and Neolithic periods of India, the types of the tools and the extent of their use were much limited in the earlier stages and gradually declined as Metal Technology, mainly of Copper and its alloys, advanced and copper tools with much sup :rior mecha- nical properties, became more and more easily available for use. The stone tools which were prevalent during the earlier stages of the Protohistoric period were the Neolithic polished stone axes predominantly in the South and Chalcolithic Blades and Flakes in the Deccan and Malwa. The techniques used in the manufacture of these stone tools have already been mentioned earlier. Pottery and. Terracotta Techniques : Protohistoric Period A large amount of ceramic material is available in India, archaeologically both in space and time, for typological and techni- cal studies, to enable one to draw inferences as regards the techniques of their manufacture and the mode of their use. Most of the studies on this material have been of a typological nature and much remains to be done on the scientific and technological side of these materials and objects. Those limited scientific and technical studies that have been undertaken so far have enabled us to understand the following aspects of their technologies. Among the pottery making techniques prevalent in proto- historic period, the following may be mentioned : ( a ) Hand made, using the Dabber and Platter technique ( b ) Mould technique. ( c ) Coiling and vessel- wall building techniques. ( d ) Turn-table ( Tournette ) technique. ( e ) Wheel technique, including the foot wheel and regular hand-spun wheel ( and also combination of wheel made and hand made ) . Out of these, the most wide-spread techniques, both in time and space, are the dabber and platter technique, mould technique, the regular hand-spun-wheel, and also a combination of wheel and Dabber-Platter techniques. Examples of all these three techniques are encountered in archaeological excavations carried out in India right from pre-Harappan period to historic times.</page><page sequence="4">156 G. G. Mttjumdar A good evidence of hand - made pottery techniques comes from a systematic study of Baluchistan pottery by Fairservis ( 1956, 1961 ). Mackay infers that the foot- wheel-technique was employed in making pottery at Mohenjo-daro (Mackay 1938, 1943). Use of the wheel - throwing technique is amply evidenced in Pre-Hara- ppan, Harappan and Post-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures of Rajasth- an, Central India, Gangetic basin, Deccan etc. (Sankalia, 1970-a ). Clay-working and Tempering Clay forms the chief raw material in the preparation of any type of earthenware and the quality of clay of any particular region is clearly reflected in the fabric of pottery made out of it irrespective of the period in which it was made. The main steps in the use of clay are : - 1. levigation processes which remove the coarser fraction, and/or 2. addition of organic or inorganic materials to temper i. e. to improve the quality of the clay so as to m^ke it suitable for good pottery making. These tempering materials in ancient Indian pottery have been found to consist of finely commuted grass or cereal husk, cow-or horse-dung, sand - grains or the crushed pottery grit. The nature of the exact material used depends upon the quality of clay employed and also on the potter's tradition. As regards the colour of the ware, the final product of the kiln will exhibit various shades of red in the oxidising type of firing depend- ing upon the iron-contents of the clay and the temperatures reached in the kiln. If the original clay is poor in iron, the vessel is given a slip of iron-rich fine clay to impart a bright red colour to its surface in the oxidising atmosphere of the kiln. The reducing or smoky atmosphere yields vessels with black colour which results from reduced iron oxide as well as from smoke particles. Both Mackay ( 1938, 1943 ) and Sankalia ( 1970-a ) have studied and discussed this aspect, in detail, while investigating ancient Indian pottery. In addition to colour various techniques of decorating the surface of pottery were in vogue in preparing ancient pottery. Thus painting ( Black-on-Red, white-on-Black, White-on-Red, Polych- rome on red. etc. ), incised designs, perforated patterns and grafitti formed the main techniques.</page><page sequence="5">Physical and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 157 In addition to the possible widespread use of open firing techni- ques, specially designed and built kilns appear to have been employed for firing ancient pottery. Mackay has discovered the remains of such a specially built round kiln with a separate fire chamber and a heating chamber at Mohenjo-daro to fire Harappan pottery. ( Mackay 1938 ). In the same context Rao has described a similar kiln in the Lothal excavations ( Rao 1962, 1963, 1964 ) Recent excavations at Inamgaon in Dist. Poona have brought to light the remains of a pottery kiln encountered in the Chalcolithic Jorwe phase of the Deccan. The kiln is like a huge trough embedded in ground and thus appears to be built in situ. Its maximum diame- ter is 1 * 7 m. and at a depth of 60 cms from the top level were found clay cushions, placed over the fire chamber lined with stones. The clay cushions are oval in shape with a groove in the middle of each side and a hole in the centre which served as an outlet for the hot gases. In the lowest portion of the kiln were flues or air ducts. To the North-East of the kiln was the fire passage which reached below the bottom of the baking chamber of the kiln. The passage was lined and covered with stones. ( Dhavalikar 1973 ). A variety of pottery fabrics is encountered in the archaeolo- gical finds.. The important ones with the special technological feature of each are listed below : - Sr. Ware Period Region No. 1. The Black-and-Red Ware ( Protohistoric- All over India. Historic ) 2. The Painted Grey Ware Iron Age Rajasthan, U. P. Punjab. 3. The Northern Black " Eastern U. P. . Polished Ware. " and Bihar. 4. The Red Polished Ware Indo-Roman Deccan, South, etc., 5. The Lustrous Red Ware Chalcolithic Gujarat, ( Rangpur ) ( Saurashtra ) . 6. The Ochre-Coloured Chalcolithic Punjab, U. P. Pottery Rajasthan, etc. Out of this list only the Black-and-Red Ware and the Northern Black Polished Ware, have been studied in some detail to</page><page sequence="6">158 G. G. Mujumdar yield clues regarding the special techniques employed in their preparation to impart the typical surface characteristics to the respective fabrics. The present writer has studied the techniques involved in the preparation of Black-and-Red Ware. His studies have brought to light the following facts about the techique of this important fabric. 1. that the method of inverted firing supposed to have been used for producing this pottery appears to be hypothetical and almost impossible to be practised. 2. the Ware can be produced by three different methods. But Simultaneous Redox Firing ( i. e. creating oxidising and reducing atmosphere in the same kiln ) is common to all. In the first method, the pot is subjected to the Simultaneous Redox method in a single firing to yield the desired effect. In the second and third methods, the entire pot is fired red or black respectively in the first firing and the fired pot is further subjected to second firing under Simultaneous Redox conditions to yield duel coloured effect, quite similar to the ancient pottery (Mujumdar, 1968). Another important pottery fabric to receive the attention of the scientists is the Northern Black Polished Ware which is known as the de-lux pottery of ancient India. This fabric because, of its chronological, technological and cultural position, has been subjected to intense study by several scholars in India and abroad. Scholars hold differing opinions about the nature of the luster on the surface of this fabric. Bhardwaj carried out experiments to understand the nature of the lustrous slip covering the surface of this fabric and felt that the lustrous black colour was mainly due to carbon and that neither ferr- ous silicate as suggested by Sanaullah ( 1946 ) and Lai ( Dr. ) ( Lai 1954-55, ) nor magnetic oxide as asserted by Hegde (1966) is respon- sible for this colour. Bharadwaj also could not find any evidence of post-firing application of organic nļaterial as was thought by Lai ( 1947-48 ). He further felt that the lustrous effect results from the application of well levigated emulsion of refined clay and organic liquid ( say plant juices ) over the dried pots before firing; the slid</page><page sequence="7">Physical and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 159 after drying, carbonised daring firing under reduced conditions, with- out burning out completely. This resulted in a uniform lustrous black surface ( Bharadwaj 1969 ). This view is also shared by Sanau- llah and Lai ( Sanaullah 1946 ; Lai ( Dr. ) Lai 1954-55). Hegde carried out analytical and electron-microscopical studies on this important fabric. He further attempted to copy this fabric by employing the knowledge obtained through his studies and claimed a fair success in his attempt. ( Hegde 1962, 1966, 1972-b ). His analytical studies revealed that the slip is relatively more magnetic because of magnetic oxide of iron in the slip. He felt that this magnetic oxide, produced during firing under reducing conditions was responsible for the black colour. According to him a fine clay was prepared by the addition of alkali, say crude soda ash, and applied to the surface and fired in reducing atmosphere resulting in the typical black surface characteristic of the NBP. His electron microscopic studies supported his thesis about the materials used in the production of the NBP Ware, the precise nature of its slip and the factors responsible for its coal-black colour and the glossy surface finish. In view of the differing claims about the nature of the lustrous surface, Sankalia felt that the problem of NBP still remains unsolved ( Sankalia, 1970-a, p. 21 ). Of the remaining fabrics, the Painted Grey Ware, which is an important group of pottery, culturally, chronologically as well as technologically, is a wheel made pottery with well baked thin walls and made from well levigated clay possibly without any temper add- tion. It is not known by what technique, so uniform a grey colour inside outside and throughout the body was imparted to this crucial ware ( Lai. 1954-55 : 32 ). Although Sanaullah ( 1934-35 : 88 ) attributes the typical grey colour of such potteries ( his studies are based on the Shahi Tump Grey Ware alone ) to the presence of black ferrous oxide produced by the action of reducing gases, the question remains as to how to create such reducing conditions in the kiln to yield a uniform grey fabric.. The Ochre Coloured Pottery often mentioned in connection with the Copper Hoards and the PGW of U. P. is also an interesting group and it has been studied by Lai ( Lai 1969 ). Various ceramic</page><page sequence="8">160 G. G. Mujumdar materials other than Pottery and including Glazes and Glass have also become the subject of technical and scientific studies ( Lai 1952-a, 1952-b, 1953, 1954-55; Dikshit 1969). Very little technological work has been done on the ancient Indian terracottas, Sankalia has studied the problem of Indian Terracottas and has inferred about the techniques after Mackay (Sankalia. 1970-a : 26; Mackay in Marshall, 1931, I, 349). The problem is worthy of further study. ( Sankalia and Dhavalikar 1969). In the field of bead making, there is evidence of the knowledge of producing a variety of them from various natural materials like bones, ivory, shells, semi-precious stones and other minerals. Sankalia who studied this problem mentions that the techni- que of preparing bangles from Conch-shell in modern India is descri- bed by Hornell and inferred by Mackay ( Sankalia. 1970-a, : 36-37 ; Mackay in Marshall. 1931-11 : 564 ; Hornell. 1918 : 433-48 ). The beads of bones, ivory, teeth and shells have been variously encountered in the excavations at Langhnaj ( N. Gujarat), (Sankalia. 1965 ; Agrawal et al. 1969 : 188 ) Lothai ( Rao 1963 : 147 ) ; Mohenjo- daro (Mackay in Marshall. 1931 : I. p. 84) and Harappa (Vats 1940 : 433 ). Sankalia has further discussed the technique of producing stone beads ( Sankalia, 1970 : 38-43 ). In this connection he mentions the discovery of a workshop for making stone beads by Mackay at Chanhu-daro where the latter came across various stages of stone bead preparation, the copper/bronze bead drills etc. revealing the most probable technique of stone bead manufacture ( Mackay. 1943 : 211 ). Rao mentions the production of carnelian, as raw material for beads, by baking agate and the etching process of the etched beads as a good evidence of the Lothal lapideri's knowledge of the chemical process resulting in the desired effect ( Rao 1973 ). Similarly, Tosi ( 1969 ) in his excavations at Shahr-i-Sokhta came across a squat Buff Ware jar found buried in the most ancient floor of period Il-a. This jar was sealed completely with a block of clay that preserved the perishable contents from deterioration. Among the contents of the jar were found : -</page><page sequence="9">Physical and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 161 Three pieces of Canes, serving as containers for the rough-outs of the beads of various semi-precious stones, seven cylinderical beads of Lapis Lazuli completely smoothened but unperforated, thirty-five chips of Carnelian, cu,t into rectangular facets with contours that were still irregular, ten splinters of green chalcedony with touched up edges, three basalt pebbles probably serving as hammers and poli- shers, six rectangular wooden tablets bored in the centre by a series of holes with diffierent diameters ( these were obviously supports for the beads while drilling ), a bow-drill composed of a wooden shaft held perpendicular by a stone handle which with a bow-string wound round it made it rotate at every movement of the hand, could bore into the necklace beads with a stone tip-flint, quartzite, porphyry etc. Thus, the excavator was able to reconstruct almost the entire process of working beads for the necklace. The buried deposit, the large number of drill heads, the presence of Lapis-Lazuli, Carne- lian, Turquoise and Green Chalcedony greater in wasters than in the finished product ( less than 10% )- all this seemed to be evidence that the city was centre for working semi-precious stones and the production of necklace beads and other decorative elements. Dikshit has reviewed in detail the three techniques, still pre- valent in Sind, of making etched carnelian beads. The white patterns on the red surface were obtained by making a thick liquid of potash, white lead and the juice of Kiral bush ( Capparis aphylla ), which was applied directly with pen on Carnelian bead. After heating on char- coal fire the white design left by juice becomes permanent. ( Dikshit 1949). Sankalia has also discussed the faience and steatite bead technology ( Sankalia 1970-a : 42-45 ). Metal Technology : Protohistoric and Early Historic Period Coming to the metallurgical and metal working techniques the earliest evidence comes from the three principal sites of Harappan Civilization in addition to a few other sites in Baluchistan and the unstratified Copper Hoards from the Punjab, U. P. and Bihar regions. Similarly several Chalcolithic sites from different parts of India have yielded specimens of copper/bronze artefacts ( Sankalia. 1970-a ; Agrawal. 1968, 1971 Sanaullah in Vats, 1940, I, : 379-80 ; Rao. 1962 ; Hegde, 1965 ; Hegde in Sankalia et al 1969, : 228 ). All</page><page sequence="10">162 G. G. Mujumdar these studies have produced a better understanding of the metall- urgical and metal working practices existing at different sites and periods in India. Sankalia ( 1970-a, 45-58 ) has grouped them as follows : - 1. Sites in West Asia, Iran ( Agrawal 1968); ( 1971 ) Afganistan, ( Casal, 1961 ) ; Baluchistan ( de Cardi, 1965 ), from where the earliest evidence of metallurgical techniques comes and is believed to have spread to East and West by about 5000 B. C. 2. Pre-Harappan and Harappan sites from Sind, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat regions ( Lai and Thapar 1967 ; Mackay in Marshall, 1931, Rao. 1962, 1963 and 1973, Sankalia 1970-a, pp. 45-58 ; Vats 1940, I. 379-380). 3. Other sites of Chalcolithic period in M. P. ; Rajasthan ; Maharashtra; Andhra Pradesh ; Mysore; Madras ; Uttar- Pradesh ; Bihar; West Bengal ( Sankalia 1970-a, 46-47 ). The main problems involved in the technology of extracting Copper Bronze from their mineral raw materials and putting them to useful purpose by giving the extracted metal typical form/shape are, 1 . The knowledge and the availability of the various copper bearing, and also tin-bearing minerals usually referred to as ores. 2. The knowledge of extracting metal ( smelting ) in crude form and then refining the same including alloying it with suitable metal and finally, 3. The knowledge of shaping or forming the extracted/ alloyed metal to useful tools, implements and weapons. All this information about the knowledge of the ancients regarding the metals has to be derived from the relevant materials recovered from archaeological excavations and explorations. Such useful materials are : 1. Metal objects, finished or unfinished, metal lumps or ingots ; the former being the chief source. 2. Metal ores, very very rare. 3. Metallurgical or metal working bye-products such as slags ; left over fluxes, fuels, ashes etc. which are usually rare, and</page><page sequence="11">Physical and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 163 4. Apparatus, and equipment used in extracting or shaping the metal objects such as furnaces ; ovens, crucibles, tongs and the like. 5. Also helpful is the exploration and study or ancient metal workings in the neighbourhood of excavated sites. All the relevant metallurgical information is obtained by a scientific and technological study of one or more relevant materials listed above. The main approaches to the scientific studies are : 1. Chemical Analyses These yield the percentage of the chief metal, copper, and also of the alloying metals if any. In addition some useful informa- tion is also obtained as regards the impurity or trace elements pattern, from the metal body, slag and ore. 2. Spectrometric Analyses These also yield the quantitative data regarding the main metal, alloying metal, and most important the trace element or impurity pattern characteristic of the metal, ore or the slag. In both the methods, the correlation of the impurity pattern of the metal either with the ore body or the slag or with both found in the site or in the vicinity helps in locating the source of the metal. 3. Metallographic Analyses A thin section of the metal or metal-ore studied under a metallurgical microscope, after proper polishing and etching proce- dure, reveals the mode of fabrication of the metal object like, cast- ing, cold forging, hot forging, annealing etc. 4. Additional Sophisticated Methods, both destructive and non- destructive, are also available for the study of metals although their use on Indian material is very limited because of the non-availability of the equipment. The scientific study of Copper Bronze objects, slags etc. found at the sites grouped earlier, as based on modern methods has enabled us to gather a good deal of metallurgical information by way of not only the metallurgical practices but to some extent the source of copper. Following are the important scientific studies carried out on Indian metallic antiquities and related materials, responsible</page><page sequence="12">164 G. G. Mujumdar for yielding the above metallurgical knowledge. Lai ( Dr. ) 1947, 1951, 1956 ; Bharadwaj 1965-66, 1966, 1968, 1968-69-a, 1968-69-b, 1969, 1970, 1972 Bharadwaj, et al , 1968, 1969 Hegde ( 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969 1971-a 1971-b, 1972-a, 1973 ) ; Bhowmik ( 1972 ) ; Agrawal ( 1968, 1971 ) ; Mujumdar and Rajaguru ( 1963 ) ; Sanaullah in Mackay ( 1938, 1943 ). Apart from Copper/Bronze, some evidence is also available about the other coinage metals like Gold, Silver, and alloys like Electrum from the Deccan Chalcolithic ( I AR 1958-59 : 18 ) ; Neolithic South ( Allchin 1962 ; Nagaraja Rao and Malhotra 1965 and Mohenjo-daro ( Marshall 1931, p. 524 ). A very recent example has come from Inamgaon ( Sankalia, 1973 ). All these examples indicate the knowledge and use of precious metals in the Chalcolithic periods in the North Deccan and South respectively. As regards Iron metallurgy in India, the problem is well summarised by Bannerji ( 1965 ). The important scientific studies on Iron technology in India include those of Hegde ( 1973 ) who carried out analytical studies of the stratified material remains of the iron smelting industry of the Early Historic period recently excavated at Dhatwa ( Gujarat ) which have yielded interesting results as regards the ore and the smelting processes as well as metal fabrication, and that of Bharadwaj ( 1972 ) who has also studied and discussed the aspects of Early Iron Technology in India after a careful analysis of iron objects and slags from Rajghat ( U. P. ) excavations datable to 600-400 B. C. Apart from metallurgical and metal working practices some archaeological evidence is also available for other chemical practices existing in early times. These practices include, calcining and slak- ing of lime, preparation and use of mortar and cementing materials, preparation of fermented juices, production, refining and use of pigments, production of glazes and glasses of different varieties etc. ( Marshall, 1931, Pt. I and II ; Mackay, 1943 ; Vats, 1940 ; Sankalia, 1970-a ). Bone and Ivory Tools : Protohistoric Period Besides bone and ivory beads, which are already discussed earlier, occasionally a few tools or implements of stone are found in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements of the Deccan. In the</page><page sequence="13">Phy steal and Earth Sciences and Archaeology 165 Neolithic at Burzahom in Kashmir, some fine bone objects have been discovered (I. A. R. 1961-62 : 19). Such bone objects have also been found at Chirand in Bihar and sites in U. P. near Delhi besides those discovered at Betamcherla in Kurnool district ( A. P. ) . A few implements made on Bone/Ivory have been noticed at Mohenjo- daro in Harappan context ( Mackay, 1938, p. 431 ) but at Harappa a comparatively larger number has been discovered ( Vats 1940 : 459 ) . A number of elephant tusks were found at the later excava- tions at Mohenjo-daro ( Mackay 1938 : 579 ) as well as a single tusk at Chanhu-daro ( Mackay 1943 ). Very recently at Inamgaon a small tusk was found embedded in a small pit in Deccan Chalco- lithic (Jorwe) context ( Sankalia 1973 ). These discoveries imply the production and use of ivory objects during the Harappan and Chalcolithic periods in the North and the Deccan. Techniques and Preservation of Paintings A good number of cave-paintings belonging to Prehistoric, Protohistoric and Early Historic periods have been brought to light in the last fifty years or so in various parts of India by various scholars ( Carlleyle, 1883 ; Cockburn 1883 ; Gordon 1958 ; Varma 1964 ; Pande, 1968; or Ansari and Nagaraja Rao 1964-65). Much more known are the paintings belonging to the Early Historic period from different parts of India, notably from Ajanta in Maha- rashtra State and Bagh caves in Madhya Pradesh. Lai and others of the Archaeological Survey of India have been engaged for a long time in studying and executing preservative measures of these important cave paintings (Lai. (Dr.) 1967, 1970). Bhowmik has also studied the problem of ancient paintings in detail ( Bhowmik 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970-a ; 1970-b). Important discoveries and investigations have been made by Wakankar in the Bhopal region of Madhya Pradesh. Accord- ing to Wakankar, the medium for preparing pigmented paint material was water and not oil or fat like some of the European cave paintings. In some cases it has been observed that a milky juice exuding from some trees ( Dudhi, a local name ) has also been used as a medium but such paintings in course of time become black because of fungus growth. The main pigments used in Prehistoric paintings are Terre verte ( Green ), Haematite ( red ), Yellow Ochre ( Yellow ), Ground Kankar ( dirty white ) etc.</page><page sequence="14">166 G. G. Mujumdar Protohistoric cave paintings were quite similar to the Prehis- toric ones as far as the materials and practices are concerned. In the Historic period Red Ochre for bright red, Burnt Lime for bright white and Lapis Lazuli for blue were used. Sometimes, the use of black in the form of finely powdered charcoal is also observed (Wakankar 1963-a, 1963-b, 1963-c, 1965, 1973 ). The main scientific problems involved in the study of such paintings can be grouped as follows : - 1 . Recognition of the existence of different layers of paintings of different periods. 2. Study of extensive deterioration caused by weathering and leaching in the form of flaking of pigments and accre- tion of dust, dirt and smoke particles. 3. Investigations of the practices involved in the execution of these paintings as well as of the chemical materials used (Lai, (Dr.) 1958 : 204-205). 4. Study of the preservative treatment for the same. The above discussion indicates that the Prehistoric and Protohistoric painters had the basic knowledge of the materials and practices of painting and they exploited the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms for these materials, which also form the chief source, even to-day, apart from the synthetic ones, for the modern painter.
