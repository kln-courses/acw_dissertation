Traducciones cotejadas de la version castellana: Francesa: R. Le Deaut, Inglesa: M. McNamara y M. Maher. Lugares paralelos a Deuteronomio de Pseudojonatan y Neophyti 1: Ε. B. Levine. Consejo Superior de Investigaciones cientificas, Madrid 1978 (With this volume the editio princeps of Neophyti 1, started in 1968—after the publication of several articles on the subject—, is completed. According to the introduc tory note, however, a Vlth volume is forthcoming, containing indices and appendices to the editio princeps and its introductions, and also the Hebrew lemmata.lemmata. In the first chapter of the Introduction Diez Macho brings up to date the targumic bibliography. Among other publications he mentions: M. Klein's recension of the bibliography of Grossfeld, which offers some additional material; the publication of the Newsletter for Targum Studies, which gives useful information; Diez Merino's report on the targumic studies at the 6th World Congress of Jewish Studies (1973); the targumic papers read at the 8th Congress of the International Society of Old Testa ment Scholars (Edinburgh 1974); the studies of R. Le Deaut; and Gre lot's recension of Neophyti 1, IV, in which the author discusses the Journal for the Study of Judaism, Vol. X, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">90 REVIEW OF BOOKS language of the ms. An important remark, made by Le Deaut, is that we cannot know whether (in comparison to a longer text) a shorter targum or midrash text is the older one (cf. my remarks in Een Aramees boek Job (Amsterdam 1974), pp. 27-29). The second chapter deals with recent publica tions in relation to Neophyti 1. We would like to mention in this connection Ohana'sOhana's studies which refer to the contention of Geiger and Kahle that what is anti-mishnaic is pre-mishnaic. Ohana's position is illustrated by his discussion of the translation of givr and^r: in Neophyti 1 these words always mean "to live, reside" and "stranger", whereas in Onqelos they are understood as "to become a proselyte" and "proselyte" (see already Neophyti 1, IV, pp. 33*-35*, and cf. this Journal 6 (1975), p. 124). An im portant event is the English re-edition of SchOrer's Geschichte des Jiidischen VolkesVolkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi, emended and enlarged by G. Vermes and F. Millar (Edinburgh 1973). These two authors also say that it is not possible to conclude from the length of a targum whether it is young or old. Diez Macho then mentions Munoz Leon's dissertation on Memra of which the author himself gave a recapitulation in Neophyti 1, III, pp. 70*־ 83*. Finally Diez Macho deals with Y. Komlos, The Bible in the Light 0J the the Aramaic Translations (Tel Aviv 1973) written in modern Hebrew; he challenges some arguments put forward in this work. The third chapter in its totality (41*-82*) deals with the book of M. Kasher, The Aramaic versions versions of the Bible (= Torah Shelemah XXIV), Jerusalem 1974 (modern Hebrew), announced already in Neophyti 1, IV, p. 30*, cf. Neophyti 1,1, pp. 66*-70*. In this book Kasher investigates the origins of the targums and their mutual relations. Diez Macho gives a detailed survey of the contents and here and there criticizes Kasher's opinions, especially when Kasher dates the three targums (Onqelos, Pseudo-Jonathan, Neophyti 1) from the period of Ezra. Kasher states that many quotations in the Mishna and in other Jewish literature depend on the Targums. The 4th chapter contains a great part of Diez Macho's paper read at the Edinburgh Con gress. This chapter is entitled: Neophyti 1. Textual Crystallization. To Diez Macho a very important point is of course the age of the Neophyti text. He adduces various arguments in order to demonstrate that Neophyti 1, though including later additions, is an old Palestinian Targum. He es pecially challenges the opinion, put forward by some scholars, that Neophy ti 1 is the product of a Humanistic revision. Both in contents and in lan guage Neophyti 1 shows its ancient origins. Chapter 5 deals with new elucidations with regard to the fragmentary targums. Here Diez Macho gives a recapitulation of M. L. Klein's communication "Extant Sources of the Fragmentary Targum to the Pentateuch", read at the Edinburgh Con gress. Most interesting is what is said about έφψαθά in Mark 7, 34: Is this form Hebrew or Aramaic?, a problem on which several authors have given their opinion. After having given various examples of similar assimilated forms, Diez Macho concludes that έφφαθά is Aramaic. Ch. 6 treats new contributions to the knowledge of the language of the targums. A. Tal's dissertation (Tel Aviv 1975) is critically discussed. In Tal's opinion the lan guage of Tgjon relating to the former prophets—and also that of Onqe los—is a kind of koine, a superdialectical Aramaic from before the time of</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF BOOKS 91 Ben Kosheba, whereas the language of the Palestinian targums, Neophyti included, dates from a later time. Secondly he discusses an article of Μ. Z. Kaddari on the language of Onqelos; the recension article of S. A. Kaufmann on the editio princeps of the Qumran Job Targum {JAOS 93 (1973), pp. 317-327); Fitzmyer's remarks concerning Aramaic, both in his edition of the Genesis Apocryphon and in articles; articles of McNama ra; a paper of Muraoka read at the Jerusalem Congress of 1973 and pu blished in JJS 25 (1974), pp. 425-443; and finally the dissertation of E. Mar tinez Borobio on the grammatical structure of the Aramaic of Neophyti 1. It is clear that the discussion of the various Aramaic dialects and their relations and of the colloquial and literary kinds of Aramaic is not yet closed. Diez Macho deserves our heartfelt thanks for his survey of recent targum studies. I noted some inaccuracies whose summing up may be use ful for the list of Addenda et Corrigenda to be published in vol.

The introduction is followed by the Neophyti text of Deuteronomy with a Spanish trans lation, edited in the same way as applied in the preceding volumes, cf. this Journal Journal 2 (1971), p. 85. We then find in two annexes the French and the English translation and in a third annex Parallels to Deuteronomy of Pseudo Jonathan Jonathan and Neophyti 1 by Ε. B. Levine. We congratulate Diez Macho with the completion of his edition. All those who are engaged in targumic studies will surely be indebted to him and his assistants for this excellent work). Β.
