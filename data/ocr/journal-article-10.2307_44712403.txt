'So let no one be eager to return home, before he has slept with a Trojan's wife and avenged ' Avenged what? Obviously the rape of Helen. The Greeks are to do to the wives of the Trojans what Paris did to the wife of Menelaus. So they will avenge the ópufiiicrra and OToyaydę of Helen. It is difficult to believe, reading this passage, that in this country the normal, accepted interpretation of 1. 356 is that the Greeks are to avenge their own 'cares' (=liEÁEÓf||icnra?) and groans for Helens sake . In fact, that 'EAévtìs is taken as an objective genitive. This strange interpretation has the authority of Aristarchus and is found, for example, in Leaf, Monro, and Liddell and Scott. Aristarchus seems to have produced his explanation in a literary dispute with the Chorizontes. They put forward the view that this was a difference between the attitude of the Iliad and the Odyssey: that the poet of the Iliad makes Helen an un- willing victim, while in the Odyssey she went willingly with Paris. To counter this argument, Aristarchus produced his alternative interpretation of B 356. Most of us are Chorizontes now; why, then, should we repeat from generation to generation a forced interpretation which was conceived for the narrow purpose of literary polemics ? There are two reasons; the difficulty of the word óp|if||ionra and the suggestion that Helen was carried off against her will. The former difficulty is not helped by ex- plaining TXévr is ópiifmccra as 'anxiety for the sake of Helen'. It is at least as easy to translate 'to avenge Helen's struggles and lamentations'. Nor is it necessary to discuss whether or not Helen was a willing victim. Perhaps the poet is a little inconsistent; perhaps Nestor is being rhetorical. At all events, lamentation is the accepted reaction of an abducted princess. One may assume that opinará te oTovccyáç te was a formula which existed before the composition of the Iliad, a formula which was applied to abducted princesses, of whom there were others in Greek mythology as well as Helen. In fact, her individual reaction is hardly being mentioned. TtoaoOoci 6' 4 EXévris ópprmará te aroyaydę te means little more than 'to avenge the abduction of Helen'.1 2. Secondly, there is the problem of the alleged anger of Paris in Z 326. Hector has called at Paris' house to persuade his brother to return to the fighting. Paris has been at home ever since he was spirited away by Aphrodite at the inglorious end of his duel with Menelaus. At the moment he is engaged rather moodily in playing with his armour. How does Hector address him? Z 326-8: Saijióvi', où iaèv KccXà 'ó'ov tov5 evOeo Oujjćp. I Àaoì jaèv çOivúBouor TTEpi tttóàiv aitrú te teT^oç | ļjapvdļJEVoi. ' It is not right for you to have this anger in your heart; the people perish fighting about the :ity and the high wall. ' 1 The recurrence of the line at B 590 does not affect this argument.</page><page sequence="2">24 PROCEEDINGS OF THE There is absolutely no reason for Hector to speak in this way to Paris. Nowhere else do we find the suggestion that Paris is angry with the Trojans, and indeed he has no reason to be; rather, they are angry with him. The suggestion that Hector is being sarcastic is most unlikely; Homer seems always to explain people's motives if they say one. thing and mean another. And the theory that Hector is referring to Paris' anger as a euphemism, in order not to call him a coward in front of Helen, as Eustathius suggested, is open to the same objections. In fact, the phrase does not suit this situation, because Paris is not angry in the Iliad. Some modern German scholars, impressed by the inconsistency, have ascribed this whole scene to a short, independent epic of Hector's visit to Troy.1 And in this hypothetical independent epic, Paris' absence from the field was due to anger. Professor Kakridis in his book Homeric Researches has a rather different explanation. He thinks, as do many others, that Phoenix' tale of Meleager in Book 9 is a shortened version of an earlier epic poem on the subject of Meleager. And in this meeting between Hector and Paris in Troy, he sees echoes of the earlier poem, at the point where various deputations come to ask Meleager to return to the battle (I 574-86). Meleager's absence certainly was due to anger, and it would have been perfectly reasonable for his friends (I 585) to say to him 'Saijiovi', ou jjisv kocAcc yoK ov tóv5' evOeo Ounćp'. The explanation I suggest is similar to that of Professor Kakridis, but much more general. When a warrior of the front rank in epic poetry sat in his house, absenting himself from the battlefield, the usual reason was 'wrath'. Epic heroes were not allowed to be cowards. It was because of anger that Achilles sulked in his tent; because of anger Meleager refused to fight. And it is clear that this was a common theme in pre-Homeric epic poetry.

'So also we have heard the famous stories of heoroes of old, whenever violent anger overtook one of them; they could be won over by gifts and the words of their friends.' KÂéa àvSpcov had already occurred at I 189 as the subject of Achilles' song; they also occur at 6 73, of the song of Demodocus; they are assumed to be heroic lays, pre- Homeric poetry. So we learn that the absence of a hero from the battlefield was a common theme of pre-Homeric epic; and the reason was Yph°ļ - anger at some slight to his honour. This was so much the usual thing, that when Hector came to ask Paris to return to the battle he automatically said ou nèv KaÀà yphov tóv5' êvOeo 0u^ćp. That is what, in effect, the ambassadors said to Achilles, and the various deputations to Meleager. The argument is the same in both these passages. The general, typical situation has submerged the particular and individual one; Helen, in B 356, and Paris in Z 326 are in positions where unhappiness and anger respectively are normally found, and this fact has caused the poet to attribute to them these normal reactions. 1 E.g. Robert, Bethe, Wilamowitz.</page><page sequence="3">CAMBRIDGE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY 25 3. When Achilles asks his mother to use her influence with Zeus, he reminds her of an occasion in the past, A 396-406 : I have often heard you boasting in my father's house, when you said that you alone among the gods saved the son of Cronos from disaster, when the other Olympian gods, Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene, wished to bind him. You came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds, having quickly called the hundred-handed one to high Olympus, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men call him Aegaeon - for he again is stronger than his father. And he sat beside the son of Cronos glorying in his strength, and the blessed gods were afraid of him, and no longer tried to bind Zeus. The interesting part of this story is the apparently irrelevant clause which seems to explain Aegaeon in 1. 404. Thetis brought the giant, ôv Bpiápecov KOcXéouai ôeoí, dv8pES 6é tg TTcnrres I Aiyaícov'* ô yàp ocOte ßi^ oO nccrpòs ájiEÍvcov. That a child should be stronger than his father is a paradox. 'We are much better than our fathers', said Sthenelus, before Diomede told him to be silent. Athena, talking to Telemachus in ß 27 6, says ' Few children are the equals of their fathers; the majority are worse, and a few are better'. Iolaus, in the Heraclidae, says 'You might perhaps find one among many who is not worse than his father'. There are many other examples of this theme; it is not difficult to see the psycho- logical basis of the paradox in the developing father-son relationship. But the main story about the child being stronger than his father is one not yet mentioned. It is told in almost identical terms by Pindar and Aeschylus, and it also refers to Zeus and Thetis . When Zeus and Poseidon were rivals for the hand of Thetis, they were deterred by a prophecy that the sea goddess would bear a son stronger than his father, who would wield a weapon mightier than the thunderbolt, if she married Zeus, and mightier than the trident if she married Poseidon. They therefore arranged for her to marry a mortal, Peleus. If a later poet had wished to give a reason for Thetis' having influence with Zeus, this story of his early desire for her could hardly have failed to occur to him. When Homer has the same problem, he produces a primitive-seeming story about highly anthropomorphic gods and giants, but in the middle of it there occurs an apparently irrelevant phrase about the giant's being stronger than his father. The motif of the one story seems to have been interpolated in the other. There have been attempts to explain 1. 404. As it stands, the offending phrase looks like an etymological explanation of the name Aegaeon; it would be more intelligible as an explanation of the giant's other name, Briareus. As to the particle ccute, one would expect it to mean ' for he again is stronger than his father'. The scholiast says that the father of Briareus/Aegaeon was Poseidon. Many of the commentators1 accept this and say that as Poseidon was strong among the gods, so his son was even stronger; it is an obvious attempt to make some sense of the line, but to say that Briareus was stronger than Poseidon does not prove his superiority to the other gods as well. In any case, as one might expect, Hesiod makes Briareus the son of Ouranos and Gaea, like the other giants.2 Another possibility therefore is that the giant was stronger than Ouranos, just as Zeus had been stronger than his father, Cronos. 1 E.g. Ameis, Faesi, van Leeuwen. a So Pierron.</page><page sequence="4">26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE It is difficult to read either of these explanations into the Greek. In fact, the irrele- vancy of this little phrase makes A 404 almost unintelligible. Zenodotus seems to have offered an alternative reading. I have no certain explanation to give; only a possibility to suggest. If we may assume that there is some connection between the two stories, one in Homer, the other in Pindar and Aeschylus, both about Thetis and Zeus, and both containing this theme 'stronger than his father', there are two possible theories: either the story as told in Homer, of physical brutality and fear among the gods, seemed rather primitive to later tastes, and a poet, perhaps Pindar himself, who was prone to change the older myths, invented the other story under the influence of these very words, ó yàp aCrre ßiq ou TTonrpòç áuEÍvcov. This seems unlikely enough, although there is little doubt that later myths were often verbally inspired by phrases in Homer.1 Moreover it still does not explain the occurrence of the phrase in Homer. Alternatively we might assume that the story told by Pindar and Aeschylus, with its psychological basis, is really more primitive than Homer's anthropomorphic legend about gods and giants: that Homer, for his own purposes, chose not to use the tale of the love of Zeus for Thetis, and in its place invented one of his favourite scenes of family life on Olympus; but that his poetical imagination was caught by the theme of the old story and the detail slipped in. Aegaeon became stronger than his father.2 We have considered three passages, each containing a line which is, on the surface, inconsistent or irrelevant. In each case the difficult phrase is typical of, and may have been suggested by, the situation. Helen in B 356 has the attributes of an unwilling victim, because most abducted princesses are unwilling victims: Paris in Z 326 is asked to control his anger because most absentee heroes are absent because of anger; and (although this is more hypothetical) Aegaeon in A 404 is made stronger than his father, through an association in the poet's mind with another story involving Zeus and Thetis. M. M. WILLCOCK x For example, the later fate of Astyanax was probably suggested by Andromache's unhappy surmise in 6) 735 and the story of the magical rain of gold on the island of Rhodes by B 670. With this suggestion the reader may compare Professor Kakridis' convincing explanation of the petrifaction of Niobe's neighbours in 6)611 ( Homeric Researches , p. 101).</page></plain_text>
