<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Collision of Process and Form: Drawing's Imprint on Peter Eisenman's House VI Krishna Luce In his essay "Trace Elements," Stan Allen argues that Peter Eisenman's architecture stands as evidence of his design process, offering a means to reconstruct and reanimate the "motions" involved in design. This turn to process, Allen points out, is highly sig nificant in light of the legacy of process-driven design that emerges in Eisenman's wake.1 Similarly, Reinhold Martin writes that process is now part of architecture's discursive network, a network made up of "the entire world of words and things that is captured by the deceptively simple designation 'architecture.'" Martin farther maintains that each new discursive practice "articulates new, historically and contextually specific prob lems."2 Assuming that both men are correct in identifying the increasingly important role of process within architecture, it leads us to ponder the nature of the questions that have emerged in Eisenman's wake. Looking at it as more than just a rhetorical trope, what does a turn to process mean for the historically and contextually specific problems of architecture? To further define the predicament of today's process-driven architecture, this essay returns to Eisenman's work, focusing on just one of his projects. Commissioned by Suzanne and Dick Frank, House VI is a small building of just 1,500 square feet located in Cornwall, Connecticut.3 Built predominantly of stuccoed plywood, the house is a com position of glass and white orthogonal forms (fig. 1). One of Eisenman's first built works, it was designed and initially constructed from 1972 to 1975.4 House VI is an appropriate choice for analysis since Eisenman has written of it that "the building is not an object in the traditional sense, not the end result of a process, but more accurately a record of a process, so that the process itself becomes the object."5 But what processes does House VI record, and why would such a record of process gain lasting significance within architecture? To examine these questions I will look not just to the building and Eisen man's assertions but also to the design development drawings that Eisenman produced. Housed in the Getty Research Library, this collection was acquired directly from Eisen man in 1992. Its images document the initial development of the building's design from inception through schematics.6 Most of the images are executed in pen, with some pencil underdrawing on yellow tracing paper, and many of them carry dates in Eisenman's own hand. For my analysis, I relied on these dates as an honest presentation of the order of Eisenman's design development.7 Getty Research Journal, no. 2 (2010): 125-37 © Kristina Luce 125</page><page sequence="2">Fig. l.

Axonometric sketches present a cube alternately subdivided into four-square and nine-square gridded patterns (fig. 2). Subsequent drawings demonstrate that once established as the design's starting point, Eisenman's next move was to embed these simple patterns into one another and then work out a pattern of hierarchy that created an expressive interrelationship (figs. 3,4). Eisenman then undermined the sense of whole ness or totality inherent in this intersection by isolating the fractal-like recursion of the four-square geometry, cropping the nine-square back down to one of its corner four squares.

Having developed its new and ambiguous expression, Eisenman then used this grid pattern as the parti, or geometric key, for the rest of the design (fig. 5). The next drawings in Eisenman's design progression illustrate a different phase in the process. Rather than refining or resolving the relationships within the fractured grid, these drawings illustrate his experimentation with the grid's formal materialization. Through this process he developed and selected from a variety of geometric gestures, all of which are expressions of the grid. The development of the grid's exact materializa tion is carried out through a series of axonometric sketches. Within these drawings, axes became walls or sometimes voids cutting through the building. Sections of the cubed grid emerge only to later disappear. The series of seventeen drawings in all form a kind of stop motion animation of his design process, illustrating an imagined building that seems to grow in some areas and contract in others with what might be likened to a creative, Luce Collision of Process and Form 129</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 6.

It is clear that Eisenman, aided by the semitransparency of yel low tracing paper, has generated these drawings by overlaying a new drawing sheet onto the previous image and tracing its form. In this way each drawing might be understood as part of a serial design process, a reconsideration of previous decisions and a signaling of the decisions still to come. Unlike the process during which Eisenman conceived the geometric parti for the design, this second phase has no apparent moment of resolution that naturally forms a termination of the process. Instead, this phase is interminable and pregnant with all the playful and possible instantiations of the grid. The dichotomy between this seemingly random endpoint for the second phase of Eisenman's process and the resolution of the cropped nine-square cube demands some reconciliation. Eisenman has acknowledged that a rupture existed in the design, point ing out, "Once the conceptual structure [of House VI] is understood, it detaches itself from the initial physical experience."9 It is possible to conclude from the drawings that Fig. 7.

Art © Peter Eisenman Luce Collision of Process and Form 131</page><page sequence="8">this rupture is a reflection of the one in Eisenman's own process of design. The initial phase of this process was a composition of wholes—ideal forms that that would serve to organize the design that were then cropped. The secondary process opposes such com positional principles, valuing House VI instead as an incomplete and partial trace. One can conclude, therefore, that the perceptual meaning that Eisenman sought to create in the experience of the house is the same one that he experienced (or constructed) within his process of design. To generate an understanding of this dichotomy in the visitor, Eisenman relied on his ability to instill an activating dissatisfaction within the building. He wrote that within House VI, the "particular juxtaposition of solids and voids produces a situation that is only resolved by the mind's finding the need to change the position of the ele ments."10 In other words, Eisenman's goal was to make a kind of sliding puzzle out of House VI. He desired to induce the reanimation of his process of design in the visitor, a thawing of the process that the building froze in its instantiation. By reactivating this process, Eisenman undermined the physical object that is House VI, placing it alongside all the other buildings that a visitor might imagine. For Eisenman, the building was not a stable thing but a mutable and active part of the environment. His is a conception at odds with our perception of buildings as stable, solid artifacts, but it is an understanding that continues to be expressed in the serialization of design found in projects like Greg Lynn's Embryological House. To play the sliding puzzle game as Eisenman intends, however, one must first dis cover the rules by which he was playing. The sought-for resolution, it is implied, would stem from the discovery of the geometric rules governing the seemingly random com position of House VI. It is through this process, this attempt by the visitor to deduce the conceptual key for the design from the physical trace of the building, that a deeper level of House VI's contribution to architectural discourse becomes apparent. In acknowl edging that there is a dichotomy at the core of the design, Eisenman recognizes that the game he lays out, in fact, has multiple and even conflicted messages. The house might be perceived as an architectural sliding puzzle, a complex and unstable reality, but its con ceptual key is stable, solid, Neoplatonic, and alludes to classicizing aesthetic traditions within architecture. Both parts of the game reference a kind of process. In the first case, this process gives rise to a set of formal rules. In the second, the process translates these rules into material form. In this way two types of design process coexist, but are kept separate from one another. The grid represents the outcome of that first part of the process. It is the ideal form to be materialized by the building. To the visitor, the grid is a mathematical system, a series of compositional guidelines embodied by the grid's alignments and interrelation ships. It is a set of rules to be discovered as the sliding puzzle game is played. These rules govern the new mental alignments that a visitor may discover as (s)he tries to reconcile the work's formal composition. From this perspective the grid itself can be seen as an origin, a causal object, or at least a boundary across which visitors are denied access. And 132 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 2 (2010)</page><page sequence="9">yet, although the grid behaves as a screen, implying that it is the origination point for the design, it is still not a compositional ur-form. Instead, as Eisenman's own design draw ings show, it has as its point of origination the simple four- and nine-square divisions of a cube. These compositional moves have classicizing roots that reference architecture's long history. The nine-square and four-square patterns Eisenman intersects are the same ones Rudolf Wittkower found in his analysis of Renaissance proportions, and they are the same patterns that Wittkower's student Colin Rowe (who was in turn Eisenman's teacher) used to compare the work of Andrea Palladio and Le Corbusier.11 By overlay ing and cropping the two grids, Eisenman undermines the properties inherent in them: symmetry, stability, harmony, and so on. He contorts and destroys these patterns, but he cannot and does not simply ignore them. The destructive expression of the House VI parti grid is Eisenman's appraisal of the traditional, Neoclassical, patterns of architec tural composition. Instead of starting with a clean slate, inventing principles appropriate to a contemporary weekend house, he pushes against the cultural system within which he was trained. In a sense, then, Eisenman's narration of the design process within House VI stops short. The sliding puzzle game references only the later portion of his process. Even though the visitor is to discover the grid as part of the building's conceptual resolution, the building can do little more than establish the identity of this grid and its particu lar rules. The opportunity to manipulate the grid, to alter the building's deep underly ing logic, is opposed by the physical and material resistance of the building. And while Eisenman makes gestures to point to the grid, other than denying the cultural meaning attributable to its historical roots, he does not seem to consciously engage the intellec tual process by which he came to this object. Grids are collided, forms articulated, and historical cultural languages negated, but the viewer has no access to the acknowledg ment and contemplation of the process that allowed such manipulations. What is missing is Eisenman's critical and conscious engagement with the act and process of drawing. It is striking that for a building understood to be a moment of frozen process, Eisenman seems to have neglected the role drawing played in that process. While overtly, House VI is a commentary on the processes and compositional principles of architectural form, I believe its continued significance stems from a dif ferent source. In House VI, Eisenman reveals a discipline-wide blind spot. By simulta neously focusing on design process while neglecting his own, Eisenman expresses an early formulation of the essential question that a process-centric architecture demands: Can architecture engage process when the medium of architectural design is drawing? With House VI Eisenman highlights what he views as the myriad failures of historical architectural composition, but in so doing, he also opens the gap between the realities of drawing as an instrument of design and the fictions of transparency that architecture maintains about drawing's role.12 House VI might not itself contemplate this gap, but as a whole the project demands that the gap be contemplated. In effect, I am arguing that although Eisenman calls out the multiplicity of processes involved within design, his Luce Collision of Process and Form 133</page><page sequence="10">sngagement aligns only with those aspects of design circumscribed by drawing. His cn :ique is similarly limited to the historical cultural codes established by a drawing-based architecture. However, the continued relevance of his projects is rooted in the tendency 3f such commentaries to be held together by a third, implicit questioning of not just architectural representation generally but specifically drawing as architecture's concep tual medium. The problem is that although drawing is the process through which architects design, paradoxically, drawing does not easily allow one to focus on process. The architectural drawing is unapologetically centered on the object. As an act, drawing is indeed a process, but it tends to diminish or disguise this role in favor of the object it represents. Patrick Maynard writes of this doubled but divided understanding of draw ing, stating that while "the drawn shapes we see may have been understood in terms of operations... [these processes are] not visible in the product."13 Maynard's point is that although the process of drawing encodes one form of knowledge (procedural), this knowledge is present only during the active stage of process. One can reanimate this pro cess through the written word, but in the image many of the procedural details become ambiguous and obscure. Once complete, the drawing becomes an object that is, bafflingly, both an absolute document of its process of formation and nearly opaque in what it com municates about that process. As a result, today, and, for that matter, throughout the last five hundred years, the prevalent understanding of architectural drawing is as a noun rather than a verb, as an image rather than an act, thus making architecture object-centric rather than process-centric.14 Unlike other types of drawing, what the various forms of orthographic projection (including plans, sections, elevations, and isometrics) excel at is the communication of form. These images do not distort proportion or shape the way perspective does to achieve its visual illusion. Without the need for a physical referent, orthographic draw ings can telegraph decisions made in one plane onto the other two. They can expose col lisions and suggest solutions for the three-dimensional crises formed when the inner eye fails. The combined use of plan, section, and elevation functions as a set of prescriptive lenses for our ability to imagine space and form in three dimensions. No matter how reli ant a design is on eidetic shapes, drawing pinpoints the implications of those ideas that cannot help but remain unresolved in the space of imagination. Drawing does not just represent formal knowledge, drawing generates it, but to do so, it suppresses other quali ties that different forms of representation highlight. In the end it was this power, the ability to create knowledge about form, and the implicit agreement that architecture was about form above all else that united the designs of the last five hundred years. Eisenman's design for House VI pushed against the bound aries that existed between drawing and process-driven design, but ultimately he could not fully transgress these boundaries because drawing was the only conceptual medium open to him. So long as drawing remained the major tool of architectural design, so long as what it ignored was sacrificed in exchange for its ability to prefigure shape, architec 134 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 2 (2010)</page><page sequence="11">ture had no choice but to maintain its emphasis on form even as architects like Eisenman attempted to integrate other epistemes, such as process. Projects like House VI demon strate, however, that drawing's dominance had come under question, that it had become the locus of inquiry and challenge within architecture. To the extent that things have shape, that they are formal, drawing is a profound tool not only for communicating the form of these things but also for better understanding them. Yet its power to communi cate and augment knowledge of shape bumped up against architecture's new attention to process. Drawing, with its form-centric core, began to lose its relevance in architecture when objects lost their primacy, when considerations outside the "thingness" of archi tecture began to occupy intellectual concentration. Toward the end of his critique, Allen argues that by turning the focus of design back onto itself, Eisenman created a self-referential spiral within which design became closed off, speaking only to itself and doomed to irrelevance.15 It can be argued, however, that making design irrelevant, or at least the type of design that drawing enabled, was a necessary goal. Since it was drawing that had defined the design process throughout the previous five hundred years, designers had ineluctably defined architecture in a way that situated form as its central quality. In the case of House VI, drawing caused the grid to be understood as an object, and this understanding overwhelmed any visibility the act of drawing may have had in calling it forth or extracting it. Putatively, Eisenman's work was a critique of historical codes and perhaps of architecture as a stable object, but by closing design onto itself, the project forced drawing's role within the design process to eventually become visible. Far from dooming design to irrelevance, this was a necessary move for design to move forward, particularly if process was to be engaged in a mature and meaningful way. When Allen wrote that Eisenman's turn to process made architecture "powerless to engage any material not already implicated in the hermetic procedures of design,"16 his assessment was correct, but it was because drawing had already circumscribed architec ture's boundaries. With House VI Eisenman plunged into the act of formal composition, an act that has defined architecture since the Renaissance, and turned it into an intermi nable, infinite process that simultaneously fetishized form and made it utterly meaning less. In so doing, Eisenman also threw the role of drawing into question. With House VI Eisenman held a mirror to the discipline of architecture, revealing the inherent conflict created by design's shifting priorities. One of the most persistently difficult issues Eisen man pondered was not the appropriateness of historical cultural codes but the cultural practices that defined his profession. Both the gap he represented through his bifurcated design process and the gap in what he represented of his process provided a space in which drawing's role within design could reach visibility. Because of such gaps, draw ing's dominance has begun to be questioned and continues to give way to other modes of design more amenable to showing process. The questions contemplated by today's com putational architecture demonstrate the importance of the space that Eisenman opened up. In sum, House VI illuminated the same set of cultural circumstances that paved the Luce Collision of Process and Form 135</page><page sequence="12">way for an acceptance of a computationally-based means of design. Neither Eisenman nor House VI postulates this new medium for architecture, but they both turn toward its new priorities. As a result of the directional accuracy of this reorientation, Eisenman's efforts and buildings can be understood as an important lens for grasping the current "world of words and things" that make up architecture.17 Krishna Luce is a doctoral candidate in architectural history and theory at the Taubman Col lege of Architecture and Urban Design, University of Michigan.

"Beyond specific references to his formal vocabulary (which are really quite rare), any time we see work that justifies itself by reference to the history of its design process... we are in the territory first mapped out by Eisenman in the seventies with his investigations of the index. Since that time, an attention to process has been the explicit sign of a conceptually ambitious, theoretically driven work."

Eisenman has taken pains to stress the importance of disharmony and incompletion in archi tecture. Informed by Michel Foucault, he sees the transgression of wholeness as a displacement of an anthropomorphic center and reflection of the alienated self. "If you sayA/B A/B, that is an alternation of wholes outside of the classical canon, which tries to take A and B and bring them into symmetry—as in B/A/B/A/B When you have A/B/A/B/ you have alternating pairs with no center, closure or hierarchy. A/B/A/B/A is complete. A/B/A/B is not." Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman, "The 1982 Debate: Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture," in Studio Works 7 (Harvard University Graduate School of Design) (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000). It is interesting, then, that House VI, as an asymmetrical, disharmonious, and dynamic com position, is resolved as a series of symmetrical, stable wholes, as these are the geometries that began the design for Eisenman and the eidetic forms that serve as the mind's geometric vocabulary. These Platonic and ideal geometries are incomplete but irrepressible in the design. Even as they are denied, obfuscated nearly to the point of permanent invisibility, it is their order that rules over the interrelationships of the parts, and it is their order that a visitor discovers lying beneath the forms of the house. It is the original, classically symmetrical order that gives meaning to the interrelationships of Eisenman's incomplete 136 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 2 (2010)</page><page sequence="13">geometries. Without the original harmony to regulate it, Eisenman's incomplete order is no order at all, and the dichotomy that is so important to activating the visitor cannot be created. 9.

Historically, of course, it makes sense to derive compositional inspiration from the villa type, since as a weekend dwelling, House VI shares with the villa certain class and functional requirements, but Eisenman does not want to reference these historical meanings. Instead, his designs completely negate the value of these patterns. 12. "I would like to suggest also that, while such an enabling fiction may be made explicit, this has not been done in architecture, and that because of this inexplicitness a curious situation has come to pass in which, while on the one hand the drawing might be vastly overvalued, on the other the properties of drawing—its peculiar powers in relation to its putative subject, the building—are hardly recognized at all."
