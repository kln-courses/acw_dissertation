<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND REVIEWS OUR OWN WORDS. By Mary Helen Dohan. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1974. Pp. xiv+315. Since this book is for the general reader, not for language scholars, it should perhaps not be reviewed in IJAL at all. On the other hand, language scholars need to know what popular books are being published in their fields, and as this is in most respects a superior example of its type, it deserves notice. The subject of the book is American English -right down to the moment of its going to press. Just about every word or phrase which could be described as an Americanism has been worked in somewhere. The result is a copious book with these Americanisms in- dexed in twenty-nine double-column pages: the reader may look up almost any item with good expectation of finding it at least men- tioned, sometimes discussed. One is reminded of H. L. Mencken's statement, "The only claim I make for The American Language is that you can open it anywhere and read in either direction." Dohan had "done her homework" with all the important studies in the field (see her critical notes in "Suggested Readings," pp. 311-15). The book is frankly derivative, yet the play of interest and opinion that holds it together is Dohan's own-opinion usually well informed and judicious, except when the romance and wonder of it all gets the upper hand. This happens chiefly in the first four chapters, the historical part, which is tinged with a sense of teleology (pp. 25, 29ff). The Indo-Europeans, the Germanic tribes, the Celts and Saxons and Danes obviously have had one great raison d'etre in common: to foresee and produce the English language, that "glorious artifact," so that the American language might in the fullness of time be born out of it. Flattering thought. How fortunate for us to be native speakers of English! Dohan's genuine enthusiasm for words, especially "Our Own Words," bears the reader along much of the time. In popular books, the danger lies in enthusiasm un- supported by knowledge, but I have found no gross errors of fact in this book (though she goes off the track on the "Danish pronouns," p. 48), and caution saves her as to a number of doubtful etymologies-an area where many fools naively tread. The chief shortcoming-if that is what it is -is that Dohan virtually equates language with the lexicon. Phonology, morphology, syntax are nodded to in passing, but only barely. What we get is the birth and develop- ment of the nation as seen through the emer- gence of words. To this end she has fully utilized the historical dictionaries (OED, EDD, DAE, and especially Mathews's DA); when the word for something appears, we know that it has happened: history is realized. Only once in a while does Dohan forget (what she perfectly well knows) that the earliest record of a word or sense may not be identical with its time of first use. Another mark of a popular book is seen in Dohan's unblushing anthropomorphism (pp. 61ff). The language is a living organism which treads its ineluctable way, sometimes triumphantly, taking one thing from this stage or this language, another from another stage or language, always to its improvement. But in this she probably reflects the tradition of Jespersen, whom she quotes on the "masculinity" of English. For the general reader, this may not be altogether bad; it is a pretty dependable way of stirring interest, though occasionally it leads to romantic interpretations, as if the meaning of some word, or its connotation, were intrinsic to it (e.g., bairn, p. 41). On the whole, however, this book will cer- tainly do more good than harm. The faults are venial. It may safely be recommended to the general reader and to students looking for an introductory book. Even the scholar will find some words treated that he never met before-and treated in lively style. Nor, so far as fact or data go, will he often be misled. F. G.
