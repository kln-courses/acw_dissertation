O'Hara Leonardo ... he knew how a smile was made - Valery For a genuine poet, metaphor is not a rhetorical figure but a vicarious image that he actually beholds in place of a concept -Nietzsche One day in January 1937 Samuel Beckett, to the amazement of his friends, was stabbed in the chest on a Paris street by a sometime pimp he scarcely knew. When Beckett recovered from his wounds (a punctured right lung), he went to see his assailant in jail to ask him why he did it. To his questioning, Beckett received only a sing-song reply, "'il n'y a pas raison, il n'y a pas raison." To many, this incident represents the essence of what they mean by the term "postmodern," viz., an existence radically absurd which subverts every attempt to explain it that is based on a traditional conception of human reason. When translated either into the *Paul Ricoeur. The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language. Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1977. Walter J. Ong, S.J.

It has become fashionable recently, however, to oppose this "postmodern" vision of existence by returning to traditional humanistic values and by dissolving the knots of the absurd within the elastic networks of cultural history, slipping them back into a previously idealized past and then sliding them forward again in an effort to weave a beguiling spell in which it seems that ancients and moderns share not only the same basic problems and crises but a continuity of rationality and value to handle all such disturbances of law and order. There is also an alternative move in this kind of conservative strategy, and it is more honest. It consists in attempting to present carefully a historical criticism of the origins and aims of the fundamental divisions within the areas of study under interrogation. The best way to characterize briefly this form of interpretation would be to say that it is as if Beckett, after receiving that nonsensical reply, began to do linguistic, psychoanalytic, sociological and philosophical analyses of it as a statement composed of multi-dimensional signs, and then proceeded, based on this work, to speculate on the many potential semantic functions this judgment can have in various discourses. If the first approach is like that of the blind spider spinning a web in space, then the second is like that of the mole in the dark burrowing ahead underground perhaps towards some kind of light. Walter J. Ong's Interfaces of the Word: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness and Culture and Paul Ricoeur's The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language display many similar features. Both works are wide-ranging, interdisciplinary, and dialectically organized. They take into their scope, each in its own way, the history of Western culture from the age of Plato and Aristotle to that of Teilliard de Chardin and Jacques Derrida. Both texts argue persuasively, from an enlightened traditional point of view, for a return to the classical aesthetic ideal of creative imitation as it was originally conceived and practiced by the Greeks. Both criticize, therefore, the modern development of irony since the German Romantics, from a figure of speech in the service of a humanistic norm (as in Dickens' Great Expectations) to a reflexive literary method. Ong and Ricoeur are rather appalled by such "creative" and "critical" writers as Mallarme and Derrida, who use irony to structure self-referential texts that express, paradoxically enough, gaily deterministic visions of language as an over-mastering alien force essentially subversive of the grandiose pretentions of representational thinking. Naturally enough, Beckett's parody of the symboliste, the Unnamable, who tries vainly to stammer out a conclusion that would represent the essence of his existence, a conclusion that can never quite 330</page><page sequence="3">come, is a spectacle not calculated to please either Ong or Ricoeur. For both thinkers prefer "high talk," and so they usually avoid, whenever possible, "processions that lack stilts."l In a series of eleven interdisciplinary studies (eight of which were given originally as separate talks), Ong contends that human consciousness in the West has evolved from an oral stage of culture to a print and now a computer stage. This technological development of the word has weaned man from "mother tongues" or "natural" language to "father tongues" or "artificial" technical jargon. While leading to increased alienation of man from his world, this development also constitutes the basis for the second coming of "primal orality" on a higher, more sophisticated level, that of the multi-media "city without walls"-but with screens. Combining insights from linguistics, phenomenology, anthropology, media studies, and the history of philosophy and theology, Ong elaborates here the thesis he first articulated and developed in The Presence of the Word (1967) and Rhetoric, Romance, and Technology (1971). For Ong, "the world of primary orality [that of the Pre-Socratics] was torn to pieces by writing [Plato] and print [Guttenberg], which [since the Renaissance and the rise of modern science] created, agonizingly, a new kind of noetic and a new kind of culture based on analysis and self-conscious unification that [since the Romantics] has itself been fragmenting and re-forming . . . in new constellations," at the center of which may be appearing a new dialectically "interfaced" consciousness, a new kind of human being.2 Thus Ong incorporates in one fell swoop-dialectically, of course-Eric Havelock's Preface to Plato and Teilliard de Chardin's The Phenomenon of Man, with Bernard Lonergan's Insight and Marshall McLuhan's The Medium Is The Message. Ong ties his argument to what he sees as particularly extreme crisis points in the myriad "transformations of the word." By this phrase, he refers to the complex changes in Western man's understanding of the nature and function of language. Especially important to him is the abrupt substitution in the Renaissance of the interchangeable permanent characters of the printed text for the oral formulas, grand epithets, and old topoi of traditional rhetoric, and the subsequent substitution in recent years of the computer punch card and the library xerox machine for the golden book. For Ong, then, the communal agon of debate has given way first to the romance of the book and now to the facsimiles of the archive. However, Ong does believe that the present confrontation between our urban and technological society and still essentially rural and religious cultures of "the Third World" will prove instructive, given especially the rapid spread of the new self-conscious orality of radio, television, and film. One of Ong's best studies, "African Talking Drums and Oral Noetics," concerns the oral mind-set behind the intricate system of standardized signals used by such people as the Lokele of Zaire to communicate complex ceremonial meanings over great distances 331</page><page sequence="4">throughout Subsaharan Africa. Unfortunately, however, when Ong attempts to articulate the significance of this kind of inter-penetration of cultures represented by and in his own work, he can only resort to that old dialectical song and dance about how initial alienation is necessary for eventual "higher" reintegration, an inflationary economic view expressed too often in worn-out patterns of thought and specious metaphors that lack phenomenological precision, in terms both of the experience of the Lokele and of Ong himself. For an example of Ong's failure in this regard we must turn to his climactic study, "Present and Future: Voice and the Opening of Closed Systems." Here Ong contends that, thanks to TV and other media developments, "Human consciousness is now open closure." As if taking his metaphor of "transformations of the word" in its original religious sense, Ong conceives of the new consciousness now emerging on the horizon as one which creatively bridges the gaps between the multifarious discourses of the human sciences: "The 'I' interfaces with everything" (1W, p. 337). By resorting to this metaphor, Ong hopes to reconcile in a single image the diverse historical, cultural, and philosophical oppositions that he has set up in his text. But the trouble with this lies not so much in the procedure itself, as in the fact that Ong's oppositions are bluntly defined, schematically deployed, and limply related by (relatively) empty metaphors uninformed by lively speculation. An example of this kind of multi-faceted failure occurs in his penultimate study, "From Mimesis to Irony: Writing and Print as Integuments of Voice," in which Ong tries to sum up, much as Northrop Frye might do, the movement of Western literary history in terms of the final triumph of irony over mimesis in modern literature and criticism. What Ong is attacking primarily is the reflexive symbolism of Mallarme and its critical justifications, ranging from the Russian Formalists and the poetics of Paul Valery to New Critical polemics: Finally, what do the foregoing reflections suggest regarding the possibility of "pure" literature in which the literary content would simply constitute its own world? They suggest that perhaps no serious thinker is even interested in this possibility any more. Marxist critics, for example, have never been allowed the question. And the new orality of our age, incarnate in television, appears inhibitory to ideas of "pure" art, for it upgrades, however, artificially, participation and the blurring of the lines between art and life. Despite the high incidence of irony as a literary technique and as a critical preoccupation, there are signs-of which this paper is one-that we are increasingly critical of irony as a basic strategy in literature and art, and critical of other distancing strategies as well, although I hope that we will 332</page><page sequence="5">always remain aware that aesthetic distance is essential to art and that the art-nature distinction is as real and necessary as it is elusive. If this distinction is not clear in primary oral cultures, as I have tried to show it is not, this is one of the weaknesses of such cultures, for they have their own weaknesses too, as literate and electronic cultures have theirs. But if we must distinguish art and nature-as we must-we must also remember that the relationship between art and nature is a dialectical one, and that each is involved in the other. This leaves the quest for an ultimately "pure" literature disabled for good. Such a quest for "pure" literature, I hope it is by now clear, is or was a historical phenomenon belonging to a certain stage in the development of knowledge and the evolution of consciousness. (1W, pp. 301-2) First of all, Ong sets up a series of simplistic oppositions between an elitist quest for "pure" art and ironic distance from the world and the popular culture of participatory imitation "incarnate in television." Secondly, he fails to define the terms of his scheme with any precision. As if irony, for example, were simply as he defines it "in its most ordinary sense today," "the conveying of a truth by asserting its opposite." (1W, p. 288) Thirdly, he begs the question and ignores what he admits is massive counter-evidence when he asserts that no "serious thinker" is interested any longer in irony and "pure" literature and then refers the reader to Marxist critics as his major gesture at documentation. Fourthly, he arrogantly promulgates an inconsistent (i.e., vaguely "dialectical") and specious historicism. He assumes that once the dialectical juggernaut of history has rolled over some unpleasant literary phenomenon, sublating the supposed essence of that phenomenon to its perpetually moving wheels, then that phenomenon must suffer oblivion in the desert sands, and so happy days are just around the corner or over the horizon for the rest of us, thanks again to the same lumbering and stalling dialectical conveyance. Finally, and most tellingly, Ong ignores the implications of his own mixed metaphors, as if anyone could take seriously now, without careful theoretical justification, such loaded metaphors as that of "the new orality" that is "incarnate in television" or that of "the relationship between art and nature" being a dialectical one, with each "involved in the other." These are domesticated metaphors drawn from theology and metaphysics that Ong loads only with blanks. This passage discloses the major differences between his own and Ricoeur's similar project. Where Ong claims originality and apocalyptic status and delivers cheap imitations and a facile historicism, Ricoeur refrains from any personal claims and dutifully submits his questions to the great masters of metaphor from Aristotle to Richards and Heidegger, 333</page><page sequence="6">who know as Aristotle puts it that "it is a great thing, indeed, to make a proper use of the poetical forms, as also of compounds and strange words; but the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor" [literally: to be metaphorical, to metaphorikon einai] .3 Where Ong makes minimal gestures in scattered footnotes to thinkers such as Derrida, Roland Barthes, and Ricoeur himself, some of whom one can view as being in a line of descent from Mallarm6 and Valery, Ricoeur confronts head-on and in some detail the challenge to representational thinking put by Derrida's ironic deconstruction of speculative discourse and its secret dependence on dead metaphors. Finally, where Ong presumes, as Hegel does, that his own work is a sign of the coming times, when irony will be forgotten and enlightened aping of the new orality will reign supreme, Ricouer raises as a question for long and repeated meditation and discussion the possibility of recovering the spirit of living metaphor in philosophical reflection and critical interpretation. That is, Ricoeur provides the basis, in scrupulously phrased discourse, for a hermeneutic understanding, in the "postmodern" mode, of the being of the poet. Ricoeur's The Rule of Metaphor consists of eight multidiscipli- nary studies of the creation of meaning in language, all of which were originally given as talks at the University of Toronto in the autumn of 1971 and substantially revised for both the French and English version of the book. While each study is a unique whole with its own point of view and objective, the eight studies taken together trace the history of thinking on the nature, structure, and function of metaphor from Aristotle to Derrida. Ricoeur clarifies the dynamic interplay of word, sentence, and discourse that occurs in authentic or "living" metaphor by dialectically defining-in the strong, originally Kantian sense of the term-the complex and interwoven ways metaphor has been conceived first by classical rhetoric and its later diminished tropological avatars, and then, more recently, by modern linguistic analysis, Anglo-American speech-act theory, French structuralist and post-structuralist thinking and philosophical hermeneutics. Ricoeur thereby demonstrates the systematic continuity of viewpoints on metaphor even as he takes great pains to circumscribe each approach within the arc of its own limiting problematic. But Ricoeur does so to demonstrate the discontinuities existing between the different approaches as well as to suggest the possible unity of a systematic kind that such differences evoke. By justifying the validity of each discipline within its own boundaries, Ricoeur establishes the plurality of discourses as the basis of his argument for the relative independence of and the complex interplay between poetry and thinking. At the end of the book, for example, Ricoeur whole-heartedly endorses Heidegger's formulation, from one of his later works, What Is Philosophy?, of the relationship between these twin activities of man: 334</page><page sequence="7">In concluding, I should like to retain .. this excellent statement from the later works of Heidegger: "Between these two [thinking and poetry] there exists a secret kinship because in the service of language both intercede on the behalf of language and give lavishly of themselves. Between both there is, however, at the same time an abyss for they 'dwell on the most widely separated mountains.' " (RM, p. 313) Heidegger is testifying here in the only way he can to the irony of being metaphorical in philosophical discourse, and Ricoeur agrees with him on language's power to open man up, making him the clearing of Being: What is given to thought in this way by the 'tensional' truth of poetry is the most primordial, most hidden dialectic-the dialectic that reigns between the experi- ence of belonging as a whole and the power of distanciation that opens up the space of speculative thought. (RM, p. 313) While Ricoeur and Heidegger share this double vision of poetry and thought in their intricate inter-relationship, Ricoeur's method of thinking and interpreting differs strikingly from Heidegger's leap, in the right way, into the hermeneutic circle. As Ricoeur understands Heideggerian interpretation (both here in The Rule of Metaphor and in several essays in The Conflict of Interpretations), Heidegger's approach to a text is twofold: a first phase in which he attempts "to destroy" the text by posing questions to it as a representative of the philosophical tradition that stretches from Plato to Nietzsche, questions that are posed in a language radically different from that of the text, that the text cannot possibly answer, or that the text can only be made to answer, ironically enough, by an interpreter who cannot take no answer for an answer but must coerce the text to say that which it has not said in the name of an anti-will-to-power hermeneutics; and a second phase in which an interpreter meditates upon an arbitrarily chosen set of metaphors while in the midst of reading a famous text in the tradition, with the result being that the text is displaced by the interpreter's meditation in order that Heidegger (or one of his followers) may ride upon his favorite hobby-horse once again. Rather than ape Heidegger, Ricoeur prefers to differentiate in a systematic way the conflict of interpretations that is raging in the human sciences between the hermeneutics of suspicion, as practiced by the disciples of Marx, Nietzsche, and Derrida, and the hermeneutics of recuperation, as seen in the work of Mircea Eliade, Bultmann, and Gerhard Von Rade. Ricoeur's method of interpretation, as seen in Freud and 335</page><page sequence="8">Philosophy or The Rule of Metaphor, is threefold: a first phase in which Ricoeur articulates the differences that exist in the philosophical tradition between opposing sides of an issue, in the language of the thinkers themselves; a second phase in which Ricoeur demonstrates the conceptual and metaphorical affinities between opposing thinkers in a contemporary debate and then between these present opponents and their precursors in the tradition; and finally, a third phase in which Ricoeur speculates on the nature and structure of a possible future synthesis of all these opposing positions that the very activity of thinking seems to promise, a synthesis that Ricoeur now steadfastly refuses to do anything other than to propose. Deferring all synthetic resolutions and maintaining a critical stance towards them allows Ricoeur to resist the temptation to create either comforting myths of wholeness, unity and order, or self-indulgent visions of apocalypse, of the "end" of this, that, or the other. Ricoeur is an example of the modern ironic thinker par excellence, who has mastered his irony. So in The Rule of Metaphor Ricoeur attempts to enact his dialectic hermeneutics by making a harmonious choir of differing voices, all of which speak from their own perspectives of the question raised by each of them in their own way, viz., can philosophical or speculative discourse repeat in a faithful and an explicit fashion the implicit ontology of living metaphor. Ricoeur attempts to describe the essential features of this ontology, what he calls "the truth of being" in metaphor, by saying that "living," creative metaphor is "that rhetorical process of transposing and transmuting semantic differences by which discourse unleashes the power certain fictions have to redescribe reality." (RM, p. 324) Thus Ricoeur begins and, in a sense, ends with Aristotle. He accepts initially that latter's definition of metaphor (drawn from the Poetics) as "giving the thing a name that belongs to something else; the transference being either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy," (RM, p. 13) only to discover already implicit in this definition, perhaps despite Aristotle's systematic intentions, the basis for a tension theory of metaphor as "impertinent predication," rather than just the authority behind the traditional conception of metaphor as "deviant denomination." (RM, p. 4) In a painstaking way, the book shifts its focus from the metaphorical word, to the metaphorical attribution and judgment (the sentence), and from Classical rhetoric to semiotics and semantics, in order to develop a hermeneutic understanding of metaphor as it animates the various discourses of the human sciences. For an example of how Ricoeur elicits from a text-rather than coerces from it-meanings implied in it but previously not spelled out by it, we must turn to his discussion of Aristotle's analysis of the metaphor of the sun's creative action at a distance-"sowing a god-created flame"-found originally in Homer. Ricoeur sees in Aristotle's analysis of the metaphor of "sowing" here not just the presentation of a specific 336</page><page sequence="9">example of how the poet substitutes a rich and strange figure for a properly literal and univocal expression, but he also sees the fundamentals of the description of metaphor as a rhetorical process of making absurd judgments, based upon implicit resemblances between sets of differences, which raises what Gilbert Ryle terms a "category mistake" to the level of high art. For Ricoeur looking through the lens of Aristotle's text, this metaphor says that the sun both is and is not as as the sowing of seed. That is, the metaphor discloses the being of the sun fully as active, alive, rather than presumes it must be mechanical and dead, and yet it does so while still preserving the unique phenomenon of the sun's shining. "To present man 'as acting' and all things 'as in act'-such could well be the ontological function of metaphorical discourse, in which every dormant potentiality of existence appears as blossoming forth, every latent capacity for action as actualized."4 Ricoeur's view of metaphor is clearly complex and intricate-for example, he attempts to spell out the significance of this implicit, apophantic "as" present in all metaphors-and so I cannot hope to do full justice to that view here. But by following his lead (in his opening and closing studies) and contrasting his view with Derrida's critique of metaphor, perhaps, I can suggest the general significance of Ricoeur's work for literary criticism. In his "White Mythology" Derrida expands Martin Heidegger's assertion (from Der Satz vom Grund) that "the metaphorical exists only within the boundaries of metaphysics" (as the imaginary focal point does within a circle) by claiming that in philosophical discourse "dead" metaphor, whose figurative lineaments have been effaced by chronic wear and tear, is actually the central device for transposing the sensible into the non-sensible-the major performance of philosophical discourse-and so for reproducing the still-born metaphysics of presence, which Derrida sees as haunting all Western thinking. The metaphysical edifice, to mix metaphors here, is thus not founded upon the systematic basis of univocal concepts (as Aristotle in his Metaphysics desires), but upon the trembling ground of double-entendre. By "deconstructing" this foundation, that is, by exposing the hollow traces and white spaces of dead metaphor that secretly mark even the apparently most solid and opaque of metaphysical bricks, Derrida is able to put into radical question the entire abstract structure of the history of philosophy from Plato to Husserl. Derrida believes that metaphor in philosophy "died" repeatedly so that the idea may rise again: "Metaphysics.. .has effaced in itself that fabulous scene which brought it into being, and which yet remains, active and stirring, inscribed in white ink, an invisible drawing covered over in the palimpsest" of Western metaphysics. Like Nietzsche's ironic version of the divine child of Heraclitus, who plays before the waters of mortality, repeatedly building and then destroying (before completing), houses of being, the 337</page><page sequence="10">self-deluded philosopher worships a first principle created in the image of all that he lacks, one which is made-virtually-out of nothing at all. Take, for example, the metaphor of the sun in Aristotle's Poetics. Derrida finds that it is the central metaphor informing the major texts of Western metaphysics (not to mention those of the major poets). It is the philosophical metaphor par excellence, the metaphor for metaphor, as it were. For the sun cannot be seen directly (without blinding) but only via its works of illumination and its creative efficaciousness: "A presence disappearing in its own radiance, a hidden source of light, of truth and of meaning, an obliteration of the face of being-such would be the insistent return of that which subjects metaphysics to metaphor" and vice versa. Every philosophy has its first principle of god-concept, whether it is explicitly identified as such or not, and whether it is called Reason, Nature, Life, Will, Self, Being, Eros-or truth. All these terms point to the dance of figures in the philosophical text, which discloses the philosopher-heliotrope enthralled, like Plato or Hegel, by his own ideal illusion of complete self-presence and transparency, the absolute ideal of the sun of knowledge. Consequently, Derrida concludes, no systematic reflection on metaphor is really possible, since, despite one's best (or worst) intentions, one must always speak in metaphors about metaphor, thereby revealing the only alternative course open to the suspicious hermeneut, viz., the ironically Kantian project of making everyone "recognize the conditions which make it in principle impossible to carry out [the philosophical] project." Where Kant pointed out the antitheses of human understanding to make necessary his transcendental philosophy of pure reason, Derrida's "vaster project of deconstruction," as Ricoeur rightly puts it, "consists in destroying metaphysical discourse by reduction to aporias." In short, Derrida is perhaps the devil's advocate to end all devil's advocates.5 Ricoeur's response to Derrida is essentially threefold. First, he points out Derrida's reliance upon the supposed function of "dead" metaphor in philosphical discourse. What interests Ricoeur, however, is the paradox of living metaphor. After all, what is the serious philosopher to make of the poet's figures? How is he to "complete" or make explicit in the speculative terms of philosophical reflection the ambiguous or paradoxical new meanings of authentic poetry? Secondly, Ricoeur contends that Derrida has failed to give the complete context of Heidegger's assertion about metaphor and its relation to metaphysics. According to Ricoeur, when Heidegger claims that "metaphor only exists within the boundaries of the metaphysical," he is referring to that kind of metaphor which appears in philosophy, viz., "dead" metaphor. The traditional view of metaphor is "wrong" or metaphysical, Heidegger believes, precisely because it is based on this kind of metaphor, a kind that most philosophers assume involves a simple substitution of a foreign or alien name for the proper one, as in the sentence "the King is a lion" (as 338</page><page sequence="11">opposed to "the King is a man.") So in order for Derrida to claim that all metaphor is basically metaphysical, especially the metaphors of the philosopher, and so be able to accuse all past philosophies of being deformed by the metaphysics of presence, Derrida himself must accept the very naive view of metaphor as nominal deviation and substitution he criticizes in others. (RM, pp. 290-91) Even if one grants for a moment Derrida's argument and accepts his view of metaphor, one made obsolete by Ricoeur's more complex "tensional" or dialectical view, why assume, as Derrida does, that Plato's dualistic ontology informs Aristotle's or Hegel's understanding of language? More importantly still, can anyone seriously believe that in Shakespeare's metaphor of time as a ravenous beggar there dwells in secret Western man's celebration of eternity and devaluation of existence? In such creative, living metaphors more than metaphysical views are produced. Finally, Ricoeur's third major criticism of Derrida involves his different understanding of the nature of speculative discourse. Basing himself squarely on Kant and Husserl, he argues that the speculative is what allows us to say that "to understand a (logical) expression" is something other than "finding images." It allows us to say, further, that the scope [visee] of the universal is something other than the display of images that accompany it, illustrate it .... The speculative is the very principle of the disparity [inadequation] between illustrations and intellection, between exemplification and conceptual apprehension. (RM, p. 301) In short, when a philosopher thinks, he thinks, and when he writes, well, he writes. The situation of the thinker does not involve, as Derrida would have it, some other inter-play of activities that occurs behind his back, as it were. For Ricoeur, it is the categories of human reason, and not the figures of language (however expansively conceived and identified with writing), which allow the philosopher's metaphors to disclose being. Hence, for Ricoeur, "if no metaphor is privileged," including that of the sun, "neither is any forbidden," in philosophy, since the dialectical tension of figure and concept in the living or revivified metaphors of a philosopher's text "can contribute to a Platonism of the invisible or glorify the visibility of appearance," (RM, p. 311) according to the dominating intention of the author, that "self" which the text, with "its universal power of world disclosure, gives ... to the ego."6 For Ricoeur, when a philosopher creates a text, he is re-interpreting the text of another philosopher, and he experiences as a consequence, not the recovery of that philosopher's historical period, nor of his personality, but what Hans Georg Gadamer calls "the fusion of horizons" between the creative selves inherent in both texts. The 339</page><page sequence="12">philosopher, then, would be a kind of poetic interpreter and the poet a kind of philosophical interpreter after all: "To apprehend or perceive, to contemplate, to see similarity-such is metaphor's genius-stroke, which marks the poet, naturally enough, but also the philosopher." (RM, p. 27) And would not the poet be the one, Ricoeur asks, who perceives power as act and act as power? He who sees as whole and complete what is sketchy and in process, who perceives ... things as not prevented from becoming, [but] seeing them as blossoming forth ... ev- ery form attained as a promise of newness .... In short, he who reaches "this source of the movement of natural objects, being present in them somehow, either potentially or in complete reality" (Metaphysics A 4, 1015 a 18-19), which the Greeks called phusis? (RM, p. 308) What this means is that when the philosopher speculates in an authentic fashion, sacrificing all illusions of some final synthesis and recalling the finitude of human being, he becomes a medium through which the world appears in all its richness, he becomes "a crystal man" in Stevens' phrase, who, like Eros in Plato's Symposium, reflects not Man's will-to-power over Being but Being's appearance in Man as the multi-dimensional figures of his texts, as the signs of Man's desire for Beauty. By way of offering a criticism of Ricoeur's position on metaphor, one could detail his development as a philosopher, the history of his career, the evolution of his vision, the refinements of his method.7 However interesting and useful that might be, it would not prove helpful here in answering the crucial question that his book raises for a postmodern critical audience: what does it contribute to the understanding of the current crisis in literary criticism? One way of suggesting the beginnings of an answer to this question may result by turning away from Ricoeur's abstract apotheosis of the poet in the above passage and turning to the work of Paul Valery, a central figure in the aesthetic tradition in our culture, a tradition that embraces Mallarme, Nietzsche, Pater, Yeats, Stevens and Beckett-just to name a few. For Valery, of all the others, most clearly expresses in brillant detail a vision of the poet that essentially agrees with and yet subtly puts into question Ricoeur's.8 At an early point in Monsieur Teste, an ironic portrait of the self-conscious modern intelligence, Valery, perhaps speaking seriously for a moment through his highly mannered narrative persona, describes the discourse of his fictional "master of thought" (M. Teste) as a kind of creative aphasia. "At times his words would lose all sense, seeming merely 340</page><page sequence="13">to fill a blank for which the appropriate term was still in doubt or not provided by the language." And yet, paradoxically enough, by virtue of this very privation-the founding need underlying the creation of metaphor-M. Teste's discourse possesses a hypnotic power every bit as sublime as Satan's, a capacity for speech that absorbs the listener into its intricacies until the listener feels "included among the things in [M. Teste's] mind ... remote, [and] mingled with the houses, the magnitudes of space, the shifting colors of the street, the street corners ... ." By designating concrete objects figuratively, interweaving them into an intentionally elliptical and fragmentary network of abstract philosophical speculations, metaphoric attributions, and proper names, M. Teste appears to have "renewed the universe of language" itself, dialectically reconciling its play of presence and absence, participation and distance, in the image of his own person, which has become for the willingly mystified auditor the latest (if often absurd) avatar, as it were, of the divine logos.9 I begin the concluding section of the essay with this literary anecdote because Valery, I believe, discloses here for our perverse delight that old hidden god of writing, that archetypal symbol of self-transformation, which usually stands behind all texts, smiling through their misty fissures, and which also appears to haunt the margins of these two most recent and most ambitious phenomenological analyses of the history of the human word in Western culture.10 But does not Valery's position actually anticipate and ironically undercut Ricoeur's? Not really. "Supposing truth is a woman-what then? "11 Nietzsche asked. And perhaps the answer to this question is as Yeats put it: "love has a spider's eye / To find out some appropriate pain."'12 What pain could be more appropriate in this instance than that which is necessarily involved in the desire of a modern to become a master of metaphor, viz., the pain in living the irony of being metaphorical, in seeing the sublime performances of the past masters of metaphor and in desiring to emulate their daimonic natures? To put it in other words: Valery's irony does nothing to undermine the vision of the creator as master of metaphor, rather it reinforces it by preserving it defensively until a philosopher like Ricoeur can resurrect the primal significance encased in Valery's salt. For doesn't Ricoeur's view of the poet depend as much upon Plato's conception of the daimonic in the Symposium as it does upon Aristotle's celebration of the poet in the Poetics, precisely because the latter is revising the former? From the beginning of his philosophical career Ricoeur has seen the role of the interpreter, a role the poet plays as well as the critic or philosopher, as that of a mediator between different realms of existence, a mediator who accomplishes his task of mediation by internalizing the gaps and paradoxes he repeatedly confronts in life and transforming them through his dialectic into the play of becoming, the irony of being metaphorical, the fate of producing texts-in other words, all that Valery terms the satisfactions of the Intellectual Comedy. 341</page><page sequence="14">The question that both Ricoeur's and Ong's work raises is twofold: what is the significance of the textual creation of god-images, whatever its mode: rhapsodic (Ricoeur's apotheosis of the poet), unwittingly absurd (Ong's interfacing "I"), or ironic (Valery's M. Teste); and is this phenomenon a necessary consequence of textual composition itself? Let us return to Valery for some clarification of these matters. In his "Introduction to the Method of Leonardo da Vinci," (1894) Valery begins by confessing that, confronted by the many, diverse influences of the past upon the present, the human mind naturally wishes "to place a being in our likeness at the heart of the system (of history) we impose on ourselves," a being in our likeness and yet not one of us, but one strangely different precisely because of his ability to make connections amidst differences. So Valery turns to the figure of Leonardo and constructs him according to an ideal image of mind that he needs to comprehend at the time if he is going to write at all: I propose to imagine a man whose activities are so diverse that if I postulate a ruling idea behind them all, there could be none more universal. And I want this man to possess an infinitely keen perception of the difference of things, the adventures of which perception might well be called analysis. I see him as aiming at all things: he is always thinking in terms of the universe, and of rigor. He is so formed as to overlook nothing that enters into the confusion of things; not the least shrub. He descends into the depths of that which exists for all men, but there draws apart and studies himself. He penetrates to the habits and structures of nature, he works on them from every angle, and finally it is he alone who constructs, enumerates, sets in motion.... (PV, pp. 35-36) Valery calls this creation of thought, "the symbolic mind," and defines its essence in terms of its capacity for formulating the irony of being metaphorical. "[Leonardo] has the charm of always seeming to think of something else.... So he makes sport of difficulties, and, growing bolder, he translates all his feelings with clarity into this universal language [of symbolic construction]. The abundance of his metaphorical resources makes this possible." (PV, p. 65) What Valery is saying here is almost less important than what he is doing, what he is performing. His meditation upon how one composes a text enacts a process of his own symbolic transformation. In answer to our twofold question, it would be best to adopt Blake's view of imaginative creation: one becomes what one beholds. And this process of self-creation is, in Valery's eyes, necessarily entailed by the act of writing: "the 342</page><page sequence="15">adversary link . . . the ever more accurate grouping of signs that reach towards one another until they attain the point of pure difference." (PV, p. xi) I would contend that it is at this "point of pure difference," which arises out of the dialectical interplay of signs in a text, that there develops the empty sphere of irony in which appears the figure of a god: I propose to praise Socarates, gentlemen, [Alcibiades says at the end of Plato's Symposium] by using similes. He will perhaps think that I mean to make fun of him, but my object in employing them is truth, not ridicule. I declare that he bears a strong resemblance to those figures of Silenus in statuaries' shops, represented holding pipes or flutes; they are hollow inside, and when they are taken apart you see that they contain little figures of gods.14 Both Ong and Ricoeur betray the working out of this ironic pattern of mediating the various experiences of being influenced, of encountering the sublime. But unlike Ong and, like Valery, Ricoeur recognizes this pattern and attempts to turn it to different ends. As his brillant essay, "Fatherhood: From Phantasm to Symbol,"15 makes clear, Ricoeur uses irony throughout his career to set up oppositions which only the powerful ambiguities of symbolic language can mediate. And yet, Ricoeur also inevitably suspends judgment on the question of what authority can be established on such shaky bases. As we have seen, this is why, in his final study of metaphor, Ricoeur uses Heidegger's warning (in Der Satz vom Grund) about taking metaphors metaphysically in order to check Derrida's reduction of metaphysics to pure metaphor, before Ricoeur himself then raises the following set of questions concerning one of his own most compelling (if often unacknowledged) authority-figures, Martin Heidegger: What philosopher worthy of the name prior to Heidegger has not meditated on the metaphor of the way and considered himself to be the first to embark on a path that is language itself addressing him? Who among them has not sought the "ground" and the "foundation," the "dwelling" and the "clearing"? Who has not believed that truth was "near" and yet difficult to perceive and even more difficult to say, that it was hidden and yet manifest, open and yet veiled? Who has not, in one way or another, linked the forward movement of thought to its ability to "regress," to take a step "backward"? Who has not attempted to distinguish the "beginning of thinking" from any chronological starting point? Who has not conceptualized his own task essentially as a 343</page><page sequence="16">labour of thought directed toward itself and against itself? Who has not believed that to continue one must make a break and "leap" outside the circle of accepted ideas? Who has not opposed thinking based on a horizon of knowedge based on objects, opposed meditating thought to representative thought? Who has not known that ultimately the "way" and the "place" are the same, and "method" and "thing" identical? Who has not seen that the relation between thinking and being is not a relation in the logical sense of the word, that this relation presupposes no terms preceding it but, in one way or another, constitutes the belonging -together of thinking and being? Finally, what philosopher before Heidegger has not attempted to think other than as tautology [that is, to think identity and difference together], on the basis of this belonging- together of thinking and being? (RM, pp. 311-12) What Ricoeur is doing here by means of such a proliferation of questions is demystifying the pretensions of one of his own "god-images" and doing it by means of one of Heidegger's favorite techniques, systematic interrogation. Ricoeur calls Heidegger's position into question by disclosing here "a will-to-power" and "a sort of vengefulness [against the history of philosophy conceived as a single finished text] -which Heidegger's thinking, nevertheless, calls us to renounce." (RM, p. 311) Thus Ricoeur in the final chapter of The Rule of Metaphor undermines Derrida's reductio ad absurdum of Heidegger's position and then he puts ironically into question Heidegger's own basis of authority, so as to place in the clearing that results from this ironic cancellation of figures not his own divine countenance but rather "the love of Creation"16 which interprets all things as alive and living itself as the irony of being metaphorical. For certainly doesn't Ricouer's repeated use of Aristotle's vision of the poet suggest that, perhaps, the following passage from Yeats is the most appropriate modern (or "postmodern," for that matter) text to be singled out as embodying Ricoeur's position? O Presences That passion, piety or affection knows, And that all heavenly glory symbolise- O self-born mockers of man's enterprise; VIII Labour is blossoming or dancing where The body is not bruised to pleasure soul, Nor beauty born out of its own despair, 344</page><page sequence="17">Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil. O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer, Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole? O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, How can we know the dancer from the dance?l 7 And isn't this radical questioning of all categorical divisions of being, which are executed on behalf of the technological imagination of existence, at the heart of what the term "postmodern' may mean critically?18 Isn't such questioning, which one finds expressed in the structure of Ricoeur's thinking and dramatized in Yeats's notoriously "modernist" poetry-isn't it also behind Samuel Beckett's ironic reduction of Joyce's pretensions to authorial omnipotence and of Kafka's monopoly on angst, that is, behind his otherwise grimly absurd word-play of "fundamental sounds"? The only sounds, apart from those of the body on its way, are of fall, a great drop dropping at last from a great height and bursting, a solid mass that leaves its place and crashes down, lighter particles collapsing slowly. Then the echo is heard, as loud at first as the sound that woke it and repeated sometimes a good score of times, each time a little weaker, no sometimes louder than the time before, till finally it dies away. Then, silence again, broken only by the sound, intricate and faint, of the body on its way.19 In short, doesn't the whole question of modern and postmodern admit of so many overlappings of one set of authors with another across the artificial boundary lines of periodization that the distinction itself has become radically suspicious and in need of precisely that kind of critical analysis and phenomenological description found in germ in Ricoeur's careful romance of interpretation?

This is the English translation of the 1975 La metaphore vive originally published by Editions du Seuil. Robert Czerny (with Kathleen McLaughin and John Costello, S. J.) are the translators. They have provided a scrupulously literal version of the French text. The only major deviation from the original is the title (La metaphore vive). Czerny's explanation is that he wanted to suggest both Aristotle's idea of master of metaphor and Ricoeur's increasing confrontation with the philosophy of language games and their rules, but this is unconvincing. Living Metaphor as a title would have struck the proper note of discord in the current debates about metaphor and, as well, raised the possibility of returning to a primordial understanding of the topic in the Greek sense of the word. 4 RM, p. 43. Strangely enough, Ricoeur usually ignores the abundant sexual implications of metaphor. See, for example, his discussion (pp. 285 ff.) of Derrida's term rasure. 5 RM, pp. 285 ff.

Press, 1976), pp. 94-95. 7 Some of the best secondary sources are: Patrick L.

Reagan, ed. Studies in the Philosophy of Paul Ricoeur (Athens: Ohio Univ. Press, 1978). As the recent anthology of his work-The Philosophy of Paul Ricoeur, Charles Reagan and David Stewart, eds. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1978)-demonstrates, Ricoeur's vision and method is essentially that of "suspending judgment." That is, Ricoeur begins with a redefinition of a philosophical problem in terms of an aporia which he then attempts to mediate via an elaborate dialectical exploration of the horns of this dilemma, only to postpone any final synthesis by returning to a poetic, mythological, or symbolic level of discourse, in which a ruling metaphor or set of metaphors reinstates in all its original power for provoking creative speculation some traditional expression for the radical ambivalence of human existence. By far the best image for summing up Ricoeur's vision and method is one that haunts his work from Fallible Man (1960) on: that of Eros as found in Plato's Symposium. For example, see how Ricoeur "mediates," in a radically paradoxical way, the conflict between interpreting the history of philosophy either as expression of an implicit system or as the juxtaposition of different 346</page><page sequence="19">personalities: "The encounter with history is never a dialogue; for the first condition of dialogue is that the other answer. History is that sector of communication without reciprocity. But, granting this limitation, it is a kind of unilateral friendship, like unrequited love." History and Trust, ed. and trans. Charles A. Kelbley, [Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1965], p. 37.) Hence Ricoeur does not simply conclude The Rule of Metaphor with the apotheosis of the poet, but with this ironic expression of hope for a figure who could mediate between the differing realms of the discourses on being: "One can imagine a hermeneutic style where interpretation would conform both to the notion of concept and to that of the constitutive intention of the experience seeking to be expressed in the metaphorical mode." RM, p. 303. 8 Ricoeur is aware of the dangers of such apotheosis: "Is seeing all things in act seeing them in the manner of a work of art, a result of technical production [conceived in terms of a naive analogy with the organic forms of nature] ? Would reality then come to be seen in our eyes as some vast artifice engendered by an artist's will, provided 'nothing external hinders,' as stated in Metaphysics 0 7? But does this not burden our gaze with an anthropomorphism even heavier than [previously]...." RM, p. 308.

Ricoeur examines three models of fatherhood: the Freudian model of neurotic phantasm, the Hegelian model of judicial institution, and the Christian model of self-sacrificing partner who, on the basis of a free election of relationship, allows himself to be named-but only in relationship to the word of his self-designating Son. Ricoeur suggests that the shift from Old Testament to New Testament can be seen best as the transformation of the Freudian phantasm, via the dialectic of figures instituted by the Covenant relationship, into the rich paradoxes of the symbol of the Father in the Christian experience. One could suggest that quite often Ricoeur's use of dialectic enacts a similar process in his texts. In this way, Ricoeur "masters" difference. 347</page><page sequence="20">16 Paul Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation, trans. Denis Savage (New Haven: Yale Univ.

See Ihab Hassan, "Culture, Indeterminacy, and Immanence: Margins of the (Postmodern) Age," Humanities in Society, 1 (Winter 1978), 66-68. While reluctant to define "postmodernism" in genealogical terms-primarily because many aspects of "modernism" have implicitly anticipated "postmodern" explicit concerns, still I find the distinction, the difference the terms puts into play, critically useful, if yet worthy of further questioning and analysis. 19 Samuel Beckett, "Fizzle 1," Fizzles (New York: Grove Press, Inc., 1976), p. 11.
