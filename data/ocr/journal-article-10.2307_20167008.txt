D. POHL Myth and ritual is a language of signs in terms of which claims to rights and status are expressed, but it is a language of argument, not a chorus of harmony. If ritual is sometimes a mechanism of integration, one could as well argue that it is often a mechanism of disintegration. E. R. Leach 1965:278 I Tlaxcala According to their own histories, theTlaxcalan people were among the first Chichimeca bands led by the man-god Camaxtli-Mixcoatl to enter the Basin of Mexico (Mu?oz Camargo 1984). Then after the fall of Tula around the middle of the twelfth century, they moved to the east to settle in the modern state of Tlaxcala, confederating themselves with Huexotzinco, Cholula, and a score of smaller kingdoms from Puebla to Oaxaca (see Gibson 1952; Pohl 1991, 1994a, 1994b, 1995; Pohl and Byland 1994; Garcia Cook et al. 1996). Tlaxcalan territory was divided into four pie-shaped quarters converging on a central point where government was dominated by the four highest ranking kingdoms: Tepeticpac, Quiahuiztlan, Ocotelolco, and Tizatlan (Lockhart 1992:21-23) (fig. 1). Located within a few kilometers of each other, the rulers of these kingdoms, called tlatoque, formed a governing council. The council was led by the tlatoani of Tizatlan at the time of conquest, but there is evidence of a rotational power structure rooted in a fairly equal distribution of political, religious, and economic functions. The Tepeticpac tlatoani, for example, controlled the religious cult by preserving the ashes of Camaxtli-Mixcoatl himself, while the principal market was supervised by the Ocotelolco king (Mu?oz Camargo 1984, Lockhart 1992). Each of the four tlatoque governed autonomous territories through the tetecuhtin, heads of noble estates located in the interior of their jurisdictions.1 Archaeological evidence suggests that some teccalli were larger and more prosperous than the four ranking kingdoms themselves (Garcia Cook 1981:273-274). Despite the outward appearance of a stable centralized administration, the tlatoque in fact governed Tlaxcala in the midst of profound factional tension. The tetecuhtin frequently competed with each other over inheritance rights, ownership of lands, and access to strategic resources. The debilitating effects of militant factionalism, on the other hand, were neutralized through a system of feasts that bound the Tlaxcalan nobility together into networks of mutual dependence. Timed to the 260-day sacred calendar or tonalpohualli, moveable feasts in particular involved lavish outlays of exotic gifts and food, and especially intoxicating drink, intended to create obligations and indebtedness that fueled a system of elite reciprocity. The settings for these revolving feasts were the palaces of the tetecuhtin and tlatoque themselves (Mu?oz Camargo 1984:195-200). In 1927 excavations by the Mexican Department of Archaeology, Secretary of Education uncovered the remains of the Postclassic palace at Tizatlan including a room containing two polychrome altar-ofrenc/as (Caso 1927, Noguera 1927). In 1990 a third painted altar constructed against a painted masonry bench was discovered in a similar context at Ocotelolco by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog?a e Historia (Contreras 1993, 1994). Together these finds provide us with a fixed architectural setting, a communicative environment as it were, for iconographie studies of imagery associated with palace drinking and feasting. First I will examine the iconography of the altars by relating them to symbolism found on associated ritual objects including codices, polychrome pottery, and greenstone statuary. Next, I will show that the overarching theme presented on the altars is specifically that of thetzitzimime, who were personifications of deceased gods, celestial bodies, and patrons of the divisions of the 260-day ritual calendar. According to the religious stories commemorated with codices, This study of theTzitzimime benefitted from discussions with Elizabeth Boone, Cecelia Klein, and Peter Thomashow. The author is also grateful to the participants in the 1996 UCLA Department of Art History Symposium, "What Rituals Did: Mexico and Peru, 1200-1700," for comments made on a preliminary examination of the paintings. I thank Jeffrey Quilter for inviting me to explore my ideas further with my colleagues at the 1996 Dumbarton Oaks Round Table Pre-Columbian States of Being. 1. James Lockhart (1992:104) emphasizes that the kingdoms of Tlaxcala and Puebla were distinct from those around the Basin of Mexico in that they emphasized the power and autonomy of the tecuhtli as head of a teccalli, or "lineage estate," over that of the calpulli and tecpan. This emphasis may have evolved in response to the pronounced interaction with Oaxacan kings with whom they were so frequently allied. The tecuhtli is in many ways the direct equivalent of the Mixtee yya and the Zapotee cocijo.</page><page sequence="3">186 RES 33 SPRING 1998 TLAXCALA |^~??&gt; LORD TLEHUEXOLOTZIN TEPETICPAC LORD MAXIXCATZIN OCOTELOLCO LORD XICOTENCATL TIZATLAN LORD CITLALPOPOCATZIN QUIAHUIZTLAN Figure 1. Control of Tlaxcala was divided between four kingdoms, but a central administration was maintained by a council of the ranking tlatoque. Each of the four rulers living in 1521 was portrayed in illustrations accompanying an edition of the Historia de Tlaxcala by Mu?oz Camargo preserved in The Library of the University of Glasgow, Scotland. They wear a red and white headband as a sign of their position (Nicholson 1967). The Tlaxcalan elite distinguished themselves from other Aztec peoples, such as the Mexica, by advocating a separate origin legend and a special relationship with the culture hero, Camaxtli-Mixcoatl, whose ashes they claimed to preserve. Drawing: John M. D. Pohl. pottery, statues, and the altars, theTzitzimime were born from factional strife among the gods at the time of creation and cast out of their paradise to wreak death and destruction on mankind through disease, drought, and warfare. It appears that the Aztecs of Tlaxcala not only recognized factionalism and social violence as a fact of political life, they were even celebrated in allegory during feasts and drinking bouts as primordial events of cosmic creation. II The Ocotelolco Altar At Ocotelolco, a 47-cm-high masonry bench was constructed along eight meters of the north wall of a room and painted with a series of alternating skulls, human hearts, hands, and shields (Contreras 1993, 1994). The frieze clearly connects the benches to the ornamentation of Tlaxcalan polychrome drinking vessels and therefore to the Tlaxcalan drinkers that attended feasts in this room. At the center of the frieze, a square altar was constructed with a base that projects 84 cm forward from the bench. It is lavishly painted on three sides with eight anthropomorphic serpents, in Codex Borgia style, descending over a black and white painted geometric background.2 The altar's south face also 2. Contreras (1993, 1994) identifies them as xiuhcoatl, personifications of the god Xiuhtecuhtli as Fire Serpents. Anthropomorphic serpents abound in Aztec religious stories.

The center of the cartouche contains an anthropomorphic flint, an arrow, and a banner set upon a rectangular octli basin painted with eyes and a skeletal jaw. Behind the basin sits a large black serpent (fig. 2). By some accounts the personified flint was said to be the sacred cult object of Camaxtli-Mixcoatl. The original Serpent" and "Plumed Serpent" respectively. According to the Histoyre du Mechique, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca once transformed themselves into two giant serpents in order to separate the earth from the sky (Garibay 1973:108) The Mixtees called the Aztecs as an ethnic group Jay Yecoo, or "Serpent Men," and they appear as such in Codex Vindobonensis (Smith 1973:209).</page><page sequence="5">188 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Chichimecs who left Chicomoztoc were led by the four hundred Mixcoa (Cloud Snakes). At one point in their journey they were attacked by the goddess Itzpapalotl (Obsidian Butterfly). According to another legend, she was one of the gods who had been cast from paradise as theTzitzimime (Qui?ones Keber 1995:183, 255, 265-266). After falling to earth, Itzpapalotl devoured all but two of the Mixcoa: Camaxtli and Mimich. Camaxtli and Mimich then trapped Itzpapalotl, shot her to death with arrows, and resurrected their brothers. When the Mixcoa burned Itzpapalotl's body, flints appeared in the colors of the four sacred world directions: blue, white, yellow, and red. Camaxtli selected the white flint and folded it into his sacred bundle (Bierhorst 1992:23, 152-153; Mu?oz Camargo 1984:147; Pohl n.d.). By other accounts the flint was a reliquary object dedicated to the goddess Citlalicue-Cihuacoatl (Starskirt Snake Woman). Citlalicue was a personification of the Milky Way who guarded the first level of heaven (Garibay 1973:69; Klein 1988, 1997). As an avatar for Cihuacoatl, she was also invoked by midwives and curers together with Chalchiuhtlicue, the water goddess (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 2:155, book 6:159-160, 179-180). Citlalicue-Cihuacoatl is portrayed in art as a Tzitzimitl (see Klein 1997). According to legend, Citlalicue-Cihuacoatl once gave birth to a knife blade that she treated as her child by keeping it in a cradle. When her sons learned of the object, they were enraged and hurled it to earth. The flint struck at Chicomoztoc, the seven caves of creation, and 1,600 gods burst forth from its body (Mendieta 1971:77; Sahagun 1977:1:46-47).3 The entire complex on the front of the Ocotelolco altar is clearly related to the ceremony being enacted on page 32 of Codex Borgia, which involves the supernatural emergence of Quetzalcoatl together with fourTezcatlipoca from flints attached to the body of a giant decapitated stellar demon, either Itzpapalotl or Citlalicue (fig. 2). The connection between the scene painted on the altar and the ritual page from Codex Borgia is significant. Karl Nowotny (1961) proposed that this section of Codex Borgia was in fact a prescription for the ritual enactment of feasts that were to be performed in ceremonial plazas and chambers like that excavated at Ocotelolco. Four calendrical signs?flower, eagle, serpent, and dog?in the Borgia scene clearly indicate time periods in the 260-day calendar that were appropriate to enacting the feast. While Spanish chroniclers wrote extensively on the 18 annual "fixed" veintana ceremonies (festivals celebrated at 20-day intervals) that were calculated by the Aztecs to the 365-day solar year, substantially less is known of the "moveable" feasts that were timed to the 260-day divinatory calendar (see Kubier and Gibson 1951). It is clear from Sahag?n's writings, however, that they were largely celebrated in the palaces by the elite themselves, in articulation with the public markets that were also calculated to the 260-day calendar (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 4:138; Duran 1971:273-286).4 The sixteen moveable feasts (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 2) 1. Four Ollin (Tonatiuh, the Fifth Sun) 2. Seven Flower (Xochipilli-Tonacatecuhtli-Piltzintecuhtli) 3. One Deer (The Cihuateteo) 4. Two Tochtli (The Pulque Gods) 5. One Flower (Centeotl) 6. One Reed (Quetzalcoatl) 7. One Death (Tezcatlipoca) 8. One Rain (The Cihuateteo) 9. Four Wind (A Merchants Feast) 10. One Grass (Tezcatlipoca, Tetzauhteotl) 11. One Flint (Camaxtli-Mixcoatl) 12. One Monkey (The Cihuateteo) 13. One Dog (Xiuhtecuhtli) 3. According to Codex Telleriano Remensis, Citlalicue's children included Itzpapalotl, Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, and others who were later themselves cast out of heaven for their transgressions as Tzitzimime (Qui?ones-Keber 1995:255, 265). While some Aztec religious stories differentiate Citlalicue-Cihuacoatl from Itzpapalotl, others suggest that they were one in the same spirit being. Cecelia Klein (1997), Elizabeth Boone (1997), and Karl Taube (1993) have all discussed the close iconographie similarities between these deities and otherTztitzimime like Coatlicue and Mayahuel. In Torquemada's version of the Camaxtli Mixcoatl story, the hero's nemesis is called Quilaztli, a name not only given to Cihuacoatl incarnated as a giant eagle, but also to Itzpapalotl incarnated as a two-headed deer. (Torquemada 1986:1:80-81; Sahag?n 1950-1982, book 2:236; Garibay 1973:40). 4. Hassig (1985:67-84) proposes that the 260-day calendar evolved in Mesoamerica as a device for creating periodicity over regional market systems. If so, periodicity was clearly dictated by elite control of the divinatory calendars and therefore through synchronization with their own rotating system of moveable feasts. There were laws that compelled sellers to attend the markets. Market dates were based on five-day intervals, or maquiltianquiztli, throughout any given region. This was an important unit of periodization with regard to the celebration of calendar days dedicated to the Cihuateteo and the Maquiltonaleque as well. Duran said that markets were haunted by gods who threatened terrible ills and made evil omens and auguries against neighboring villages that did not attend (Duran 1971:273-274).</page><page sequence="6">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 189 Figure 3.

One Water (The Cihuateteo) 15. Feasts dedicated to the birthdays of noble children. 16. Feasts dedicated to noble marriages. Other moveable feasts are named in Books 4 and 9. Two feasts were celebrated every four and eight years dedicated to other rites of passage. Sahag?n describes over 20 feasts calculated to the 260-day divinatory calendar, not including days for celebrating the births, marriages, and deaths of individuals. A considerable proportion of these days are dedicated to the gods deemed to have been Tzitzimime, particularly the calendrical deities known as the Cihuateteo. It is no accident then that the signs for so many of these same feast days appear carved into surviving greenstone statues that were once placed on altars like that at Ocotelolco as the primary expression of the religious cult activated at the feast (Mu?oz Camargo 1984:197). The so-called Bilimec Vessel preserved in the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Vienna, is a case in point. This unique stone basin portrays the day sign "Grass" personified as Malinalteotl and possibly the Tzitzimitl Ahuiateotl-Maquiltonal as well (Seler 1990-1996:2: 199-227; Jansen 1986:102-103) (fig. 3). Above the projecting face of the demon are pictographic carvings of smaller stellar Tzitzimime attacking a sun disk partially obscured by a night sky, the symbol for a solar eclipse (see Taube 1993:3, 6-7). The feast day of 4 Motion carved into the center of the sun disk symbolizes the fifth and final age of mankind when the world would be destroyed by earthquakes and famine (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 7:2, 34; Bierhorst 1992:26). Two other dates are carved on the vessel, 8 Flint and 1 Rabbit. 8 Flint was addressed in prayer as the personification of the fermented drink octli (Ruiz de Alarc?n 1982:315). 1 Rabbit was a calendrical name for Citlalicue-Cihuacoatl (Alarc?n 1982:203). The back of the Bilimec vessel portrays the goddess herself. Her decapitated head has fallen backwards, her outstretched claws hold giant flints, and octli, equated with the goddess's milk, spurts forth from her breasts into a vessel at her feet (fig. 4). Karl Taube proposed that the Bilimek Vessel specifically names the day 1 Mallinalli (Taube 1993). Stone images dedicated to the feast day 1 Mallinalli and the following day 2 Reed are specifically described by Sahag?n as being transported between the houses of</page><page sequence="7">190 RES 33 SPRING 1998 STONE SCULPTURE Generalizes feasting with the Tzitzimime and the dead Figure 4. Examining an articulated complex of pottery, benches, codices, and statues as a whole, one perceives a fascinating dichotomy in the use of the Tzitzimitl iconography in the moveable feasts at Ocotelolco. While the benches and pottery are ambiguous in their portrayal of the basic theme of human skulls, hearts, and hands; the statues, codices, and altars clearly specify what feast day was to be celebrated, what god the feast was to be dedicated to, and how the rituals to that god were to be enacted.

[One Grass] One who felt devotion took it to his house that it might bless him and cause his goods to increase. And when this took place, he kept it and preferred not to let it go.

Painting it in the same manner as Tezcatlipoca, they ornamented it when they placed it... to take it, would go he who earlier had wished to guard it in his home . . . there was feasting and drinking in his home. And when it grew dark there was drunkenness. Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 4:56 While the Bilimec Vessel may be dedicated to the feast day 1 Grass, there is also a greenstone mask carved with the day sign 2 Reed preserved in the Dumbarton Oaks collection in Washington, D.C. It bears a specific qualifying attribute of Tezcatlipoca, the smoking mirror at its right temple. Omacatl, or more properly Ome Acatl, is the the N?huatl name for 2 Reed, the god of banquets (see Seler 1990-1996:2:266).

Ill The Tizatlan altar-o/renc/as Although a masonry altar of roughly the same dimensions as that at Ocotelolco was built into the north end of a room at Tizatlan, it was apparently left unpainted. Instead, artisans applied comparable imagery to two low, rectangular platforms set into the center of the room before two sets of half columns. The length of the platforms suggests that more could be arranged upon them than simply sacred bundles, greenstone statues, or other paraphernalia employed in palace rituals. Their size and dimensions also infer that they may have served as a kind of table called an "ofrenda" for the display of special arrangements of gifts, foods, and drink dedicated to the spirits of the dead in Tlaxcalan households today (Nutini 1988). In the present discussion, I will call them altar-o/renc/as. The paintings on the Tizatlan altar-o/renc/as replicate the themes found at Ocotelolco. Altar A is located on the west side. It is 1.80 m long, 1.2 m wide, and 370 cm high (Caso 1927, Noguera 1927, Garc?a Cook 1986). Like the Ocotelolco benches, the sides of Altar A are painted with friezes of human skulls, hearts, hands, and shields?the icons of the Tzitzimime (fig. 5). The front, however, displays two facing images of the gods Tezcatlipoca and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (fig. 6). Both are related ?conographically and conceptually with the Tlaxcalan patron god Camaxtli-Mixcoatl (see Pohl 1994b:93-95). Tezcatlipoca is recognizable by his black-and-yellow-striped face paint and the substitution of a mirror for one foot (Spranz 1973:181-205). He carries a shield and banner in his left hand and a spear thrower in his right. Behind him an elaborate ornamental bundle or bag is painted. Similarities in pose and dress associate this ?mage of the "god of discord" with Borgia pages 21 and 17. The opposing image of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is recognizable by his fleshless skull and red-and-white striped body (Spranz 1973:246-262). He is carrying a shield and banner in his left hand and perhaps wields an axe in his right. Behind him appears a large disembodied serpent head. A flint is inserted into its mouth from which blood gushes forth. The image of the bloody serpent specifically associates this scene with page 19 of Codex Borgia in which Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is depicted cutting down one of the sacred trees of Tamoanchan. The significance of these two deities is clear. According to one cycle of Tzitzimitl stories, the gods originally resided in peace and harmony in a great celestial paradise called Tamoanchan where they were ruled by Tonacatecuhtli and his wifeTonacacihua (also known as Xochiquetzal) (L?pez Austin 1994, Beyer 1965). Eventually they were divided over a magnificent garden of flowery trees. When Mixcoatl, Itzpapalotl, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Mictlantecuhtli, among others, wished to eat the flowers, they destroyed the trees by ripping off the branches causing human blood to spew forth from the trunks. Tonacatecuhtli was so outraged at the destruction of the sacred flowers that he cast the gods out of paradise, and so they became theTzitzimime and fell to earth as stars (Codex Vaticanus A [Kingsborough 1831-1848] Codex Teleriano Remensis [Qui?ones Keber 1995:255, ALTAR A Figure 5. The sides of Tizatlan Altar A portray a painted series of alternating human skulls, hearts, hands, and shields?a very common motif painted on Catalina feasting wares (A). This motif is emblematic of the Tzitzimime.

Pohl.</page><page sequence="9">192 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 6. The left-hand painted panel of Tizatlan Altar A depicts Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, in attack position, before the bloody mouth of a giant snake. (A) The scene is clearly related to Codex Borgia, page 19, where the stellar Tzitzimitl is hacking apart the tree of Tamoanchan before the same snake. (B) The right-hand panel depicts the god Tezcatlipoca in ritual dress and pose that equates him with Codex Borgia, pages 17 and 21. Drawing: John M. D. Pohl. 265-266]). The broken tree was a traditional symbol of the discord between Aztec factions. When the members of the Chichimec tribe were making their epic Odyssey into the Basin of Mexico, they were frightened by a tree that was miraculously ripped asunder. The Mexica band took it as a sign that their god, Huitzilopochtli, wished them to take a separate path, and so the seven tribes divided (Torquemada 1986:78). Altar B is located on the east side. It is 1.90 m long, 1.12 m wide, and 370 cm high. The sides portray a much more elaborate frieze consisting of two bands of alternating skulls, hearts, hands, blankets, splashing water, thorns used as bloodletters, and scorpions. A sequence of crosses painted in the colors of the four world directions surmounts a black and white stepped fret fringe around the base of the painting. It suggests a large woven cover over the altar (see Klein 1997) (fig. 7). While most of the signs are consistent with the Tzitzimitl imagery under discussion, the scorpion is unique. Scorpions were ground into hallucinogenic potions that were either drunk or smoothed over the body and absorbed through the skin. Their poison was also used as a medicine to cure the sick (Duran 1971:115-11 7).5 Before the scorpion there was Yappan, the archetype of the penitent spending all of his time praying fasting, and castigating himself through auto sacrifice. Citlalicue and Chalchiuhtlicue foresaw that as a reward for his extreme devotion, Yappan was to be transformed into a scorpion, but his venom would kill many people. The goddesses sent Xochiquetzal, the patroness of love affairs, to corrupt Yappan and diminish his potency. In religious symbolism, his stinger then signified the penitent who sheds blood from his body with instruments of auto-sacrifice to atone for his sins (Alarc?n 1982, 1984; Serna 1987:381-382). The scorpion is also a symbol of the purification rituals dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli and Chalchiuhtlicue according 5. The scorpion was invoked as a stellar constellation, possibly Scorpio (Spinden 1916:59-60). Poisonous insects like scorpions were used in curing (Duran 1971:11 7). Insect venom affects both the immune and neurological systems. Venom derived from bees, in particular, is currently employed in a somewhat unorthodox treatment of the debilitating effects of arthritis and multiple sclerosis, for example. Venom is also used in the production of antivenin.</page><page sequence="10">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 193 to Sahag?n (1950-1982:Book 6:41). Codex Borgia pages 13 and 69 and Codex Fejervary Mayer page 27 juxtapose the scorpion with both gods as well. Significantly, the front of the altar portrays codex-style scenes concerning these same rites. The front, right-hand panel of Altar B depicts the place sign for a river unnamed, except for an abstract fish or jewel and some shells. A figure painted as Quetzalcoatl kneels upon the water making an offering of a ritual stick bundle (see Pohl and Byland 1996). Quetzalcoatl is joined in this ceremony by Tonacatecuhtli and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. In the lower left-hand corner appears the partially destroyed face of the rain god Tlaloc. The image in the lower right-hand corner is unidentifiable (Caso 1927, Noguera 1927, Garc?a Cook 1986) (fig. 8). The left-hand panel also portrays a river place-sign, but within it swims a woman sporting the nose ornament frequently associated with the Tlaxcalan water goddess Matlalcueye-Chalchiuhtlicue for whom the nearby volcano is named (Spranz 1973:32). Above, Quetzalcoatl again kneels upon the water making an offering of stick bundles, but this time he is accompanied by Tonacatecuhtli and Xiuhtecuhtli. In the lower right and left-hand corners appear a jaguar and an eagle. The imagery on Altar B is dedicated to both the purification rituals prescribed for children at their birth and to the "baptism" and naming ceremony held later in the house of the child's father (Motolonia 1950:59-60; Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 2:39). While the portrayal of the woman in the water clearly relates to that of Matlalcueye Chalchiuhtlicue on page 65 of Codex Borgia, the place sign can also stand for an actual spring called Chalchiuatl, or "water of the green stones," where Tlaxcalan children were ritually purified (Mu?oz Camargo 1984:55). The rituals at birth were described in detail by Sahag?n: And the midwife had arranged the baby, when she had cut his navel cord, then she bathed him, she proceeded to address him. She said to him if male: "Approach thy mother Chalchiuhtlicue, Chalchiuhtlatonac! May she receive thee! May she remove, may she transfer the filthiness which thou hast taken from thy mother, from thy father! May she cleanse thy heart; may she make it fine, good! May she give thee fine, good conduct!" . . . Then the midwife took the water; she breathed upon it; then she made the baby taste it; she touched his chest and his head [with the water]. Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 6:175-182. The midwife addressed both the child and the mother with lengthy prayers and admonitions calling upon ALTAR B \ \ \ Figure 7. In addition to a painted frieze of skulls, hearts, and hands, Tizatlan Altar B also portrays bloodletters, mantas or capes, and scorpions finished with a black and white stepped fret fringe.

Codex Vindobonensis 34 elaborates by showing Lord 9 Wind "Quetzalcoatl" performing a ritual at the Jewel River that is nearly identical to that on the Tizatlan Altar B paintings. The significance of the Jewel River ceremony in Mixtee contexts may be found in an analysis of two important scenes involving the first ancestors. On both Bodley 39-40 III and Vindobonensis 34, Lord 5 Wind marries Lady 9 Crocodile. They produce inhuman offspring however including a deer and a rabbit. Codex Bodley next depicts the place-sign for Jewel River (Chalchiautl at Tlaxcala). Then the couple are shown "marrying" again, as if trying a second time to produce children, and this time succeeding with over twenty-five generations of offspring. The implication is that the water rites under discussion are what allow the nobility to produce "human" offspring.</page><page sequence="11">194 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 8.

TheTzitzimime known as the Cihuateteo were the patronesses of women who died in childbirth (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 6:161). By invoking a principal that what causes misfortune also cures it, the midwives were known to pay special honor to them (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 4:93). There are no major religious stories that link Chalchiuhtlicue with Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca in any detail. The separation of theTizatlan altar-o/renc/as further suggests that they were dedicated to two distinct rituals, possibly accounting for their separation from the central altar itself (fig. 9). I examined the possibility of the story of the destruction of Tamoanchan in regard to the image of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli on Altar A. A famous greenstone statue of this god preserved in the W?rttembergisches Landesmuseum, Stuttgart, bears the day-signs of many of the principal moveable feasts discussed above. We may envision the invocation of the rituals calculated according to the feasts dedicated to Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli by the placing of the statue on the central altar at the appropriate times. It is significant that the famous Dumbarton Oaks greenstone statue of a goddess giving birth is not inscribed with any of the principal moveable feast days, for these feasts were determined according to the birthdate of each individual and therefore entirely variable. W The TzitzimitI theme It is apparent in examining the painted benches, altars, and ofrendas, together with polychrome ceramics, idols, and codices that the predominant iconographie theme of Tlaxcalan royal feasts was the celebration of theTzitzimime, a category of Erinys-like spirit beings that personified indigenous belief in a relationship between disease, drought, war, sacrifice, death, and divine castigation (see Boone 1997 for discussion).

Pohl. hands and feet, teeth and eyes at its joints, a necklace of human hands and hearts, and a fleshless skull surmounted by a headdress of sacrificial banners (fig. 6). The Tzitzimime were most feared during climactic events, especially eclipses, when they were to emerge as stars from their nighttime world to attack the sun and bring an end to the present age of mankind (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 7:2; Book 8:2; Qui?ones Keber 1995:255). For this reason, a number of important calendrical days were dedicated to the feasts of the Tzitzimime including the New Fire Ceremony that concluded the end of each 52-year cycle. There was also a fertility aspect to their cult for they were said to come from the clouds bringing rain, water, thunder, and lightening (Alvarado Tezozomoc 1 983:403, 451 ). Most importantly the Tzitzimime were associated with the chaos induced with drunkenness and violent discord in Aztec religious stories and in the royal feasts themselves (Seler 1990-1996, Taube 1993). The Tzitzimime were primarily equated with a series of calendrical deities known as the Cihuateteo and the Maquiltonaleque (or Ahuiateteo). According to Sahag?n, there was always great apprehension during their feast days: 1 House, 1 Deer, 1 Monkey, 1 Eagle, and 1 Rain, signs dedicated to the west (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 4) (fig. 10). For example, Codex Telleriano Remensis states that the day 1 House was: considered bad because they say that on that day the demons came from the skies above in the form of women that we call witches. It was commonly said of them that they went about the crossroads and in isolated and hidden places. Qui?ones Keber 1995:265 while Sahag?n recorded the day 1 Rain as: full of evil, vice, misery, orphanhood, affliction, suffering, anguish, misfortune, and indigence.

Sahag?n 1950-1982: Book 4:41 The Maquiltonaleque were the consorts of the Cihauteteo and presided over the feast days 5 Lizard, 5 Rabbit, 5 Grass, 5 Vulture, and 5 Flower, signs dedicated to the south (Seler 1990-1996:1:63-66; Taube 1993) (fig. 11). The diviners who used the 260-day calendars in the codices to foretell the future even invoked the Maquiltonaleque as their own fingers, describing them as the "pearly headed" Tzitzimime (Alarc?n 1982:210)7 Apparently these gods were given special attention in Tlaxcalan palaces. An image dedicated to a Maquiltonal was once displayed in theTizatlan palace's main patio. It was described by Spanish friars who saw it as a frightening apparition of the dead (Torquemada 1986:3: 201). More recently, a polychrome plate depicting the head of the black Maquiltonal of Codex Borgia was excavated at Ocotelolco (Contreras 1993, 1994).8 There is evidence that the Tzitzimime also represented the spirits or ghosts of deceased gods. We know that the Tlaxcalans preferred to cremate the elite dead. There was consequently no cult of deified ancestors calculated through sacred codical histories of over 25 generations of primogeniture and descent like those that appear in the Mixtee codices. Rather the tetecuhtin and tlatoque were elected to their positions through a series of ritual promotions sponsored by their families, relatives, allies, and the priests of Quetzalcoatl at Cholula (Carrasco 1966, Rounds 1977, Pohl 1994a, 1994b). Only a few Aztec cremation urns have ever been found. Those that are ornamented portray images of gods like Tezcatlipoca and Mixcoatl indicating that after cremation, the identity of the deceased was subliminated to the identity of the god to whom he was dedicated (Matos Moctezuma 1988:72-73). In some cases it is very clear that the Tzitzimime represent malevolent alter egos of Aztec gods. The Anales de Cuauhtitlan, describe how the culture hero Quetzalcoatl was tricked by his rival, Tezcatlipoca, into drinking the forbidden fifth cup of octli, sleeping with 7. Lacandon diviners believe their hands to be the transmitters of messages from the gods (Tozzer 1982:195-196; L?pez Austin 1993:139). A white human hand ornaments the mouths of the Maquiltonaleque, possibly signifying that these TzitzimitI are the spirits of the diviners themselves. During my 1997 Aztec-Mixtec workshop at Austin, Texas, Peter Seleverstone proposed that the elite themselves could have manipulated the assignment of prophecies at birth through their control of the tonalpohualli and the subsequent bathing and naming ceremonies that followed, in a sense predetermining the careers of their people. His observation is supported by the social inequalities in the designation of birthdays, bathings, and prophecies noted by Sahag?n (1950-1982, book 4:113). Control over the assignment of each individual's tonal, or "soul/' in Tlaxcalan society would have been a powerful elite device for maintaining class structure. 8. This splendid specimen is a rare example of a human ?mage in the Catalina polychrome tradition (Lind 1994). Contreras (1994:21) identified the head as Tezcatlipoca on the basis of its yellow and black bands of color. This imagery is shared with the black Maquiltonal, however. I believe the latter identification is more consistent with the fact that the eye of the face is closed in death. The headdress features paper rosettes and streamers that commonly ornament the Maquiltonaleque in particular and images of the dead in general.</page><page sequence="14">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 197 Figure 11.

Civil war broke out between the followers of the two man-gods. Driven from Toi Ian, Quetzalcoatl wandered throughout southern Mexico preaching his doctrine until he arrived at the Veracruz coast where he died. While his body was cremated upon a pyre, his spirit was transformed into the morning star, the arch Tzitzimitl, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. Resurrected as such, Quetzalcoatl was then believed to punish sinners and transgressors during his regular stellar appearances on the sky's horizon (Bierhorst 1992:36). In similar fashion, the Cihuateteo and the Maquiltonaleque represented malevolent avatars of the transformed gods. The Maquiltonal 5 Flower, in fact, was also known as Maquilxochitl, the benevolent god of feasting, lovemaking, and gambling, while the Cihuateteotl 1 Eagle, in fact, was the avatar of the goddess Xochiquetzal, patroness of royal women, and 1 House was the calendrical name of the Chichimec deity Itzpapalotl, who was destroyed by the Mixcoa. Despite their fierce characteristics, there appears to have been a more beneficent aspect to TzitzimitI cults, and they were called "angels of the air and sustainers of the sky" (Alvarado Tezozomoc 1980:358). Serna said that the Cihuateteo were also the clouds that brought the first heavy showers of the year (Serna 1987:430). This clearly connected them to the worship of the royal dead, forTlaxcalans believed that their kings and queens were transformed into clouds when they passed to the other world (Mendieta 1971:97).9 The connection between feasting with the dead and fertility cults is not as strange as one might think. The Hopi conceive of kachinas as both the souls of the dead and the bringers of rain. Many Indian peoples, in fact, believe themselves to be physical conduits for gods and ancestors during feasts. By gorging, they feed the gods. By drinking to excess, they provide the gods with liquid nourishment. The gods are then asked to reciprocate by giving of themselves in the form of ripe corn and plentiful water. The Papago, for example, perform rainmaking ceremonies that feature the fermenting and drinking of a liquor made from cactus fruit. At a high point in the festivities, the liquor is offered to men representing the sacred four directions with the exhortation: "Drink friends! Get beautifully drunk! Hither bring the wind and the cloud" (Underhill 1949:59)10 V Demons, drunkenness, and social violence Excessive drinking was a particular characteristic of the moveable feasts, and we have seen that the Tzitzimime in general were closely associated in legend with drunkenness and social chaos (Serna 1987:349-354; Taube 1993). I have been examining palace feasts as the primary mechanism of social intercourse among factions of multiethnic kings in Postclassic highland Mexico from a.D. 1200-1500 (Pohl 1994c, n.d.). While I perceive the feast as a means 9. During the trial of the native priest Martin Ocelotl, it was revealed that he held pagan feasts for the noblemen, invoked Camaxtli-Mixcoatl as god and called upon his "sisters," the clouds, to bring rain (Archivo General de la Naci?n de Mexico 1912:21). 10. Pulque also replaced water as a storeable thirst-quenching beverage during the dry season in the Mexican highlands (Taylor 1979:30, 57).</page><page sequence="15">198 RES 33 SPRING 1998 toward alliance between factions of Tolteca-Chichimeca, Mixtees, and Zapotees, among others, I am bothered by descriptions in the sources of feasts being extremely violent as well. An early account by Friar Toribio Motolonia, who lived in Tlaxcala, is typical: In many of these feasts they would give the guests blankets and they would dance night and day until they were drunken and exhausted. In the drinking bouts that they frequently had it is incredible that they consumed so much wine fermented from certain roots of bad odor. They ordinarily began drinking at sunset and drank steadily in groups of ten and fifteen that by the end of the evening they were losing their wits singing and shouting and calling upon the devil. They went striking, wounding, killing one another even though they might be close friends and even relatives. They had another intoxication that was even crueler and it was produced from the mushroom. They drank after eating them or ate the mushrooms with honey. Then they had all sorts of visions especially of snakes and as they go completely out of their minds they think that their legs and bodies are full of worms that are eating them alive. So affected with this beastly drunkenness, they would treat each other with cruelty. These mushrooms they say in their own language are teonanacatl or the flesh of the god. 1950:45-46, 54 Motolonia's remarks suggest that displays of generosity, gift giving, and reciprocity at feasts did not always achieve the expected outcome of strengthening social bonds. While it is difficult to comprehend what specifically led to the drunkenness and homicide to which Motolinia refers, there is considerable evidence from colonial studies that it was not drunkenness that was ultimately blamed for homicides by the Indian people themselves, but rather nagging social issues, frequently disputes between close kinsmen over land and adulterous relationships (Taylor 1979). Tlaxcalan politics were plagued by such disputes. Mu?oz Camargo (1984:271-275) wrote of assassinations that attended the succession to high office in Tlaxcalan kingdoms. During the conquest, Tlaxcala supplied Cortes with thousands of men and supplies, but the army's effectiveness was severely handicapped by ongoing feuds between its commanding officers, Chichimecatl and Xicotencatl the Younger (Diaz del Castillo 1956:324-325, 396-397; Thomas 1993:244-245, 490). When Chichimecatl was accused of poor generalship, he retaliated by withholding his troops in the middle of combat. Later, during the final siege of Tenochtitlan, Xicotencatl took advantage of the confusion of the march, abandoned the army, and returned home to seize the lands and titles of Chichimecatl. Cortes himself later had Xicotencatl executed for plotting his own defeat at the hands of the Mexica. There is clearly an iconographie theme of divisiveness and social violence as well as drunken intoxication in the cult of the Tzitzimime. Murderers were called Tzitzimime (Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 10:38). Numerous painted goblets from Tlaxcala and Puebla portray hands together with human hearts, skulls, limb bones, which are symbols of sacrifice, death and dismemberment (Lind 1994:97-98). Aztec creation stories are filled with accounts of factional strife between gods and other spirit forces in which the defeated are ultimately sacrificed and dismembered, a metaphor for the fragmentation of the greater social and political "body." Both real and metaphorical cannibalism could also be implied. We know that ritual cannibalistic feasts were conducted at certain times, but human hearts and blood were also allegorically invoked as symbols for chocolate in song (Mu?oz Camargo 1984:46-47, 67; Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 6:256). It would appear from the predominance of the theme that these Tzitzimime were the spirit forces to which Motolinia refers when he says that they were "calling upon the devil." Codex Magiiabechiano specifically illustrates the participants in feasts dancing, bloodletting, drinking, eating, and consuming mushrooms before idols representing the Tzitzimime (fig. 12). Drunkenness and murder are found at the root of social dissension in the creation saga of the Tlaxcalan patron and father of Quetzalcoatl, Camaxtli-Mixcoatl. According to the story, four hundred Mixcoa, or cloud serpent men, were born of Chalchiuhtlicue, the water goddess, to serve the sun its nourishment. When the Mixcoa rejected their duties and got drunk instead, the sun commanded four of their brothers, including Camaxtli-Mixcoatl himself, and their sister to make war on them. The chosen five then butchered the drunken four hundred and served them to the sun for his nourishment (Bierhorst 1992:149-151 ).11 Although we know that drunkenness and murder were expressly forbidden in Aztec society at large, indeed punished with death, there is considerable evidence that it was 11. Another version of this same story actually credits Mixcoatl with the invention of both octli and war (Garibay 1973:36-37). L?pez Austin (1993:161) discusses the ritual objects employed at feasts as metaphorical weapons.</page><page sequence="16">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 199 Figure 12. Codex Magliabechiano (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence) shows participants feasting before the image of a giant blue TzitzimitI. Drawing: John M. D. Pohl. also perceived as a necessary expedient in the political affairs of the profoundly militant Tlaxcalan elite. This became tragically apparent shortly after the conquest when, ironically, the murders of both an Indian priest and a nobleman's son, over the rituals of the feasts of the Tzitzimime and political succession, would lead to the commemoration of Mexico's first martyr. According to Friar Toribio Motolinia, shortly after establishing themselves in Tlaxcala, the Franciscans selected the firstborn sons of the nobility to train in the doctrine of the Christian faith (Motolinia 1950:243-253). Alarmed, an Indian priest donned the guise of the "god of wine," Ometochtli or Two Rabbit, and went into the marketplace to preach. Before long, he encountered a group of the noblemen's sons who declared the priest a devil and stoned him to death. The friars condemned the murder, but remained undaunted in their demand to continue the conversion. Next they ordered that the son of a high lord Acxotecatl be taken and trained in the faith. When the young Crist?bal returned, he demanded that his father "give up his idols and the sins in which he was living, especially the sin of drunkenness because it was all a very great wickedness." Acxotecatl refused for he "was one of the savage and warlike Indians ... his hands were stained with murders and homicides." Crist?bal then went into his father's house and overturned the ollas of wine and household idols. Xochipapalotzin, Acxotecatl's second wife, urged the lord to kill Crist?bal, "so that, with him dead, another son, Bernardino, who was hers, would inherit." Perceiving himself to be shamed, even impoverished, at the loss of his wine and idols (and therefore his inability to participate in the revolving system of reciprocity through feasting), Acxotecatl was incensed. He beat Crist?bal with a cudgel, burned him alive, and finally murdered the child by driving a sword through his heart (Fig. 13). Acxotecatl was summarily executed by the Spaniards, while Crist?bal was declared to be Mexico's first Christian martyr (Motolinia 1950:243-249). VI Contemporary analogies In this brief examination of pre-Columbian Tlaxcalan altar-ofrenc/a paintings, I propose that a principal religious theme of palace feasts was an encounter with the Tzitzimime, potentially malevolent avatars of gods that also embodied a cult of the ancestral dead. In fact,</page><page sequence="17">200 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 13. Line drawing from a colonial painting at Atlihuetzia, Tlaxcala depicting Acxotecatl stabbing his son, Crist?bal, to death on a fire while his wife Xochipapalotzin looks on. Drawing: John M. D. Pohl. present-day Tlaxcalan rituals dedicated to the souls of the dead continue to have much in common with the TzitzimitI theme (Nutini 1988). Altars are still constructed against the north walls of the main rooms of family dwellings, the direction from which the souls are said to arrive during Todos Santos (Nutini 1988:189, 234; Mu?oz Camargo 1984:191). Altars and their retablos are permanent fixtures and may be ornamented with statues and icons of Christian saints by generations of the homes occupants. During Todos Santos, the larger ofrenda platforms are set up as an extension of the altars to hold the plentiful offerings of candles, incense, flowers, exotic foods, liquor, and clothing made to the dead. The crystallized sugar skull, at least one for every deceased family member, is unquestionably the predominant icon of the Todos Santos ofrenda arrangements (Nutini 1988:202). The relationship between the Tzitzimime and the greater pantheon of Aztec gods may be mirrored in contemporary practices, particularly in the dichotomy between the cult of the dead and the cult of the saints. Private cults of both the dead and the saints are physically centered in the household and are ritually celebrated by extended families while public cults of both the dead and the saints are centered in the community church and ritually celebrated through the mayordomia, or "cargo system." However, it is clear that for the private family houshold, the cult of the dead is much more important than its public component. The cult of the saints, on the other hand, is exactly the opposite: its public component is far more important than its private component (Nutini 1988:9-10). The cults of the Tzitzimime and the cults of gods like Quetzalcoatl, Camaxtli-Mixcoatl, Chalchiuhtlicue, and so forth, also overlapped. In similar fashion, the moveable feasts timed to the sacred 260-day calendar were more specifically celebrated in the palaces and dedicated to Tzitzimime, such as the Cihuateteo and the Maquiltonaleque, while the 18 veintana ceremonies, the large public feasts timed to the 365 day calendar, were held in the temple precincts. The use of a 365-day calendar by Spaniard and Indian alike facilitated the syncretic fusion of Aztec and Catholic feasts (Nutini 1988:61, 87). Despite the vestigial use of the 260-day calendar in remote regions, moveable feast systems were rapidly eclipsed throughout most of Mesoamerica together with the elite infrastructure that they supported. Today the largest celebration of the dead, Todos Santos, is held between October 28 and November 3. It is sanctioned by Catholic doctrine and brings the entire community of kinsmen, compadres, and friends together into a united group bound by the ties they share with those who have departed and the saints</page><page sequence="18">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 201 who reside in heaven (Nutini 1988:316). However, the souls of the dead are also petitioned separately as intermediaries with the supernatural at other times of the year in conjunction with the private household cult as well. Not unlike the pre-Hispanic Tzitzimime, the souls of the Tlaxcalan dead are believed to be responsible for watching over the maturation of the crops, providing sufficient rainfall, and for the physical health of the extended family who venerates them (Nutini 1988:307). During the entire month of August, on February 2, and on June 26, the souls of children are commemorated for their help in averting torrential rains and hail storms that could destroy crops. The souls of adults are venerated on January 5 and December 16 to insure crop fertility and to protect life and property. On May 8 and May 15 vigils are held more specifically for those who live in purgatory and serve as attendants to the spirits of the mountains La Malinche and El Cuatlapanga (Nutini 1988:316,322) Although they reside in the spiritual cosmos of purgatory and heaven, the souls of the dead are also associated with specific landscape features, especially La Malinche volcano lying south of the city of Tlaxcala. La Malinche volcano was originally called Matlalcueye, or "Lady Blue Skirt," the Tlaxcalan name for the goddess Chalchiuhtlicue invoked in relation toTizatlan Altar B. The spirit of the water goddess is believed to reside in the volcano where she demands that the Tlaxcalans honor the souls of the dead for they are her servants. They are the intercessors who plead the farmers' causes and beg favors of her on their behalf (Starr 1900; Nutini 1988:233). The goddess's caverns are filled with ollas of water for brewing either rain or hail. The rain is beneficial, but the hail stones are hungry and devour the fruits, grain, and seeds in the fields to take back to the caverns. For this reason the Tezitlazc, community rain makers, must continually appease the goddess and her servants with offerings at La Malinche in order to ensure their blessings. While all souls have the ability to return and harass those who mistreated them in life, those of women who died in childbirth and those killed by lightening being especially vengeful, the more malevolent attributes of the the pre-Columbian Tzitzimime are today attributed to various kinds of witches such as: theTetlachihuic; theTlahuelpuchi, or female spirits that suck blood; and the Matlalcihua, or spirits of the ravines that haunt drunkards and adulterers (Hunt 1977).12 When Sahag?n's informants described murderers as Tzitzimime, perhaps they conceived of them in the same way that witches are thought to possess perpetrators in Tlaxcala today: People believe that the killer was guided or compelled by an evil supernatural, the devil, a vengeful tetlachihuic, a matlalcihua, or other malevolent being to commit the deed, thus releasing him from responsibility for the act. On the other hand, neither is the victim completely blameless or innocent in his fate, but rather he is regarded as contributing to his own untimely demise. Again under the influence of some evil supernatural, the people believe, he did something to provoke the incident leading to his death. In acts of violence leading to death, there are no fully innocent or fully guilty parties. Nutini 1988:128, see also Sahag?n 1950-1982, book 10:38 All societies view murder with abhorrence and exact punishment according to the conditions under which the crime was committed. However, the evaluation of such conditions can be subject to widely differing social values. In traditional societies, crimes are viewed as offenses against individuals, but they even more drastically affect the ability of extended families and their supporters to function together as social units. The goal of judgement is directed at restoring social harmony in ways that satisfy the kinship units involved rather than castigating a single offender (Haviland 1993:333-335). In Tlaxcalan society, it seems as if the conception of the witch, through its third party participation, allows people to condemn the horrific nature of murder, but facilitates the resolution of disputes between the affected kinship groups by blaming a substantial proportion of the act on an uncontrollable supernatural being. VII Alliances and feasts Analysis of the figurative images in the Ocotelolco and Tizatlan frescos clearly connects them to specific pages of Codex Borgia, a pre-Columbian divinatory manuscript used to select auspicious days for settling matters of religious and social import, to evaluate the 12. Among the Nahua of the Sierra de Puebla, the Tetlachihuijquetl (Tetlachihuic) is specifically associated with the Tzitzimime (Sandstrom 1991:253). Although Matlalcihua is interpeted as "Ensnarring Woman" from the nahua word matlatl, or "net," it is significantly similar to a word for the color blue, matlalin, perhaps associating the spirit as "Blue Woman" with Matlalcueye or "Blue Skirt" as well.</page><page sequence="19">202 RES 33 SPRING 1998 fate of newborn children, and to calculate the celebration of a rotational system of moveable feasts. Through icons displayed in ritual dress, members of the Aztec deity pantheon were identified including Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, and Matlalcueye-Chalchiuhtlicue. Their representations can be tied to specific images from Codex Borgia where they are depicted presiding over different divisions of the 260-day calendar and the rituals that were celebrated during those times. Each was associated with a particular cycle of legends detailing those powers that were invoked in calling upon the god to act upon the needs of the diviners (L?pez Austin 1993). By far the overarching theme of the altars and ofrendas together with the polychrome pottery and greenstone statues focuses on the cult of the Tzitzimime, supernatural with whom the gods were closely associated. To Spanish friars, the Tzitzimime were malevolent demons and witches. Afterall, they were frightening in their appearance with their fleshless heads and bodies, claws for hands and feet, and adornments of human hearts and hands. They were the eaters of men (Garibay 1973:69). However Louise Burkhart has proposed that such perspectives were simplistic and resulted from the imposition of a Christian definition of good versus evil (Burkhart 1989:35-36). Indigenous people themselves perceived these powerful spirit forces as having a dualistic disposition. The Tzitzimime represented avatars of specific gods, particularly in regard to major divisions of the 260-day calendar and the feasts celebrated by the lords in their palaces. They were thought to provoke murder, drunkenness, and lasciviousness, but they were also the punishers of overindulgent sinners. They were the source of diseases, yet they were invoked by curers. They brought torrential storms that destroyed crops, and yet they were petitioned by the rainbringers. In short, they represented a blend of the positive and negative qualities that composed both human social order and universal chaos. The Tzitzimime were also likened to the souls of the dead, but only as symbolic manifestations. Women who died in childbirth were never invoked by name by midwives who remembered them in life, rather they were invoked through the spirits of the five Cihuateteo, patrons of the trecenas 1 Deer, 1 Rain, 1 Monkey, 1 House, and 1 Eagle. In this regard, rather than representing the souls of specific individuals, the Tzitzimime functioned as the spirits of human archetypes, manifestations of the fates prescribed in the auguries of the 260-day signs of the tonalpohualli (see Sahag?n 1950-1982:Book 4; F?rst 1995 for discussion). Although the term tonalpohualli is usually translated as the "count of the days," in fact tonal is used to describe the "soul" in traditional Nahua communities today (Sandstrom 1991). The tonal invoked as the Tzitzimime is the soul of the day assigned to each individual born into the community.13 Anthropologists studying ethnohistorical sources of ancient Mesoamerican lifeways are frequently torn between proposing patterns of ritual behavior from isolated accounts or dismissing the same accounts as idiosyncratic or even aberrant. This is particularly true with reports of ritual drunkenness, intoxication, fighting, and even homicide like that reported by Motolinia. The issue of the role of drunkenness in Aztec palace feasts is not fully resolved however. Did the tetecuhtin drink themselves into stupors, committing acts of violence in spite of themselves, or was violence an expected outcome? Was factional violence excused because it took place in such a ritualistic setting? There may be no way of specifically answering these questions for the Tlaxcalteca, but comparable behavior documented among other Indian societies may provide some insights. Case studies among the Yanamamo of Venezuela and Brazil are enlightening (Chagnon 1983). The Yanamamo live in small villages of 80-150 people. Alliances between villages result from a developmental sequence that involves initial trade, mutual feasting, and finally the exchange of women. However, a competitive social climate is ever present in which warfare is widespread and attended by a bellicose social and religious ideology. The goal of war is enrichment by seizing property and women. No village is beyond taking advantage of another if they sense inherent weaknesses. The ever present military threat creates a situation in which intervillage alliance is a necessity, but at the same time, it fosters a factional ideology that inhibits alliance formation. In short, allies need, but cannot trust, each other (Chagnon 1983:146-147). The chief function of Yanamamo feasts is to cultivate or reaffirm intervillage solidarity in the intimate context of food sharing, thereby putting a potential ally under obligation to reciprocate at a later date. Alliances begin when one village initiates gift exchanges with another. 13. For a more detailed discussion of the tonal or tetonal as the predetermined soul of an individual, see L?pez Austin 1988, F?rst 1995, and Monaghan 1998.</page><page sequence="20">Pohl: Themes of drunkenness, violence, and factionalism 203 Axe heads, hallucinogenic drugs, dogs, arrow points, bows, cotton, hammocks, and clay pots are commonly given. Mutual exchanges build trust and eventually the village most desirous of the alliance will invite an exchange partner to a feast. Feasts demand a tremendous output of labor and resources. Animals have to be hunted, fish have to be trapped, and plantains have to be harvested. The preparations last for weeks. When the guests arrive, they are fed generously and entertained throughout the night with dancing and chanting after the consumption of plentiful amounts of a hallucinogen called ebene (Chagnon 1983:160). The featured beverage is a plaintain soup of which nearly a hundred gallons may be consumed in one night. Ingredients included the ashes of deceased kin so that the festivities may also honor the ancestors (Chagnon 1983:106). In order to prove to one another that they are militarily worthy partners, Yanamamo feasts are attended by much bragging and boasting of military accomplishments. Under normal circumstances, allies who feast with each other do not actually fight, but from time to time even the best allies agree beforehand to terminate a feast with a chest-pounding duel in which the men strike each other from a squatting position with their fists. The purpose is to demonstrate to each other that although they are friends, they are capable of defending their village's autonomy and will fight if necessary. The intent of the feast and accompanying gift exchanges is consequently to reduce the possibility of more serious levels of conflict while at the same time promoting intervillage solidarity and mutual interdependence (Chagnon 1983:169). Taking place in such a volatile social atmosphere, any Yanamamo feast has the potential for ending with violent death. In extreme cases, feasts were actually planned as traps to confiscate women and possessions or even annihilate an enemy. However, such shortsighted schemes are devastating to society at large and lead to general mistrust among other valued allies. More frequently fights result from unresolved social issues. Chanting while intoxicated is a means of recalling past events, both cosmogonical and historical, that bond villages and kinship groups together. However, reciting the past can also have the effect of reopening old wounds. Villages may accuse each other of thefts, for example, or individuals may recall personal problems in which they suddenly demand support from their kinsmen in the midst of a banquet. Shamans may accuse visitors of attacking their village through Hekura, spirits that are invoked through hallucinogenic trances. In such cases, chest-pounding duels may escalate to club fights and, on rarer occasions, axe fights. As counterproductive as drinking and violence in attendance to alliance building might seem, it is hardly unique to Amazonian tribes (Sullivan 1988:195-227). Drunkenness and ritual combat assumes different forms and fills different functions across a broad spectrum of Indian societies. It may be condoned through brawls during which participants celebrate the reenactment of world creation when the first factions were born from chaos, or it may be celebrated through dances in which combatants drink to fight unseen forces that threaten to destroy social harmony. In all cases, it is sanctified by myth. Any direct comparison between the Yanamamo and the Tlaxcalteca must take into account the fact that they are divided by 500 years in time and represent two very different levels of social complexity. Nevertheless, some basic behavioral similarities suggest comparable functional explanations for ritual drunkenness and violence. While anthropologists traditionally equate feasting, reciprocity, and gift economies with tribal levels of social organization, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they were also an integral feature of the elite economic dynamics of Mesoamerican civilizations. Elsewhere I have proposed that alliance networks of city-states and great houses dominated much of Tlaxcala, Puebla, and Oaxaca during the Postclassic (Pohl 1994c). Although Tolteca-Chichimeca, Mixtee, and Zapotee societies were characterized by profound social stratification and state-level political institutions, the royal elite conducted their personal interrelationships more like tribes. Postclassic palaces were constructed as networks of enclosed rooms and courts that were not only ideally suited to private feasting and drinking parties, but also the production of elite crafts such as weaving, jewelry making, and polychrome ceramic production. Elite craft production, in turn, not only fueled an exclusive and highly competitive gift economy but also formed the basis of a bridewealth system that bound factions together into extended alliance corridors of related kin. Colonial sources are silent with regard to what kind of ritual violence was practiced in Aztec feasts such as wrestling, punching, clubbing, and so forth, and all feasts were not combative.

Tizatlan Altar A, on the other hand, displays icons related to a primordial war between the gods themselves, and it is not difficult to imagine the demeanor of guests at an Ocotelolco banquet as they gazed at the bench frieze of dismembered human heads and hands while drinking from goblets ornamented with shields and human hearts. This electrifying combination of exquisite beauty in craft with menace in iconography was meant to be confrontational and promoted nothing less than outright belligerence on the part of the host. In examining the issue of feasting and factionalism within the context of pre-Columbian ritual, I propose that the problems inherent in single-instance ethnohistorical accounts can be offset by examining the more institutionalized cognitive patterns reflected in narrative art?the painted frescoes, pottery, statuary, and codices that served to contextualize feasts and drinking bouts. For the pre-Columbian Tlaxcalan aristocracy, it seems that the connection between violence and drunkenness was commemorated as a logical facet of political life. Their feasts were largely conceived as an encounter with the Tzitzimime, not only souls of the dead but also the essences of those social values that both bound the living together and that threatened to rip them asunder; personifying a fundamental theme underlying the creation of the Aztec world.
