Stamnoi made in Athens were major exports to the Etruscans in Italy. The decoration here juxtaposes scenes of heroic and contempo rary warfare. The chariot evokes a bygone era described in Homer's epics of the Trojan War. The warrior with a snake as the shield device is setting out for battle; the chari oteer is already in place. The two figures with pointed caps and Eastern dress and the foot soldiers on both sides represent contemporary warriors. The line of soldiers on the reverse is varied by the devices: a rectilinear pinwheel, a human buttock and leg, half of a kantharos (a two-handled cup associated with the wine god Dionysos), the forepart of a bull, and the car of a chariot. jrm 550 -500 B.C.

Gift of Edward Klagsbrun and Joan Saslow, in memory of Dr. Henny Durst. 201112011517) The god Dionysos is nude except for the characteristic nebris (fawn skin) worn diagonally over his right shoulder. Long locks of hair, originally painted and possibly gilded, fall onto his shoulders and back. The complete figure either held the thyrsos (a ceremonial staff tipped with a pinecone and twined with ivy) in his raised left arm or rested his arm on a tree trunk. This statuette belongs to a series of Roman sculptures that refer back to a Late Classical Greek type. The S-curve and slight twist of the torso to the right, for example, directly quote works by Praxiteles. There is considerable iconographic variation among these Roman statuettes of Dionysos, in the stance, the position of the arms, the pres ence or absence of a nebris or panther next to the tree sup port, and other details. The eclectic, classicizing character of the piece, evident in the skillful modeling of the muscula ture, the polished flesh, and the flat rendering of the animal skin, points to a date in the second century A.D.Young Dionysos enjoyed a resurgent popularity during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (a.d. 117—38). Although it may have had a votive function, the statuette most probably served as decoration. kk 12 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS Head of Zeus Amnion Roman, Hadrianic-Antonine period, ca.

A comparable head appears on Hadrianic coins and on cuirassed statues of Emperor Hadrian him self. In Imperial times the deity was seen as protector of the Roman army, especially the legions of North Africa. This is the grandest representation of Zeus Ammon to survive from classical antiquity. The eclectic style combines the divine gran deur and Olympian tranquillity of Classical Greek cult statues with the deep-set eyes and unruly mass of leonine hair of early Hellenistic works. It is tempting to surmise that this head echoes a fifth-century B.C. cult statue of the Pheidian school or a later emu lation of it.

So intent is their focus, and so dignified their pos ture, that they appear at once heroic and divinely inspired. Surprisingly, the words they pen are not their gospel texts but extraordinary messages rooted in medieval theology. Saint Mark writes: "CHRISTUM DEUS TUMULO SUSCITAT ISTE LEO" (God raised Christ from the tomb in the manner of the Lion), linking Christian belief in the Resurrection of Jesus to the medieval legend that the lion breathes life into stillborn cubs three days after their birth. Saint Luke's words address the divine nature of his own task:"IURA SACERDOTIS HIC NOTAT ORE BOVIS" (This one writes sacred law through the mouth of the ox); thus the beast conventionally linked to the saint serves as the medium of inspiration. These figures likely come from the high altar of the abbey of Grand mont, near Limoges. The altar was described in glowing terms in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, long after the fashion for medieval works had passed. When the abbey was destroyed in 1791 a smelter pur chased all the "old copper." A few fine pieces were spared—among them, it seems, these Evangelists. bdb 900- 1249 17 Evangelists Mark and Luke France (Limoges), ca. 1220-30 Gilt copper and glass; Mark (left): h. 6% in.

Saddle plates made of pierced iron and decorated with gold or silver damascening, like this example, did not occur until approximately one thousand years later, mainly in Tibet but also in China. This strongly suggests that pierced iron saddle plates were an innovation of Tibetan or Mongol craftsmen during the Yuan dynasty. The pierced foliate ground and damascening technique on this pommel plate (for the front, or pommel, of a saddle) are very similar to the work MUSO Soseki on Tibetan saddles, but this is the only known example featuring human figures or a secular scene of any kind, in this case a tiger hunt.

The movement and depth in the rendering of the birds, flowers, and leaves on this tray help date it to the fourteenth century, when the Mongol Yuan dynasty controlled China. This extraordinary tray is one of a handful of carved lacquers with the name Zhang Cheng incised into its back. Zhang and his contemporary Yang Mao are among the few lacquer artists whose names have been preserved in historical writings, but very little is known about their biographies. Although the authenticity of the rare signatures remains controversial, they suggest that lacquer was particularly valued as an art form during the fourteenth century. dpl Panel Spain (Granada), late 13th—mid-14th century Limestone, 303/bX 11 x 4 in.

Although fragmentary, the piece retains enough of its original length to reveal the designs. The rectangular panel is carved on three sides. On one of the wide sides is a band of squared interlace, on the other a tall band of repeating eight-pointed stars and cartouches, both enclosing a knot pattern, with a guilloche border. The Kufic inscription on the adjacent narrow edge repeats the Arabic word al- 'afiyya (good health). Several fourteenth-century tombstones in the Museo de la Alhambra in Granada have similar geometric ornament, but their inscriptions are in Naskh, or rounded, script, not Kufic.The ornate facades of the Alhambra Palace, on the other hand, include Arabic inscriptions in both cursive Naskh and squared Kufic script, as well as highly complex geometric ornament. This panel may have been part of the frame of a doorway.

(80.3 cm) Provenance: [Wolfgang Hofstatter, Vienna, and his descendants, from before 1967]; [Blumka Gallery, New York], The Cloisters Collection, 2010 (2010.446) Created in northern Austria along the Danube River, this sculpture is notable for the deep, lyrical carving of the drapery. The current appearance of much of the surface is due to a past restoration that removed layers of over paint, exposing some areas of gesso and bole, the reddish soft clay used as a base for gold leaf. The delicately applied paint on the Virgin's face is original, and the blue lining of her mantle, painted in intense azurite, retains much of its original appearance. The Virgin's hands, which would have held the infant Jesus, were carved separately and have been lost. The sculpture displays the mastery of the wood carver's art associated with the great altarpieces of the late Middle Ages, and it can be seen in the context of the monumental Kefermarkt altarpiece in Upper Austria, which is dated about 1490—97. The Virgin was probably carved for the central section of a winged altarpiece, where she would have been flanked by angels or saints. The adja cent wings were likely painted or decorated with carvings in low relief representing scenes of the Life of the Virgin or the Infancy ofjesus.

Sometime between about 1509 and 1515 he traveled to Augsburg and joined Hans Holbein the Elder's atelier, where he produced an altarpiece that originally included this monumental double-sided panel representing the Dormition of the Virgin and Christ Carrying the Cross. The other three panels of the folding wings of the altarpiece are in the Hamburger Kunsthalle, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, and the Shipley Art Gallery in Gateshead, England. The exteriors of the wings represent scenes of the Passion of Christ, and the interiors show episodes from the Life of the Virgin. The now lost centerpiece probably displayed sculptures of the Virgin and Child with saints. The influence of Dtirer resonates in Schaufelein's marvelously cohesive composi tion and in the affecting sense of quiet pathos expressed by the individualized apostles in the Dormition. A workshop assistant was mostly responsible for Christ Carrying the Cross, to which Schaufelein added the dynamic figure of the rope-pulling henchman at the right. Of superb quality and fine condition, this rare work is the most important painting by Schaufelein in American collections.

In the cartouche above, Minerva receives a victory palm. This is the only intact version of Neptune from the thrice-woven series of tapestries called the Doria Grotesques. Perino del Vaga designed the eight-piece sequence in about 1545 for the naval commander Andrea Doria to add to the substan tial tapestry collection in his glorious palazzo in Fassolo, then just outside the port city of Genoa. The Grotesques, each featuring a different deity, show case Perino's dexterity in this decorative field, combining respect for antique prototypes with Raphael-inspired Renaissance grace. Neptune, celebrat ing the mythological figure with whom Doria most identified, was the most significant tapestry in the group. Though designed in Italy, the tapes tries were made 500 miles away in the Southern Netherlands, almost certainly in Brussels, where the most celebrated weavers in the world worked. This Neptune is exquisitely woven in wool and silk in a subtle palette, with won derful hatching and nuanced areas of light and shade that exploit the medi um s interplay between trompe l'oeil relief and surface pattern. eahc 26 RECENT ACQUISITIONS Perino del Vaga Jupiter and Juno: Study for the "Furti di Giove" Tapestries ca. 1532-35 Pen and dark brown ink with brown and gray wash, heightened with white: 17 x 15% in.

Purchase, Amati Gifts, 2010 (2010.205) The Bassano family took their name from the city of Bassano del Grappa in theVeneto, but by the early sixteenth century they had relocated to Venice. Bassano was a well-known Jewish surname, and although only circumstan tial evidence exists about the religion of the instrument making family, they may have fled Bassano in 1516 when all the Jewish residents of the town were expelled. During the six teenth and the first half of the seventeenth century the family was active in music circles in Venice and also, surprisingly, in London, where in the late 1530s five Bassano brothers estab lished themselves as musicians at the court of Henry VIII. Members of the London branch of the family were part of Shakespeare's circle.

As it looks up toward the cloud-filled sky, the dragon twists its head so that its chin is above its eye. The production of finished single-page drawings destined for albums increased in Iran in the late sixteenth century, and many of those pages depicted dragons, either alone or in combat with men or other animals. This drawing is unsigned, but details of the dragon's head as well as the rendering of the clouds and foliage strongly suggest that this is a work of Sadiqi Beg, a leading artist at the court of Shah 'Abbas I, who reigned from 1587—1629, and head of the royal library. Along with Riza-yi 'Abbasi, Sadiqi Beg was a pioneer of the calligraphic style of drawing in Iran. Both artists used lines of varying thickness to suggest movement and mass, inspiring numerous followers in the early seven Buddhist Monk Bodhidharma teenth century sc China, Ming (1368-1644)-Qing (1644-1911) dynasty, 17th century Rhinoceros horn, h. 4'A in.

Mostly cups modeled after ancient ritual vessels but occasionally also scholarly and religious figures, these carvings were highly prized by collec tors for their exquisite details, facilitated by the fine texture of the horn; the rich brown color, which mel lows over time; and, of course, the rarity of the mate rial, which only a few could afford. This handsomely crafted figure with closed eyes and a calm visage depicts Bodhidharma, the Indian Buddhist monk who came to China and founded the Chan sect in the sixth century. His meditative pose alludes to the legend that he sat in a cave for ten years and finally attained enlightenment. zjs f, JJ?P?.fy- /A )nj)' - V „Vy ' ' i '3 30 1 RECENT ACQUISITIONS Buddhist Monk Bodhidharma China, Ming (1368-1644)-Qing (1644-1911) dynasty, 17th century Rhinoceros horn, h. 414 in.

Sperling Funds, 2011 (2011.319) Martin Freminet had built a considerable reputation in Italy by 1602, when he was summoned back to France by Henri IV. Two years later, the king put him in charge of decorating the vault of the Chapel of the Trinity at the chateau of Fontainebleau. Freminet's concept for the chapel featured a compartmentalized ceiling with scenes in oil on plaster in a complex scheme of painted and gilt stucco ornament. This study is preparatory for one of the eight stand ing figures of kings of Judah and Israel that punctuate the side walls. The figure's strength and regal bearing are expressed in the lively ink line delineating the musculature and the Roman military costume, while the anatomy is further accentuated with smoky shading in black chalk and touches of white. Drawn as if seen from below, the king stands in con trapposto, his right hand on his hip, recall ing the muscular figures of Michelangelo as well as the ancient statues of warriors and gods that Freminet studied during his Roman sojourn. Overlaying these elements is a lush and elegant sensibility derived from the richly textured milieu of Fontainebleau, where mythology, history, and religion were everywhere interwoven with a playful vocab ulary of ornament and fantasy. ps 1600-1700 31 Martin Fréminet French, Paris 1567-1619 Paris A King of Judah and Israel ca.1604 Pen and brown ink, black chalk with heightening in white; 17/B x 10% in.

Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 201112011.409) This powerful image, executed by the Mughal master Payag in about 1630—35, depicts the fearsome goddess Bhairavi seated on a headless corpse in a funereal land scape of decomposing bodies. Her counterpart Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, appears beside her in the guise of an ash-covered devotee. Bhairavi s iconography, and that of other demonic manifestations of the goddess, is known from a long-standing sculptural tradition in India and some rare evidence in early Mughal manuscripts. Its fully developed expression here seems to have drawn on multiple sources, not least Payag's own imagination and understanding of the profundity of the subject matter. The unusual treatment of the charnel setting suggests that the artist was aware of European scenes of heavenly ascension, judgment, and crucifixion with a comparable scattering of bones across the ground. The painting is surrounded by a gold border filled from sky to ground with impressionistically executed scenes and plumes of smoke billowing from the fires in the main painting. The later devanagari inscription identifying the goddess was probably added while the painting was in the collection of the rulers of the Rajput kingdom of Mewar during the eighteenth century. nnh 32 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS Attributed to Payag Indian, active 1595-1655 The Goddess Bhairavi Devi Worshiped by Shiva ca. 1630-35 Opaque watercolor and gold on paper, 71/i x 10% in.

Peluso Gift, 2011 (2011.596) m Antonio Novelli was a stalwart of the Florentine Baroque and at the same time a defender of the Renaissance past. The powerful presence and sideward movement of this bust are Baroque, while the heads of the cherubim among clouds are derived from fifteenth-century precedents.The work shows only slight exposure to the ele ments; it may be supposed that it was originally outdoors but protected in a niche fairly high up, where the Redeemer's complex air of heroism and benevolence, com manding while blessing humanity below, could best be appreciated. The sculptor took extraordinary pains both to identify and to idealize the Nazarene, giving him long, lovingly rendered sidelocks and the seamless garment described in scripture. Having been revamped in the eighteenth century, the villa at Camerata from which the bust comes now has no tower or niche that could have accommodated it. It may have been incorporated sometime after 1649, while the villa belonged to the Albizzi family. In terms of Novelli's manner, the aptest parallels are to be found in his Head of a Bearded Man in a Hat seated marble figure of Michelangelo of 1633—35 (Casa Buonarroti, Florence), with ca 1 g5Q its equally delicate folds of cloth. jdd Black and red chalk, blue pastel; 3% x 3% in.

Purchase, The Vincent Astor Foundation, Susan Dillon, in honor of James C. Y. Watt, and Friends of Asian Art Gifts, 2012 (2012.1B7a-ll Small-scale albums were a favorite medium in the seventeenth century because their mul tiple leaves afforded artists the opportunity to explore a topic through a sequence of related images. In this gemlike example, the Anhui master Zheng Min has created eight iconic views of Mount Huang, a scenic region in Anhui Province that gave its name to one of the most influential "schools" of painters of that time. Many of these artists were Ming loyalists who retreated into the landscape as a way of withholding support from the Manchus who conquered China in 1644. Taking the dramatic scenery of Mount Huang (Yellow Mountain) as their main source of inspiration, they painted in a style characterized by spare compositions rendered in a dry, monochrome palette that conveyed their aloof sensibilities. The album, painted for a specific patron in 1681, presents meticulously executed views of Mount Huang—including the majestic Heavenly Citadel Peak shown here—while facing pages are inscribed with the artist s poetic accounts of the famous sites. Painted from memory years after his two visits to the region, the album balances sensitive descriptive detail and lyrical abstraction to achieve a quintessential vision of the scenery that inspired many of the leading artists of the late seventeenth century. mkh 36 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS Zheng Min Chinese, 1633-1683 Eight Views of Mount Huang China, Qing dynasty (1644-1911 ), 1681 Album of nine double leaves of painting and calligraphy, ink on paper; each leaf 9 Vi x 5 Yt in.

During the Renaissance noblemen regularly wore long, lethal, and frequently ornate swords known as rapiers, both for self-defense and as a necessary costume accessory. In the early seventeenth century rapiers became smaller, lighter, and more refined, developing into what are known as smallswords, which con tinued to be worn by gentlemen until the late eighteenth century. This early smallsword is a rare and beautiful example of the form, design, and orna mentation that distinguishes the best French swords of the early Louis XIV period. Its intricately damascened gold decoration is derived from contemporary print sources. Of the few comparable smallswords that exist, three are in current or former royal dynastic collections: Windsor Castle, the Musee de l'Armee in Paris, and the Royal Armory in Stockholm, a further indication of their quality and importance.

Admired for their mise-en-page, Watteau's drawings often combine separate studies; here a study of a woman's hands is set below an oblique study of her head, seen from above. In a painterly mix of red chalk and silvery gray graphite, Watteau captured his sitter's natural comportment, drawing attention to elegant details such as her cheekbone and her drop earring and deli cate necklace. Although he parted with few in his lifetime, Watteau's chalk draw ings became well known after his death thanks to his friend Jean de Jullienne's proj ect of publishing etchings replicating them under the title Figures de dijferents caracteres (1726-28).

Purchase, William Cullen Bryant Fellows Gifts, 2012 (2012.27a-j) The furniture form most emblematic of the Dutch presence in colonial New York and New Jersey is the kast. With its bold jutting cornice, paneled facade, and ebonized ball-shaped feet, the American kast is a simplified provincial expression of the high-style Baroque hasten made in Amsterdam and other urban centers of the United Provinces of the Netherlands in the mid- to late seventeenth cen tury. Functionally, however, it is precisely the same and served as the repository for impeccably washed and highly valued linens—pressed, folded, and neatly stacked by conscientious householders on the shelves within. This handsome mid eighteenth-century example is exceptional in that it retains its original finish and has a continuous history of ownership for nearly two and a half centuries in the Lounsberry family of Marbletown, New York. Coincidentally, installed in the New York Alcove on the third floor of the American Wing where this kast is on display is a handsome gumwood paneled fireplace wall from a house in the neighboring town of High Falls, New York, that may have been made in about 1750 by the same anonymous joiner. pmk 40 , RECENT ACQUISITIONS Dragon Jar Korea (Bunwon), Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), second half of 18th century Porcelain with underglaze cobalt blue painting, h. 1714 in.

Purchase, 2009 Benefit Fund, 2010 (2010.368) On this porcelain jar two four-clawed drag ons chase flaming jewels amid floating clouds. Framed on top and bottom by stylized mush roomlike motifs symbolizing good fortune, the robust dragons exude grandeur and hint at whimsy. Considered auspicious beasts, dragons, painted in either cobalt blue or iron-brown pigment and depicted as either majestic or humorous, were a popular decorative idiom on Joseon-period porcelain. The five-clawed dragon represented an emperor or king in East Asia; the four-clawed dragon was usually asso ciated with a prince. Blue-and-white dragon jars dating from the seventeenth through the mid-nineteenth century were made at the court-managed porcelain kilns of Bunwon, near the capital at Hanyang (present-day Seoul), for use in royal ceremonies. They were likely inspired by Ming Chinese prototypes. The shape of this jar, with its broad shoulders, tall and slightly curved pro file, and upright neck, and the fluid and expres sive rendering of the dragon are distinctively Korean. sl Cupboard (Kast) Ulster County, New York, 1740-70 Cherry and white pine, 77 x 72 x 25% in.

The fresco, which mostly follows the drawing, was com pleted in l77i.With other frescoes in the same town, it counts among Enderle's greatest accomplishments. The biblical quotation in the cartouche at the bottom center of the drawing—"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the utter most farthing" (Matthew 5:26)—is a humorous warning to the ceiling's patron that payment is to be made in full.

This fine eighteenth-century French design for a smallsword hilt is probably the work of a goldsmith who specialized in sword hilts. Annotations in the margins of the sheet provide useful insight as to its function. The drawing was no doubt presented to a client for his approval. The colored washes suggest that the hilt could be executed either in silver highlighted in '■*&amp;&gt; • •*-». t varicolored gold or entirely in gold.

Although they are less well known, the porcelain sculptures from near the end of the century reflect an extraordinary tech nical skill that far surpasses that found in earlier works. Many of the later figures are made of biscuit, or unglazed, porcelain; the white ceramic body simulates marble, and the absence of glaze allows the fineness of the modeling to be fully appreciated.

Cotter, in memory of his mother, Muriel Josephine Cotter (1902-20031,2010(2010.144) This handsome drawing demonstrates Benjamin West's skill as a draftsman and enriches the Metropolitan's hold ings of works by this leading figure in American and British art about 1800. While the drawing cannot be con nected to a particular undertaking, its date and the figure's appearance suggest its association with one ofWest's projects at Windsor Castle: paintings for the Chapel of Revealed Religion, planned for King George III but never completed, or windows for Saint George's Chapel. The varied and occasionally cursory handling of details implies that West regarded the sheet as only a preliminary sketch. His vigorous application of chalk and ink is com plemented by the rugged texture of the paper, which was intended for utilitarian purposes and is referred to as "oatmeal" because of its clusters of fibers and knots. In subject, graphic energy, and Baroque drama, Study for the Crucifixion typifies West's most impressive decora tive commissions. It is unlike any of the other works by him in the Museum's collection.These include five oils that range in date from his formative years as a portraitist in Pennsylvania to his maturity as history painter to George III, four ambitious drawings of historical and reli gious subjects, three modest pen-and-ink sketches, and several prints. hbw Ornament (Taiganja) . , . , , , . , ' active roles in ritual exchanges and ceremonial Indonesia (Sulawesi Island, central region), life as supernaturally powerful objects associ 19th century ated with fertility, prosperity, and protection Gold, h. 3 in.

Made near the end of Goya's life in about 1825, while he was living in exile in Bordeaux, it represents his enduring fascina tion with the people and culture of his native Spain.

Scale alone sets these two photographs apart from other "studies for art ists," but their magic comes especially from a surface pattern that inter rupts the images—a serendipitous accident that suggests a view through gossamer or an image printed on finely pleated silk. Instead of wiping his glass negatives clean and starting over, this artist recognized the effect as a veil that, like time or memory, removed the pictures from their mundane academic or utilitarian function and elevated them to the realm of art. The two images are complements.The female nude—Eve or Venus?— is a voluptuous fragment, surrounded by diaphanous white drapery and vignetted by the camera lens as if seen through a peephole. She is fully exposed, but with her face outside the frame, she remains an anonymous object of desire. By contrast, her male counterpart, in a pose recalling antique statuary, is shown in strict profile, face visible, hand open, standing alongside a blocky plinth and backed by the dark geometry of a ladder. md 1800 - 2000 57 Standing Female Nude; Standing Male Nude France, ca. 1856 Salted paper prints from glass negatives, each 17/8x11 '/s in.

Gift of Emma and Jay Lewis, 2011 (2011.321.7) This vase may be considered the tour de force of the oeuvre of James Callowhill, one of the most accom plished porcelain decorators working in the United States in the late nineteenth century. Callowhill acquired his expertise during the three decades he spent at the Worcester Royal Porcelain Works in England. He and his brother and two of their sons immigrated to the United States in the mid-i88os and began practicing their considerable skills at vari ous potteries along the Eastern Seaboard. By about 1889 Callowhill was working in Boston, where he decorated this vase in the mottled colors that are characteristic of his work. For this design he looked to several different exotic sources. The miniature flowers in jewel-like colors are outlined in thin gold lines that evoke Japanese Satsuma ware, which was enjoying great popularity at the time. The carefully executed chrysanthemums and prunus blossoms are set in cartouches of Islamic inspiration, with outlines created by leaving the stark white of the porcelain body undecorated.The vase's large size and the complexity of its decoration suggest that it may have been intended as an exhibition piece. acf 64 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS James Callowhill British, 1838-1917 Vase Boston, ca. 1889-1900 Porcelain, h. 22 in.

Saint-Gaudens's conception for the portrait was novel: Lincoln has risen from a deliberately oversized ceremonial chair of state and is poised to deliver an oration, a transitional moment encapsulating action and imminence. The result is an inspired likeness that conveys Lincoln's quintessence as a thinker, a leader, an orator, and the Great Emancipator. In 1910 the monumental sculpture was reduced to statuette size with the involvement of Saint-Gaudens's widow and his founders and studio assistants. This statuette, cast in 1911 as the first of an edi tion of about seventeen, was purchased by Clara Stone Hay, widow of John Hay, Lincoln's assistant private secretary and biographer and a friend of Saint-Gaudens's. It enhances the Museum's com prehensive collection of more than fifty works by the sculptor and has already become an iconic centerpiece of the new American Wing galleries that opened in January 2012. tt 1885- 1911 I 65 Augustus Saint-Gaudens American, Dublin 1848-1907 Cornish, New Hampshire Abraham Lincoln: The Man (Standing Lincoln) 1884-87; reduced 1910, cast 1911 Bronze, h. 40Yi in.

Menschel Photography Library Fund, and Maureen and Noel Testa Gift, 2011 (2011.66) Josef Maria Eder, founder and director of the Vienna Training and Research Institute of Graphic Art and the author of an early history of photography, was among the first to recognize the importance of X-rays for biology, medicine, and other purposes. Together with photochemist Eduard Valenta he produced this portfolio less than a month after Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen announced the discovery of X-rays.Just as William Henry Fox Talbot's The Pencil of Nature had shown the myriad uses of the new medium of photography fifty years earlier, Eder andValenta's volume was the first publication to demonstrate the X-ray's magical ability to reveal the hidden structure of living things. Human hands and feet, fish, frogs, a snake, a chameleon, a lizard, a rat, and a newborn rabbit are all presented in exquisitely printed photogravures, along with carved cameos and an assortment of natural materials. In an era when photography's ability to accurately depict the visible world had become commonplace, this newfound capacity to record the invisible opened up a host of new possibili ties, both scientific and aesthetic. The careful compositions and shocking appearance of these "Experiments in Photography" link them to the previous century's tradition of natural history illustration and presage the visual experi mentation of New Vision photographers in the 1910s and 1920s. lth 66 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS Smith &amp; Wesson (manufacturer) American, established 1852 Tiffany &amp; Co.

Gift of Jacqueline Loewe Fowler, 2011 (2011.234) Henry van de Velde gave up painting in 1892 for a career in architecture and design. In 1895 he completed his first house, which was built for his own family in the town of Uccle, near Brussels. Bloemenwerf House, as it was called, became a showcase for his belief in the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, the integration of all aspects of living into an artistically uni fied whole. To that end, all of the furnishings in his home, from door fixtures to wallpaper, had the same patterns of curvilinear embel lishment and the same flowing, elegant shapes designed in the Jugendstil style, a more recti linear and less asymmetrical variant of the international movement generally known as Art Nouveau. This elm and leather side chair is a variant of the suite of chairs originally made for Van de Velde's dining room. It was a highly suc cessful design that many of his clients requested for their homes. He produced the same chair in many different finishes, including exotic woods such as padouk and bubinga as well as mahogany and oak, and with seats that varied from the original simple woven rush to fabrics and leather. ja 67 Henry van de Velde (designer) Belgian, Antwerp 1863-1957 Zurich Société Van de Velde &amp; Company (manufacturer) Bloemenwerf Side Chair designed 1895 Elm, leather, brass; h. 37% in.

Colenbrander (the initials he was known by do not match the order of his given names) had become, like the British Christopher Dresser, one of the world's first industrial designers. Colenbrander performed work-for-hire jobs for a variety of manufacturers. He is best known as a designer of ceramics (notably for the Rozenburg factory in The Hague during the :88os) and carpets. In 1921 he was appointed design director at artist-dealer N. H. (Henri) van Lerven's newly formed Plateelbakkerij Ram (Ram Pottery) in Arnhem, where he produced some of his most astonishing and original work. On this vase free-flowing lines contain areas filled with con trasting saturated colors, suggesting inkblots or artfully splat tered paint. An ambiguous balance between positive and negative lends vibrant dynamism that presages the psychedelic art of a half century later. Although Colenbrander s enigmatic abstract designs seemingly avoid links with precedent or tradi tion, his exuberant colors and patterns reflect his generation's growing awareness of Islamic art, especially from Java, then a Dutch colony. His unusual palette may also reflect concurrent experiments by avant-garde Expressionist artists who used color to suggest emotions and moods. jdg 70 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS Prestige Cloth (Kente) Ghana, Ewe peoples, 1930-50 Cotton and silk, 73 x 120 in.

(45.7 cm) Provenance: Purchased from the maker by Steve Miller, 1993-2012. Gift of Steve Miller, 201212012.246) During the final years of his life the famed James D'Aquisto created a remarkable series of guitars that were a radical departure from traditional design. The twenty-four instruments represent the full maturity of his skill as a maker and his concept of eschewing metal and plastic hardware in favor of all natural materials. D'Aquisto also broke with traditional guitar architecture, which had been based largely on Art Deco motifs popular ized in the 1930s, by using new shapes for sound holes, a sleeker overall outline, asymmetrical lines, and an expanded palette of finish colors. This magnificent example has a stunning natural to honey sunburst finish and, unusual for D'Aquisto in those years, decorative inlaid maple strips on the macassar ebony hardware pieces. The headstock has a heart-shaped cutout, a motif that occurs on only one other D'Aquisto instrument. The guitar was finished and signed by D'Aquisto on November 23, 1993, and was subsequently purchased by D'Aquisto s good friend the rock and roll musician Steve Miller, who has donated it to the Museum to be "played and enjoyed." jkd 76 | RECENT ACQUISITIONS Alexander McQueen British, 1969-2010 Ensemble spring/summer 1999 Bodice of balsa wood and cream leather, trousers of cream pinstriped wool and cream silk lace; w. of bodice 48 in.

Purchase, Gould Family Foundation Gift, in memory of Jo Copeland, 2011 (2011.170a, b) Alexander McQueen's dazzling creativity and startling originality were expressed through the technical virtuosity of his fashions and the conceptual complexity of his runway presentations, which were suggestive of avant-garde installation and performance art. Rare among designers, he saw beyond cloth ing's physical constraints to its ideational and ideological possibilities.That for McQueen fashion was not simply about wearability is clearly expressed in this piece made from balsa wood shaped to resemble butterfly wings. With its del icate hand-punched pattern, it questions the requisites of clothing, insisting upon a reevaluation of simplistic and reductionist interpretations of fashion. The piece formed part of McQueen's spring/summer 1999 collection, entitled "No. 13," which explored the relationship between the nineteenth century Arts and Crafts Movement and what the designer called the "hard edge of the technology of textiles." The show opened with athlete Aimee Mullins in a pair of hand-carved prosthetic legs designed by McQueen. (Mullins was born with fibular hemimelia, or missing fibula bones, and had both her legs amputated below the knee when she was a year old.)

Denise and Andrew Saul Fund, 201112011.512a-e) The curves of A Drawing in Five Parts were inspired in part by the subtly shifting slopes of the sand dunes on the San Francisco beach where Serra grew up and in part by the arching lines raked into the sand in the Zen gardens of Kyoto. To create the drawings Serra first melted a number of paintsticks. He then evenly spread the now fluid medium onto a worktable and covered it with metal mesh. Next he placed sheets of paper facedown on top and pressed a stylus onto the verso of the paper, forcing the liquefied medium through the screen and onto the surface. Like Serra's sculpture, the five sequential drawings with their nestled arcs suggest motion and imply the passage of time. ia 2004-5 79 Richard Serra American, born San Francisco 1938 A Drawing in Five Parts 2005 Paintstick on handmade paper, each part 40x40 in.

Purchase, 2011 NoRuz at the Met Benefit, 2012 (2012.39) Poet Turning into Heech is a tall cylindrical form with a polelike extension rising from its top. The upper half of the cylinder is covered with rows of pseudoinscriptions with the letters of the word heech, which means "nothing" in Persian, coiled around it. The whole upper portion of the piece rests on two "legs," narrow poles set into a base. Like many of sculptor and scholar Parviz Tanavoli s heech sculptures, this one is anthro pomorphic, perhaps a metaphoric allusion to a poet. For decades Tanavoli has divided his time between his native Iran, the United States, and Canada. One of the founders of the Saqqakhana School, whose followers focused on the intersec tion of contemporary practices with traditional Persian folk art forms,Tanavoli began to create his legendary heech sculptures in the early 1960s. Originally conceived as a reaction to the art of the Saqqakhana School, which he felt had lost its purity and become increasingly commercial ized, the sculptures are deeply rooted in Rumi's mystical poetry, visualizing the Sufi belief that God creates everything from nothing. They are optimistic, whimsical, and anthropomorphic ren ditions of "nothing" as it sits on chairs, emerges from cages, or envelops a poet. me Parviz Tanavoli Iranian, born Tehran 1937, active in Canada Poet Turning into Heech 2007 Bronze, h. 8954 in.
