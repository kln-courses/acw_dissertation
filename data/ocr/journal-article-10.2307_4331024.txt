CORNELL St. John's College Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501 Man is practically unable for psychological reasons, to do without an integral idea of the universe. Crude or refined, with our consent or without it, such a trans-scientific picture of the world will settle in the minds of each of us, ruling our lives more effectively than scientific truth. Ortega y Gasset The paradox has long been recognized in the history of science that our very admiration for a successful theory can be the greatest obstacle to its historical investigation. For historical analysis requires that we somehow distance ourselves from the theory holding it momentarily as a problem and a mere possibility - if we are to learn anything about the complicated transscientiflc "influences" on its actual origin. This essay is prompted by what seems to be a need for a more distanced, objective viewpoint in Darwin studies, living as we do in the era of neo-Darwinism.1 Scholars have conquered the positivist tendency in some respects - avoiding, for example, the projection of Darwin's later ideas upon his early theoretical notes. But in at least one important respect, in the consideration of Darwin's relation to abstract metaphysics, we may too easily assume the stance of a later Darwinism allegedly "pure" of cosmic beliefs. Some writers suggest that Darwin was fundamentally agnostic in the years when he first developed natural selection (1837 1839),2 a view particularly redolent of positivist history and, as we Journal of the History of Biology, vol. 20, no. 3 (Fall 1987) pp. 381-412.

CORNELL shall see, at variance with the bulk of textual evidence.3 But more commonly, and more justifiably, the impression that Darwin's teaching was not fundamentally influenced by theology or meta- physics comes about by the emphasis on his real struggle (before and after publishing the Origin) to purify his thinking of uncertain theistic assumptions. Darwin's "positive" achievements continually revised nineteenth-century theologies of nature - this is certainly significant in modern ideas - and he himself ended up an agnostic,4 with his science unrevised. Perhaps in taking Darwin's final outcome, or some pure version of Darwinism, as a settled goal, indicating (almost teleologically) the guiding principle of his growth, recent biographers make the continuity of his mind with the theological past less significant than the continuity with a skeptical future. Neal Gillespie describes Darwin's contribution to the "positivist episteme" in opposition to the old creationism.5 Howard Gruber has stressed how Darwin effectively put God outside the field of nature's laws.6 David Kohn has detailed Darwin's break with the earlier theology of harmony or balance of nature.7 Something of an exception among recent students of 204n 13; and compare David Kohn and M. J. S. Hodge, The Immediate Origins of Natural Selection," in The Darwinian Heritage, ed. David Kohn (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1 985). 3. 1 am indebted to the anonymous reviewer of this article for reminding me that even Darwin's belief in God was probably not without tension in the late 1 830s. Darwin says in Notebook M, for example, that his biologically determinis- tic views regarding moral behavior "would make a man a predestinarian of a new kind because he would tend to be an atheist. Man thus believing would more earnestly pray 'deliver us from temptation,' he would be most humble, he would strive to do good to improve his organization". (M 74 isee below, n. 121). While it is not likely that this consideration of atheism was merely impersonal, it may be merely relative to the traditional Christian moral ideas under consideration; and even there Darwin seems to take conventional prayer and simply give it a new sense within his larger metaphysical system of law. As we shall see below, the dominant trend in Darwin's notes is exactly that: he absorbs contemporary (and perhaps naive) ideas of divinity into his grander, but ultimately theistic, scheme. Much of Darwin's early criticism of religion may thus come to resemble his early "materialism," which, as others have shown (see below, n. 31), fits into an overarching deistic framework. 4.

Yet Ospovat did not insist on any profound or permanent influence of theistic notions on Darwin's science either, pursuing, rather, the opposite question of how his theology gradually had to "accommodate" his science.' Peter Bowler's synthesis of scholarly opinion on Darwin's theoretical development well reflects the inclination to tell the story with an eye to the eventual triumph of Darwinian mechanicism: he takes Darwin's theological remarks after conceiving natural selection as "lapses of wishful thinking," and Darwin's analogical argument for selection as indicating a vague "inability to throw off the influence of the design argument."' This essay does not seek to reject these recent observations. Rather, it seeks to suggest that the historian's view to a certain kind of progress, even if that progress does genuinely exist, can distract us from other substantial issues that happen to lie outside that view. It is interesting that earlier scholars - Gertrude Himmelfarb, Walter Cannon, Robert Young - had a keen sense of the way theological or metaphysical notions were quietly integrated into Darwin's "scientific" teachings."' Unfortunately, they did not document this influence extensively, being less acquainted than are current students of Darwin with the crucial texts from the years of his discovery of natural selection. This essay intends to make clear, however, through the interpretation of these crucial texts, both published and in manuscript, that the fact of overall metaphysical influence is indeed there and that in a sense it is the relief in which Darwin's shifts and struggles and equivocations must be cast. One might well focus on what rare agnostic thoughts Darwin had before, say, the 1860s, or on the fact that later Darwin wished to enunciate his general view of nature without relying on the theology through which it was originally conceived. But this might distract us from the more fundamental determinant of Darwin's intellectual career: from the critical years in which he formed his ideas, he retained a fairly continuous a priori belief about the 8.

CORNELL ultimate structure of the cosmos, which became practically in- separable from his understanding of natural selection. He believed that the universe consisted essentially of mechanical laws ordered according to a hidden simplicity and intelligibility. At what point this belief should be called "theological," at what point "meta- physical," and at what point simply "attitudinal," may be a matter of taste. The issue is that a definite cosmological bias endured throughout Darwin's development of his great theory of natural selection, and it decisively prejudiced his judgment about his own discovery. In particular, it determined his general estimation of natural selection as the most important of nature's principles - the key, as it were, to organic nature as a whole. Only when we are clear on the fundamental connection between Darwin's famous doctrine of living things and the metaphysical commitment that preceded it can we fully appreciate an intriguing problem in the foundations of modem biology. DARWIN'S ACCEPTANCE OF CREATION BY LAW It should be recognized, first of all, that from the 1830s until at least 1859, Darwin seems to have accepted the general idea of divine creation. This idea, however, excluded all intervention by God in favor of a hierarchical system of laws designed to produce the world we know. Darwin's concern to defend the principle of divine law against that of divine caprice appears explicitly, for instance, in his B notebook (B 22, 45, 98, and esp. 101)" and in the M and N notebooks (e.g., M 154e, N 12; see below);'2 it animates his notes on the Attributes of God by the geologist- theologian John MacCulloch, which were written after Darwin discovered natural selection (MS pp. 1, 3, 6); it shapes the 1842 and 1844 drafts of his theory,'3 and even the Origin of Species, insofar as that work pits lawful natural selection against special creation.

As for the inspirations of Darwin's doctrine of creation, one might look to the more speculative naturalists of his acquaintance, such as Robert Grant and Erasmus Darwin,14 or even to William Paley, who acknowledged the "magnificence" and the "sublimity" of the Creator's astronomic laws in his Natural Theology, much as Darwin would later.15 Yet so much of Darwin's theoretical devel- opment can be linked to his study of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology while serving as naturalist on H. M. S. Beagle, that Lyell may well have indelibly impressed on him the meaning of a law- bound universe. Lyell's argument for uniformitarian geology, after all, rested on the systematic unity of natural law. "Our estimate of the value of all geological evidence," he wrote, and the interest derived from the investigation of the earth's history, must depend entirely on the degree of confidence which we feel in regard to the permanency of the laws of nature. Their immutable constancy alone can enable us ... to arrive at the knowledge of general principles in the economy of our terrestial system.'6 Lyell also claimed (as Darwin would) empirical evidence in support of this particular metaphysical view: he took the close comparability of fossil remains with living animals, and the uni- formity of animal instinct, to suggest the unity of laws across time as well as between the organic and the inorganic.'7 Even in making a clear exception for man's origin and place in nature, Lyell seemed to strengthen his uniformitarian position. None of the "fixed and constant laws of the animate or inanimate world" had been undermined by human beings - except in a "moral" sense, he said - and there was no reason to suppose fundamental exceptions for nature's past operations.'8 But Lyell's position on the creation of organisms was further ambiguous.

CORNELL made geophysical suppositions, for instance, that the overall design of God's laws balanced forces that conserved the earth's habitable land, he never worked out the larger design of the particular changes of living beings. It remained necessary in his scheme that better-adapted organisms be continually, and it seems specially, created to replace extinct forms.19 While Darwin came to question Lyell's creationism during his Pacific travels 2- since he met with forms apparently transported from other places, and yet failed to meet with those he anticipated on the theory of creations for specific environments - nonetheless he probably preserved Lyell's scheme of divine law and just incorporated the idea of hereditary descent into it. Consider that puzzling passage in Darwin's Beagle diary (and later his Journal), his well-known meditation on the bizarre Australian fauna: the unity of divine creation and the unity of descent are curiously interchangeable. Following Lyell - who was following Paley, who in turn was scolding Hume - Darwin criticized the heretic supposition that there was more than one creator, and that a different deity was responsible for the Australian forms than for the European or American. No, he says, these two "creations" were truly the work of one hand, for he could observe at that moment the Australian lion-ant trapping its prey in the sand, just like the European species.2' It is exceedingly difficult to know all that he is assuming here, but either organic descent or mono- theistic law could already be presupposed in the theological "argument"; indeed, these may both be tied up, for Darwin, with the belief in nature's unity and simplicity as a system. Why, we might ask, does Darwin's "disbeliever" already admit, in practically theistic terms, that on different continents "the object . .. has been the same &amp; certainly the end in each case is complete"?2' Why should an insect genus (containing, presumably, separately created species) prove unity better than, say, the order of Marsupials (also represented on other continents)? Further, M. J. S. Hodge has noted that Darwin would soon reject the superfluous hypothesis that lion-ants and marsupials were created more than once, most 19. M. J. S.

Isolation might be responsible for a distinct fauna like Australia's, just as migration, conversely, might be responsible for hereditary changes of form elsewhere.22 The connection between descent and divine unity that possibly informed this note from the Beagle voyage arises, at any rate, in Darwin's first notebook on transmutation, opened after his return to England. Arguments for the unity of law and for transmutation there are often explicitly one and the same. If we accept at all that the Creator creates by laws, Darwin says, this is certainly "shown" by the geological character of the Galapagos islands, whose age and distance from the South American mainland correspond to the distribution and character of their species (B 98). It is absurd, he continues, to attribute every natural detail to the Creator's forethought and to ignore the possibility of lawful unfolding - to imagine Him specially creating in the Galapagos only those birds that could not have arrived there, and to overlook such general phenomena as the variability that animals manifest in new coun- tries. This line of thought culminates in a proclamation of descent as divine law: Astronomers might formerly have said that God ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In same manner God orders each animal created with certain form in certain country, but how much more simple and sublime power let attraction act according to certain law, such are inevitable consequences - let animal be created, then by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their successors. (B 10)1) Darwin's association of descent and creation by law is important because it represents the essence of his metaphysical originality in these crucial years (1837-1 839). English natural theologians had hesitated to simplify creation to this point. Paley had admired God's planning as discernible in physical astronomy, but he found this science defective for proving a designing Intelligence since its principles, in themselves, were remote from the notions of plan or purpose.2 William Whewell, writing decades later, agreed; merely "igeneral law," he lamented, "may seem in many cases to remove further from us the proof of providential care," for it rules instances both where the welfare of creatures is concerned and 22.

CORNELL where it is not.24 Hence a cogent argument for design had appeared to depend on reasoning from particular, clearly pur- posive organisms; and the association of design with special creations was much the order of the day. It was probably to protect the traditional argument for design that Whewell and Lyell left vague the question of species' origins in their respective schemes of the earth's history.25 By contrast, Darwin's theology transcended such tokens of "empiricist" creationism. Beginning as he did with the more abstract notion of divine law, he had no use for the Paleyan approach to design. He did not so much deny the notion of God's intelligent construction of particular "living machines" as simply replace it with the idea of the intelligent ordering of general phenomena. The pattern in Galapagos geography showed how the Creator creates, and so did a widespread event like the simul- taneous extinction of mammals. Reflecting on the latter problem, Darwin asks: "What does [God do] in this world without rule?" (D 72). Yet this legalism represented not only the essence but also the extent of Darwin's radicalism in theology. Apart from his thoroughgoing denial of divine intervention in creation, his belief was quite conventional. He merely reduced the doctrine of crea- tion to the deistic idea of wise law that contemporary scientists accepted as inviolable. As an example of this deistic dogma, consider Lyell's later reflection on the relation of law to the introduction of species: It may be asked why shd omnipotence tie itself down by restrictions - the answer is first that it is so - 2ndly Man is enabled thereby to study &amp; understand the mechanism of the orgc &amp; inorganic worlds. This may be a very small part of the reasons of fixed laws but one is enough.26 24.

William Carpenter, too, announced in his Principles of General and Comparative Physiology (1839) his implicit belief in the hierarchy of laws, for the sake of science and theology. He assumed, much like Lyell, the providence of these principles for human knowledge. "We cannot but believe," he confessed, "that the Creator, in endowing us with tour intellectuall faculties, intended that they should conduct us nearer to the conception of his Infinite mind."27 We should leave no doubt about Darwin's willingness to accept this higher theology of law, or his ability to reason from it in a purely metaphysical way - so lightly is it treated these days by commentators. Darwin's personal notations suggest that his ad- miration for a sublime Legislator was not simply rhetoric.28 Particularly telling might be his response in reading Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who probably did employ rhetorical techniques following the tradition of earlier, Enlightenment authors - to conceal but also allude to his own pantheism. In a note in the Principes de philosophie zoologique, Geoffroy exalts the signifi- cantly feminine "puissance creatrice" who ruled that the elements "be eternally abandoned to chance" (emphasis added).2' A closet agnostic might have been more suspicious than Darwin, who only puzzled over Saint-Hilaire's belief in descent (B 111). Darwin interprets the curious metaphysics after his own assumption: "Hlilairel says grand idea God giving laws and on them leaving all to follow consequences" (B 1 14). Darwin's private endorsement of the atheist Auguste Comte, too, whose Cours de philosophie positive he read about in the Edinburgh Review,30 entailed no violation of his own theistic 27. William B. Carpenter, Principles of General and Comparative Physiology (London: Churchill, 1839), p. 463; see also pp. 1-3. William Whewell, too, endorsed a providential view of the "fundamental ideas" of science (such as space, number, and causality), and so assured the natural philosopher's contact with created reality (see Whewell, Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, I, 29; II, 634). 28. In his copy of Lamarck's Philosophie zoologique, for example, Darwin circled Lamarck's words "sublime Auteur" (referring to a Creator whose will works through the order of nature) and drew a line linking it to Lamarck's expression of admiration for such a regular deity; see Darwin's copy, in Cam- bridge University Library, of J.-B.

It was Comte's denial of divine "contrivance" that Darwin applauded (M 70). He sided with Comte as a way of shaming providentialists who did not appreciate God's "most magnificent laws which we profane in thinking not capable to produce every effect of every kind which surrounds us" (M 136). Comte's triadic scheme of human progress was taken in the same theistic context - and so, as Ospovat showed, progress in the idea of God told not against all theology for Darwin, but only against the special implantation of the idea of God in man's mind.3' Darwin still acknowledged the "implicit faith" of the "civilized nations ... that through the goodness of God knowledge has been communicated to us" (M 136). He also argued, again disregarding Comte, that the lawbound will of God indicated analogically the deterministic character of man's volition: Now it is not a little remarkable that the fixed laws of nature should be universally thought to be the will of a superior being, whose natures can only be rudely traced out. When one sees this, one suspects that our will may arise from as fixed laws of organization. (M 69-70) Later we shall see how this same, free analogical argument about man and God characterized Darwin's reflections on his Malthus reading as well. Perhaps what best reveals Darwin's reliance on some meta- physical beliefs is his approach to the origin of the ideas basic to the post-Newtonian outlook, such as God and mechanical causality. Darwin pursued no epistemology in the strict sense of analyzing the extent to which such human ideas have actual objects; these ideas were merely assumed to represent reality and, like practically everything else, were described as emerging in intelligent organisms through descent and divine law. Darwin's goal in several passages of the M and N notebooks was to consider how the concepts used in science and theology are foreshadowed in the mental operations of lower animals and could therefore atheism. The Laplacean physics that Comte favored would lead, not to a chilling despiritualization of the universe, but to a grander conception of the deity. Darwin's silence in his notes on this point probably signifies consent, since it is essentially a claim he makes himself at other times (see Notebook N, p. 36; and "Sketch of 1842," p. 87). 31. See Ospovat, "God and Natural Selection," p. 183: "The idea of God [wasl for Darwin one of the effects which God's laws produce."</page><page sequence="11">Theistic Metaphysics and Darwin's Natural Selection 391 spring from his presupposed system of lawful creation.32 Signifi- cantly, when he read one philosopher who did question the theological and metaphysical underpinnings of the post-Newtonian outlook - David Hume - he did not notice how thoroughly the Scottish thinker had undermined the foundations of any simple and comprehensive system. Hume's essay "Of the Reason of Animals," mentioned by Darwin in his personal notes, takes scientific truth as intrinsically limited by practical groping and compares the scientist's principles to animal beliefs.33 Darwin's remark on the essay suggests that he was rather seeking evidence for his transformist idea of the "origin of religion" (N 101), and was presupposing the ultimate truths that Hume questioned. Similarly, Darwin did not trouble with how, in "Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy," Hume denies the ability of the human mind to determine what principles lie behind sensation and criticizes philosophers' invocation of divine authority.34 One might simply take Darwin's part and assume that he did well to sidestep Hume and get on with his science, as Darwin himself implies later in his Alutobiography.35 Still, the fact is that in this crucial period he never saw Hume's deeper, critical challenge to the theistic metaphysics on which Darwin was founding his new view of creation. Rather than suspect his own metaphysical assumptions, he suspected that "the endless round of doubts &amp; scepticisms might be solved by considering the origin of reason, as gradually developed" (N 101 ).36 As we shall see, Darwin's indifference here to fundamental epistemological criticism would have some effect on his mature thought about nature as a whole. 32. See, e.g., M 141 and N 14, in which Darwin refers to John Abercrombie, Inquiries C oncerning the Intellectual Powers (London: Murray, 1838), and William Whewell, History of the Inductive Sciences, 3 vols. (London: Parker, 1837). Darwin's copy of Abercrombie (in Cambridge University Library) also contains marginalia on the "instinctualization" of science; on p. 8 Darwin notes, for example, "as simple animals must also have causation. The conviction of truth may be owing to these simple causes followed by uniform effects, only affecting such beings." 33. David Hume, Philosophical Essays on Morals, Literature, and Politics, 2 vols.

CORNELL THE METAPHYSICAL EXPRESSION OF DARWIN'S EMPIRICAL INQUIRIES Bearing in mind Darwin's willingness to accept a divine creation- by-law, we turn now to examine how this belief informed his natural science and ultimately his doctrine of natural selection. We may begin by considering how he related transformation to other general phenomena, speculating on a providential system of means and ends. From the opening of Notebook B, Darwin understood sexual generation as having a profound "final cause," a greater purpose than mere reproduction: sexual generation, in contrast to budding or gemmation, creates the variability necessary for plants and animals to adapt in a "world subject to change" (B 2). We might say that Darwin took Lyell's teaching that the particular variations of a species were providentially appointed in view of its future environment, and replaced Lyell's implicit creationism with trans- formism, understanding variability now as providentially appointed for species' continuous change. The metaphysical meaning of Darwin's sexual inquiry is clear in a development at D 18-19: the mule does not reproduce itself successfully through sexual mixing, he now maintains, because gradual acquisition of character is necessary in transformation and the mule is a sudden synthesis. If a mule did generate, Darwin continues, "the Creator would thus contradict his own law." In addition to its link to variability, because sexual generation requires the union of individuals and in many cases the rearing of young, Darwin interpreted it as part of the Creator's long-term plan for producing the social animals (C 236; E 48). He also put into the cosmic pattern the phenomenon of individual death, which he held to originate in sexual organisms. Death must be necessary - at least "with our present systems of body &amp; universe" (B 5) - in that accidental injuries would accrue in animals that "lived for ever." As in Darwin's sexual speculations, the idea of hierarchical arrangement in the system of divine laws, whereby some rules necessarily impinge on others, can be found throughout his notes.37 In the second transmutation notebook, for example, he takes diversification as itself a means for getting the greatest number of beings in the earth's limited available space. Thinking that "certain preexisting laws" - Lyellian laws of geographical conservation (C 147-148e) - are already given, Darwin suggests 37. This reasoning about God's system may be traced at least to Paley; see Paley, Natural Theology, chap. 3 (I, 69).</page><page sequence="13">Theistic Metaphysics and Darwin's Natural Selection 393 that the formation of species and genera was arranged to maximize the earth's potential for life (C 146). But whether means or end, transmutation is consistently treated as a general phenomenon with some simple rule, thanks to the hierarchical image of God's "laws invoking laws" (M 154e). Darwin is not skeptical, but only "careful" about identifying the supreme principle that produces development.38 "Is there some law in nature an animal may acquire organs, but lose them with more difficulty -" he ponders in Note- book D; "such law would explain every thing. - Pure hypothesis be careful -" (D 58). It is particularly important to note how Darwin's idea of lawful creation affects the issue of adaptation, so central to his later doctrine. As Kohn has observed, Darwin's initial case for trans- mutation entailed loosening the Lyellian stipulation about the strict adaptation of each creature to its destined environment.39 At B 1 5 Darwin says: "It is a point of great interest to prove animals not adapted to each country. - Provision for transportal otherwise not so numerous . . . ." Yet his critique of creationist adaptation simultaneously alluded to the alternative system of law he imagined. In the long passage invoking creation-by-law cited above from Notebook B, he emphasizes the similarity of modern armadillos to fossil edentates. What but the hope to supplant the constant claims of special providence with absolute rules made him imagine higher, comparative grounds from which to view an allegedly designful "adaptation" in edentates "- Passage for vertebrae in neck - same cause Ilaw of heredity?]; such beautiful adaptation, yet other animals live so well -" (B 99, emphasis added). The need to dispel the impression of special designs made by fine adaptations, and to sketch the higher design of creation, is further evident in Notebook C: "There is no correlation between individual objects as Ichneumon &amp; caterpillar," Darwin asserts, "though our ignorance may make us think so, but only between laws" (C 173). He thus does not doubt that peculiar adaptations have been ordered between animals; he considers it significant, for example, that human earwax repels insects (C 174). But the correct metaphysical view of the creation of these adaptations, the note implies, is an ordering of laws, not the making of the animals themselves. Divine action cannot have been directly exercised on the specific contrivances since they are not "perfect": "The 38. In his Autobiography (p. 141), Darwin admits to having not been "skeptical." His claim that skepticism would have been harmful to science may be an attempt to justify his original theological persuasion. 39.

CORNELL cor[rjelations are not, however, perfect, else one animal would not cause misery to other, - else smell of man would be disagreeable to mosquitoes" (C 174). Clearly Darwin did puzzle about co- adaptation in casting about for the mechanism of descent, as he later said in the Origin of Species,4" for he immediately goes on to call adaptation "really perhaps the greatest difficulty to whole theory" (C 175). As we shall see shortly, his solution to this "difficulty" would offer what special-creationism could not, namely, a proper estimation of the "perfection" of organisms and the lawful way (presumably a more divine way) of producing it. The theological debate that Darwin was pursuing in his trans- mutation notes can also be recognized in his references to Reverend Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population. It is well known that this reading signaled a decisive turn on Darwin's theoretical path toward natural selection: Malthus showed him how severe the "warring of species" must be, and how, under changing circumstances, it constitutes a process for sifting better-adapted individuals.4' Darwin's "Malthusian" views, Kohn has emphasized, entailed criticism of traditional theology. When Darwin says "every one till he thinks deeply has assumed that (the) increase of animals (is) exactly proportiona(te) to the number that can live" (D 134), he refers to the assumption of providential harmony between each feature of an organism (such as reproduction rate) and its particular environment.42 But note that, again, Darwin is correcting an essentially special-creationist view of providence, which he often does in making way for his alternative, universal system of creation.43 And he does seem to have already figured the population principle into that system. One indication of this is the way his first account of the universal pressure of population distinguishes the human response: he stresses the effect of the practices of agriculture and restraint from reproduction among men, over against all other beings. Population problems inspire "energy" in man, but produce formal changes universally. The point is not that such a relative distinction is incorrect, but that, in distinguishing man's resources for coping with population, and omitting possible analogical resources of other animals, Darwin tacitly appeals to a rigid metaphysical order where only man can make for himself a distinct place. 40.

Darwin was not merely engaging in theodicy here, incidentally seeking a "final cause" or purpose in the awful death and destruction he had discovered. The "final cause" refers to the reproductive "wedging" and not the dying. Rather, he seems to take fecundity and competition themselves as laws designed for creating the world. In a subsequent comment on the Essay, he criticizes Malthus for not having followed through with his own theology of law, for not having pushed it beyond miraculous acts to a general scheme of creation. Darwin cites Malthus, at the same time ridiculing his implicit creationism: "It accords with the most liberal! spirit of philosophy to believe that no stone can fall, or plant rise, without the immediate agency of the deity. But we known from experience! that these operations of what we call nature, have been conducted almost! invariably according to fixed laws: and since the world began, the causes of population &amp; depopulation have been probably as constant as any of the laws of nature with which we are acquainted." - This applies to one species I would apply it not only to population &amp; depopulation, but extermination &amp; production of new forms.. .. (E 3) In applying the Malthusian law to two great problems at once, "'extermination &amp; production," Darwin may even have assumed that the new principle must therefore have a higher place in the general system of law he presupposes. A later passage seems to confirm such an interest in metaphysical unity on Darwin's part: "If species change, we see external conditions have great effect on them &amp; therefore extermination becomes part of same law" (E 43, emphasis added). The issue, then, is not whether Darwin's belief produced a theodicy or even a curious but dispensable meta- physical "background" to his Malthusian views. The issue is whether his metaphysics of designed law artificially inflated his estimate of the Malthusian principle, tagging it as the anticipated, higher law of creation. Subsequent pages of Darwin's notebooks evidence this theoretical effect of his metaphysical belief. THE THEOLOGY OF PERFECTION AND SELECTION In this section I propose a simple thesis to resolve some of the apparent complexities of Darwin's last transmutation notebook:</page><page sequence="16">396 JOHN F. CORNELL the power he attributed to his new mechanism depended specifi- cally on the assumption of a divine Being, intelligent like man but superior and utterly lawful. This assumption underlay both Darwin's idea of natural species' "perfect adaptation" and his stunning analogy of selective breeding to describe nature in terms of his mechanism. Although it distorts Darwin's thought somewhat to separate these two themes, I shall take up that of perfection first because the scholarly literature that I will comment on has isolated it. Several students of Darwin have considered the meaning of "perfect adaptation," or (more accurately) "perfectly adapted" beings, and heard its evocation of the English natural theological idea of organisms' appropriate construction for their environments. Yet no account so far has made complete sense of Darwin's references. Most recently, Dov Ospovat aligned Darwin's phrase with a moderate contemporary assessment of adaptation, one even admitting imperfections, according to the view that the deity was limited by his other laws." But without examples of Darwin or his contemporaries using this phrase specifically to refer to God's limits, that contextual explanation may be misleading. I would suggest that Darwin's motive for using the term is both simpler and more revealing. The word "perfect" is an adjective generally reserved for divine action. That is how, for instance, Paley used it,45 and it was probably what Darwin understood, even when he was criticizing the belief in the perfection of particular forms (as we saw, e.g., at C 174) because that belief implied special creation by God. Now Darwin proclaims such divine "perfection" of adaptation only when he holds the true, lawful scheme of creation to be concerned. Significantly, he does this mostly after his insight into the Malthusian law. "Perfect adaptation" signifies Darwin's belief that the law he has discovered is not merely one principle in the infinite richness of nature, but the essential cosmic plan. Let us look at the texts. The first notebook phrase apparently referring to the perfection of adaptation is in Notebook D (p. 36, August 1838), shortly before Darwin's Malthus reading. he pro- claims the "magnificent view" one has of the world by conceiving not a feeble anthropoid Creator but One who has lawfully linked astronomical causes to geographical and meteorological causes, finally producing mutually adapted changes in which bodies "keep perfect" through "certain laws of harmony." As always, Darwin's 44. Dov Ospovat, The Development of Darwin's Theory (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1981), pp. 36-37. See also n. 39 (above). 45. Paley, Natural Theology, chaps. 3 and 5 (I, 59, 82).</page><page sequence="17">Theistic Metaphysics and Darwin's Natural Selection 397 idea of "perfection" refers to the nice relationship of organisms to their physical surroundings. But it also refers to the overall design of the world, from a divine viewpoint. Later, at E 48 (that is, after the Malthus insight), perfection is mentioned favorably again. Darwin refers to "this perfect world" in another long discussion of the universe's several great "final causes," or divine aims, produced by general laws. Again, one of these providential aims is the broad adaptation of animals to their surroundings, and, significantly, it is achieved by the newly recognized Lyellio-Malthusian arrangement that physical changes should act on masses of individuals (E 50 - 51). This latter reference, accommodating Darwin's Malthusian insight, precedes almost immediately his first use of the actual phrase "perfectly adapted" (at E 57). Darwin's sense of a com- prehensive system, the invocation of divine perfection, and his new theory are thus all closely connected. The phrase "perfectly adapted," to be sure, expresses the organism's relation to its immediate environment. But for Darwin it also describes the result of a rigorous universal law, as the Malthusian mechanism is now understood. Variations accumulate on "any structure," Darwin says at E 57, "so long as" it shall be "perfectly adapted." The phrase "perfectly adapted" describing organisms occurs now and only now in the notebooks, that is, in the months after Darwin's Malthus reading. It appears in the final transmutation notebook four or five more times (E 71 12x], 72, 75, 122e), and twice in Darwin's notes on MacCulloch's natural theology (Mc 3, 11), which date from the same period, where the general, lawful design of the cosmos is still being defended against traditional crea- tionism; for instance, at E 71, the fact that domesticated animals are not "perfectly adapted" is apparently related to the "arbitrary" (i.e., relatively unlawful) procedure of man. Darwin's use of the phrase "perfectly adapted" for natural species evokes, not the limited degree of adaptation (which would be a paradoxical meaning), but the lawful way of achieving adaptation, appropriate to a deity, that Darwin has discovered. This metaphysical background to Darwin's theorizing has decisive consequences in the way he orients his conception of nature as a whole around his new mechanism. Consider: had Darwin given an exact, methodologically rigorous statement about the Malthusian principle, independent of the theistic context, he</page><page sequence="18">398 JOHN F. CORNELL might have said that any variation could thrive that was sufficiently (not perfectly) adapted to circumstances. The necessary relation he had discovered would allude to no cosmic purpose, no over- arching law for all creation, but only to the fact that adaptation was an indeterminate, limiting condition on the production of organic form and diversity. But, as it was, with the metaphysical idea that God achieved some simple ends through general laws, that one of these ends is adaptation, and that its law might now be uncovered, Darwin assumed the high, creative power of the Malthusian rule and tied it to the production of "perfection." Prior metaphysical belief gave his principle an unlimited and cosmo- logical, rather than a limited and conditional, form.46 Perhaps it would clarify our reading to say a word about Ospovat's contrasting interpretation of the Darwinian theme of "perfect adaptation." By focusing on the general continuity between Darwin and his context, Ospovat did not stress the remarkable link between Darwin's new theory and his sudden endorsement of perfect adaptation, representing the final fulfillment of a search after a general law to substitute for special creation. For Ospovat, "perfect adaptation" was therefore only a vague vestige of Darwin's original thinking, not an expression of the preexisting metaphysics that appropriated and colored his new empirical idea. Ospovat stressed what he thought to be evidence of a reverse influence, the influence of Darwin's new theory upon some original theological notions. Only under the impact of the Malthusian principle of population, on Ospovat's view, did Darwin come to endorse a theology of creation by merely general laws;47 and later, as Darwin meditated on the problem of competition between foreign and native species, he finally abandoned perfect adaptation for an emphasis on "relative" fitness.48 But the first change Ospovat suggested is altogether doubtful. As we have seen, Darwin was searching for general laws long before he hit upon his theory; it was rather the theory that was cast into the preexisting mold of creation by general laws. As for the second change, Darwin's shift away from perfect adaptation (which Ospovat would date from the 1850s49), there is a slight shift in Darwin's choice of words, perhaps, but no revision in the 46. See also Darwin's "Essay of 1844," p. 155, where natural selection is described (indirectly) as a "method" for adapting things to various ends - that is, from the same cosmological elevation. 47.

Ibid., p. 205.</page><page sequence="19">Theistic Metaphysics and Darwin's Natural Selection 399 cosmic goal that "perfect adaptation" represented initially. Darwin's interest in a certain "relativity" of adaptation did not represent a decisive departure from his idea of adaptation "perfectly" achieved through law; that interest represented another criticism of the creationist idea of absolute and unconditioned perfection of an organism, and it existed in Darwin's notes before he read Malthus.50 Moreover, the "relativist" critique of creationist perfection and the idea of lawfully produced "perfection" are not incompatible, and in fact they exist together in Darwin's 1842 "Sketch" of natural selection.5' While it is true that Darwin does not use the words "perfect adaptation" much in the Origin of Species, the original sense of "perfect adaptation," the designed universal goal of fit organic form, is still present in the Origin. The scale by which Darwin measures living beings is still the ideal goal of perfect adaptation, a goal achieved lawfully, however, over time and even in the future, not by a once-and-for-all special act of God. Thus he says that the success of foreign animals in a place shows that the natives are not so "perfectly adapted" that they could not be "improved."52 It may be confusing that, in the Origin, Darwin often refers to the creationist idea of perfection he is out to refute.53 But he had not changed the fundamental orientation of his thought around some single, adaptation-making process, harkening back to his metaphysics of providential law. The idea of examining two alternative metaphysical beliefs special creation, and general creation by some intelligently de- signed law - still informed Darwin's thinking about adaptation in the Origin. This may be seen from what he says about "organs of extreme perfection." He addresses the "difficulty" of how to account for such marvels of complexity as the eye, a difficulty he doubtless foresaw from creationists in the Paleyan tradition. His reply involves arguing the possibility of the gradual development of such fine organs, and then showing imaginatively the application of his own mechanism of change.54 But a theological thread runs though the argument: It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long- continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we 50. See, for example, C 73. 51. Darwin, "Sketch of 1842," p. 68. 52.

But may not this inference be presump- tuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? 55 And Darwin's theory is obviously compatible with the more sublime theology. His natural power, "always intently watching each slight accidental alteration," well conforms, he suggests, to the notion of the superiority of the works of the Creator to man.56 Darwin still presented the question as a metaphysical one about the means used by a Creator in achieving perfection: special intervention in nature, or a simple general law.57 His particular discovery was thus facilely accorded the high status of a general doctrine of nature and the principal law used for transformation. The Origin's reference to the superiority of the Creator's work confronts us with the issue mentioned earlier, that Darwin's concern with nature's perfection was actually based on an implicit comparison of divine and human creation. Despite his criticism of the creationist idea of God's fashioning organisms as "pre- sumptuous" - indeed, even as part of that criticism - Darwin himself had a presumption of sorts about the way God might create in relation to the way of man. We may turn to examine the important role of such theistic analogy in Darwin's thinking about nature, and especially his analogy of the art of selective breeding with his Malthusian principle, described consequently as "natural selection." Textual evidence suggests that this, Darwin's most famous analogy, was founded on a prior general comparison of God's legislating and man's own creative power. Darwin's analogi- cal connection of the Malthusian law to a human technique like breeding thus confirmed the status of Malthusianism, in his view, as the higher creative law for producing viable forms in nature. We have already seen that, at E 57, Darwin states the principle of population pressure as a creative law making variations per- fectly adapted. At E 63 he makes the analogy between the human breeder and nature for the first time to describe this law. Since the Malthusian process is the supposed lawful means of a Creator, its power to surpass what man does analogously in picking individuals to breed, is a foregone conclusion: "Nature" is naturally better at breeding. 55. Ibid., p. 188. 56. Ibid., p. 189. 57.

(E 63) A few pages later the analogy is bolder, and the "perfection" of the superior power is more clear. It is a beautiful part of my theory, that domesticated races of organics are made by precisely same means as species - but latter far more perfectly &amp; infinitely slower. - No domesticated animal is perfectly adapted to external conditions. - (hence great variation in each birth) from man arbitrarily destroying certain forms &amp; not others. (E 7 1) Human breeders are thus cast in the role of followers of Nature's way of making species, only Nature's way is "infinitely slower" and "more perfect." At first one might think that all Darwin supposed here when speaking of the superiority of Nature-as-Breeder was her greater time to make species, which endowment he certainly mentions. But this is putting the cart before the horse. The assimilation of the Malthusian principle to a theistic system had already occurred; here the difference in time allotted to the breeder and to Nature is considered only with reference to the deeper assumption that a divine system of creation exists and that human art images it, if only poorly. That the premise of a sublime God underlies Darwin's confidence here in the power of time may further be surmised from the fact that elsewhere in his notes he regards time simply as part of God's plan for creation (e.g., B 49). One might also think, from the next pages (E 71-75), that the idea of "perfectly adapted" natural species derives from a strictly empirical com- parison of them with man's fancy and sometimes fragile breeds (such as the Italian greyhound).58 But Darwin's foundation is ultimately theological (or metaphysical) here, too, for he is com- paring, not just living beings in the wild and under domestication, but (as always) two basic kinds of creation, human and divine. Later, at E 118, where he is rehearsing his new argument, he focuses on those domestic varieties (the racehorse and the pouter pigeon) that owe much to purity of breeding, and asks: "Has nature any process analogous - if so she can produce great ends." 58. Cf. ibid., p. 123.</page><page sequence="22">402 JOHN F. CORNELL Again we see the same metaphysical pattern: he attributes to "Nature" not only automatic superiority in this artistic endeavor, but also some overall purposes presumably fulfilled by a lawful process.59 Darwin's estimation of the importance of his discovery was clearly subject to theological inflation. Other signs point to the fact that Darwin's theistic presumption supported his analogical exaltation of his mechanism. Remember, Darwin implicitly accepted the likeness of a Creative Being's intelligence to man's; even in his Autobiography he still ponders it.60 His theological complaints were aimed at those who lowered their theoretical standard and made divine creation a piecemeal business rather than a result of rule (see M 154). Remember, too, as we saw in Notebook M, that Darwin accepted the common belief that the laws of nature represent a superior will, and from this belief he reasoned to the lawful character of human volition - a purely abstract, theistic analogy (M 69-70). Now consider this note penned by Darwin about the same time he invented the breeder analogy, where he finds another use for the analogy between man's mind and God's laws: The analogy between the worker of art [or intellect] such as hinge &amp; hinge of shell, work of laws of organization is remark- able - what is intellect, but organization. ... I look at every adaptation, as the surviving one of ten thousand trials. - each step being perfect (or nearly so . ..) to the then existing conditions. - An adaptation made by intellect this process is shortened, but yet analogous, no savage ever made a perfect hinge. - reason, &amp; not death rejects the imperfect attempts.(Mc 11) Darwin describes man's art, imaging the Malthusian process he envisions for nature's history, as a rational rejection of one's "imperfect" efforts. This comparison presupposes the relation of Darwin's discovery to cosmic creation, and then connects it, by his macrocosm-microcosm analogy, to human art in general. The savage appears here as a primitive artist, indicating a further connection of Darwin's new idea of art to the Comtean view of the lawful progress of man's powers as well as to the gradual per- fection of all creation. Can anything show more clearly the metaphysical side of Darwin's science, his layering of ideas in a purely speculative way, his use of analogy between man and 59.

Darwin, Autobiography, pp. 92-93.</page><page sequence="23">Theistic Metaphysics and Darwin's Natural Selection 403 the Whole to produce great cosmological generalizations? Un- doubtedly, Darwin's analogy between the breeder and Nature was, at bottom, a similar, a priori elevation of his Malthusian discovery upon the essentially theistic foundation he accepted from the start.6' Yet we have still another indication that Darwin's theistic metaphysics appropriated his discovery and engendered the breeding analogy. In his 1844 "Essay" Darwin describes a Breeder- God watching and working over nature. While he does not mean this image in the most literal sense, he is not unfriendly to the divine design it implies, so long as it is restricted to the design of laws. For before proceeding to describe the lawful process that he believes does create adapted beings, he reminds his reader of the "plan by which this universe seems governed by the Creator."62 In sum, Darwin's analogy between breeder and Nature reveals nicely how metaphysics helped his new mechanism achieve con- siderable, nay, consummate importance. Granted, one could certainly argue that the Malthusian pressure of population has effects analogous to that of the breeder on numbers of individual organisms. But only the supposed connection between human and divine creation of some sort would encourage one to go further, as Darwin did, and argue that this breederlike force ought to be the principal power that made natural forms.63 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROBLEM OF VARIETY AND VARIATION Living nature offers two spheres for investigating and inter- preting the causes of things: either outside or within the organism. Clearly Darwin's assignment of the supreme position in his system to the Malthusian population pressure meant a decisive emphasis on the external forces in nature and their mechanical results, over internal organic powers - specifically, over variation and the 61. Interestingly, Darwin took the analogy from the breeder's artifice to nature as invalid before the Malthusian insight provided him with an alleged divine law to which to link breeding; see my "Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature," J. Hist. Biol., 17 (1984), 313-322. 62. Darwin, "Essay of 1844," p. 1 16. 63. It should also be noted that Darwin's Newtonian deduction of organic phenomena from his principles, following the "vera causa" ideal of scientific explanation, relied implicitly on his theistic system. Staking out the whole of natural history as an object of deductive science presumes that creation is a law-abiding, rational order. Non-Christian natural philosophers such as Aristotle, Lucretius, and even Buffon did not presume a total deductive system for nature as a whole.</page><page sequence="24">404 JOHN F. CORNELL production of diversity. But this emphasis would have stemmed, along with his theory, from his original metaphysical disposition. We may indeed sketch several stages in which Darwin's meta- physics subordinated the question of variation. First, there are the premises with which Darwin began his inquiry. Beside the possible bias of Lyellian geology toward making physical laws the ultimate determinants of organic life (B 3, C 148e, D 36), the idea of a hierarchy of laws inherently opposes diversity of form as a fundamental natural phenomenon - it presumes abstract levels of unity, not the multiplicity of actual beings, to be real. Diversity is thus bound to be subordinated to some "higher" principle. Darwin probably did not even consider diversity, in the theistic terms of the day, as one of the ends of the Creator's laws, or as one of the "givens" of nature. He supposed species and genera to be a means to the general end of increasing the quantity of life on earth (C 147), as we have seen, an incidental result of adaptation to diverse places; physiologically, he regarded variation as the result of a distinct system of internal laws of correlation to be worked out in the future (E 48). Later, under the influence of Henri Milne-Edwards, who did take organic diversity as one of the "givens" of zoology, Darwin would take up the question of "divergence" explicitly and try to reduce it to a simple consequence of natural selection.64 Two crucial phases of Darwin's theorizing relied specifically on the supposition of simple laws, with the effect of depreciating the phenomenon of diversity. When Darwin discovered the Malthusian principle, which focused on the competitive forces outside organ- isms, he saw it as the solution to the general problem of how a system of laws produces adaptation. The power of this external force in creating adapted species was further exalted, as we saw, on the ground that creation and extinction thus fell under a single principle. Then, most importantly, with the conception of the theistic analogy of selective beeding, the breeder's artistic perspec- tive came to represent the supposed dominance in nature of a single, external principle over the internal powers of variation. Remember, from the breeder's manipulative point of view, varia- tion is interesting not as a significant natural process but as something to be directed from outside, toward his own artificial ends. Variability is chaotic and directionless, as far as the breeder is concerned, until he may usefully intervene. Toward the end of 64.

Over against the idea of an external control, variation thus comes to appear as formless "material" waiting to be shaped - and Darwin even refers to it thus in the Origin.65 This signals the ultimate subordination of the internal processes of variation to one comprehensive idea in the scientist's mind. The single princi- ple of selection took up the active, creative role in Darwin's system of nature;66 he had begun his inquiry, after all, by assuming that the world was created by some simple laws. If Darwin put his emphasis on selection because it thus fit his metaphysical conception of creation, it becomes somewhat more comprehensible that many of his contemporaries did not find all his claims for selection compelling. The problem of whether selection or another natural process might be emphasized in an account of evolution was raised even by critics who were not altogether unfriendly to his efforts. While the literature on Darwin's controversies often mentions contemporary appeals to the "prob- lem of variation," it has rarely grasped Darwin's metaphysical bias or, consequently, the reasonableness of his contemporaries' criticism of his system. One of the more distinguished Victorian natural theologians, perhaps one of the few Darwin worried about, was the duke of Argyll. The duke was no enemy of evolution. He appreciated that Darwin intended his theories to be compatible with theism;67 and in his 1864 Address to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he commended natural selection as an "established scientific truth."'68 But as an amateur naturalist, the duke was enraptured with the very diversity of form in nature. From his theological perspective, variation was itself an important "law" established for the beauty of creation. His Edinburgh lecture dwelt, for example, on the variety of aesthetic ornament in hummingbirds.69 Darwin, to repeat, had tended to see variability only as a lesser means in the Creator's scheme; when he thought of variation as law he rather thought of a complex system of rules, the parts of which he 65.

CORNELL gathered as a number of disjointed and poorly understood "laws" (plural).70 In the Descent of Man, where Darwin discussed the possible effects of sexual selection on elaborate forms, he also denied Argyll's claim that the Creator had an aesthetic plan using variation on the theological ground that such a view was "wanting in due reverence."'71 The duke, responding in the Contemporary Review, professed that he saw nothing irreverent in his own teaching, and judged Darwin's problem to be the flat denial of anthropomorphic reasoning in theology.72 Again the duke had read Darwin's theism more or less correctly: although we have seen that there was indeed a subtle anthropomorphism in Darwin's metaphysics of hierarchical and designful laws, Darwin did reject the idea of aesthetic tastes and purposes expressed in God's system. Darwin even wrote in the margin of his copy of the duke's essay: "It is incredible to me that the Creator of the Universe should take pleasure in diversifying the plumage of Birds +c" (emphasis added).7 Darwin also appreciated the support of A. R. Wallace, who had already published his own criticism of the duke's the- ology, maintaining that the Darwinians had a more reasonable view of the deity.74 Now our point is not who had the better theology, but that this theological challenge was taken seriously and met on its own terms. Darwin accepted indirectly that the difference between him and the duke came down to a difference in theology. This should apprise us of a genuine transscientific or interpretive disagreement, beneath this perhaps crude theological exterior. How does one orient one's thinking about nature as a whole? Should multiplicity be considered a principle with its own integrity, or is justice done to nature when all beings are reduced to some unitary formula?

In particular, critics wondered how to weigh the poorly understood phenomena of variation against the principle of selection. Joseph Hooker, botanist-director of Kew Gardens and possibly Darwin's closest confidant, was certainly sympathetic with the case Darwin had tried to make for selection. Still, he judged variation to be of the deepest interest, arguing reasonably from the unknown future of scientific research: You certainly make a hobby of Natural Selection, and probably ride it too hard; that is a necessity of your case. If the improve- ment of the creation-by-variation doctrine is conceivable, it will be by unburthening your theory of Natural Selection, which at first sight seems overstrained - i.e., to account for too much. I think, too, that some of your difficulties which you override by Natural Selection may give way before other explanations. But, oh Lord! how little we do know and have known to be so advanced in knowledge by one theory. If we thought ourselves knowing dogs before you revealed Natural Selection, what d-d ignorant ones we must surely be now we do know that law.75 With a botanist's feeling for form in nature - form not neces- sarily tied to functional success - Hooker tried to clarify the meaning of "pure" morphology for Darwin, as well as the signifi- cance of the fact that nonutilitarian characters were so important in classification.76 He thought of variation as important in its own right, with its true origin in the "direct action of the conditions of life," and he estimated natural selection as a necessarily secondary principle.77 Hence, even when he was supporting Darwin, Hooker himself leaned in a different direction. For example, he offered to Darwin the idea of extrapolating over the course of descent any retention of useless characters: Just one last thought anent genetic characters of no value to the plant: is not the fact, that characters of primary value in system are so often of no use, an argument in favour of your conclu- sion, that such characters as are of no use, if not in any way 75.

CORNELL detrimental, are not necessarily eliminated but may be retained ad infinitum? 78 For Darwin's part, however, it seems that such extrapolation of a natural process through time was arbitrarily reserved for the powers of environmental selection. Useless variation he regarded as of only temporary or small importance until "fixed" by long- term adaptive advantage.79 Thus while Darwin accepted Hooker's (and Lyell's) jibe that he had made Natural Selection too much of a god, he nonetheless defended his position by falling back on the assumptions originally ordered by his metaphysical system. The breeders, he complained to Hooker, are not criticized for emphasizing selection even though they do not produce the variations they use. Further, his long-standing difficulty of ex- plaining adaptation made it right to insist as he did on natural selection."' Other generally favorable critics of Darwin may not have been as competent naturalists as Hooker. Still, what eminent writers like George Henry Lewes and Samuel Butler lacked in technical expertise may have been made up by their philosophical aware- ness of the interpretive dimension to all knowledge. Interestingly, what these two each proposed resembled Hooker's shift of emphasis among Darwin's principles by a simple but plausible feat of extrapolation. Lewes wished to make more of "laws of organic growth" common tendencies of development, like the production of luminous organs in mollusks, worms, or fireflies - at the expense of an easy application of the principle of descent. He saw in Darwin, not an oversight of such organic laws, but an under- estimation of their possible importance. In an 1868 essay Lewes observed that if one extrapolated from any contemporary play of these forces, one might assign them a greater role in fashioning living things. If we admit that differentiations so marked, and organs so important, can have arisen from organic conditions which spontaneously presented themselves in very different animals, and therefore that these organs, although closely resembling each other, are not due to ancestral influence, we can hardly 78.

Darwin reiterated to Lewes the importance of adaptation, and from the decisive role of selection in breeding, he argued again the supreme role of external selection in producing adapted forms. Perhaps his conclusion, while dismissing Lewes, contained a kernel of the truth, that oness views really depended on the history of one's own thought: "I do not suppose that anything which I have written, even supposing it mainly true, will have much influence; for I know by my own experience that a conclusion strongly arrived at cannot be quickly changed." 82 (emphasis added) The author Samuel Butler, another early convert to evolution, came to prefer Lamarck's and others' theories to Darwin's. He elaborated the idea of acquired habit as a complete organismic philosophy, and thoroughly criticized Darwin for what he saw as studied neglect of his evolutionist predecessors. Although appar- ently Darwin never engaged Butler on scientific subjects - and instead found himself attacked for allegedly subverting Butler's revival of Erasmus Darwin's teachings - still Butler's doctrine did open the same quandary about the wide tolerance necessary in interpreting nature through historical hypothesis and the equal legitimacy of other views. How, Butler asked, if Darwin admitted (as he did) some role for Lamarckian habit, could he know how to restrict that cause and assert the limitless power of selection? If habit could produce a perfect prehensile tail, a sort of "fifth hand," in a South American monkey, he said in Life and Habit, how much more may not habit do, even though unaided, as Mr. Darwin supposes to have been the case in this instance, by 81.

CORNELL "natural selection"? After attributing many of the structural and instinctive differences of plants and animals to the effects of use - as we may plainly do with Mr. Darwin's own consent - after attributing a good deal more to unknown causes, and a good deal to changed conditions ... how much of the work of originating species is left for natural selection? - which, as Mr. Darwin admits ... does not induce variability, but "implies only the preservation of such variations as arise, and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life"? 83 Again the possibility the critic seized upon was extrapolation applied elsewhere than the external pressure of population, with a consequent refocusing of theoretical attention. Butler maintained the true cause of change to be, not in the final success or failure represented by selection, but 'in the cause which determines the creature, consciously or unconsciously, to try this or that way."84 In brief, there seems to be something "metaphysical" in these Darwinian controversies about variation, even where no theology was touched on. For the problem of deciding true priorities among the several possible principles of transformation remained - so long as there were several principles to judge. How one might arrange them depended inevitably on interest and interpretation as well as on one's sheer insight into the cosmos. Any overall view of evolution left one weighing imponderable unknown factors, com- paring and calculating immeasurable accumulations in time. As Darwin himself said to Hooker concerning the difficulty of reckoning on his own Malthusian principle, "it is grappling with eternity."85 The fact is that Darwin's system, though undeniably original, did order his own priorities - the general problem of adaptation and the perfect solution of selection - and that order descended from his original metaphysics of simple, hierarchically ordered laws. True, the God of that abstract belief may have been fading soon after Darwin wrote the Origin. But, it seems, having had no definite crisis about metaphysical assumptions in general, Darwin entertained no definite criticism about how deeply they had structured his thought. He continued to give the main part in nature's entire scheme to the necessary law he had discovered.

CONCLUSION It is natural for us - living after the Darwinian Revolution and the neo-Darwinian synthesis - to consider the adoption of evolution by natural selection as unconditionally rational, because it now seems the best theory or explanation of many phenomena. Nonetheless, if we take historical inquiry seriously, as allowing us to probe into the ground of our knowledge, the roots of even this "rational" Darwinism might be unearthed. Darwinian doctrine betrays a deceptive desire for unity and simplicity of principle, and belief that the mechanistic aspect of nature is of the highest significance. Such crucial but questionable presuppositions are more easily discerned historically, insofar as they chronologically preceded Darwin's particular theoretical conviction and were even set off as a metaphysics of divine law. We have seen how Darwin's teaching about nature emerged within that theistic metaphysics. It emerged in a prior metaphysical debate in his mind between the contemporary belief in special creations and the belief in a designed hierarchy of physical laws. One can hardly deny that Darwin favored the superior side in this contest; but the contest was a narrow one whose basic premises he never clearly criticized. On the one hand, of course, his conviction about a lawful genesis inspired him to take a broad view of things and to seek out important general phenomena. But, on the other hand, it ensured that his new empirical notions would be easily drawn into the preferred cosmology. Historically, this seems to have occurred in Darwin's adoption of Malthus' principle of population and his extension of it to the whole account of descent: Malthusianism was readily attached to an ultimate scheme of things. Consequently, the key concepts that Darwin developed out of his Malthusian views - "perfect adaptation" and "selection" - reflect his cosmological prepossession, his desire to express a total and teleological process of creation. Perhaps our most valuable, and most undervalued, token of Darwin's metaphysical orientation is his reliance on a human technique (selective breed- ing) to explain "Nature's" way. In sum, to understand Darwin's faith in his "grand view of life," we should not ignore the metaphysics that preceded and structured it, the metaphysics that linked the principles of contemporary science to primordial creation. Nor should we fail to see that such a metaphysics leads natural philosophy into a shadowy realm, where system can come to look like science, and one insight like an absolute.</page><page sequence="32">412 JOHN F.
