<plain_text><page sequence="1">Management in Perspective Creative Leadership: Human vs. Metal Brains STANLEY STARK Michigan State University Even if Armaggedon never comes, we may still never learn whether metal brains can do everything human brains can do-the reason being that scientists may never agree on what human brains can do. Unless we agree about humans, of course, we cannot agree on their being simulated-which makes you think that disagreements about humans would attract a good deal of attention. To my knowledge, (1) there is abundant evidence of disagreement about humans, (2) this disagreement extends into the areas of decision and organization theory- especially where creativity and leadership are concerned, and (3) the disagree- ment-at least in the management and organization literature-has been neither well-publicized nor well-explored. Hence, I intend in this paper to discuss (1) a few selected materials from the psychological and sociological literature which illustrate what I regard as a fundamental cleavage, and (2) certain other materials which indicate presence of the same cleavage in the management and organization literature. Unless materials like these are taken into account, I believe it impossible to effectively discuss the role of human vs. metal brains in creative leadership-for they suggest that any debate over human vs. metal brains derives from a prior debate over human vs. human brains. In this presentation I shall refer mainly to publications by the following: E. G. Boring, R. H. Waters, G. A. Lundberg, T. R. Sarbin, P. E. Meehl, P. Selznick, and H. A. Simon. E. G. Boring and R. H. Waters Let us begin with a day almost 20 years ago when Norbert Wiener "defied" the famous historian and now elder statesman of psychology, E. G. Boring, "to describe a capacity of the human brain which he could not duplicate with electronic devices" (Boring, 1946, p. 178). Professor Boring reports that "I could not at once name him any"; but his inability was not merely a matter 160</page><page sequence="2">Creative Leadership of being caught unprepared, for by the time he wrote up this conversation for his colleagues, 18 months had elapsed, and still he could not name him any. Some might think Professor Boring was suffering some embarrassment over his failure and that he was reporting the conversation to his colleagues by way of seeking their help. A reading of the article does support the notion he was seeking help but not the sort of help you might have guessed; nor does it support at all the notion that he was embarrassed. Actually, a reading teaches us that Professor Wiener's question had been put to someone completely sympathetic to its viewpoint-"I confess I myself thought it would be salutary to show that all human mental functions have their electronic analogues" (p. 178)-but who lacked a standard inventory of psycho- logical functions with which he might put his sympathy to professional work. In this sense, Professor Boring was unprepared: he wanted to be able to agree with Professor Wiener not merely as a layman but as a psychologist whose knowledge of psychological functions was as systematic and exhaustive as the bodily knowledge of a physiologist. And so Professor Boring was calling upon his colleagues for help in inventorying the psychological functions-and to get them started, he submitted a thoughtfully-constructed first approximation of his own. But a reading teaches us something else, something more central to our interest. Professor Boring saw great value in what he called playing the game of hypothetical robot-not, as some of you might think, because it helps us to discern what in man's mind is essentially mechanical and what is not, but rather, because "if you talk about machines, you are more certain to leave out the subjective, anthropomorphic hocus pocus of mentalism" (p. 191). The robot, he says, is "an argument against mentalism, and against vague terms which pass current in psychologists' language while remaining incapable of rigorous definition" (p. 192). In other words, to engage in what he calls "robotic thinking" is to engage in thought completely free of the metaphysical, teleological and related strains that a Bertrand Russell sees marring western thought for too long after Leucippus and Democritus were over-shadowed by Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle (1960, pp. 72-73); or, in Professor Boring's framework, to engage in "robotic thinking" is to immunize oneself against the plague afflicting "the phenomenologists, the antipositivists, the mystics" and thereby, to help further the "demonstration of the mechanical nature of man and of the unity of the sciences" (1946, p. 191). Some might guess, this time correctly, that Professor Boring's call drew more than what he meant by "robotic thinking." Rolland H. Waters-a psychologist who has researched rate maze-learning, analyzed learning theory, co-edited an animal psychology text, and who therefore, is not too easily re- garded a phenomenologist or mystic-coined a new and pejorative term to describe the "hypothetical robot" game that Professor Boring had graciously invited everyone to play. Professor Waters called it mechanomorphism, by which he meant "the ascription of mechanical characteristics to the human 1963 161</page><page sequence="3">Academy of Management individual, and the interpretation of human behavior in terms of concepts and processes characteristic of machines" (1948, p. 139). In coining this term, he was, in effect, arming Professor Boring's opposition with the same kind of weapon Professor Boring used against them (i.e., anthropomorphism). In doing this, Professor Waters was not arguing the righteousness of ascribing humanity to infrahumanity but rather, the sinfulness of ascribing nothing but infra- humanity to humanity. He said that "if one starts with a machine, one ends with a machine" (p. 141). Precisely, Professor Boring might reply-since we are mechanical in our nature, let us from the outset conceptualize mechanistically. But-Pro- fessor Waters might counter-this method cannot possibly answer Norbert Wiener's question; if all contributions to the inventory of mental functions must pass a mechanism test, how are we to learn from such an inventory if any human mental functions are not mechanical? The answer here for our purpose is that neither Professor Boring nor Professor Waters has any serious doubt. Professor Boring believes firmly that man is nothing but machine, Professor Waters believes firmly that he is some- thing more. Professor Boring wants an inventory not that will help him to discover truth-he already knows that-but rather that will help him demon- strate it to those who do not. When, on the other hand, Professor Waters insists a priori that any inventory confined to mechanistic functions is incom- plete-an insistence equal to insisting that man is more than a machine-we know that for him also, the inventory is a demonstration and not an experiment. But what would Professor Waters add if the inventory's metal bars came down ? He does suggest a number of functions, some of which, he notes, "involve the concept of creative activity"; then he asks rhetorically, "Has this [i.e., creative activity] not been omitted from Boring's inventory" (p. 141) ? Cer- tainly, Professor Boring might reply-so has everything else "incapable of rigorous definition." Could it be, I now rhetorically ask, that what we see here is prototypical of the debate regarding the role of human and metal brains in creative leadership? Could it be, that is, that the kind of creativity that some people attribute to certain leaders is the kind that an E. G. Boring considers "the subjective, anthropomorphic hocus pocus of mentalism"? Our answer should be clear by the time we have finished. G. A. Lundberg, T. R. Sarbin, and P. E. Meehl Let us turn now to the subjects of Verstehen and clinical intuition, over which there is long-standing dispute in sociology and psychology. The rele- vance here for us is that at least since Plato, we have been told that there is a reality higher than the physicochemical, and that only a non-sensory visual capacity can perceive it. In its aristocratic or divine-gift version, it takes the form of Carlyle's seeing eye ("the eye that flashes direct into the heart of things, and sees the truth of them" [1901, p. 71]) or (less obviously and less 162 June</page><page sequence="4">Creative Leadership specifically) of Max Weber's charisma; 1 and in its democratic or idle-gift version, it takes the form of Bergson's intuition (1944). As scientists, sociolo- gists and psychologists have focused not on the question of higher reality but on the question of means of knowing it. Is there or is there not a way of knowing which depends primarily upon neither the senses nor the rational- calculative apparatus? (To ask this question is to ask whether there is a way of knowing that has been left out of a real time man/machine system such as SAGE.) For example, in 1936, George A. Lundberg wrote a critique of what he called "the current attempt to contrast statistical, quantitative, and mathematical meth- ods on the one hand and a method called the method of insight on the other," adding that "sometimes such terms as understanding or intuition are substi- tuted for insight" (p. 40). He argued that insight and understanding are not scientific methods themselves but are the aims or ends of scientific methods. If, in fact, insight and understanding are methods, how are they to be objec- tively described? "The answer to this demand in some quarters," he scoffs, "is to wear one's collar backwards, to gaze into crystals or tea cups, or to go into a trance" (p. 41). He notes in the same mocking vein that "some of the abler magicians, such as Houdini, have acceded to this demand by describing their techniques in verifiable terms"-why not, then, the sociologist-practi- tioners of Verstehen? Indeed, the latter are more obligated than a Houdini, for "verification by other qualified minds is the essence of scientific knowledge"- hence "the progress of science" means "increasingly searching demands that the author of a generalization specify the steps by which he reached it." So, it is not that Professor Lundberg opposes the method of Verstehen: how can he if nobody objectively describes it? "Let us by all means have bigger and better understanding, intuition, and insight," he gibes to the end, but first let its practitioners "let the rest of us in on the technique" (p. 53). Actually, he believes the technique a myth-a "confusion of language." His introduction makes clear that for him the distinction between Verstehen and quantitative methodology is as futile, muddling, and untrue to reality as "other famous specimens of scholastic argument." There is no true dichotomy or even continuum: scientific knowledge is quantitative or it is not scientific knowledge. What, then, is the source of the misconception? The source is the failure to see that quantitative methodology ranges in formality from the extremely raw-in which state not even numbers may be used, no less alge- braic symbols-to the extremely refined. Failing to perceive this formality continuum within quantitative methodology, some people believe they see 1Charisma can take the leadership forms either of personal heroism (through the sword) or of personal revelation (through the word): creative social change is typically associated with either as opposed to patriarchal and bureaucratic leadership. For a hint that Weber's concept of personal revelation was not based entirely on his study of history and current affairs, but that in addition it was something in which he personally be- lieved, see his distinction between education "to awaken charisma" and education "to impart specialized expert training" (Gerth and Mills, 1958, p. 426). 1963 163</page><page sequence="5">Academy of Management something essentially different-specifically, Verstehen-when in fact they are looking at the informal end of the continuum. The truth is, says Professor Lundberg, that "what the critics of the better quantitative methods [i.e., the pro-Verstehen wing] seem to prefer is informal, impressionistic, and imaginary statistics supporting their prejudices" (p. 43). In short, there is only one scientific way to the truth, and it is open equally to all: the aristocrats of Verstehen are deluded or confused.2 In 1941, psychologist Theodore R. Sarbin took up the Lundberg fight in the clinical field. Just as the latter wanted sociology purged of all but its natural science elements, so Professor Sarbin wanted erasure of the artistic image of clinical psychology. An enterprise in which prediction depends en- tirely on empirical observation and logical inference, and not at all upon artistic, intuitive, magical, or related gift, is a scientific enterprise-and this he argued is the character of the prediction implicit in diagnosis and a choice of therapy. He agreed with Professor Lundberg that "useful diagnoses always proceed from generalizations, whether based on a rigorous statistical method or upon a crude empirical method which has been variously named intuition, insight, verstehen, etc." (1941, p. 394). Diagnoses that strike one's colleagues or oneself as artistic or intuitive can usually be revealed, he claimed, to be inferences from previous experience: "that these inferences are informal and not made with the benefit of Hollerith cards and Monroe calculators is beside the point" (p. 395). In the clinic, as Professor Lundberg would say for sociology, there is no psychology-Windelband notwithstanding-" 'that can- not be taught and learned, but is the gift of intuitive intelligence' " (p. 397): there is only experience, quantification, and inference. Anything more is "super-empirical," which is to say, non-science. Thus Professor Sarbin read intuition out of clinical psychology. I am unaware of any response, but when he did it again on an even larger scale in 1944,3 the following promptly appeared: "... while it is correct to attack any attempt to separate psychology from natural science or any attempt to place intuition and 'understanding' above verification, this attack should not be perverted into an attack on intuition itself. Intuition above verification leads to intellectual anarchy. At the same time, those of us who are less intuitively gifted may well afford to adopt some humility in the presence of those who have proven to be more gifted" (Chein, 1945, p. 179). The possible implication is that Professor Sarbin is not very strong in the artistic or intui- tive method, and perhaps his perceived lack of strength supplies a motive for 2 See his 1941 paper for a more concise statement of the unitary character of all prediction. ' And probably more provocatively as well. For example, proponents and/or practioners of the intuitionist method either "fail to recognize the frame of reference into which they have fitted their generalizations or else they engage in non-scientific guesswork . . . they are making statistical predictions in an informal, subjective, and uncontrolled way, or else they are performing purely verbal manipulations which are unverifiable and akin to magic" (1944, p. 214); also "talking about such super-empirical vagaries as the 'gift of intuitive intelli- gence' is little short of autistie conduct" (p. 219). 164 June</page><page sequence="6">Creative Leadership his rejecting the method. Whether intended or not, Professor Sarbin's 1944 article alone (see footnote 3) makes it obvious psychologists can generate heat when disagreeing about what human brains can do. A few years later there appeared in a sociology journal the kind of Ver- stehen description Professor Lundberg had demanded (Abel, 1948). Its author concluded it could not be considered a scientific method (since by itself it neither adds to our knowledge nor serves as a means of verification), and thus seemed to be following the Lundberg-Sarbin line; but he emphasized some- thing else which neither of them had even mentioned-the creative role of Verstehen. He said that when we think about human behavior-specifically, when we think about possible antecedents of a given response or possible re- sponses to a given stimulus-we create hypotheses. These hypotheses arise out of "hunches" or "intuitions"-which, he suggested, "originate from the application of the operation of Verstehen" (p. 217). In emphasizing the cre- ative role of Verstehen, this author in effect aligned himself with the critic who accused Professor Sarbin of perverting an attack on the attempt to place "intuition and 'understanding' above verification . . . into an attack on intui- tion itself" (Chein: see above). For both, the operation called Verstehen is involved in creative thought, and as long as its limitations are understood,4 it is a legitimate part of the scientific enterprise, whether in the laboratory, field, or clinic. For Professors Lundberg and Sarbin, on the other hand, Verstehen is either disguised, unrecognized empirical method or it is nothing that belongs in science. In 1954, as part of a review monograph on the clinical vs. statistical prediction controversy, the psychologist Paul E. Meehl undertook to defend those clinicians who, like one of his colleagues,5 resented "that certain statis- ticians apparently wanted him to substitute a Hollerith machine for his eyes and his brain" (Meehl, 1954, p. 6). He argued along the dualistic Verstehen line that we have already seen, namely, that the experience-quantification-infer- ence pattern considered by the Lundberg-Sarbin line to be the scientific pattern is, in fact, only one of two-that there is, in addition, an intuitive pattern of which a Hollerith machine is incapable-a pattern that terminates in creative hypotheses and moreover, which is essentially similar to the mental process involved in the creation of scientific theory. The fact that we cannot specify the logic of this creative pattern (and may never be able to be) is grounds for calling it "intuitive" but noit for concluding that its results cannot be tested or validated: to so conclude is to equate "nondeductive" or "nonformal" with "irrational," an equation Professor Meehl cannot accept. Time limitation prevents me from bringing this controversy up to date. Suffice it to say that as of August 1962, Professor Sarbin and two associates were protesting that Professor Meehl's review of their new book "has gone ' For example: " From the point of view of Verstehen alone, any connection that is possible is equally certain" (Abel, 1948, p. 217). 5David Rapaport, at the 1947 meeting of the American Psychological Association. 165 1963</page><page sequence="7">Academy of Management beyond the usually accepted bounds of criticism" and were hoping that the journal editor "will consider possible procedural measures . . . to make less likely the promulgation of the more extreme forms of idiosyncrasy." 6 Formalist vs. Intuitivist Approach The preceding materials suggest the presence in behavioral science litera- ture of two distinguishable approaches to the human mind, one in which there is exclusive emphasis upon its formal and hence mechanically feasible processes, the other in which these processes share emphasis with another type, virtually unknown except for its products which are often claimed to be creative. The formalist approach commonly accompanies loyalty to logical positivism (or logical empiricism) and to the broader movement called scien- tific empiricism or unity of science, as well as adherence to a view of man as nothing but ordinary physicochemical nature, subject in all respects to the laws of its operation. The intuitivist approach commonly accompanies sym- pathy for humanistic, idealistic philosophy, for a view of life and man as continually being created, and for a view of the human mind as a unique agent in that continuing creation. In other words, those who approach the mind as nothing but mechanism tend to approach man, life, and the universe in a similarly "nothing but" fashion; whereas those who approach the mind as something more than mechanism tend also to find something more in these other domains-though their difficulty in demonstrating their "something more" findings is usually at least as great as it has been in demonstrating Verstehen. How would each of these approaches manifest itself when brought to bear on the domain of large-scale social organizations? Alvin W. Gouldner (1959) has (unintendedly) given us an answer in his distinction between rational and natural system models of organization-a distinction that builds on the early pages of Philip Selznick's Leadership in Administration. It is to this distinction and to this essay that we now turn. P. Selznick and H. A. Simon Why did Professor Selznick write this particular essay? And why did he title it Leadership in Administration? Any reply to the first question should include, I believe, a statement to the following effect: he wrote it as an intu- itivist supplement, corrective, or antithesis to the formalist essay that Herbert A. Simon titled Administrative Behavior. And any reply to the second ques- tion should include, I believe, a statement to the following effect: leadership in the old-fashioned sense, which stood so high with the intuitivist likes of Plato, Carlyle, and Weber, stands very low in the world of scientific empiri- cism: in Administrative Behavior (as in the later March and Simon Organiza- 6 Contemporary Psychology, 1962, 7, p. 311. Their book is Clinical Inference and Cogni- tive Theory, which Professor Meehl reviewed in the November 1961 issue. 166 June</page><page sequence="8">Creative Leadership tions), the word leadership itself cannot be found in the heading of a single chapter, chapter section, chapter subsection, or anywhere in the index.7 As for my implication that Professor Selznick's institutional leadership is somewhat synonymous with intuitional leadership, permit me to document it by putting the following brief speech into his mouth; and, in turn, I shall ask you to consider it as best you can from the point of view of Scientific Empiricism, i.e., with the ears of Professors Boring, Lundberg, and Sarbin: Certain organizations as a whole and most organizations in their largest part are determined in their behavior by precedent, by authority, and/or by technical considera- tions. To say this is to say (1) that they possess a completely or mainly formal- mechanical structure or (2) that their operation is completely or mainly automatic and semi-automatic. The appropriate way to learn about such organizations or opera- tions is the way of the enigneer-the student par excellence of determinate entities. Human behavior in these determinate entities will be correspondingly determinate, which means that the relevant mental processes are most appropriately studied by psychologists and sociologists closest in spirit and method to the engineer. Administra- tive Behavior (or Organizations) is an admirable work in this regard. My essay, on the other hand, addresses itself mainly to indeterminacy, self-determina- tion, or freedom. This is the meaning of such of my statements as: "leadership is most needed among those organizations, and in those periods of organizational life, where there is most freedom from the determination of decisions by technical goals and methods'" (pp. 16-17); "Critical experience calls for leadership. Experience is less critical, and leadership is most dispensable when the range of alternatives is limited by rigid technical criteria. The more limited and refined the task, the more readily can technical criteria prevail in decision-making . . . [when the organization] has the leeway to respond in alternative ways, there is room for character-formation, which enters to give structure to precisely this area of freedom " (pp. 40-41); "leadership declines in importance as the formal structure approaches complete determination of behavior. Management engineering is then fully adequate to the task" (p. 92). Since I address myself to indeterminacy, self-determination, or freedom, I emphasize not only leadership in administration, but creativity in leadership (and even intuition). For example: ". . . policy and administration are interdependent in the special sense that certain areas of organizational activity are peculiarly sensitive to policy matters. Because these areas exist, creative men are needed . . . who know how to transform a neutral body of men into a committed polity. These men are called leaders; their profession is politics. . . . The setting of goals is a creative task. . . . The task of leadership is not only to make policy but to build it into the organization's social structure. This, too, is a creative task. . . . The leadership of any polity fails when it concentrates on sheer survival: institutional survival, properly understood, is a matter of maintaining values and distinctive identity. This is at once one of the most impor- tant and least understood functions of leadership. This area (like that of defining institutional mission) is a place where the intuitively knowledgeable leader and the administrative analyst often part company . . . "(pp. 61-63). Now let us consider whether our simulated sociologist has affronted any simulated (or genuine) scientific empiricist sensibilities. Would the empiricist wonder how he would precisely define certain terms and phrases, e.g., "char- 7I refer to the second edition of Administrative Behavior (eighth printing, 1960) and the first edition of Organizations (second printing, 1959). In Administrative Behavior, "En- trepreneurs" is indexed (p. 256) and is cited three times. 1963 167</page><page sequence="9">Academy of Management acter-formation, which enters to give structure to precisely this area of freedom," "maintaining values and distinctive identity," "intuitively knowl- edgeable leader," or in other cases how he would come up with a meaning different from what scientific psychology offers, e.g., "creative men," "setting of goals," "creative task"? My guess is that Professor Simon would wonder much and that Professor Selznick would find it exceedingly difficult to satisfy him. But we must satisfy him if we are ever to convince him that at any given time the computer is not doing all the thinking that middle or upper managers do. For example, when he says that "we will have the technical capability, by 1985, to manage corporations by machine" (1960, p. 52), are we entitled to smugly retort, "Sure, but what about leading, creatively leading-a la Selznick-by machine?" if we cannot reach agreement on what Professor Selznick means? It is one thing to say to Professor Simon-"'You've left creative leadership out of your social psychology and out of your machine"- and another to demonstrate that he has omitted a piece of reality. Just as I believe Professors Boring, Lundberg, and Sarbin would cheerfully agree that they leave Verstehen out of their model of man, so I believe Professor Simon would cheerfully receive the news that he omitted " intuitive knowledgeability "- whether Platonic, Carlylean, Weberian, or Selznickean. Conclusion From Plato's Republic to Selznick's Leadership in Administration, western thinkers have associated an ill-defined creative capacity with leadership. To date, the group we have referred to as intuitivist has been shown nothing to persuade it that the digital computer possesses this capacity, but on the other hand, neither has the group we called formalist been shown anything to persuade it that the capacity exists in man. Until the latter group is persuaded, we cannot conclude that the metal brain possesses less capacity for creative leadership than the human brain-and it is at least conceivable that the latter group may never be persuaded.
