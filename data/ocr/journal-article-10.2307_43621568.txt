<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDS SPOKEN AT DELOS R. o. TUQWELL (u.s.a.): We are gathered tonight in Delos to mark the end of a latter-day Odyssey, not of geographic exploration or conquest, but of one beyond the frontiers of present knowledge and action. If it seems at all strange that this meeting should be in Delos and not in the theatre of an- other nation, let me remind you of a remark made by Thucydides more than two thousand years ago. The Greeks, he said, were born to take no rest themselves and to give none to anyone else. This restless energy has not always been guided by wisdom. Both in democratic times and in dictatorial ones, disastrous decisions have been made. These mistakes seemed, sometimes for centuries, to have been final. Attic civiliza- tion all but disappeared. But among the debris, and in the few survivors the seed of regeneration did not quite die. Defeats, occupations and op- pressions could not kill ideas. More than once new starts were made in peaceful interludes. Another is being made today. It has begun to be spoken of as the Greek renaissance. Perhaps we may say that we fortunate few are being privileged to become part of that re- naissance. We have sailed in company on its wine- dark sea, and in company, considered how men may meet their aspiration for a better way of liv- ing. We have exchanged information and opi- nion and tried to sort out its relevance to our aim. But these were landings for viewing the arti- facts of another renaissance - that of classic times. We have seen in these how men once impressed upon the materials of nature repeated approxi- mations of perfection until the ideal was given elegant and exquisite form. The product of this prodigious effort has however, often been muti- lated, destroyed or carried away. What remains has to be seen among prevailing ruin. Architect- ure and the arts were not, after all, enduring. Even democratic government did not enable them to endure: this government had virtues; but it lacked the necessary one. The treasures were not guarded by a statecraft that was sufficiently comprehensive. They belonged to a few people, not to many; and they were owned by a small and exclusive empire, not to one that stretched to the limits of the contemporary world. So that when communications and weapons improved, when rivalries and commercial conflicts arose, and came, the treasures were at hazard. We see what happened. How clear a lesson! We disperse now as travellers enlightened both by what we have heard and what we have seen. We have learned together, and we carry away the consciousness that our own endeavors need not be lost. We have a place where we are welcome. It is a place for the guardianship of our mo- dern treasures, so that some day they will not join the classic ruins. The designs made here are made for no client; as we have talked no mo- nitor has listened; we have had no faculty to plea- se. There has been no enemy to question our mo- tives. There have indeed been sharp reminders that local and partial views are partial and local. This is the rule of fair exchange. And there is no complaint. I feel that we have here begun to do what a man from Concord in Massachusetts once advised all men to do - to «keep the time of the Universe, not of the cars». Another American, a lady not long gone, insisted that freedom was born in Greece. She was saddened by the need to admit that freedom was lost here too. It was really possessed for no more than a golden interlude. But I venture to suggest that, beginning here in Greece, freedom may again be achieved. It cannot be the simple democracy of face tó face decision-making that Edith Hamil- ton wrote about. It must be found in the ordered complexity that our developing technology has made possible. We begin to believe that the laws of nature not only impose disciplines but contain the pro- mise of a higher freedom that man has ever known - that of abundance, well-being, and creativeness. Those of us who are able to look back over some decades have experienced repeated en- chroachments on our liberties and have come to dread them as much as they must have been drea- ded in classic times. We have been censored and monitored; we have had to work for dubious clients, we have been subjected to unreasonable rule. It has sometimes seemed to us that conformity was more and more to the price of abundance, a very restricted conformity and a very limited abundance. We begin now to see that this is a passing phase, a discipline enforced by the monopolizers of scarce resources. But monopolies are always broken. They are contrary to the laws of advance. 180</page><page sequence="2">They are undermined by change. Their posses- sors are overwhelmed by the riches of nature. They lose their hold or they die; but the gene- rosities of nature multiply. These generosities find embodiment not only in physical things but in the intangibles of mind and spirit. Men lift their heads and put their heads together. They begin to shape their institutions and their environment somewhat as the classic architects shaped the stone of their temples and their statues. The unfolding riches are moulded to our conception of civilization. In the Attic sense men will never again be free. They will live within a technological frame- work; and this, even if it is a public monopoly, and not a private one, will set conditions for be- haviour. But they are easy conditions. Living together they must consider one another. Using nature's forces, they must be guided by her rule. But the old chains will be broken, the old humiliations abolished. This is because there will no longer be scarcity. Men will not be starved if they refuse to work. Not having to labor for a living, they can labor for other reasons, as most men like to do, cultivating talents in their de- gree. These promises are as yet only lights on the horizon; but their glow begins to flush the hills and valleys where toil has gone on so long and been so long unrewarded. This is the land of our settlements. It flows with milk and honey. It is our task to make it ready. Those who are expecting the new day and glimpse its strange and wonderful characters are not yet many. It is fortunate that occasionally they can meet: it is even more fortunate that they can begin to draw closer in their craft. Those who work for the future are - let us face it - a different breed from those who work out of the past. They are as yet a transitional tribe, and they are sometimes lonely. But a few have this time together and will go away lifted and in- spirited. They have spoken together of the new cen- turies and made them more visible. If the Greeks go on taking no rest and giving none to others, those new centuries will be prepared for. The habit men have of going forward with fearful glances behind them will be less prevalent. The showing of attractions to come will help to keep faces forward. Emergence into the promised land of technology may become a march with banners and music rather than a furtive and funereal proceeding. I think they will persist. For Greeks appa- rently exist not only in Greece, but everywhere, needing only to be called together. The hope for mankind in this initiative is that their going forward may be advanced by centuries of time and that they may be spared seas of suffering, that order may be imposed on chaos and that great conceptions may be realized. The statues and temples of the future must not be set on any acropolis to be destroyed by the envious. They must be available to all. And they can be unless the forces of nature are denied and her collaborators frustrated. charlcs ABRAMS (U.S.A.): For me the most im- portant aspect of this meeting is that it has again brought together a variety of minds and interests from different fields and different parts of the world to concentrate their thoughts and concerns on the most important revolution of our time - the shift of people to an urban way of life. They have sensed that our world is a world of contradictions, that even in the most indus- trially advanced nations, housing and commu- nity building lag far behing industrial progress. The technical genius that has broke the secrets of speed, sound, space and light still cannot build a house cheap enough for the world's rank and file or create a community in which a child can be decently reared. One reason is that we are confronting our urbanizing world without the parallel ascent of an urban science equal to the responsibilities. Nor is there a comparative science of urbanization such as there is in jurisprudence or in compa- rative religions. We know little of the nature of the rhythms and the cross-fertilizing influen- ces that affect urban institutions. Irrevocable decisions are being made without weighing the picture in the full panoply of social and economic change. Governmental power has expanded enor- mously in our time, but power is in search of policy, while policy that calls for the philosopher as well as the scientist finds them both on the side-lines. The day when the world must hold and feed 7 billion people is no further away from us than World War I is from today. The urban population of Africa will grow from 58 million to 294 million within little more than a generation; that of Asia from 555 million to 3 and a half billion; that of Latin America from 144 million to 650 million. Yet in these areas the housing situation is worse than it was a decade ago; the problem of the ci- ties where the impact of this population's surge will be felt most is being all but ignored. It is vital therefore that concepts and iner- tias be identified and challenged, that thesis be confronted with anti-thesis and that the vital syntheses be achieved. The need today is not policy to add more pro- grams to those that already exist, but also to make a fresh identification of fundamental hu- man values and yearnings and evolve fresh ap- proaches to satisfy them as best we can. We ought not simply superimpose physical patterns on people, but leave more room for the 181</page><page sequence="3">people to add something of their o'm to their neighborhood life. We might think of ways to give people a better feeling of belonging in their neighborhoods. We might acknowledge that the city is not only a group of houses or tenaments but the center of education and culture and of training for the growingly dynamic industrial life and its needs. We might pay greater respect to the natural features of cities and reclaim those that are being concealed; we might plant more trees and create recreation that is accessible within each neigh- borhood, places where people can convene and rest and where children can play within easy dis- tance of their homes. We might aim to enhance walkability as well as better transport. We might try to enlarge the area of choice for people and afford them more freedom to choose from a variety of homes and neighbor- hoods. We might try to make cities more tolerable for the child. With urbanization and our present technolo- gy we have shattered the tyranny of distance. There is more than enough space in the world for urban man. In the industrialized United States for example, urban land is only 1% of the total land supply. While Europe averages 85 people to every sq. kilometer, Asia averages õnly 60 and the world in general only 21. The real problem is not space shortage for cities but the intense competition for sites within the already fermenting urban areas. If the urban radius within each country can be stretched by proper land policy, by transport, water and drainage, the land for homes and work should be more than ample for the generation to come. There may even be hope that with a rational urbanization and an industrialized world in which MAN recognizes the interdependency of man, that man's drives may be redirected from an extensive emphasis upon the less developed world to a constructively intensive expansion within ļihe borders of each nation, that the lebensraum concept will at last be laid to rest and that this may lead to a better hope for a lasting peace. Housing, planning an&lt;J land development are still frontier challenges and it is incredible that in the space age, man still struggles for space on his own planet; that having perfected the devi- ces for destruction of homes and cities, he has not yet learned how to create them and how to build functioning communities. It is to tasks as large as these that I and per- haps all of us may have really dedicated ourselves by the report of the Second Delos Symposion. A.B.K. BROHi (Pakistan): At the end of the Sym- posion, I would like not so mush to emphasize any special issue that was discussed, as to share with you the mood in which 1 find myself in the ancient theatre of Delos. It is a safe inference to say that those who designed this theatre had no prevision that one day, after the intervention of so many centuries, a group of men would assemple here to continue what after all is the work of the centuries, namely the work of building a better and more civilized world. The archaeologists have dug up the past and presented it back to us. You notice the quietness here: there is no noise. Let us reflect that our world may again be submitted to a similar pro- cess. Archaeologists may again recover it and what will it reflect - the world we built? just as there was no assurance of security then, there is none now. Cities have been the cradles in which civilisations have flourished. The time has now come when cities have to face the challenge of today and they are threatening to bury this civili- sation in the debris of their own ruins. Man in the contemporary world is attempting to confront the challenge by using merely the resources of his mind. He has faith in the omni- potence of his rational powers, and believes that these are quite adequate to suggest to him solutions for the situation in which he finds him- self involved. I believe that this approach is only right within limits. There are other faculties and powers with which man is endowed, and unless he secures the harmonious development of all the powers that he has, he will not be able to cope with the problems with which he is confronted. It is the total development of man - his integration at a higher level - that will bring about a complete transformation of his being. It is the work of such a man that can find the solution to our present problems, as I see it. I would therefore earnestly plead for the recognition of the supremely important aspect of the work undertaken here. Knowledge is all right but it is not enough for us, as Santayana said in one of his great poems: «Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine That lights but one step ahead So it is no wisdom to be only wise» The rational method of tackling human pro- blems should be at the service of the higher man: the man who has evolved new inner resources that equip him to perceive that no amount ol perfection in the methods and techniques of handling environment is likely to reveal. All great creation is born of this perception, ļt is only thereafter that we, in- the light of our feeble powers, give to it a local, habitation and a name. *82</page><page sequence="4">Constituted as man is today, he has to learn the supremely difficult lesson of being humble, and to believe that although he is expected to do his best, he is, continually in the care and pro- tection of that supreme power from whence all grace and governance ultimately flow on to him. A. OLUMIDE CRAIQ (NIGERIA): Not long agO the world was torn to pieces by the ravages of war. Now ten to twenty years later we are all here together forgetting the past, thinking of the present and looking forward to the future. In the present age - a time of new inventions, the sputnik age - man has not yet satisfied his human needs. In the midst of plenty there is still suffering, and poverty reigns in the world around us. But there is a wind of change. This gathering of the Delos Symposion has opened up new horizons, new ways of thinking. This group of people is tied together not by politics but by friendliness, with one common objective: how to better the situation of human settlements. Coming from a young developing nation in Africa the experience has been a wonderful one. The exchange of views with people from other environments and other disciplines has provided and will continue to provide much food for thought: thinking together how to make the world a better place. Outside a bank in Rotterdam, there is a scul- pture of a human being depicting the city without a heart. We are in a growing world with a decay- ing centre: in all countries the centres of commu- nity and of urbanization present problems confront- ing all of us. Through this little endeavour of Delos we may be able to develop or propagate the new philosophy of ekistics. In bringing this philoso- phy to life, I hope the problems of the develop- ing nations will receive priority, particularly as in the world in which we live there are some having it so good while others are having it so bad. For this we need a further study of ekistics within the shortest possible time, since humanity's greatest need is for a better way of living. I hope the torch of Delos will be carried to every corner of the earth, e. a. DOxiADis (Qreece): For two weeks, one in 1963, the other in 1964, people from several nations have met together to discuss the crisis facing us and the necessity for immediate action. We have not managed to satisfy some of our number that the document we have produced is related to the immensity of the crisis. The document is not spectacular. In compari- son with the problem, it may seem weak. Are we on the right track? But, I think we are. I think this may be the place for a story about three village masons who were asked why they were working at their job. The first said: «I am the best mason in the village»; the second «I am simply earning my liv- ing», and the third «I am building a cathedral». Perhaps we are trying to build a cathedral. To do this, you have to dig the foundations deep. We may have to dig for many years. As long as we are digging, no one will see any building above the earth. This may discourage some of us who are builders, but it is the only way we can do it. During the 1960's we can expect to acquire full knowledge of our problems: during the 70's, we can develop the system: in the 80's and 90's, test these out. This may be late for some of us, but Adam Meyerson (son of Martin Meyerson) and Jose-Ramon Lasuen will certainly still be around. Many efforts have failed because time for their solution has been underestimated. The cri- sis we now face started 200 years back, so that if we manage to achieve something in one gene- ration, it will be very important for man. BucKMiNSTER fuller (u.s.a.) : I have heard it said that the record left by the ancient Greeks is that of an order of men so superb as to preclude its counter part in modern Greece or elsewhere on earth. Despite historical deprivations of Greece, our own experience with the Greeks tells me for in- stance that such men as Doxiadis, supported in- timately by his personal family and family of colleagues will lead all mankind to greater heights of achievement of the good life than have ever before been achieved even for a few. Margaret Mead said the other day that God is rarely mentioned at conferences such as ours. This is not so much a phenomenon of conferences as it is a characteristic of our times. Many think of science and the age of industrialization as atheistic. Scientists frequently have been asked by less educated men whether anything they observe through microscopes or telescopes con- firms religious dogma and the scriptures, and if not must they not foresake scripture and reli- gion as having any fundamental significance whatsoever. Surprised by the question and uncon- vinced that they are atheists, the scientific spe- cialists, also avoiding philosophic speculation as treacherous ground for reasoning, have been notably ineffective in refuting their atheistic status. It is a popular conception that the universe must automatically have been begun in chaos, out of which chaos it has happened from time to time that probability , reversing its law of in- crease of the random element, has surprisingly accumulated increasing order. This illogical in- crease of order of the popular science cosmology has also from time to time been aided by scien- tists who «wrest order out of chaos» until proba- bility and science together have now provided us with an extra-ordinary well organized chemi- cal, physical and biological local world within a universe of gratifying regularities. The scientific record refutes this a priori 183</page><page sequence="5">chaos scheme. Every great scientist who has documented the events surrounding his major discovery has documented the fact that in comparison to his crude hypothesizing his dis- covery disclosed a sublime regularity of nature within the domain of his special exploration. Gradually, the micro-macro exploring instru- ments of all sciences have become more power- ful and the scientists have found their origi- nally remote domains everywhere overlapping, thus presently unifying the total of discovered universe. The regularities of this coordinate totality of nature are governed by pure mathematical principles - and principles are inherently weight- less and infinite, that is endless - ergo the universe could never have been chaotic and ergo has no beginning. In 1930 Einstein wrote of the non-anthropomorphic conception of God and of the Cosmic Religious Sense, asserting that the great scientists such as Kepler who had been called heretics were indeed the most profoundly religious men when appraised in a cosmic, non- anthropomorphic sense. Einstein said «what an extraordinary faith in the orderliness of uni- verse must have inspired Kepler, to spend the nights of his entire lifetime alone with the stars». Scientists having developed hyphenated names for their overlapping work - bio-chem- istry, bio-physics, etc. are now finding their total field inter-connected and unitary. They have taken on so many recent hyphens, inter- linking a complex of disciplines, that they are rendered in fact comprehensivists instead of specialists . This is a general trend of science, and so many scientists are now being educated that it may be forecast that within the next half centu- ry not only science but all society in general will have come naturally by its own explorations and experiences to discover the comprehensive, ab- stract, weightless order of universe. Thus, they will develop a regeneratively inspiring faith in the great, and only intellectually comprehensi- ble, order and integrity of the universe. Recognition of an intellect greater than, and anticipatory to our own intellections is inexora- bly emergent. This is the discovery of non- anthropomorphic God at first hand. In this discovery there is inherent a total universe of orderly events and transformation trends, transcendental to the will and alteration of men. In this sense I intuit great synergetic significance to our Delos Symposion wherein an impressive number of world-around men of in- tegrity and competence join earnestly to inquire into the vital needs of their fellowmen and into intelligent ways in which to anticipate those needs. I have faith that the labors of Doxiadis and his Delians will be blessed. This is my Delos Doxology. sir Robert matthew (UK) : Last year was a foun- dation year at Delos. This year we have gone on. We have not been repetitive. We have done two things: we have indicated the general direc- tion of an academic discipline and also put out some urgent calls to the outside for understanding and action. Ekistics will become important in the world long before the academic discipline is far devel- oped. This matter will not be in our hands. Therefore, the time spent in formulating calls to international and national bodies (if I can use this word without shocking our American friends) has not been wasted. I look on these calls as of great importance, and trust they will be heeded. I am well aware that some of the fundamen- tal problems will not be solved by buildings alone, even if built to the highest standards. And I accept the widening horizons, and the implica- tions of this both in practice and in teaching. I welcome association with other disciplines concerned with ekistics. I know that our work will thereby be enriched. As a teacher, I am well awa- re of the responsibility to develop new ways of thinking, less exclusive than before: Many teachers of arhitecture and town-planning think as I do. The world is greatly unsettled as Bucky has so rightly reminded. It is no time for any of us to become fossils. I personally am deeply thankful to have been able to take part in the Second Delos Symposion which I believe has greatly helped us in our task. John w. Riley (u.s.a.): We have come herefrom many lands and disciplines, and to me the most moving aspects of our report is the sense of de- dication which arises from it syllogistically - the kernel of our sense of commitment. The discussions of the week, which have ranged over the problems of the content, the prac- tice and the training for ekistics, have provi- ded a firm foundation for my belief in the fea- sibility of incorporating into this discipline much from the body of behavioral science knowledge. This will not be an easy task, nor is it one which should be approached by any, save the most competent. The history of the behavioral sciences in such fields as medicine, law, educa- tion, religion, and the military establishment, to name but a few, is, in general, one of success; but the failures have been many and the agony great. I would take this occasion, therefore, to ex- press my confidence in the feasibility of an early codification of those aspects of behavioral science knowledge which hold high potentials of relevance for this new and exciting discipline of ekistics - a discipline which promises so much for the future well-being of man on this earth 184</page><page sequence="6">KONSTANTIN IVANOVITCH TRAPEZNIKO V (USSR): We Soviet architects take part in the Delos Symposion for the first time. We are glad this Symposion has been held in Greece - the land of great and ancient culture, architecture and art. We wish to state that the work of this Sym- posion was fruitful and that we had good and friendly contacts with our colleagues here. The soul of the Symposion was Dr. Doxiadis, and his work was appreciated very highly. He has the noble aspiration to make man really the happy master of the cities. But to want something is not enough. We all really want this, but to bring it about we must gain a deep knowledge of the trends of their future development. Without science, this is not possible. Therefore, we deeply appreciate the work of all our colleagues here in the foundation and devel- opment of the science of human settlements. We know that many people and organizations are at work on the problems of city building and planning in all countries. In the Soviet Union, our main work is in the field of city planning and housing. City building and planning in socialist countries has certain social characteristics, laws and tasks. But this must not prevent us from being able to exchange our experiences. We must share our achievements. People of all countries - the people from developed and the developing countries are deep- ly interested in these contacts. In our century of social, technical and scien- tific revolution, the experiences must be syn- thesized and our collective efforts must be taken on a scientific basis. We all need good scientific information. We believe that if we are able to put the building of cities on the level of important state tasks, we can conquer all the difficulties. We want to stress once more that the city planning and building has great meaning for the improvement of the condition of the life of man and we must all work toward this.</page></plain_text>
