<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Individual and Society in Biological and Cultural Anthropology Robert A. Paul Institute of Liberal Arts and Department of Anthropology Emory University My argument in this article may be briefly outlined as follows: I will show that the parallel developments in cultural and biological anthropology emphasiz- ing individuals as strategizing agents offer a favorable climate for an attempt at reconciliation between the two subfields. Then I will lay out, as best I can, the point of view prevalent in current evolutionary biology about how the posited central goal of individual strategizing, namely inclusive reproductive fitness, is to be understood. The reader must understand that in my exposition of this ma- terial I intend neither to espouse nor criticize it, but rather simply to grasp it. Finally, I will present arguments to show why the evolutionary argument, though plausible and valid in part, cannot in principle account exhaustively for social and cultural facts; while at the same time showing that considerations of reproductive strategizing cannot, in principle, be excluded from the understanding of social and cultural facts either. One of the enduring differences of opinion among anthropologists, as among all students of human life, concerns the degree to which society is understood to be an entity in itself, with some power to determine the behavior of its constituent members, as opposed to a position according to which society is nothing other than the product of the summed behavior of a number of individuals. The matter is very concisely stated by Holy and Stuchlik (1983:2) as a fundamental disagree- ment over the "autonomy of agency": If society . . . is an objective reality to whose demands people respond in specific ways, then it is an autonomous agency and individual people are its agents, and the only acceptable explanation is in terms of the functioning of the system. If, on the other hand, society . . . emerges from, and is maintained or changed only by what people do, then individuals are autonomous agents and systems are consequences of their actions and, in the last instance, explicable by them. In her incisive overview of contemporary anthropological theory, Sherry Ortner (1984) argues that the most important trend of recent years has been the rejection of the view that collectivities are best seen as prior to and determinative of individual actions-a view associated with Radcliffe-Brownian structural- 80</page><page sequence="2">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 81 functionalism, Boasian cultural anthropology, and Leslie Whitean "culturol- ogy"-in favor of what she calls the "practice approach," which stresses the primary agency of actors pursuing goals or interests and using culture to do it, thus creating what we observe as society. Of course the process is understood to be dialectical, as Berger and Luckmann (1967) especially pointed out some while ago; but the current shift of emphasis has been toward the agents and their agency rather than the system. This return of the human agent to anthropology raises the question of what people want. If individuals possess autonomy of agency, then one must under- stand their motivations in order to grasp the meaning or purpose of their actions. As Ortner succinctly phrases the issue, "What do actors want and how can they get it?" (1981:366). She furthermore candidly admits that so far, unfortunately, anthropologists have generally found that actors with too much psy- chological plumbing are hard to handle methodologically, and practice theorists are no exception. [1984:151] In the absence of an accepted theory of individuals that is psychologically rich and sound enough to deal with actual human motivation, practice theorists have tended, in their own practice, to revert to familiar interest theory. The model is that of an essentially individualistic, and somewhat aggressive actor, self-interested, rational, pragmatic, and perhaps with a maximizing orientation as well. [Ortner 1984:1511 In trying to develop a model of human agency that will be both systematic and full enough of psychological plumbing to do justice to empirical reality, I want to explore further a suggestion made very cautiously by Ortner. This con- cerns the relevance of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, or sociobiology, in the understanding of what it is actors are trying to accomplish when they act. If we push further-and here we skirt dangerous ground-we might even see the whole sociobiology movement as part of this general trend [towards a practice ap- proach] insofar as it shifts the evolutionary mechanism from random mutation to in- tentional choice on the part of actors seeking to maximize reproductive success. [1984:145-146] Although her characterization of the shift represented by sociobiology within the field of evolutionary theory is incorrect-sociobiologists have never aban- doned the idea of random mutation and speak of intentional choice only as a con- scious anthropomorphism-she is quite right to note the parallel between trends in cultural anthropology and biological thinking. For just as the paradigm shift in cultural anthropology that she documents involves the downplaying of the collec- tive to the advantage of a more robust individual agent, so sociobiological theory rests on the revolutionary ideas of Hamilton (1964), which made inevitable the demise of group selectionist, typological, and species thinking, and showed how</page><page sequence="3">82 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY apparently collective, social, or altruistic behaviors could be understood in terms of the actions of strategizing individual organisms. But whereas most cultural anthropologists, in reinvigorating the actor, have stopped short of denying the existence of larger collectivities altogether, biolog- ical thinkers have not hesitated to go to this extreme. Contemporary Darwinian thought asserts very strongly that such concepts as society, culture, and even ecol- ogy, while useful in a nominalist way as shorthand names for observed regulari- ties in the world, do not refer to entities that may be granted autonomous agency. On the contrary, far from being entities or systems in themselves, these concepts are in fact reifications of generalizations made in the minds of observers, based on the observation of sums of individual actions. The challenge that this doctrine poses to cultural and social anthropology is genuine and great. The cultural anthropologist reading the sociobiological litera- ture is inevitably appalled by the view expressed there that most existing social and cultural theory is entirely fallacious, because it seeks explanations at the level of collective phenomena that quite simply do not exist. According to these socio- biological thinkers, the understanding of any action can never-in principle-be explained in terms of its usefulness, function, or meaning as part of a social, cul- tural, or ecological system, for the simple reason that these so-called systems are mere hypostases of statistical patterns observed in what they prefer to call popu- lations of individuals, each acting pretty much the way Ortner described it in her characterization of interest theory. But this radical position is only the beginning. For not only do the socio- biologists claim that only individuals exist; they also claim to know exactly what it is they want. In their view, the purpose, meaning, function, or goal of any and all action, by humans as well as all other organisms, must, in principle, be only one thing: inclusive genetic fitness, that is, success in producing succeeding gen- erations of viable offspring. It is this claim-to have discovered the one exhaustive function that alone will explain what it is people, like other organisms, are trying to do when they act-which poses the most serious threat to the integrity of cultural anthropology; not, as it is often supposed, the attempt to posit a genetic basis for behaviors that most of us would consider to be essentially learned. Sociobiology rests on the priority of genetics not in the sense that it needs to place unusually heavy weight on the genetic bases of behavior (although some of its leading theorists do in fact subscribe to such a view); but rather in the sense that it sees as the final telos of any behavior, whether genetic or learned, the enhancing of the genetic reproduc- tive success of the acting organism. From this point of view, the fact that a be- havior may be essentially acquired rather than innate does not affect the circum- stance that it still must be seen to enhance genetic fitness in order to have come into existence and survived. Just to document that I do not distort their position, let me cite Durham (1978): I hypothesize that cultural features of human phenotypes are commonly designed to promote the success of an individual human being in his or her natural and sociocul-</page><page sequence="4">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 83 tural environment and . . . that success is best measured by the extent to which the attribute permits individuals to survive and reproduce and thereby contribute genes to later generations of the population of which they are members. [ 1978:433; empha- sis in original] And similarly Alexander (1979): I have argued . . . that culture is a product of the efforts of all the individuals of history, in the different environments of history, to maximize their separate inclusive fitnesses. ... I have suggested that the capacity for culture is really the capacity to use a wide array of experiences to adjust one's personal outcomes in the interest of maximizing reproductive success. [ 1979:131] The temptation for the cultural anthropologist, faced with such ideas, is sim- ply to ignore this position altogether, or explain it away in ideological and polit- ical terms. And this is absurdly easy to do: as we know from Louis Dumont (1970, 1976) among others, individualism is itself a highly unusual cultural concept de- veloped very recently and only in Western countries in its purest form. From this point of view, neo-Darwinian theory can thus be understood not only as a Western cultural product, but as an attempt to mystify the ideology of late capitalism by projecting it into nature as a supposed scientific law. Having seen their way clear to this facile insight, a great many cultural anthropologists have dismissed the sociobiological threat from their minds, along with the threat of nuclear war and the greenhouse effect, and gone about their business. There are many reasons why this is not a wise response. First, post-Hamil- tonian Darwinian theory is no wild, maverick position held by a few cranks. It is the dominant orthodoxy among evolutionary theorists of all kinds, not just an- thropologists, who control vastly more professorships and grant dollars than do cultural anthropologists. The theory is not going to go away if we stick our heads in the sand. It is, furthermore, and politics aside, an enormously powerful theory in the realm of nonhuman organisms, making sense of a wide array of empirical data. Unless one is prepared to say that humans are not biological organisms, that they did not develop by natural selection, or that the theory of evolution is bunk, then one is called upon to examine the question of why, exactly, humans should after all be exempt from this theoretical paradigm. Finally, it seems to me that one restricts oneself intellectually by refusing to grapple with the issues raised by sociobiology. If the time has really come for anthropology to develop an adequate model of the human actor, then this can only come from a synthesis of the views developed in the various disciplines, including biology, rather than from an exclusion of some aspects of knowledge from legit- imate consideration. I want to show here, in any event, that an acceptance of the theory of the priority of inclusive genetic fitness as the final guiding function of all human ac- tion is untenable, using exactly the same logic that led to the theory in the first place. It is my hope thus to grant the insights of sociobiology a valid place within</page><page sequence="5">84 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY our own field, without succumbing to the cannibalism of the human sciences by biology, which E. O. Wilson so gleefully predicted a decade ago (1975:4). In- deed, it is my aim to argue to the cultural anthropologists that they cannot ignore biology, but to argue equally forcefully to the biologists that they can no more ignore the peculiarities of culture in making sense of homo sapiens than they can ignore the fact that porpoises live in the water or that birds can fly. In this spirit, then, let me inquire why it is that evolutionary theory is so firm in its conviction that only individual organisms are the locus of causative agency. Genes, being DNA molecules, have the ability to replicate themselves because of their molecular structure. They furthermore have the power to organize the mol- ecules around them into regular and replicable forms, through the instructions inscribed in their molecular code. These forms can then be thought of as vehicles, or surrounding tissue, for the DNA, enhancing its ability to continue to exist and to replicate further. These vehicles, built up from proteins synthesized under the direction of the genetic instructions in the DNA and transmitted to new vehicles in the act of reproduction, have the capacity to act; that is, they possess subjec- tivity. By this I mean not that these vehicles have consciousness, but that they will respond to stimuli by acts such as approach or flight, incorporation or extru- sion, etc. If there is a situation in which such replicators exist; and in which they re- produce themselves with some constancy, but also with some variation, produced either by the self-reorganization of the genes, as in the process of meiosis, or by random changes or mutations; and in which, furthermore, there is some environ- mental limitation on the number of such vehicles or organisms that can find nour- ishment, metabolize, and survive; then a process of evolution by natural selection must, almost tautologically, occur. For all the process of evolution by natural selection refers to is the situation in which those reproduced variants that survive and reproduce continue to exist, while others fail to do so. This process, and this alone, accounts for the growth of the great varieties of living forms and their ex- traordinary morphologies and behaviors. Thus all organisms may be said to be adapted to reproductive success, not because of some primal urge to reproduce (though whether or not such a primal urge exists seems to me beyond the power of science to decide), but because those that have survived, under prevailing environmental conditions in history, are those that have in fact been capable of surviving. The system seems supremely purposeful, but this is only an appearance. The fact of adaptedness is a postfacto judgment awarded to an organism on the simple basis of its continuing to be. Natural selection acts on the phenotypes, that is, on the vehicles or organisms that consist of organized tissue constructed by the genes, which are literally inside them, at the nuclei of their cells. It is the phenotypes who live and die, and by their differential mortality and reproduction constitute the statistical process which we can analyze as evolution. But they are to be understood in the last anal- ysis as agents of the real actors in the system, the genes themselves. It is the genes who endure; and it is they who possess the power of causation, since it is they</page><page sequence="6">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 85 who construct and program the surrounding tissue which constitutes the orga- nisms that bear them. The organisms are thus self-interested in the sense that they serve the interest of their genes (and I suppose I need to insert here the strong disclaimer that while I use words like interest, the theory is founded on the principle that this is only a convenient anthropomorphism used to explain a process that involves no volition or intention on the part of the agents, but only their ability to create replicas of themselves and of the organisms they inhabit). Usually these interests coincide; but if there is a clash, then it is the interests of the genes that must prevail, because it is they who program the organisms, and not vice versa. The Hamiltonian revolution rests on this insight: the apparently selfless, al- truistic or group-oriented behavior of individual animals is not a disinterested, free gift, which the individuals give to the species or to society (terms which have no real referents anyway). It is, rather, behavior by means of which the genes utilize and even sacrifice any individual organism bearing them in the higher in- terest of ensuring the success of its genetic kin, that is, other organisms bearing a copies of the same genes. Again, I need to stress that they do this not out of in- telligent calculation or planning, but simply because those genes that have pro- grammed organisms to perform acts leading to such results are favored by natural selection and are left in by history. As most people are at least vaguely aware, the paradigmatic case is that of social insects such as bees, among whom sterile workers can be shown to be serv- ing the interests of their sisters, who share more of their genes than would their own offspring (if they had any) because of a peculiarity in their mode of sexual reproduction. The theory can thus be said to be not so much based on individualism as on nepotism, in which there are, after all, genuine collectivities, collectivities cre- ated by individuals bearing varying degrees of related genomes (total packages of nuclear DNA). Why, then, are sociobiological theorists so committed to contin- uing to stress the autonomous agency of the individual organism, and not the ge- netic kin group? There are sound reasons for their position. The first is that, fi- nally, no two organisms are genetically identical (among sexually reproducing animals, to which I confine my discussion here, since homo sapiens falls into that category), and so there can never be complete coincidence of interest between two organisms, because they differ somewhat in genetic structure. (I also leave to one side the anomalous case of identical twins.) A more profound reason derives from the actual empirical property of living molecules, whereby it is possible for DNA to communicate with protein (orga- nismic tissue) in order to instruct and guide its growth and behavior; but it is im- possible for protein to communicate in any way at all with DNA. The DNA thus gives out orders and instructions with no possibility of feedback to monitor the success or failure of the operations it has ordered, or to gauge the changing state of the world in which it is operating. Imagine the captain of a ship, locked in an isolation booth, with a one-way radio leading out, constantly giving orders to veer hard a-starboard, cut the en-</page><page sequence="7">86 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY gines, etc.-all without ever receiving back any information about where the ship is heading, what waters they are in, or even whether or not the ship is sinking. This is the implausible but nonetheless empirically real picture given to us by biology of the relationship between the nuclear DNA and the phenotypic organism it guides. Imagine, further, that this pilot gave his orders in strict adherence to a route-plan encoded in a chart that he inherited from a previous captain; that he had no freedom to deviate from it; and that nothing that happened to his ship in the course of his travels could alter one whit the chart that he, in turn, would hand on to a successor captain in a successor ship, changed only by random copying errors and arbitrary reassortments of letters or words. So certain (or perhaps so uncertain) are contemporary biological theorists of the one-way flow of information and command from DNA to protein, but not vice versa, that they refer to this aspect of the theory as the "Central Dogma" of mod- ern biology. Such an arrangement is clearly a very inefficient system; but given enough time and prolific enough reproduction of replicators, it is statistically pos- sible that such a process could result in ships adequately suited to sailing the waters to which they are adapted. The cost comes in the great number of badly programmed ships that must sink to allow the successful ones to survive by this process of trial and error; and the extreme slowness by which the indirect feedback of differential mortality can have its impact in shaping the successful DNA-the charts which keep their ships afloat. The process of evolution by natural selection thus may be said to depend on individual organisms for this reason: while it is the genome or gene pool that is the subject of the evolutionary process, the genes exist only as discrete replicas within the bodies of individual phenotypes. The shaping of the genotype in an adaptive direction occurs through indirect feedback, which acts by means of the sole mechanism of differential rates of reproduction and of mortality of numbers of individual organisms in the population. This circumstance is dictated by the fact that the individual phenotypes cannot communicate with or give direct feed- back to the genes that guide them. The shape of the genotype thus evolves because individual organisms bearing related genes that dictate adaptive behaviors have either reproduced in higher numbers, or died in lower numbers, than competing organisms. In this way, then, the one-way chain of command from genotype to phenotype-the process described in the Central Dogma-determines that indi- vidual organisms, in their summed fertility and mortality, must in principle be the units upon which the mechanisms of the evolution of the genotype, and conse- quently the phenotype, operate. Now it is easy to see that if one were to set about designing a system for reproducing adapted organisms, one could do a good deal better job of it than Mother Nature has done. The obvious step to take would be to equip the organism with mechanisms whereby it could, without waiting for genetic evolution, receive direct feedback from the environment, monitor the success of its actions, and ad- just its behavior appropriately. But this same idea inevitably occurred to Mother Nature as well; and so it is that all organisms possess at least some degree of responsiveness to the environment, so that they can respond to stimuli, learn from</page><page sequence="8">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 87 experience and remember the response, and act the same way in a similar situation later. From this point of view, the power of homo sapiens to learn is different in degree, but not in kind, from the learning and responsiveness to the environment found throughout living nature. Such is the position on human learning and cul- ture taken by many sociobiologists. It is therefore fruitless for cultural anthropologists to imagine they can refute sociobiology by stressing the degree to which humans learn. Of course they learn: all organisms learn. The question is not whether an action is learned, but whether (as it must, according to the theory) it leads to enhanced reproductive success. Thus, for example, many birds have to learn their distinctive song by hearing it from other, adult birds. But since the songs are influential in attracting mates and defending territory, it is nonetheless the case that the function, goal, or even, if you will, the meaning of the song, learned though it be, is to serve the attainment of genetic replication by the individual birds, depending on how well they sing. So too, some sociobiologists argue, is it for the learned, cultural actions of homo sapiens. Other biological thinkers, such as Boyd and Richerson (1985, this volume), Dawkins (1976), and others, have recognized that once organisms develop the capacity to learn by imitating each other, that is to transmit information through social learning, they have thereby created a second channel of inheritance besides the genetic one, which can in principle be independent of the rules that guide the genetic channel. This results in what Boyd and Richerson call the "dual inherit- ance model" of evolution (see also Knauft, this volume), referring to the fact that some organisms, and most especially homo sapiens, transmit instructions for ac- tion by two different modes, each with some degree of autonomy from the other. Such a view is rejected by the more orthodox sociobiological thinkers as a breach of the universal truth of evolution by natural selection. Thus, Alexander writes, stating the position very concisely: There is every reason to expect a correlation between culture change and inclusive- fitness-maximizing; if none had existed the capacity for culture could not have evolved by natural selection of genetic alternatives. [1979:78] While I cannot suggest an evolutionary scenario (but see Boyd and Richerson 1985) whereby genetic evolution by natural selection led to its supersession by one of its own products, that is, the capacity for culture (not having been there), I nonetheless find it self-evident that the capacity for culture as we experience it is manifestly not determined by genetic considerations alone. I will now explain why this should be so. Genes produce the kind of evolution that occurs in the organic world because they are replicators. But, as Dawkins has pointed out (1976), any replicator would undergo a process of evolution; and there is no a priori reason why DNA should be the only possible replicator. It seems clear enough to me that human central nervous systems (CNS), too, are replicators: they give instructions to the mus- culature for action; they can create copies of themselves by serving as a model for</page><page sequence="9">88 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY learning or imitation by other organisms equipped with similar CNS's; they can store and recall information; and copies of them can further produce or transmit new examples of the learned behavior. The great advantage possessed by the CNS over the genome, in terms of energy efficiency, is that instead of requiring many generations of individuals exhibiting differential mortality, the CNS can receive direct feedback and engage in dialectical, two-way communication both with the environment in which it acts and with the other organisms with which it exchanges information. In other words, the Central Dogma does not apply. According to the Central Dogma, there is a one-way flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein; in other words, from the memory and program system, into a communication or messenger code (the RNA), and thence into the phenotype. In cultural communication, by contrast, the system wherein instruc- tions for action are recorded (that is, the CNS) can not only give but also receive instructions from the equivalent of the phenotype (that is, the musculature, which executes action), because the nerves and senses can monitor and transmit back to the CNS information about the impact of action on the world as well as infor- mation about the world itself. Moreover, when information is transmitted through cultural reproduction- that is, when a second organism learns behavior from the actions of a first-the means whereby the instructions are inserted into the second organism is not through an implantation of a newly shuffled copy of the genes into its physical body, as happens in sexual reproduction, but rather through observation, imita- tion, and trial and error on the part of the soma or phenotype. Simultaneously, the CNS of the learning organism is also programmed, through the observation and performance of the action by the musculature, so that it can store and reproduce the action independently on subsequent occasions without the model of the orig- inal actor before it. But we can further see that for the CNS to be programmed by learning, it has to observe a model that is external to it; and that the sense organs receiving infor- mation for the CNS do this by interpreting information that has already been en- coded in a medium that is entirely external to the body of the learning organism. That is to say, the transmission of information from one body to another occurs through the patterned flow of light waves or sound waves, or through the other media received by the senses. In a thoroughly real sense, then, the external world itself plays a role analogous to RNA in the genetic system, with the major differ- ence that there is no barrier preventing a two-way flow of information. Not only is it the case that instructions are encoded for communication in an external medium, but they can also be stored there. As symbolic and structural anthropology have made us aware, the external world is in fact inscribed by ob- serving humans in such a way that it is itself a replicator. Geertz's insight con- cerning the public, extrinsic nature of thought, as well as the structuralist and poststructuralist insistence that we act in a world already organized into semioti- cally meaningful categories, demonstrate that the CNS itself is not an adequate autonomous replicator, but that it is always in interaction with a coded external</page><page sequence="10">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 89 environment that also acts as a replicating system, in dialectical interaction with CNS's. Thus, to take a clear example, language exists not just as instructions in a CNS, but also as real patterns of sound waves in the air, a medium external to individual actors. Furthermore, it is capable of being inscribed in more permanent ways, such as writing, so that it can become a source of instruction more enduring than the organism itself. In this regard, C. S. Peirce's vision of human thought as consisting of the traffic of signs among groups of people serves as a theoretical guide, as does Durkheim's assertion of the reality of collective representations. This latter phrase refers to nothing mystical, but rather to the simple fact that most of the ideas in people's heads get there from an outside source; and even if this outside source is the behavior of another person, it has necessarily existed in an encoded medium external to human bodies. Thus all the members of a conversation can simulta- neously contribute to and attend to the entire multidirectional flow of information, because all the individuals have simultaneous access to the air around them in which are recorded the sound waves of which the conversation consists. By con- trast, RNA could only convey information to each of them singly and privately, and could take back no reply to its DNA sender. It therefore follows that just as shared genes can produce kin, shared cultural signs or symbols can also create kin; nor is this to be thought of as a derived or fictive kinship. It is just as real as genetic kinship, consisting of the same thing, namely, shared programming by identical or related replicators. But while in the case of genetic kin the Central Dogma implies that the kin are related by some- thing private that each carries inside its body, in the case of cultural kin organisms share a public, social reality to which access by one does not exclude access by others, and which is capable of a dialectical movement. It appears, then, that cultural replicators can program many individuals at once; they can be altered by lived experience and thus "inherit" acquired char- acteristics; and perhaps most importantly of all, they require neither sexual repro- duction nor differential mortality in order to learn, receive feedback, and so evolve and adapt, as is the case with genetic replicators. Culture is thus liberated from both sex and death, not in some mystical sense, but in the concrete sense that these are not necessary for it to create meaning and intention, as they are for the genes. There is thus no reason, in principle, why cultural information needs to be tied to the flow of genes through lines of genetic kinship. Indeed, at this very moment, you the reader, who are very likely hardly related to me at all in any significant genetic way, are receiving information from me by way of the patterns of ink on a page creating patterns of light, which enter your eyes and are thence conveyed to the brain where they are matched against what you have already learned. I contend, then, that both society and culture are as real as anything else under the sun: society is created not merely by the summed behavior of autono- mous individuals, but by the fact that its members share in possessing access to a</page><page sequence="11">90 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY publicly encoded information system; which, in its total operation, we call cul- ture. This system requires that information or instructions pass from the CNS of an organism, via the nerves, into patterned action by the musculature. This action organizes an external medium in a way that can be received by the sense organs of one or more other organisms. And this information can in turn be conveyed to the CNS's of the receiving individuals, who then can emit further action. Of course, the cultural system requires that the genetic reproductive system must also operate, in order for it to have individuals with CNS's to operate with. And indeed, in primitive society, more often than not the community of genetic and cultural kin are so closely united that the cultural system does indeed, for the most part, act as if it were promoting the interests of the genes of individuals. Thus, for example, cultural rules of cousin marriage, whatever the details of the system, may be understood as maximizing the genetic fitness of individuals obey- ing them, since the practice favors the replication of identical genes through con- ception between genetic kin sharing a high percentage of genes, while at the same time avoiding the cost of the deleterious effects that result from excessively close inbreeding. But because of the nature of the cultural replicating system, which I have sketched here, this overlap is not required, and the fundamental difference in the operation of the two transmission systems provides the basis for greater and greater divergence as more and more information is recorded in external recording systems, and as, concomitantly, larger and larger groups are formed of culturally related societies, in which relations of genetic kin are attenuated. Because of their freedom from the Central Dogma and hence from a generational time frame, ex- trinsic, cultural replicators are vastly more efficient than genetic ones, and once in existence, they will, through natural selection, successfully compete with the authority of the genes. The result is a picture of the evolution of human culture in a direction congruent with the one recorded by actual history: the establishment of successively more inclusive states or societies utilizing improved technologies, whose fundamental characteristic is their enhanced ability to store information in loci external to human bodies. Writing is one obvious example of such a tech- nology, and we are currently living in the midst of such a cultural evolutionary explosion, in which the growth of technologies for the more effective external recording and retrieval of information is the central phenomenon (see, for ex- ample, Lyotard 1984). There emerges from all these considerations, then, a picture of a human agent receiving instruction from two different sources, an internal one and an ex- ternal one. The internal one, because of its intrinsic properties, places sexuality at the pinnacle of its hierarchy of values and works through the mortality of in- dividuals; while the external one regards sex as a necessary nuisance interfering with its own ever more orderly and encompassing reproduction, operating inde- pendently of both sexual intercourse and of the lifespans of particular individuals. The great advantage of the dual inheritance model is that it frees us from the futile project of seeking a single total goal or function for all human action, but rather presents us to ourselves in a way congruent with our own actual experience,</page><page sequence="12">INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY 91 that is, as creatures plagued by conflicts over morality, priorities, sexuality, nar- cissism, and idealism. It also ceases to prescribe in advance what the locus of agency of an action is, or what its telos must be, but instead renders that an em- pirical question for observation and analysis to decide (see for example Silk, this volume). Thus, to take an exemplary case, celibacy, which poses such a theoretical difficulty for sociobiologists, is no problem once one recognizes that genetic in- heritance is not a total explanation, but only a part of the picture that also includes another form of inheritance, cultural transmission, which is often fundamentally hostile to the project of the genes. Celibacy in a religious context is a highly in- tentional attempt to negate the sexual reproductive program, which would favor the interests of the genes, so as to supplant it with a system of information trans- mission dependent on the cultural, symbolic channel alone. Of course, this system needs to have the sexual reproduction system in operation somewhere, in order to obtain recruits to initiate into the culturally transmitted system. But the individ- uals who are benefitting from the maximization of the reproduction of cultural replicators are not the same as the individuals who achieve genetic reproductive success in such a system. A very fine example of the symbolic division of labor between the two chan- nels can be clearly seen in the Catholic Church. The teachings of the religion, which are encoded in the external world as written texts, oral teachings, rituals, art, symbolic objects, and other paraphernalia, and the social organization of the church, all depend on social relations from which sex is excluded altogether, so that the doctrine itself is passed exclusively by cultural channels through lineages of unrelated celibate clergy, who become socialized as members of the cultural kin group purely through a process of teaching, the transmission of symbols from one generation to another. At the same time, the content of the teaching requires for the lay population the unrestricted operation of the sexual reproductive pro- gram, encouraging maximum fertility and placing a dogmatic ban on all means of interfering with sexual reproduction. The central symbols of the Catholic religion, too, present symbolic resolu- tions of the contradiction between the attitudes of a cultural versus a genetic sys- tem of reproduction toward sexual reproduction and individual mortality: the vir- gin birth and the death and resurrection simultaneously assert and deny the im- portance and reality of physical as opposed to spiritual (read cultural or symbolic) birth, and of bodily death, as opposed to spiritual (cultural) immortality. Donald Campbell, in a controversial but important paper (1975), argues that humans as organisms are by nature self-interested in terms of inclusive fitness, but that the great civilizations and religions have counteracted this tendency by enforcing altruistic, socially oriented values. Cultural evolution has thus been a struggle on the part of collective morality systems, inscribed in external, public, social channels, to control, usurp, and manipulate individuals who are simulta- neously operating with interests consonant with those of the genes; while the genes, it would appear, have fought back by making us the most sexually driven, preoccupied, and conflicted of all the animals.</page><page sequence="13">92 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY The model of human agency that I have been developing here accepts the logic of sociobiology, but also sees its limits, and so gives back to us in reinvig- orated terms the image of ourselves already entertained by the greatest of moder thinkers. From Nietzsche we have learned how central was the role of ascetic self- denial in the creation of culture. Marx taught of our alienation from our "species being" through our immersion in a system of external "fetishistic" symbols of social origin. From Freud we know that civilization flourishes at the expense of the libido, which it then uses in sublimated form to fuel its projects. From Durk- heim we discover that humankind is double, in the sense of being tor between individual, organismic goals, and antithetical social, moral ones. I suggest, then, that the dual inheritance model provides us with a way of adding Darwin to this list, accepting the power of his thought without being forced to abandon the views we have inherited from our other great masters. It thus should be possible, following the ideas proposed here, to develop an anthropology that does justice to the biological, psychological, social, and cultural aspects of homo sapiens without either excluding some aspects from consideration, or trying to reduce the genuine but partial autonomous agency proper to some realms to the explanatory hegemony of others.
