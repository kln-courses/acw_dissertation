<plain_text><page sequence="1">Political landscape: the art history of nature. By Martin Warnke. London, Reaktion Books. 1994. 165 pp. Â£12.95, paper. ISBN 0 948462 63 9. For an anglophone reader familiar with the extensive critical literature on land- scape in English, the title of this book raises many expectations. Within art his- tory and beyond, landscape painting and design have come to be regarded as deeply political, because landscape is regarded as a way of seeing and repre- senting the natural world, historically bound to the exercise of authority and power over land and territory. It comes therefore as a surprise to read in the book's preface that 'art experts . . . have totally eliminated the political element from landscape painting' and the hope that the book 'will show that political pointers need not impair our appreciation and perception of the landscape, but actually sharpen them' (pp. 7-8). Such a claim only makes sense in the specific context of the original German text. Martin Warnke is Professor of Art History at the University of Hamburg, and the literature upon which his book draws is overwhelmingly German. We know that Landschaft has a broader and less necessarily visual meaning in German than in English, and we know too (in part from Warnke's own evidence here) how powerful and dangerous has been the political reading of landscape within the nationalist discourses of the German-speaking peoples. Undoubtedly, acad- emic caution in handling the ideological dimensions of landscape art accounts in part for the situation Warnke identifies. But his claim must also rest in part on ignorance of the very considerable non-German body of literature on his subject, which has extended the political critique of landscape well beyond the formal politics Warnke considers, into the less formal politics of gender and culture for example. The point is made less in criticism (how many anglo- phone landscape writers handle non-English materials and writings with any felicity?) than in recognition of how far discussion of a genre of European culture which has always been strongly territorial, itself remains limited by national boundaries. In fact, Professor Warnke's freedom from the constraints of an existing liter- ature on his subject, and the breadth of his knowledge of images, give his pro- ject a scope and freshness of interpretation and illustration rare in many recent commentaries on landscape (the text is mercifully free of Bellinis, Bruegels, Constable and the seemingly obligatory Mr &amp;f Mrs Andrews) . Amply illustrated by 150 reproductions of paintings, sculptures, engravings, medals, photographs and cartoons, this is essentially an essay dealing with six themes of landscape, each with its own political dimension. The occupation of the plain' deals with iconographie aspects of the Kulturlandschaft itself. Roads, frontiers and monu- ments are considered as the key markers of political authority within landscapes.

'Hills and castles' develops the theme, tracing with skill and insight the ways that castles have appeared in European art, first as architectural statements of power, good order or protection (depending upon one's perspective), later as sites of nostalgia, even symbols of freedom from former tyranny. Delight in a perspective over landscape originates in the view from a castle: set upon a hill, mastering the panoramas it surveyed. As social conditions in Europe became more settled, 'the view from the castle was transfigured and could now evoke a feeling of harmony between the country and its rulers' (p. 45). This feeling of course has its own politics, although Warnke chooses not to discuss them. 'From battlefield to war landscape' examines the role that landscape has played in warfare, especially as artillery altered the patterns of advantage and vulnerability afforded to the soldier by topography. Surprisingly, Warnke makes nothing of the close technical links between cartography, military topographic drawing and landscape art. He does, however, pursue the insight that as artillery became more powerful and wars more static, the soldier increasingly merged with the landscape - in trenches and through camouflage, for example - a more visceral than visual relationship with the land. In art, this is paralleled by memo- rializing warfare as often in landscape monument as in pictorial recordings of the battlefield. The second set of three essays deals with ways that 'nature' has been har- nessed for graphic political expression. 'Nature's freedom as political freedom' is a brief, conventional discussion of the origin and spread of the English style of landscape gardening. Here especially Warnke's work would have benefited from contact with recent work in English. By contrast, 'Natural forces and nat- ural forms' is a fascinating essay on anthropomorphism in landscape and the use of gigantism to make political statements in natural forms, from Dinocrates' proposal to sculpt Alexander the Great out of Mount Athos, to twentieth-cen- tury heroic American carvings in South Dakota's mountains. Such works lead naturally to a consideration of the allegorical uses of nature and natural processes in political iconography, especially popular in seventeenth-century emblemata. Given the richness of both content and illustration and the fertility of the ideas associated with them, Warnke's conclusion is brief and unexceptional. It is also almost certainly wrong, marred by a casual acceptance of green cata- strophism. To claim that 'man's devastating exploitation of nature has put an end to her argumentative force and autonomous authority' and thus that 'the rich reservoir of motifs and experiences that once guided human action . . . has run dry' (p. 146) flatly contradicts Warnke's own political sympathies. Environmentalism is a powerful contemporary political force, founded and sus- tained precisely on and by the argumentative force and claimed autonomous authority of nature.
