I want to assert the same thesis in relation to the concept of force. The nineteenth century was fascinated by this concept-abstractly in idealist thinking, concretely in developments 1.

Don Reneau (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993).</page><page sequence="3">Altieri / The Concept of Force 193 that ranged from experiments in electricity and magnetism to speculations on large-scale forces working in evolution and in social determinism. These figures of force carried a complex message, suggesting both the possi- bility of endless progress and the necessity of increasing dehumanization, since everything that seemed capable of increasing individual powers also seemed capable of depriving agents of their autonomy. Emile Zola's natu- ralism and Herbert Spencer's ethics afford obvious examples. Modernist art insisted on fully articulating this sense of dehumanization, yet it also sought ways of treating even those articulations as a part of a larger progressive picture. For dehumanization could also be a means of breaking from the tragic blindness of nineteenth-century individualism while providing a basis for recasting romantic ideals: A sense of spiritual fullness that had relied on a radically subjective lyrical expansiveness can now be linked to the rigors of a lucid impersonal objectivity.2 Having situated my project, I will have very little more to say about historical context, except in terms of pressures that positivist scientism ex- erted on early-twentieth-century intellectual life. Rather than dwell on the specific images of force negotiated during the period, I will focus only on the abstract concepts of force that were basic for the artists, because that enables me to get directly to the most fundamental roles that the topic comes to play for the imagination-both in modernist art and in our sense of what that art might still teach or keep alive as a way of thinking. That project leads me to concentrate on three closely interrelated issues. First, I will explore one basic way that modernist art tries simultaneously to fore- ground the forces it can be said to embody and to have those forces take 2. In making my general case, I ignore two important qualifications. First, as Christopher Herbert shows in "Science and Narcissism," Modernism/Modernity 3 (Sept. 1996): 129- 36, for modernism, dehumanization is closely connected to the ideological notion that science affords an antidote to narcissistic views that put human desires at the center of the universe. My argument sanctions the claim that modernist abstraction tried to address that challenge to anthropomorphic thinking by simultaneously imposing depersonalization and by showing how certain deep structures of value nonetheless proved entirely compat- ible with that depersonalization. Second, Bruce Clarke, in "Models of Energy: Scientism in the Modern Cultural Field" (unpublished book manuscript), has argued powerfully that we see the rhetoric about force in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as instances of scientism, that is, of the allegorical application of figures developed within science to nonscientific fields. My examples suggest another side to that coin, where the concept of force is deliberately abstracted from any specific scientific context so as to provide a counter to the dependencies that scientism involves and the authority it confers. This thesis also helps explain why talk of the fourth dimension was not more prevalent.</page><page sequence="4">194 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 on semantic significance. Interpreting modernist art is not simply a ques- tion of observing how such force is deployed; it also requires clarifying how the artists envision such deployments modifying an audience's overall re- lations to themselves and to their environments. Second, I will use these explorations to show how this modernist work can modify our contempo- rary languages for talking about force in the arts. There is a long history of related concepts in rhetoric (enargeia, for example), but these seem to have no place in current theory. In fact, modernist abstraction is now al- most always represented through some version of the Clement Greenberg- Michael Fried model of optical presence-which, not surprisingly, leads to negative judgments about the entire aesthetic as pure mystification, par- ticularly in relation to associated values such as autonomy: These values cannot but be escapist when they are not cast in terms that allow talk of pressure and dialectical struggle. Without such terms, what can be shat- tering and liberating modifications of entire sensibilities become mere ex- ercises in aesthetic evasions of historical reality. To prevent that, I want to isolate what it is in prevailing contemporary assumptions that makes it impossible for us to describe in even half-adequate theoretical terms the values that are at stake in art's ways of deploying force, and hence its capacities to move audiences so that they stay moved. As my corrective, I will propose a Hegelian alternative to Kantian purposiveness, so that the claims we make about form shift from a context of talk about genius and objects to one about the ways forces become immanent and immediately self-reflexive. My third concern is to specify in the broadest intellectual terms what may produce and protect this blindness, so that we can clear the way for exploring how alternative conceptual frameworks might have claims on us. Specifically, I will try indirectly to build on Nietzsche's insistence that current forms of philosophy are destructive for cultural life because they impose as the fundamental condition for postulating values the need to test them on epistemic grounds, that is, on grounds that we use to assess truth values. For Nietzsche, both moral and aesthetic values invite quite different sets of questions where the dominant role of judgment (the assessing of how to place particulars within categories) is replaced by concerns for how judg- ment is shaped by its ways of experiencing and responding to power. To set the Nietzschean stage that frames all of the claims I will make about force, we have to understand what is problematic in pursuing moral and aesthetic values as if they were analogous to epistemic ones and hence could be determined in accord with realist or deontological expectations that there are objective conditions for deciding what is good. First, I use the</page><page sequence="5">Altieri / The Concept of Force 195 concept of epistemic to evade the now popular distinction between foun- dational and antifoundational thinking that covers over the degree to which pragmatism, at least in its classical forms, remains devoted to empiricist concerns for truth and empiricist emphases on accurate judgment. Both foundational and antifoundational perspectives tend to subordinate moral consciousness to whatever counts as criteria for knowing, so there arises for both the thorny Kantian problem of having to correlate individual will with the general, transpersonal conditions of consciousness necessary for grasping moral universals or social priorities.3 In epistemic thinking, agents are bound to truth values because there is no question of subjective invest- ment: If one wants "truth," one subordinates subjectivity to methodology. When values are involved, however, it may be impossible to make the same leaps, since what matters is not simply what is true but what hierarchies a person uses to sort and use truths. The individual is only subsumable under the rational if, as in Kant, the rational turns out to be the most noble model of personal identity One way to avoid the Kantian problematic is to begin with a phe- nomenology of valuation that seems fundamental to ethics and aesthetics- for example, in their concern for how one can enjoy one's own being and present it as desirable to others, or even in their interest in how persons can demand fealty from others by what they make manifest about them- selves. This beginning need not entail denying the importance of epistemic concerns. It requires only circumscribing them and perhaps even admitting that some discriminations about how fully we examine facts actually de- rive from those other domains. Nor need this beginning entail embracing specifically Nietzschean values just because we acknowledge the force of Nietzsche's criticisms.4 Here, the important issue is simply demonstrating the price criticism still pays for its epistemic commitments, even when it 3. I know that Richard Rorty's thinking does not quite fit this picture because he makes so radical a dichotomy between the public world and the private and because he overtly resists the claims of knowledge by insisting instead on rhetorical and historical criteria as the only significant measures. I can say only that the very reductionism that forces him to his minimalist morality and epistemology itself has authority only within an epistemic framework. My evidence for that is how little he can say about values and about psychol- ogy because, in fact, his perspective remains constrained by positivist fears if not by the values they assert. 4. See Bernard Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), and Stanley Cavell, Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome: The Constitution of Emersonian Perfectionism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990). Both authors, in quite different ways, have tried to develop more humane practical adaptions of this general Nietzschean critique of Kantian and realist moral positions.</page><page sequence="6">196 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 thinks it is opening new cultural dispensations. The more fully we recog- nize that price, the better prepared we will be to appreciate what may be at stake in how modernist work dramatizes the working of certain forces. Rather than worrying about how such work can be true or what it can be true to, and rather than imposing social explanations so that the art becomes an example of some truth or condition, we can concentrate on questions of who we become when we allow the strangeness of artistic experiments their fullest impact on our emotions and our minds. Such questions make it impossible to deal simply with ideas and representations-either as the stuff of art or as the stuff of the world that art negotiates. Instead, a focus on force demands a focus on processes of becoming, and hence on how authorial act and artistic object seem continually to modify one another's range of possibilities. I have substantial personal stakes in the first of these concerns, be- cause my book Painterly Abstraction in Modernist American Poetry did not quite get right the semantics of modernist abstraction.5 My overall argument still seems to me on the mark-that we can develop a "semantics" for mod- ernist abstraction without relying on the mystical leaps of faith called for by the artists' own theorizing. Most critics, put off by such mystical claims, were content to talk about this art as emphasizing syntax and rejecting the semantic, because the semantic had to be equated with the literary and the anecdotal. Because I think this stance reduces elaborate counterpoint to theme music, I tried to show how there could be a theoretical semantics for this art if we tried to escape binaries put in place by the representational tra- ditions of Western culture. Rather than speak of representation as art's link to the world beyond the canvas, I proposed stressing the concept of repre- sentativeness (which applies also to mimetic art). We could then talk about all art as engaging the world in terms of how it offers potentially representa- tive concrete exemplary modes of agency. Representational work becomes representative by the processes of seeing and interpreting that it articu- lates. And noniconic work becomes representative by literally composing for the viewer certain states and processes that promise both to modify the audiences' awareness of their own powers and to show how certain ab- stract ideas can be demonstrated by the experiences rendered. Thus, Piet Mondrian envisioned his art as making good on his claims about breaking through static equilibrium to dynamic equilibrium because the works give 5. Charles Altieri, Painterly Abstraction in Modernist American Poetry: The Contempora- neity of Modernism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989).</page><page sequence="7">Altieri / The Concept of Force 197 the audience the actual self-reflective experience of learning to negotiate a complex, endlessly shifting set of balances that somehow also reconciles deep emotional investments with an entirely demystified manifest physical structure. I now have to admit two basic problems with this model. My model did not sufficiently account for differences among these art surfaces or the kinds of intensity that they could establish. Dynamic equilibrium is not simply an idea or even a means of establishing exemplarity; it is an event whose event qualities matter for themselves, and it is a very different version of equilibrium from Kazimir Malevich's. Second, my stress on agency tended to emphasize only the compositional activity of the artist without attending sufficiently to how the different overt shapes and rhythms have their own discrete situating power, a power that seems not to derive from composi- tion but to elicit it and to define its possibilities. Consequently, I could not adequately account for the strange and estranging effects of some abstrac- tion, even Mondrian's, which seems to challenge the very idea of agency because that idea overhumanizes the nature of the relationships that the work exemplifies. So I want now to argue that the works both present and exemplify the shape and power of certain kinds of force. It is still crucial that audiences identify with the exemplary human agency that the work pro- duces when it asks viewers to attend to how the work itself positions them as responding sensibilities. But the state of agency is not the primary end. Rather, the basic semantics of the work consist in its processes of nego- tiating various aspects of the energy fields it manifests: These processes consist of organizing color harmonies and conflicts, composing dynamic structural tensions, and finding balances between intelligence shaping its world and responding to the patterns that the world imposes. These bal- ances, in turn, come to bear figurative power both for what they show intel- ligence can do and for what they show intelligence must handle in order to find satisfying modes of expression. Expressiveness itself, in other words, has to be positioned as a responsiveness to features of both the psyche and the world that then make demands on what the poet composes. We need an example. Let me start with some features of Malevich's Black Square and Red Square that I have already developed in various writings on agency. Then I will bring Hegel's work on force to bear in this discussion-in part to see what he can add to our general theorizing about force in art and in part to show how artists such as Malevich adapted the actual historical context that idealist thinking made available to abstract painting. Using Hegel also makes it possible to incorporate the painter's</page><page sequence="8">198 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 explorations within a phenomenology that I think still has substantial power to illuminate our world and hence to clarify why the paintings matter. Chal- lenged by what seemed futurism's merely reportorial relation to the dynamic features of modern life, modernist noniconic painters had to show that there were alternative ways of becoming responsible to and for the basic features of twentieth-century spiritual experience. My Painterly Abstraction makes three basic points about Malevich's painting. First, it calls attention to the dialectic established by the painting's structure. The tilt of the smaller, red square refuses subordination to the spatial frameworks imposed by the black square and by the frame. That negation becomes a demand that the viewer bring to bear a second sys- tem of coordinates in which the tilt itself determines alignments within the painting. Attending to these coordinates then turns the surrounding white space into an active field helping to constitute an intricate balancing of both organizational principles in relation to now dynamic color, texture, and size contrasts. What could have been simple flat surfaces echoing each other becomes instead a dynamic field reconciling potential motion in several dimensions with an overall compositional harmony. My other two points involve the thematic possibilities that these visual relations elicit. For example, it is difficult not to treat Malevich's tilt as also a means of foregrounding the intricate ontology that his abstraction affords. On one level, the world of sensation is reduced entirely to purely exten- sional, flat, colored surfaces. There is no illusion at all, except perhaps for the hints of depth set up by the relation of the two squares. Yet, this reduc- tion to pure visual matter also seems to sustain a powerful transcendental movement, since it is precisely as pure appearance that the painting also opens what we might call the thematics of the tilt. What we see is not all that we get: We get a dramatic contrast--Malevich called it the relation of revolution to established authority-and, more generally, we get a concrete realization of how abstraction actually marries meaning to sense, because it is precisely through its gestures of purifying itself from illusion into these simple extensional visual elements that the painting opens a domain of very general metaphoric possibilities. As my third claim, I offer specific ways to read these metaphoric possibilities. Minimally, Malevich is playing on the relation of art to life and mind to matter. This painting is so elemental that it cannot be a found ob- ject; only mind can make it with such delicate balances of shape and color. These flat shapes are and are not simply objects, since within the painting, within the frames provided by art conventions, the shapes work as rela-</page><page sequence="9">Altieri / The Concept of Force 199 tionships, and the relationships open metaphoric extensions that do not displace but pervade the material elements. It seems as if intelligence lit- erally inhabits these otherwise purely visual elements. In fact, the material tilt here becomes a powerful emblem for the relation of art to life and of art to the representational traditions underlying this play of intelligence. In coming alive as a work of art, this configuration literally enacts a tilt both acknowledging and providing alternatives to the coordinates established by purely extensional seeing. Malevich's painting invites us to participate in a metaphorical dwelling within what it has reduced to purely extensional marks, so that painterly intelligence becomes simply the possibility of main- taining just such an imaginative space, reducing representation to marks to free intelligence from the confines of description and dramatic interpre- tation. Finally, because that intelligence makes its own place, the painting ultimately offers itself as a self-reflexive embodiment of all those features of our lives where the only difference between pure extensional matter and what we have called spirit is a simple tilt. What else makes my body and world into a subject's? And what else brings mysteries of loving and caring for which it is extremely difficult to provide determining reasons? Tilting is a purposive but not rationalized way of inhabiting extensional objects. 2 It should be easy now to see why it is so tempting to treat the self- reflexive participation that such paintings invite in terms of thematics of agency. An audience focuses on what happens to its own sense of human powers as it negotiates these relations between activity and passivity, tilting and being placed, and seeing and building reflections on seeing. But now my task is to show why that metaphoric register is limited, so I will turn to ways that Hegel, in his work on force, sponsors a somewhat different description of abstract painting. For an introduction to that aspect of Hegel, I want to give Malevich the first word, since it is crucial that we see how he shares Hegel's fascination with phenomena that cannot be contained within frame- works developed for dealing with the sensible world, and hence that can phenomenologically be called the "supersensible" without relying on any mystical claims. In Malevich's terms, everything I have been saying about the tilt can be summarized under the rubric "the spirit of non-objectivity": "No more likenesses of reality," no idealistic images-nothing but a desert!</page><page sequence="10">200 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 But this desert is filled with the spirit of non-objective sensation which pervades everything. Even I was gripped by a kind of timidity bordering on fear when it came to leaving "the world of will and idea," in which I had lived and worked and in the reality of which I had believed. But a blissful sense of liberating non-objectivity drew me forth into the "desert," where nothing is real except feeling . . . [his ellipses] and so feeling became the substance of my life.6 Hegel's chapter on force in his Phenomenology of Spirit tries to ex- plain how this sense of nonobjectivity first emerges in the form of an irre- ducible supplement to extensional features that can be exhausted by em- pirical description. The extensional world had emerged in Hegel's previous chapter, which is devoted to the certainties of sense. The discussion of force has the task of establishing dialectical transitions between the world of pure perception and one in which awareness of the world proves inseparable from the intricacies of self-consciousness. The rest of the Phenomenology goes on to elaborate "what consciousness knows in knowing itself.7 Given my desire to explore the limitations of the epistemic, however, this larger argument is not one I can accept. I will concentrate, instead, on Hegel's treatment of force because there, the focus is not on how consciousness knows itself but on how consciousness is solicited into attempting to situate 6. Kazimir Malevich, The Non-Objective World, trans. Howard Dearstyne (Chicago: Theo- bald, 1959), 68. This passage is cited by Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1983), 289, as part of her effort to show that Malevich was influenced by discourse about that fourth dimension. I am persuaded that Malevich knew about the fourth dimension and used it as one metaphor for this ideal of "liberating non-objectivity." From my perspective, however, invoking the fourth dimension is simply one way of talking about some "other" to extensional understanding. For me, and I think for Malevich, Mondrian, and Picasso, the specific metaphors used are less important than the underlying logic that enables one to characterize the tilt into nonobjectivity. That task is better served by Hegel than by Leonide Ouspensky, if only because Hegel also sought to show how elaborate value structures could be based on a concrete version of the supersensible as simply what could not be handled adequately within languages devoted to the sensible. 7.

I will not try to follow all the turns of Hegel's argument, especially when he gets into the complexities of contradic- tions between identity and nonidentity and when he sets up his idealist ontology in which force and spirit prove identical. I want only to make clear, historically and analytically, how the general outlines of Hegel's thinking help clarify aspects of the concept of force that influence the arts and should inform theorizing about them.</page><page sequence="11">Altieri / The Concept of Force 201 itself within the world of appearances that its own activity renders incom- plete and problematic. On this level of Hegel's story, there need be no talk of absolutes or even of the dialectical interplay of substance and spirit. Here, Hegel offers only an account of those demands and embarrassments that both torment and fascinate consciousness as it seeks to locate its fundamental relations to the sensual world. Let me now trace the basic movements in Hegel's discussion of force so that the case can create intellectual resonances for Malevich's painting, while the painting provides a concrete image grounding the philosophy's abstract arguments. For Hegel, our most elemental experience of force is as something whose effects are visible in or on the objects of perception but that cannot be the simple object of our attention, since we cannot refer to the force within the same pictorial model we use to refer to the objects. As examples, one might think of electricity or gravity or, more metaphori- cally, of desires and emotions. We can characterize force and even regulate it, but we cannot represent it as force except through abstract formulas. Therefore, any description that wants to preserve the qualities that lead us to speak about force, without reducing these to static pictures, will have to vacillate between phenomenological and explanatory perspectives. That is why Hegel introduces the concept of force only after he has character- ized the kind of knowledge that produces a stable world of perceptions, but before the dialectical energies of self-consciousness enter the picture. In fact, it is precisely because force both invites and repels description that Hegel uses it as his means of shifting from the static unities that conscious- ness establishes to the constant differing from itself that is characteristic of self-consciousness.8 Hegel begins his account of force by insisting that it becomes mani- fest as active resistance to the plenitude of universals put in place by per- ception. Perception depends on universals because it has to work within established categories; it has to see something as only a positive identity (PS, 80). We perceive a light bulb as on or off. But suppose we begin to 8. Here is Hegel's most succinct formulation of how awareness of force modulates into self-consciousness: "This curtain of appearance hanging before the inner world is there- fore drawn away and we have the inner being gazing into the inner world-the vision of the undifferentiated self-same being, which repels itself from itself, posits itself as an inner being containing different moments, but for which these moments are immediately not different-self-consciousness" (PS, 103). This could be Malevich talking about how art's engagement with inner and outer aspects of experience leaves it simultaneously a thing and a nonthing, literal in more than one world.</page><page sequence="12">202 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 ask what produces that difference (or ask what makes us ask about that difference). We cannot answer such questions simply by observing. They move us from a world of objects perceived to one where perceptions are only appearances, only phenomena whose shapes and effects depend on something that cannot be located entirely in the object. Awareness of force, then, makes it impossible simply to treat the object as an isolated, self-sufficient particular. Force acts on the object, rendering it passive in relation to the being of some other reality. In so doing, it also opens the possibility that this object has kinship with other apparently independent objects. Once we grasp electricity as a force, even without understanding how that force works, we see that all light bulbs seem to work in the same way by responding to some general feature we now have to add to our sense of what counts as real. Hegel insists on providing an ontology for these relational properties. Thus, force is characterized as gathering "otherness itself, into itself," because it literally gets its identity as the substance of its differences from the universalizing thought perception relies on. Most philosophers would avoid the concept "otherness itself, into itself" because that gives a positive existence to what Hegel's account pre- sents primarily as negative. Hegel, however, takes that risk because he wants to develop parallels between the force that we observe and the forces that are involved in our observing. If we try to understand what underlies the coming on and off of light bulbs at various moments, we have to see ourselves both negating and sublating any model of thinking that is bound only to the particular object. We have to hypothesize some supplemental factors, within and without. Yet, our new account still has to preserve our direct awareness of the specific light bulb. Similarly, we find our relations to ourselves closely paralleling the relation we posit between object and force: We are driven by something we cannot picture, yet it is awareness of our subjection to that "something" that ultimately allows us to bring into one framework the differences our activity generates. We, in effect, are the turned-on lights that have to recognize how we differ from the simple states from which we began. Once the psyche enters, Hegel's account gets even more interest- ing, since there are at least three concrete ways in which the distinctions he generates to handle questions about force in the object world also clarify principles we need for talking about the psyche. First, once consciousness concerns itself with force, what had been objects that simply constitute a world become appearances beneath which some other factors are respon-</page><page sequence="13">Altieri / The Concept of Force 203 sible for the manifest effects. Second, when appearances can no longer be treated adequately by the languages we apply to objects, there emerge questions about expression: What does the appearance make visible that is not suited to purely descriptive languages, and what then is the specific relation between the being that appears and the underlying forces that it makes visible? Third, trying to understand that relation between appear- ance and what underlies it creates often unresolvable concerns about what aspects of the expression are active, that is, controlled by the being, and what aspects show how the being is acted on by some ancillary conditions. Active forces reveal the being for itself, eagerly "soliciting" what might com- plete it, while what seems passive requires our asking how the object plays the role of being solicited as a being for another whose controlling presence we then have to speculate on.9 For example, if our light bulb were to dim, we might have to explain that dimming as caused by the specific condition of the light bulb-its part in the home's specific electrical structures-or as a symptom of some system-wide failure. Human dimming and brightening allows richer possibilities for talk of activity but also requires more suspicion about the actual impact of soliciting forces from without. The interplay of active and passive forces in Hegel's dialectic begin- ning in this chapter becomes far too complex for me to track. Although we probably already have enough background to understand what Malevich is making of his nineteenth-century sources, I want to provide at least some of the flavor of that dialectic. If the light here dims too much, please just skip the next three paragraphs. We have just seen that what seems active as a force in relation to an object can also seem passive as an effect of some more comprehensive system. Hegel insists, however, that there cannot be any simple one-way relation between what he calls the comprehended and the comprehensive aspects of force. For we have to posit a force working through objects and a force working through mind, and we have to see that while mind orga- nizes physical relations, it is these relations that both solicit and influence how the mind develops those organizations. In Hegel's terms, the notion of force "becomes actual through its duplication into two forces" (PS, 85)-the grounding element and the manifest medium of the effect of that ground. Both physical and mental activities function as ground and as medium. We 9. Those speculations can become the means by which the passive being restores the capacity to become a soliciting force, and then the ideas themselves become beings for it. These vacillations admit endless twists and turns that I do not think are relevant here, although my gesture of dismissal makes them soliciting features for a deconstructionist.</page><page sequence="14">204 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 can see the mind determined by the body or the mind giving purpose to what otherwise might give purpose to it. This duplicity creates for each locus of activity the danger that it will seem to lose its particularity as a force because its activity vanishes into the concepts we use to characterize it or into the objects we use to trace its diminishment (such as spirit becoming only body). At the opposite pole, each has the corresponding possibility of actively standing over against concepts or objects by managing to define its own expressive capacities. We can lose the phenomenology of electricity to purely general analyses or to specific accounts of what happens in particular objects, and we can lose the phenomenology of self-consciousness to the satisfaction of dwelling simply within the generalizations that are developed to explain how elec- tricity works. Conversely, there remains the capacity for expression to break through repression-either in sudden glimpses of why we are fascinated by electricity or why we are fascinated by our own processes of thinking on the topic.10 Hegel's richest concrete speculations on this interplay of active and passive, of phenomenological and structural, take place when he turns to discussing how attention to force leads necessarily to the positing of laws. Laws offer a mode of universalization quite different from those of percep- tion, since a law is not simply a category for particular objects but a way of giving objectivity to relations among objects. Law is "the stable image of unstable appearance" (PS, 90). By postulating laws, we produce sameness out of the play of difference. Even when the eye sees only differences, the mind can register underlying identities because of how the differences par- ticipate in the same structural necessities. Law, then, does for objects what the concept of force does for brute change: It regularizes flux into deeper structures, and it creates the possibility that knowledge itself extends be- yond appearances. Law makes force one thing rather than many. But this unity is at best an incomplete one, because the concept of law is not sufficiently attuned to the variety that it represses."1 So the very unity law brings opens the 10. This sentence is my attempt to make sense of the following Hegelian passage: "The soliciting force, e.g., is posited as a universal medium, and the one solicited, on the other hand, as Force driven back onto itself; or is it really the latter that is the soliciting force for the other and is what makes it a medium . . . The external, soliciting Force appears as a universal medium, but only through its having been solicited by the other force to do so" (PS, 84). 11. I am leaving out of my account Hegel's brilliant analysis of how law must undergo a splitting that parallels the one between soliciting and solicited force. We can state this</page><page sequence="15">Altieri / The Concept of Force 205 way to further division. Spirit finds itself having to account not only for how law relates to its objects but also how it both creates and is created by subjects. Law seems to capture what is the "within" of appearance, but its abstractness itself also becomes an appearance. That appearance in- vites our seeking another "within," but this within turns out to be another manifestation of force, since whatever seems to underlie our attributions of lawfulness has the same dynamic and ungraspable relation to universals that force does in its simpler manifestations. All this is beginning to seem too intricate to be useful. But Hegel's greatness lies largely in the moves he makes precisely when that charge seems most impending. For at this point, his dialectic can show that this very force we are trying to locate turns out to clarify the fundamental dynamics of what is involved in consciousness becoming conscious of itself. Conscious- ness has to see itself caught up in this logic of appearance and otherness. Within its workings, however, there does emerge a law that can actually capture necessity because the law generalizes the very form of the process of self-consciousness that is emerging-namely, "that like becomes unlike and unlike becomes like" (PS, 96). Whatever consciousness grasps it in- verts, turning force into concept and law, and casting those universals back into the play of forces that constantly solicit them. Consequently, this figure of and for self-consciousness makes it clear why all the movement that force produces requires our going beyond ap- pearances, yet leaves us incapable of going through those appearances to some higher reality. We need self-consciousness to locate those forces most emphatically not reducible to appearances, since its motions escape tension in two ways. First, there is not one law but always many: The general law does not give a unity of specific laws but "leaves out their specific character." The unifying law must always be supplemented by specific ones it cannot quite contain in their specificity. Hegel's example is the relation between the general law of attraction and any specific set of practical principles such as the laws of electricity or of gravity (PS, 91), but I think even practical matters of jurisprudence manifest the same problem. The particular law is not clearly contained by any determinate chain from only one set of more comprehensive principles. Second, as a consequence of this multiplicity of law, there is no stable way, at this level, for understanding where the necessity lies that the law attributes. Clearly, the notion of law gives consciousness self-certainty, since the positing of law makes it pos- sible for reflective spirit to see itself producing unity for different manifestations of force. But law also has its solicited dimension as well as a soliciting one, so consciousness wobbles between seeing itself as the ultimate substance or seeing itself as completed in something beyond itself. Scholars may explain the world, or, as Daniel Dennet sug- gests somewhere, they may be mere sememes that libraries generate so as to reproduce themselves.</page><page sequence="16">206 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 the very laws that they seem to make possible (PS, 87-88). So self-con- sciousness can have certainty of itself because of its capacity to provide form for force, and, through that, to feel its powers to make attributions about a supersensible. Yet, this supersensible need not be trapped in the same static world as Kant's transcendental reasoning, because whatever force consciousness feels must remain tightly wound into the structure of appearance. Any other force called up by consciousness will soon be re- vealed as empty, or merely mystical, because it is not situated within what actually solicits consciousness. Reflecting on the relation between force and self-consciousness leads us to realize that the supersensible is entirely immanent-not the other of appearance but an other within appearance that allows us to formulate the concept of "appearance qua appearance" (PS, 89). Rather than dwelling beneath appearances, the supersensible consists in the mind's simultaneous sense of its bondage to appearance and its freedom to bring our values and causes within a world that now on one level exists for consciousness, hence as appearance.12 Hegel's qua, in other words, is inseparable from Malevich's tilt. Con- sciousness feels itself as the point of transfer between appearance and appearance seen as appearance, and hence as involving complex rela- tional dependencies on what makes appearance different from perception. Self-consciousness emerges as the awareness of the interplay of negative and reconstructive powers that enable us to appreciate those relational de- pendencies and treat them as complex balances. In one dimension, the tilt is a simple occurrence, almost a whimsical variation manifesting the simple force of change. But in the very process of registering this effect, the paint- ing also establishes a supremely confident moment of self-consciousness that both defines the need for new coordinates and comes to appreciate the overall relational structure that this gesture creates. Solicited by the shift from object to appearance, self-consciousness can explore its own solicit- ing powers until they become their own opposite, solicited by the painting's sense of contact with something that seems more capacious and structural 12. Once again, Hegel's specific formulation deserves careful attention that I cannot give in my argument: "Infinity, or this absolute unrest of pure self-movement, in which whatever is determined in one way or another, e.g. as being, is rather the opposite of this determi- nateness, this no doubt has been from the start the soul of all that has gone before, but it is in the inner world that it has first freely and clearly shown itself. Appearance, or the play of forces, already displays it, but it is as 'explanation' that it first freely stands forth; and in being finally an object for consciousness, as that which it is, consciousness is thus self-consciousness" (PS, 101).</page><page sequence="17">Altieri / The Concept of Force 207 within appearance than individual self-consciousness. What emerges as agency now is inseparable from a mediating process that it can no longer pretend to control. 3 Providing an intellectual context for reading one Malevich painting does not a theory make. So it is time that I turned to that larger project- if not to construct a full theory, then at least to indicate how the concept of force might make a difference in our discourse about the arts. My direct model will remain abstract painting, but I will extend the discussion to ex- plore more general implications for how we locate expressivity in art, for how we can attribute a distinctive ontology for the objects we frame as art, for how we link art to the world, and for how we understand the role of theory. In making these cases, I will presuppose on the last of these topics by characterizing my own process in Hegelian terms. I see theory in the arts not as high-level explanation but as the phenomenological thickening of appearance so that we ultimately find the qua of appearance charged with intellectual resonance. Rather than place particulars within categories, this perspective uses generalization to suffuse those particulars with meanings that give self-consciousness both peace and substance. My first claim is my most general, potentially least contentious, and probably my most important. Hegel makes clear why any work of art, per- haps any particular we come to value, cannot be treated entirely in descrip- tive or pictorial terms. One must capture the tension between force and objects of perception, and, consequently, one must preserve the dynamic relation between appearance and some constitutive other to the object that emerges when it becomes seen as appearance. To do that, theory has to introduce concerns for expressiveness, concerns that require attending to relations among what is hidden and what is manifest, to the play of soliciting and solicited features, to the work of postulating universals or laws and the recognition of their limitations, and to the intricate ways that these various aspects fold into and out of one another. Such concerns are basic to any theory of expressiveness. Hegel makes possible a distinctive theory because he deals with such elemen- tal features of expressivity that we need not rely on specific psychological hypotheses. Perhaps more important, this focus on elements links Hegel to Emmanuel Levinas's concerns for an otherness that is fundamental to eliciting human responses (without requiring Levinas's conclusions). Ex-</page><page sequence="18">208 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 pressivity is not simply a matter of how agency is deployed or how emotions are made manifest: Expressivity remains a relational structure between something not statable and necessarily incomplete efforts to frame what appearance manifests. The best way to bring out the value of basing the analysis of ex- pressivity on Hegel's treatment of force is to develop a contrast with the far more influential Kantian analysis of the immanence basic to the ap- pearance (Schein) constituting aesthetic objects. For Kant, artworks matter because they are radically particular and yet give pleasure in a mode that can be called judgment because the pleasure appeals for universal assent. This radical particularity stems from "purposiveness without purpose," that is, from marks of a shaping intelligence that cannot be successfully sub- sumed under any concepts, and hence that manifest a genius giving the rule to art. From Kant on, then, positive accounts of immanence in artworks have emphasized the work that psychological, formal, or interpretive intel- ligences do in giving shape to inchoate worlds. Such assumptions have bound theory to a fairly narrow range of evaluative principles, such as those stressing complexity or intricate unity, in part because the principles make it extremely difficult to talk directly about emotions and about how audiences are positioned and acted on. Analogously, the Kantian line of argument entails treating all struggle that matters in a great work as part of the author's plan rather than as resis- tances from the material or from contradictions the author refuses to face. There have been strong objections to this Kantian position, of course, but for the most part they derive from psychoanalytic criticism (which has trouble dealing with art as art) and from a rhetoric of common sense or a set of oppositional claims that still rely on the binaries Kant set up. Those binaries prove most destructive in their impact on theory's efforts to account for the emotional component of aesthetic engagement because they force us to place everything we cannot locate epistemically or purposively in the object as dimensions of pure subjective response. Similarly, when Kant's stress on authorial intelligence is challenged, it is done so by reducing artworks to semiotic weavings that critics fit into various allegories that subordinate internal energies within the work to the critic's rhetorical situation.13 13. When Jacques Derrida finally turned to theoretical accounts of art, he kept a Kantian notion of purposive agency in the form of an ideal working signature, even though other writings of his, such as Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question, trans. Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), are very much in the spirit of Hegel's work on force.</page><page sequence="19">Altieri / The Concept of Force 209 Hegel allows us a very different view of expressivity. From this per- spective, specific works can be seen as embodying an interplay between force and appearance that does not reduce force to intelligence or nature quite to either heteronomy or lawfulness. Instead, expressiveness becomes a very general condition that occurs whenever there are concrete manifes- tations of force working within and against appearance. Yet, not everything that is excessive in relation to perception has this expressive dimension. Expressivity enters when the sense of underlying force has a persistence and pervasiveness that tempts us to bring to bear the regularities that law produces but that also opens routes of resistance to such law. Expressivity, therefore, pervades appearance without being translatable either into per- ceptions or into concepts, and without being simply equatable with human agency. Its power lies in the concreteness of its embodiment, combined with a suggestiveness about the configurations that can underlie it, as if the spe- cific appearance held the key to what in experience can be generalizable yet resistant to concepts. Clearly, this approach to expressivity cannot be used as a defini- tion of aesthetic experience. But while Hegelian expressivity cannot explain why we assume aesthetic attitudes, it can help a great deal in clarifying why such attitudes are so well attuned to certain features of experience. Expressivity enables us to explain how we can be moved as we keep our attention focused on internal relations within works of art, and it situates intelligence so that authorial agency is dramatically engaged within the so- licited/soliciting dialectic that force sets in motion. Because intelligence is situated in relation to what it does not control, we understand why works of art can offer exemplary ways of thinking and feeling in relation to those conditions. If we compare expressivity in art to expressivity in natural settings, it seems clear that, in the latter, what at first catches our attention as an ex- pressive particular eventually yields to some concept or some law. Think of noticing mysterious tracks, or imagine geologist Charles Lyell trying to figure out how rocks carried signs of their own historicity. But when the expressivity involves human analogues or emotional projections, in art and in life, the manifestation of force depends on the constant tension between the desire to bring the whole under some rule and the fascination that occurs when we attend to how the particulars refuse that rule. What could be merely an instance of some category emerges instead as a particular charged with an immanence overdetermining which laws might seem appropriate. And then we have some basis for a nonidealist model of autonomy based</page><page sequence="20">210 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 simply on the fact that what remains immanent retains greater power to characterize the particular than does any more general framework. Appear- ance reasserts its rights precisely because of the particular way in which its status qua appearance seems irreducible. Modernism made this status qua appearance the basis for its claims about art as an embodiment within the work rather than as an interpretation of what the work gestured to beyond its manifest particulars. Consequently, the most important descriptive elements stressed in my Hegelian account have found places in the work of contemporary theorists. Nelson Good- man's Languages of Art, for example, provides a very useful model for cap- turing the semantic force within appearance by describing expressions as metaphorically exemplifying what they refer to: A face expresses a person's sadness because it possesses attributes of what it also refers to.14 Richard Wollheim offers a more subtle version of Goodman's formulation by treating entire works of art as expressing "an internal condition by corresponding to, or being of a piece with it."15 But I think we need Hegel to complete the picture, because these theorists do not give a very good account of what we can attribute to this internal condition, and hence they cannot adequately develop the values that may be at stake in our concerning ourselves with this immanent relation between what is manifest and what it expresses. At one pole, the theory of expression is primarily formalist, stressing with Kant and Schiller the purposive play by which the art object comes to appear. Here, the appropriate values derive from our engagement with the authorial activity. At the other pole, philosophers such as Wollheim treat the appearance as yielding some kind of distinctive knowledge. Thus, for Woll- heim, "artistic expression is invariably expression of an internal or psycho- logical condition."16 In subsequent work, he finds the underlying causal force in the artist's fantasy life, which in turn can be clarified by psychoanaly- sis. Wollheim skillfully avoids equating the meaning of the work with such underlying conditions, but he seems to me trapped in a causal model that will not allow him adequate attention either to how the art works on the fan- tasy or to how the fantasy itself can be positioned in relation to the forces that call it into being and give it power. I think Hegel helps us avoid both poles-formalist and psychologi- 14. Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (India- napolis, Ind.: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968). 15.

Wollheim, The Mind and Its Depths, 154.</page><page sequence="21">Altieri / The Concept of Force 211 cal-because of his more dialectical and more general perspective. For Hegel, expressivity is not simply a fact about some phenomenon but a mode or moment in which the relation between force, appearance, and inade- quate projection of underlying laws plays out constitutive tensions. When we respond to the forceful aspect of a phenomenon, we tend to postulate continuity over time, and that continuity both invites our generalizing and establishes an immanence that qualifies that generalizing. So while it in- cludes both, expressive activity, in art and in life, cannot be reduced either to discourse about ends in themselves or about manifesting internal psycho- logical conditions. Rather, expressivity is better seen as making manifest the working of forces that at once compose the internal dynamic presence of the art and project beyond that presence in ways that problematize indi- viduality by making visible the dependencies and pressures underlying it. So long as the work remains expressive, no sooner does it come into focus as one clear thing than gaps and possible alternative stances begin to emerge. If the work retains any force, that force sets itself against the con- cept and the law, which now come to seem repressive because they are not adequate to the intricacy of the expression. Yet, this resistance to concepts is not simply ideal, not merely a matter of Kantian purposiveness. With only slight exaggeration, we can say that the resistance is material, the product of actual tensions and slippages between efforts to impose intentionality and the continuing pressure of what remains other to, and perhaps even prior to, the purposive intelligence. As Hegel put it, the law claiming to be within the object becomes itself an appearance for which we seek another "within." Hegel offers, then, a powerful minimalist, nonpsychological, and pro- cessual (if not entirely dialectical) account of expressive particularity. His thinking enables us to locate expressive particularity simply in the ways that a phenomenon establishes systemic, but not systematic, resistance to its own status as pure perceptual appearance. We honor distinctness of force by recognizing a persistent excess not reducible to either sensible appear- ance or framing universals. This resistance takes positive form as a coloring of details so pervasive and demanding that responding to a phenomenon is kept in continual tension with interpreting it. Wollheim is right that ex- pressivity is a matter of the signs possessing what they refer to, but he is not sufficiently attentive to the complex shifts that such possession often demands of an audience. Where there is excess beyond what description can fix, there is a temptation to posit laws. But the laws posited tend to be inadequate and hence to send us back to that intricacy of appearance.</page><page sequence="22">212 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 Particulars become dynamic-in themselves as beyond any one law and in concert as forming complex overall appearances that have positive status as the other of the proposed laws. One might take as an example Jasper Johns's targets, which constantly invite the taking of subject positions that aim directly at them but at the same time offer a seductive twinkle, sug- gesting that what seems to be power is really always already solicited by an object that therefore can always evade what it entices. Because Hegel's account is so general that it does not require any specific psychology, the same logic of force in relation to appearance sus- tains an ontological claim crucial for defending modernist art against simpli- fications based on equating it with Greenberg's formalism and also central to recasting how mimesis takes place. Hegel enables us to keep a sense of works as distinctive self-dynamizing objects, yet the locus of such proper- ties is not any special ontology for art but its relation to practices that lead us to dwell on the ways that forces become immanent within the work's deployment of syntactic and semantic energies. This version of immanence opens in two directions-historical and analytic. Historically, it helps us understand why modernist abstraction put such emphasis on form, often while treating form not as an end in itself but as an instrument for deepening existential commitments. In this art, form becomes the means of simultaneously framing perceptions and ex- erting a pressure, suggesting a beyond to what emerges as appearance. Formal tension, then, becomes art's basic vehicle for manifesting the force of force as it keeps polarities such as passive and active, inner and outer, in intricate conjunctions without integrating them in any one static, overall imposed unity. By aligning form so closely to the purely extensional rela- tions of line, plane, and color, this art locates dynamic energies in both the most elemental of perceptions and the most capacious of framing struc- tures, each in soliciting and solicited relations to its counterpart. Thanks to the work of form, we see how the art object can have its vitality through its internal structure of oppositions. This life becomes a literal demonstra- tion of force animating the objects within the painting. It allows the painting to engage the world as a surrogate because it embodies ways that self- consciousness not only reflects a dialectic of like and unlike but actually finds that dialectic constituting its own reality. Finally, form so elemental yet dynamic provides a means of countering the authority of the epistemic-not so much by positing some absolute other to it but by haunting it with posi- tive shared existential states that have only the most minimal significance (perhaps as visual pleasure) within empirical analyses.</page><page sequence="23">Altieri / The Concept of Force 213 We can extend much of what we have been saying about modernist abstraction to more general theoretical claims about the ontology of art. In Western art, at least, it makes sense to treat works as having an internal life created by an interplay between force and object as it engages the mind's awareness of how its activity and certain of its powers are necessary for the full unfolding of that relation. Consequently, force can take the place of Kantian purposiveness. Force sustains a similar sense of expressive par- ticularity without the temptation to reduce the work either to a response aesthetics based on pleasure or to an intentionalism that soon leads to thematic allegories and ethical judgments. Let me try to make this ontological claim as concrete as I can. For Hegel, force depends on a constant tension with appearance. For an on- tology of art, two fundamental levels of this tension prove crucial. The first is a matter of tilt, which provides, in effect, an elemental and abstract model for the difference that expressivity makes when we attribute it to some kind of intentionality. Art has force as art because the object it offers cannot be treated simply as an object but takes on the fascinations of becoming an ap- pearance, a construct that nonetheless maintains all of the manifoldness of objects. What appears not only elicits a sense of underlying forces but also seems inseparable from those forces, as if it were the necessary means of their being manifest as active properties. Kant attributed this complex status to the working of purposiveness: Objects offered aesthetic pleasure when there seemed an underlying intelligence making concrete choices within the work that could not be understood if we tried to connect the choices to determinate concepts. Hence, art as purposiveness requires the corollary notion of genius as the maker through which nature gives the rule to art. For Hegel, however, what gives the rule to art is both more elemental and more complex because purposiveness involves the complex interplay of so- licited and soliciting forces and their relation to projections about law and their undoings. Hegelian situatings of force do not separate art from life and purpose but put art back within the most troubling existential adventures. The second implication of this Hegelian ontology ought now to be obvious. It provides grounds for clarifying what is severely limited in Paint- erlyAbstraction's use of the notion of exemplary agency (a concept that tries to adapt Kant's purposiveness to modernist values). Modernist constructiv- ism does often emphasize the metaphoric implications of the agency that the art syntax both articulates and exemplifies as an active power capable of defining how certain commitments have existential consequences. But constructivism rarely does so in as anthropocentric or as metaphoric a way</page><page sequence="24">214 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 as I imposed on it. In most cases, the agency developed within the art- works is not an isolatable state of conscious activity but an actual placing of consciousness within embodied forces that are not reducible to stan- dard human predicates. Agency emerges within a constant struggle be- tween phenomenology and structure. Surface features both elicit and resist whatever seems to underlie the appearances and give them a definite but unnameable relation to a sense of law and of necessity. For this art, agency itself is not quite human, if we use our received notions of human as a measure. Moreover, this agency is not quite what we can recuperate by concentrating on intentions. Agency here is a rela- tion between intentionality, what impinges on it, and what seems to situate intelligence at a margin of sense where humanity is transformed into some- thing more elemental and less subject to standard human concerns. (Think of Picasso's monster-artists and the way in which surrealism captures the logic of modernism in perhaps too literal a way.) In the best modernist art, and perhaps to some extent in almost all great art, we witness a drama of authorial intentionality at once soliciting and solicited into a process of accommodating itself to processes differing from itself, often on levels so elemental as to modify our very idea of purpose. Conventional theories of intentional agency can explain a Kent but not a Lear, whose affective life is continually altered on its deepest levels by what it makes for itself to confront. Again, Malevich's tilt serves as a good example. It is clearly a figure for intentionality and agency, since its action transforms the static into the dynamic, and the extensional into the transcendental. This model of agency, however, does not suffice to emphasize the ways in which this tilt becomes an emblem for the very force that intentionality brings into an otherwise objective world. Malevich wants whatever human agency is to be entirely embodied in this elemental form, so that intentionality takes on dimensions, dependencies, and relations to chance that humanistic versions of it ignore. In fact, if we bring in the metaphoric register of agency here, and it is dif- ficult not to, we have to see intentionality as fundamentally caught up in a constant process of internal differing that both evokes self-conscious identi- fications with the tilt and binds that self-consciousness to simple extensional factors that resist all its human modalities. Black Square and Red Square has the force it does because everything that constrains abstract relations to pure appearance at the same time insists that appearance is only a stage on which other principles manifest their indecipherable clarities. Analogously, Johns's targets are not simply plays on the immedi-</page><page sequence="25">Altieri / The Concept of Force 215 ate relation between aiming and being aimed at. There is also a constant shifting of overall ontological planes, one establishing the design as a lit- eral target, the other transforming the object into a formal register where its flatness enters into dialogue with its abstract expressionist predecessors. These predecessors felt they had to project a psychological causality for their work, so that its vacillations between substance and spirit could all be attributed to heroic existential virtues. Their emphasis on heroic directness could not handle what remains resistant to the authorial will, in art or in life. Johns, on the other hand, offers a much simpler surface, but through that, opens more intricate ways of visualizing the margins between the psyche and what we have to call not its objects but its objectifications. These approaches to expressivity and to the ontology of the work of art still leave unanswered the crucial question of how the values attributed to aesthetic experience have implications for the world beyond the work. No stress on immanence within the work can satisfactorily address critiques of formalism unless it can face that question. We need, then, a third basic claim for the roles that a concept of force can play for aesthetic theory- this time in relation to how audiences are modified by the kinds of self- reflexive experience that art invites. In Painterly Abstraction, I argued that modernist abstraction takes on force within the world because of the ways that it directs its audience to take self-reflexive stances attending to where the work positions them as they engage it. Artworks compose sites that take on reality through our awareness of what happens to us when we in- habit them. What happens to us ranges from having our attention modified and our views changed in relation to how we see the world to altering how we understand the needs, wants, and capacities we attribute to ourselves. Mondrian invites us to build on the dynamic balances he composes so that we get a sense of what lies beyond tragic individualism; Malevich trans- forms the very elemental conditions that are basic to feeling who we are as individuals. My version of self-consciousness was too abstract, however. For the most part, I have discussed how we view ourselves but not how we find our- selves solicited to certain views of the self-in part by the artist's rhetorical power and in part by the force that the work comes to possess. My par- ticipant audience was an audience of intellectuals, whose sense of identity depends on specifying where they stand. Hegel's example now makes me want to insist on the terror and sublimity that emerges when the audience cannot quite establish that encompassing intellectual framework but finds itself moved in every sense of the term. Participation need not bring clear</page><page sequence="26">216 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 understanding. It is probably richest when it is felt as force-that is, as a tear in the appearances that even self-consciousness produces, so that we know that what we are thinking is not quite congruent with the intensity of what we are feeling, and therefore that the particular has more power over us than we have over it. This demand to admit the otherness of the art- work need not entail the worshipful silence so often postulated at the end of contemporary lyric poems. Hegel's great contribution is that he taught us how to admit otherness and negation as conditions within intellectual life, so they need not produce only passive wonder or purely absorbed self- transcendence. Hegel enables us to talk about the testimonial force that art takes on as exemplary for its audience in terms of a dialectic taking place within the subject. In this dialectic, the subject realizes that it is moved in ways it cannot understand to places it cannot quite map, and it realizes how much it seems modified by its awareness of that movement. This process warrants two claims about the self-reflexive personal power that aesthetic experience offers. First, one can say that much of our aesthetic experience plays the crucial role of simultaneously attaching us to appearance and making us aware of the difference from it through which caring, fearing, and playing-and sharing caring, fearing, and playing-all become sites for imaginative exchanges. Then one can make the additional emotional claim that art becomes part of the world beyond its surface by in- viting an audience to recognize how its sense of itself is modified by the play of wonder and increased understanding that emerges as one comes to see better what is at stake in one's participation. Here, for example, I am trying to show how Hegelian dynamics themselves come to seem plausible ways of seeing the self active in the world because of how they come to life within Malevich's canvas. Or, one could say that Johns's targets transform that idealist version of differing and deferring into a strategic and quiet means of setting a sensual ironist's stance against the melodramatic single-minded intensities of existentialism and its painterly expressionist cousins. How do I know I am right? Or, more generally, what criteria might be invoked to decide whether I am right about expressivity, ontology, and testi- monial audience states, and what further lines of inquiry might be pursued to test competing claims? In true Hegelian form, to answer this question, I have to return to what I had already presupposed when I introduced my theoretical case: One has claims to be right when one manages to flesh out appearances, so that, without losing their phenomenological qualities, they take on explanatory resonance within a discursive framework. Stated this way, the Hegelian case is all too general. Therefore, I want to bring his</page><page sequence="27">Altieri / The Concept of Force 217 thinking on force to bear. Not only does it help us clarify how the phenome- nological and the explanatory can sustain one another, but it also helps elaborate a version of description and assessment not bound entirely to the epistemic frameworks now shaped by empiricist thinking. We need that elaboration in part to escape Hegel himself. For by the end of his Phe- nomenology, Hegel proves himself perhaps the most egregious of epistemic thinkers-all becoming must have its systematic knower, and all potential knowing must have its being. The section on force, however, allows a more supple relation between force and appearance because there he is con- cerned only with how the supersensible takes place within experience, not with how this place is ultimately intelligible as a concrete universal. Early in the Phenomenology, the supersensible has a minimal transcendental force, since all its dynamic capacities are located simply in its making possible our seeing "appearance qua appearance." Even that statement sounds portentous and outdated in its meta- physical speculativeness. But the "qua" here proves quite rich-for both phi- losophy and the arts. It suggests that we distinguish between appearances as they initially strike the senses, and appearances realized qua appear- ance, that is, as immanent manifestations (or Heidegger's "worldliness of the world") making visible entire structures of concern.17 This doubled ver- sion of appearance enables us to understand the supersensible as simply what cannot be contained by our languages for the sensible, yet what seems necessary for how appearance bears immanent meanings and concerns. The supersensible, then, is ultimately consciousness aware of itself as a so- licited and soliciting force pervading, but not displacing, appearance. Even though the emergence of force begins the chain that requires the spirit to see itself differing from itself, Hegel insists that self-consciousness need not be consumed in that differing. Ultimately, it returns to appearance as the re- flexive life of value, care, and meaning that gives appearance its relevance for particular lives.18 17. Heidegger develops this phrase in his "The Origin of the Work of Art," trans. Albert Hofstadter, in Albert Hofstadter, Philosophies of Art and Beauty: Selected Readings in Aesthetics from Plato to Heidegger (New York: Random House, 1964): 649-701. This text is the most relevant text of Heidegger's for the discussion of aesthetic force. 18. Slavoj Ziiek, in The Sublime Object of Ideology (London: Verso, 1990), has recently offered a forceful version of this Hegelian claim about appearances to resurrect Hegelian arguments about historical necessity. Even if 2iek is right, I see no application to retro- spective claims about necessity. For the arts, what matters is not the structuralist Hegel but the phenomenologist.</page><page sequence="28">218 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 I can think of two ways to show why this vision of appearance mat- ters as a model for assessing critical work. On the simplest level, it applies to any domain where particularity is crucial and hence where significance emerges not by subsuming the particular within categories but by fleshing out the values at stake as we come to appreciate better how the particular functions qua particular. On this level, there is a supersensible, because the alternative, the path of pictorial understanding, leads only to subsuming the particulars under categorical frames not suited to their distinctive qualities or even to the possible frameworks within which these qualities might be theoretically elaborated. If there is to be immanent value, or simple focus on immanence as a condition of appearance, we have to bring to bear quite different psychological orientations. Claims have to be tested not for their truth about the object but for what they make visible within its ways of set- ting force in relation to initial appearances, so that in its differing from itself, what appears becomes something to care about for itself. This again begins to sound hopelessly metaphysical, until we think of how different Malevich's tilt becomes when we recognize the force it brings to bear against picto- rial objectivity while complicating and enriching the intricate balance of the surface. My second way of adapting force to questions of criteria is much more general. Theory has to be able to reconcile the competing pulls of the phenomenological stance necessary to keep immanence from becoming a formalism and the fundamentally structuralist orientation that allows inter- pretive consciousness to bring relational schema to bear on that phenome- nology. Hegel the dramatist (opposed to Hegel the epistemic systematic thinker) accomplishes this task by putting a structural intelligence to phe- nomenological ends. That synthesis is not easy. Usually, structuralist think- ing (or any thinking, such as Bertrand Russell's, that prizes structures and distrusts appearances) despises phenomenology, while phenomenology sees itself as an intuitionist alternative to structuralist generalization. But because Hegel's is a phenomenology of spirit, it has to include within phe- nomenology all the structural work spirit does and all the pains spirit suffers from not mastering the structures it depends on. There are substantial domains of experience where phenomenology cannot suffice. Phenomenology has to yield to explanation if the various powers of science are to become available or even if social thinking is to be able to negotiate human differences. However, in domains where it is crucial to preserve the dynamic features of what the mind takes as force, Hegel can serve, perhaps must serve, as an exemplary thinker. For then</page><page sequence="29">Altieri / The Concept of Force 219 we have to know how force breaks with appearance, and we have to know how we know and relate to that break. This means appreciating how we come back from analysis to appearance, but with consciousness aware of its role in giving appearance what significance it has, without losing the phe- nomenological surface. Perhaps most astonishing here is that, seen from this perspective, modernist abstract art turns out to be secular Hegelian- ism, putting a concrete structural intelligence in the service of a projective phenomenology. By rejecting representation, such work refuses the direct habitation of already understood appearances in order to compose imagi- native worlds whose particular working might help establish attitudes that modify general attitudes. 4 To bring the story of modernist experiments with force up to the present, one has to ask a very un-Hegelian question: Why did the revo- lution that modernist art proposed not take place or even enter into any socially powerful dialectic? Yet, once the issues are cast this way, they be- come much too large for me, so I will address only a small part of that larger question: Why has twentieth-century criticism been so strikingly un- responsive to what is most challenging and intellectually groundbreaking in modernist experiments with the notion and nature of force? Or, more concretely, what underlying orientations of critical discourse in the humani- ties make the criticism so impervious to the thematics and aesthetics we have been considering? Part of an answer will involve simple pragmatic concerns. It is hard enough to adapt to new demands on how the eye is deployed, without also having to shift one's ways of thinking about what is at stake in such deployment. We also have to recognize that this new art asked for changes in thinking so deep and so broad that following it would entail rejecting filiations with the epistemic orientations that dominate other disciplines and organize almost all the social practices carried out through critical argument. I exaggerate, but not as much as defenders of current dispensations in criticism may like. Clearly, those who insist on using these artworks as primarily social texts submit the works, and themselves, to values and struc- tures of oppositions based on epistemic orientations. I think one can say the same thing about most versions of formalism, since formalism becomes simply the inverse of knowledge claims. Thus, for Greenberg and his fol- lowers, the primary role of modernism is to codify a mode of aesthetic force</page><page sequence="30">220 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 that is primarily negative when placed in relation to the social order: Art purifies its understanding of its own medium and struggles against kitsch by gaining a self-referential autonomy resistant to democratic society's leveling demands. Greenberg's formalism honors the force of artistic immanence, but only by abstracting it into a separate domain of appearance that is not dialectically linked to a basic phenomenology. This, too, is not news. If I am to demonstrate how much we need substantial shifts in the parameters that contemporary criticism sets for modernist art (and for what they may enable us to say about art in general), I will have to show how epistemic orientations constrain and even blind the most sophisticated contemporary discourse on that work. One section of one essay will not suffice for this case. Yet, I think I can at least indicate how this problematic orientation takes hold and can clarify the consequences it generates by dwelling for a few moments on two quite intelligent books, Daniel Herwitz's Making Theory/Constructing Art and Johanna Drucker's Theorizing Modernism. I will have to oversimplify their overall arguments, but I hope thereby to focus attention on their cen- tral assumptions. Each critic is keenly aware of how modernism struggles against representational aesthetics, and each is subtle in formulating ways that these struggles lead to envisioning artworks as literal presences. But then the troubles begin. For neither critic has a language for evaluating these experiments that is anywhere near as rich or as supple as their de- scriptions-primarily because they develop evaluative accounts of these presences by relying on conceptual oppositions whose power depends on the very epistemic frameworks that the art they are describing sought to re- place. In revealingly different ways, both critics approach modernist notions of embodiment in terms derived from Greenberg's ideals of optical pleni- tude and autonomy. Herwitz continues by other means Greenberg's dream of art offering a site of being free from the ideological warfare and blind habits that govern daily life; Drucker relies on Greenberg's arguments to reduce modernism to ideas of presence and of autonomy whose limitations become means of celebrating poststructuralist alternatives. Both alterna- tives, then, offer no means of taking modernist claims about embodiment as a philosophically challenging way to envision immanence, and both still depend on treating art objects as materials for contemplation rather than as directives for exploring self-reflexive states that begin as subjective but then open into other possible configurations of the individual psyche. Herwitz's case is especially significant, because he certainly does not want to echo Greenberg. Yet, his keen philosophical intelligence is trapped into accepting as its fundamental evaluative framework a transcen-</page><page sequence="31">Altieri / The Concept of Force 221 dental aestheticism very close to many of Greenberg's principles. More- over, Herwitz's particular project seems to allow no alternative. He wants to defend modern and contemporary art against Arthur Danto's influential argument that avant-garde modernism prepared the way for the death of painting by making its visual work inseparable from the theory that oriented and justified it, but how can he do that without idealizing formal objects that have the power to resist theory? To appreciate his dilemma, we need a brief summary of Danto's thesis. Modernist abstraction had to be sanctioned by theory, since its images could not in themselves link to the world in the same ways that representational art specified its links. With Marcel Duchamp, that depen- dency generated a radical reversal of roles: Anything could be made into an artwork just by changing the theoretical framework into which it was put. In Duchamp, there remained an authorial whimsy implicit in the work, but Andy Warhol developed the full logic of this position. Art did not require artifice, genius, or immanent purposiveness; it merely involved a kind of theoretical mouse to do the relevant pointing and clicking. So since anything could be art, art had no specific identity and no cogent claims on artists or audiences. Herwitz does an excellent job of showing why these claims are deeply flawed. But he does not seem to see how much his own positive case is limited by the oppositions he takes on. Herwitz responds to this primacy of theory by theorizing against that primacy rather than by proposing other uses of theory. That move requires him to place value only on those as- pects of art that undercut or resist the claims of theory. He surrenders the modernists' intellectual ambitions to secure their painterly intensities. This is especially unfortunate because Herwitz is very good on mod- ernism's resistance to representation and its reliance on principles of em- bodiment that stress the capacity of formal structure to directly bear "philo- sophical truth."19 His treatment of values of presence in terms of embodiment manages to show, contra Greenberg, that much more becomes visible in such presence than sheer optical values. How, then, can one go on to characterize that "much more," especially without falling into Danto's trap and making the visual effect depend on theory? Herwitz responds to this problem in two basic ways. The first is negative. He tries to isolate what is 19. Daniel Herwitz, Making Theory/Constructing Art: On the Authority of the Avant-Garde (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 5. Hereafter, this work is cited parentheti- cally as MT</page><page sequence="32">222 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 problematic about modernist theorizing and about its effects on the paint- ing. So he insists that modernist theorizing is driven by a desire for certitude subordinating the concrete work to what can clearly be proposed about it by theory. Thus, when he turns to the paintings, he tries to show how, "where the avant-garde norms of transparent rule by theory and immedi- ate theoretical empowerment are in play, there is, therefore, repression" (MT, 303). Hence, he treats Mondrian's insistence that his works "picture the hidden, inner form of life, its true reality" as an instance of Mondrian blinding himself to "the complexity of" his "own example, of its own object" (MT, 303). The most important positive role for criticism becomes facilitat- ing those moments when there emerges simply "the silence of a painter who enjoys nothing more than the pure dedication to spirituality in paint." Thus, "the silent spirituality of a Mondrian painting" manifests "the victory of Mondrian the painter over Mondrian the painter-philosopher, if only for a moment" (MT, 138). Herwitz realizes that the need to be justified by theory is precisely what traps aesthetics within the epistemic order and what leads to claims that art can capture "truths" about putative inner lives. But there is an im- mense distance between that realization and finding alternative positive values. Silent spirituality is, to my mind, not an adequate alternative. In- stead, one has to take seriously an entire set of attitudes made possible by modernist experiments in embodiment. One has to explore the possibility of claiming certitudes based not on how signs refer but on their expressivity- that is, on the capacity of art to deploy energies that place audiences in sites where certain self-reflexive experiences become possible.20 Certitude then becomes conviction that specific works can create experiences that modify overall stances toward the world-not by persuading an audience but by empowering it. Probably the deepest problem in Herwitz's book is that he thinks of theory only in the terms of his own Anglo-American philosophical training. Indeed, if one expects theorizing in the arts to perform the same task as theorizing in an epistemic discipline, where truth claims can be empirically tested, one will find art's appeals to the intellect so embarrassing that the mystifying of silence will always seem the less egregious error. But suppose 20. See MT, 126-28. Herwitz is very good on Mondrian's sense of embodiment as making philosophy literal and demonstrating in matter the truth of spirit. But he apparently cannot bring himself to believe even in the realm of possibilities that Mondrian opens, so he has to withdraw into praising silent spirituality.</page><page sequence="33">Altieri / The Concept of Force 223 that modernist artists are exploring alternative notions of theory, and hence of what counts as philosophical in the arts. Perhaps embodiment is not only an aesthetic ideal but also a philosophical one through which one can challenge the primacy of epistemic values. Perhaps speculation on embodi- ment provides an alternative (now seized on, but also muddled, by theorists of performativity) to the sense that values depend on beliefs that depend on images that in turn are to be assessed for the correspondences they do and do not achieve. Emphasizing embodiment gives aesthetic theory a very different model for how values are created and held, one in which decision is prior to belief and assessment depends on affect and effect as agents attempt to participate in or react to specific manifestations of force. Emphasizing embodiment makes theory itself a means of both dramatizing and characterizing what those manifestations make available. In such theorizing, the ideal of truth is a proleptic one, not a referen- tial one. Theories such as Mondrian's and Malevich's are "true," or, perhaps better, "apposite," to the degree that one eventually sees them as continu- ous with the force of the painting because they extend the predicates one can attribute to one's own conditions as one responds to the work. This mode of theorizing is to art what philosophy is to the Nietzschean hero-the work of a hammer tested by the effects it creates as an instrument for orga- nizing, interpreting, and testifying for specific expressive energies. It would be foolish to let this kind of theorizing and this notion of assessment be our only models. Most action in the world requires epistemic measures, since they afford clear and determinate modes of assessment. Even performative ideals have to include some measure of epistemic concern, since there will be little long-term aesthetic or ethical force for constructions that get their facts wrong (or that rely on silence). However, we cannot fail to distinguish between letting the epistemic play necessary roles and letting it dominate all the discursive formulations we take seriously, even if our intention is to deconstruct them. There have to be overall theoretical models that can deal directly with everything the tilt entails without narrowing its force back into an arena where only descriptions count. Where Herwitz is ultimately haunted by an epistemic order he seeks to escape, my second contemporary critic, Drucker, eagerly includes mod- ernist art within that order, since only by so warping modernism can she make poststructural discourse provide necessary alternatives on three cen- tral topics-"attitudes toward the space.., of modernism as representation, assumptions about the ontology of the object. . ; and theories of the pro-</page><page sequence="34">224 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 duction of subjectivity (from artist and viewer to subject position)."21 Each topic can be easily thematized by her because she makes the clever move of focusing on how "a tradition [for talking about modernism] becomes de- fined through intertextual practice rather than by a review of the original texts and images from a fresh perspective" (TM, 3). Obviously, in such a project everything depends on how the critic reconstructs "tradition." For Drucker, modernist tradition culminates in late modernist formalism.22 This formalism becomes not a departure from mod- ernist intensities but their culmination (as tradition), and it in turn provides the necessary terms on which poststructuralism's deconstructive interests can feast. To work this sleight of hand, she has to isolate those features of modernism that prove compatible with this formalism. This is where the epistemic enters, because she insists that this tradition remains bound to epistemic concerns for truth and for reference. Her line of argument en- tails treating modernist experiments that oppose representational ideals as if they were motivated entirely by a pursuit of the image as sheer presen- tation. For Drucker, modernists conceived presentation as an alternative route to truth: The image reified by embodiment was understood to offer direct access to the real. This same notion of immediacy also sanctions her claim that modernist experiments in agency should be understood under the rubric of autonomy as developed by Greenberg. Both image and agent are understood in accord with the fundamental tenet of formalism-namely, the reliance on the "presumed visual self-sufficiency of the object" (TM, 63). The pursuit of such self-sufficiency manifestly reveals modernism as seek- ing autonomy by escaping the demands of historical referents (TM, 77-78). There is not even a suggestion that autonomy may be an ideal requiring 21. Johanna Drucker, Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 1-2. Hereafter, this work is cited parenthetically as TM. 22. I want to challenge this apparently innocent claim to reconstruct tradition. It is not clear that there is only one tradition of discourses sponsored by and sponsoring mod- ernism. More important, this claim to tradition necessarily stresses continuities rather than discontinuities between late modernist formalism and high modernist constructiv- ism. (Ironically, Drucker's way to celebrate deconstructive themes is to ignore the way the basic organizing structure of her book occludes important differences.) I think it is more accurate to argue that late modernist formalism is part of the modernist tradition only in the way that Billy Graham is part of the traditions of Christian theology. If we are to retain the power that once made traditions worth appealing to, we have to emphasize the contributions of its richest exemplars, and we have to understand the positive reasons that others honored them.</page><page sequence="35">Altieri / The Concept of Force 225 the direct taking of responsibility for how one engages the historical pres- sures, especially those not entirely manifest if one stays confined to a logic of referents. If one is to recapture modernist ambitions, one has to be able to char- acterize what Drucker quite intelligently sets up as modernism's concern for "the espace of the painted canvas" as maintaining "a distinctly autonomous identity" that could not be realized so long as assessing visual truth were a matter primarily of "mere perception" (TM, 46). But the following state- ment summarizes the only values that she can develop by showing how this space differs from the space of representation and how that difference in turn modifies what we can mean by autonomy: The final, important paradox of faith in optical truth or truth which is only representable (and knowable) in visual form, is that it links the image to the "real" as a referent . . . This claim to visual image as primary site dismisses any possibility of even conceiving of the image as a reproduction or surrogate for a visual experience already in existence outside of the frame of the picture's production. ... Such an image is in no way subordinate, according to hierarchies of either form or substance, to any other visual experience. Further such images reify, that is, bring into objective and concrete visual form, that which otherwise passes ephemerally through the culture as lived, but unrepresented, experience. (TM, 45) Notice how Drucker reduces modernist ideals about visual space to the roles that the image can play, and then how "image" is characterized as primarily a privileged means of reference. For her, the means of refer- ence is set in opposition to any acknowledgment of existences outside the frame of picture-production. Moreover, the goal of such images becomes the "reifying" of "that which otherwise" remains unrepresented experience, so modernist art is simply another means of representation. Consequently, all these claims depend on the idea that images present a truth. Even if the means for such presentation is reification rather than representation, this perspective still treats works as if they were to be assessed by what the image manages to objectify by picturing. Modernism then turns out to be benighted: Its emphasis on the "identity of the visual image" (TM, 63) requires correction by a poststructuralist resistance to formalism through "a rhetoric asserting a dynamic process of construction of the ontology of the object" (TM, 62).</page><page sequence="36">226 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 In my view, it is Drucker, or Drucker's epistemic perspective, that is responsible for all the reifying, and responsible, too, for privileging a post- structural version of construction that does not do as much work as the modernist one she distorts. Most modernist art and writing is not satisfied with idealizing the image as a simple presence because it wants also to stress getting audiences to participate self-reflexively in the range and in- tensity of forces that the espace mobilizes and makes manifest. Moreover, modernism is less concerned with "reality" as some abstract entity than with how its constructed images embody actual forces that enter the audi- ence's world. That concern then enables the modernists to give very differ- ent casts than she imposes both to the concept of "autonomy" and to the ideal of bringing "into objective and concrete visual form that which other- wise passes ephemerally through the culture as lived, but unrepresented, experience." For most modernist theory, autonomy is not a matter of separating selves or artworks from life but of making immanent certain forces that claim responsibility for organizing and interpreting a particular intense experi- ence. The ideals of autonomous art and autonomous selves do not stress freedom from the world but self-defining responsibility within it. Drucker cannot reconstruct that modernist faith because of her stress simply on the image, which then sets the artwork over against the world and promises a self-composure that depends on maintaining that distance. If, however, one sees the image as an element within a more comprehensive constructivist aesthetic of embodiment, then the modernist work is never separated from the world. Rather, it is simply a more intensive self-reflexive way of partici- pating in material existence. Optical presence is not an end but a means of eliciting attention to the forces that the eye dramatizes but cannot in itself comprehend. From this perspective, art can become autonomous to the degree that it offers understanding of its own deportment of energies-so long as one also realizes that autonomy is not a metaphysical or psychologi- cal absolute but a relative social term opposed to domination by forces one does not take responsibility for. In fact, once we stress how force is composed in such works, we can see why Drucker is wrong in treating mod- ernist art as pursuing a false claim to objectivity through the image's special referential powers. For modernism, the composition itself constitutes the exploration of how objectivity can be established through what audiences might share in their self-reflexive engagements with the image. And then the "truth" of the work is inseparable from the power it has to modify our</page><page sequence="37">Altieri / The Concept of Force 227 experiences of ourselves as subjects: We find ourselves complexly woven into what must be called transsubjective states, if only for the moments we participate in the work. To test the consequences of my differences from Drucker and to indicate the cost of remaining within the epistemic mode that deconstruc- tion uses as its cast for modeling what it claims to replace, I will close by showing how Drucker simply cannot capture the energies of Picasso's early collages. Like Rosalind Krauss, whom she echoes, Drucker is trapped into having to deal with Picasso through a language based on notions of rep- resentation that are much too static and unidimensional to gain access to the levels of psychic life engaged and interpreted by Picasso's images. For example, the following passage shows how she forces cubism into post- structural concerns that are sharply at odds with ideals of realization that the cubists inherited from Cezanne: "Cubism does not merely demonstrate once and for all that images were mere fictions in their claims to represent the real, Cubism disposes of the real itself and shows it to be only and always available as representation" (TM, 50). Picasso's collages enable me to get at what is problematic here with- out my having to rely on pure noniconic work. Picasso is clearly absorbed by the problematics of representation in ways that noniconic painters evade. But I think he is just as clearly concerned to engage these problematics within a complex play of deconstructive and constructive forces that epi- stemic talk about representation simply cannot engage. (Nor could my own stress on agency in Painterly Abstraction adequately handle this dynamic because it reduced the forces that the mind participates in to the processes of self-consciousness, without sufficient attention to what is strangely im- personal within them.) This is Drucker's basic argument on collage: The collage is both an image of contemporary life and a participant in it: the activity of and within the visual image is concerned with the circulation of information in visual form-rather than about the representation of anything in conventional pictorial terms. ... Thus the image has become an original, not reflective, site for cir- culation of information, for the activity of reification (concretization of the image of modern life) within its operation as a cultural domain. The Still Life with Chair Caning, then, is the place in which the image of experience is made-as the condensed field of fragments of real things, mass produced material, and still life painting in fragmented, newly conceived spatial terms. (TM, 49)</page><page sequence="38">228 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 Drucker sees here that one cannot deal with the status of the image with- out bringing in notions of participation. For her, the only participation that matters is the way that the artwork per se can be said to participate in con- temporary life because of the circulation of images it keeps in motion. This focus affords her access only to the general status of the information that the painting deals with: She cannot ask about the qualities and energies that come to the fore as the conditions framing and interpreting that circu- lation. Consequently, she has to treat the experience of the work as little more than the experience of the objects that make up the image. She can handle what we see but not what we find ourselves doing in such seeing. Because she cannot deal with how the audience is invited to participate, she cannot engage the most emphatic forces organized by the painting- those that present in virtual space the relation between deconstructing ob- jects into their materials and recomposing materials into markers that elicit awareness of how audience synthesis literally composes a world in which imagining is fundamental to what we take as the real. She cannot see how close Picasso is here to Wallace Stevens, on the one hand, and to Wittgen- stein, on the other, since both locate ultimate value in this capacity to feel the real as something imagined, without relying on imagination to compose any alternative worlds. To make good on my claims, I want to look closely at my favorite of these early collages, Guitar, Sheet Music and Wine Glass. In Painterly Ab- straction, I addressed Rosalind Krauss's influential and powerful argument that, rather than considering the collage as having the "ground of percep- tion," and hence "the material support of the image... forc[ing] itself on our perception," we have to stress its deconstructive features. She insists that "in collage the ground is literally masked and riven. It enters our experience not as an object of perception but as an object of discourse, of represen- tation."23 For the collages foreground a process where the signs by which a work represents must differ from and defer what they purport to make present. Ultimately, then, Picasso is showing that art cannot achieve "per- ceptual plenitude and unimpeachable self-presence" because the power to distinguish within this plenitude depends on signs for signs in infinite regress. I argued, instead, that this deconstructive movement is a means not 23. These three quotations are from Rosalind Krauss, "Re-presenting Picasso," Art in America 68 (1980): 93, 93, 96. For my discussion of Krauss, see Painterly Abstraction, 206-9.</page><page sequence="39">Altieri / The Concept of Force 229 an end. The painting does decompose visual presence, but only to drama- tize the powers of synthetic intelligence and artistic will. The guitar does eventually emerge, not as a perceptual given but as the consequence of both the artist's and the viewer's constructive powers. In fact, it is precisely because of that deconstruction that the guitar emerges with an aura, a magical presence inseparable from the feeling that now the guitar is not simply an object but a possession of mind, a construction that gives objects not only existence but also power. This power extends beyond perception to suggest that by making visual a version of physically composing the ob- ject, Picasso, in effect, dramatized for painting a capacity to render its own powers as analogues for the power of music. This guitar exists because of the rhythms and harmonies established by the play among the constitutive elements. More generally, Picasso's collage becomes a powerful example of how high modernist work pursues a version of presence in which the syntax of a work takes on semantic implications by, in effect, embodying for self-reflection both the powers of mind that go into the construction of an object-world and the conative pleasures or senses of self-activity that are inseparable from such construction once we free the mind's activity from a model of representation based on the description of what can be treated as objects. I still think that I am right about this collage, or that I am at least more responsive to its intricacy than is the Krauss reading on which Drucker re- lies. But I want to show how much more we can say if we free ourselves entirely from the debates structured around questions about representa- tion, with their inescapable concerns for issues of reference and origin. In the context of my emphasis here on the concept of force and the critique of epistemic assumptions, art criticism can be much more dialectical and somewhat more precise in its account of collage effects. First, we can see clearly what the crucial task is for the viewer-namely, to reconcile the de- constructive elements stressed by Krauss, whereby identity is intricately problematized, with the reconstructive elements that are activated by our realization that it is precisely such deconstruction that makes it possible to experience the emergence of the guitar as visually present in its virtual state. We can then begin to elaborate this case by exploring the various ways these opposites inhere in one another because of what the composi- tion accomplishes in its refusal simply to paint an image of the guitar, and hence to bind itself to the epistemic register, even if that register had been extended by cubist procedures. Hegel requires me to alter my reading in three fundamental ways,</page><page sequence="40">230 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 each crucial to realizing what is also at stake in the more general task of bracketing epistemically framed questions about art to explore what alter- natives emerge. The first involves uses for the concept of appearance. On its most literal level, Guitar, Sheet Music and Wine Glass plays two levels of appearance against each other-the appearance of material structures that are denied their materiality to be used as signs and the appearance that they constitute when the signs themselves are deployed for their ma- terial properties as signs. Dramatically, then, Picasso brilliantly enacts the dialectical relation between force and appearance: Initial appearances are overdetermined by some set of forces that turn out to make it possible for us to experience appearance as appearance-that is, appearance felt as event and understood in terms of what is producing the effects we are responding to. In this regard, Picasso does Heideggerian work without Heideggerian pomposity. The second way force modifies my reading brings us to the limit of Heideggerian aesthetics. I was not wrong to stress the force of will in my treatment of Picasso: One might say that the phallus is never far from his surfaces. But because Picasso's will is set against any demands coming from the world, that is, from how things can be said to impose an order on us, we enter here an imaginative situation that cannot be handled in terms provided by Heidegger's concern for realization and for the capaci- ties of the work to bring us to a new sense of what it means to dwell in that world of objects. Yet, we also have to be careful not to characterize that re- sisting willfulness in debased Nietzschean terms as simply a psychological assertiveness whose sources can be analyzed and effects judged in ethical terms. Guitar, Sheet Music and Wine Glass tries to make visible specific qualities of the synthetic force to which it testifies, and, in so doing, it de- mands a more complex psychology than our interpretive languages usually bring to bear. The most concrete way to treat the force of will in Picasso's painting is to dwell simply on the surface. There, the painting offers two compet- ing, but ultimately complementary, levels. One level is the realized image in virtual space; the other level is the insistently real-that is, sculptural- play of textures and forms by which that illusion is realized. This means that any account of the painting has to explain what Picasso thinks he gains by having the surface textures serve as the elements composing the virtual image or idea that organizes the painting. I think we can get at some of this complexity by returning to Hegel's work on soliciting and solicited forces. The Heideggerian and romantic story casts will as solicited by the object</page><page sequence="41">Altieri / The Concept of Force 231 that it then helps to realize. Picasso seems to reverse that hierarchy. There is a soliciting object, but it is not the visual guitar. Rather, what solicits is already a construct, an idea of facing the challenge to compose a guitar so that even its musical effects can be visually embodied. Emphasis is put on the way in which the artist's materials themselves do not so much constrain will as extend it, as if they were also active vehicles for imaginative play. Consequently, the painting stages a drama in which will as a conscious ac- tivity and will as a force solicited by possibilities now in the painting rather than primarily in the world engage in dialogue about the possibilities of con- structive energies: What begins as simple will, the work of negation in the process of the artist redefining the use of his materials, composes a sub- stance that then alters the very condition of willfulness. For we literally see how the negative becomes a positive in the construction of a virtual image, then how the virtual image seems to provide metaphoric possibilities con- cerning the music of the guitar, which demands another level of will, this time a will opened to the effects of what lies mysteriously within the artis- tic process. Will as a negative force and will as a purposive activity here buckle, producing a concrete situation in which will seems invited to con- sider its violence and its own synthetic powers as only aspects of a very complex process. Initial negative force that remains as a shaping power seems also capable of dwelling "slowly and with meditation" on the diffuse musical accompaniment that seems the odd, but irresistible, complement to this recasting of sense. It seems, then, that what began as an Ezra Pound verbal collage could transform itself into the lush willfulness of a Wallace Stevens rhetorical site. So where Cezanne's and early cubist versions of realization were de- voted to making us appreciate what is involved in the visibility of the visible, the dynamic process embodied within Picasso's collages seems instead to stress what we may call "the willability of the will." For here we observe what begins in negation coming to dwell on how the means for willing bring into the world their own substantial music. Will itself brings all the plea- sures of embodiment because it can make visible its own capacity to make its solicitations solicited. The self-defensive author of Painterly Abstraction could call this still a modification of the notion of agency. But that emphasis places the resolution in the authorial compositional agent rather than in the redefinition of what will can be, for which the painting itself provides the only compelling testimony. Finally, all my claims depend on the version of aesthetic immanence that I am arguing Hegel allows us to put in place of Kantian aesthetics.</page><page sequence="42">232 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 Picasso's collage simply is a testimonial embodiment of what may be at stake were we able to concentrate on certain transformative aspects of force that it asks its audience to participate in. The work still cannot be consumed by any of the purposes that Kant fought off with his concept of purposiveness without purpose. Yet, our valuing of it need not make any claims about knowledge or about any supersensible except a quite literal effort to complicate what the senses are asked to do. Ultimately, painting is an art of appearance. But appearance only begins in perception. Great painting is about various kinds of forces that become visible within appear- ance and that position the audience to participate in those appearances as if they were luminous and hence testimony to what might be predicable of those forces. In Giotto, the testimony is to what art can celebrate through its participation in Christian incarnational values; in Rembrandt, the testi- mony is to what comes to appear as the underlying pressures on faces and gestures; in Van Dyck and Reynolds, art testifies to the social embodiment of breeding and authority that comes to pervade appearances; and finally, with modernist abstraction, the forces participated in become so elemental that they also have claims to reach levels of possible universal agreement not warped by ideological differences. In this modernist dispensation, paint- ings can serve as representatives for shareable states, because the wills they embody cannot be justified by any psychological story beyond the spe- cific states of being that the paintings make visible. Our ultimate task in responding to these wills is to find ways that philosophy can make use of those demonstrations without becoming paralyzed over demands to explain how we know what we claim. As Gertrude Stein almost put it, composition in the place of explanation is also a cultural force worth reckoning with.</page></plain_text>
