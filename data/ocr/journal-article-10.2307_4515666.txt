<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNGLAZED RELIEF POTTERY FROM NORTHERN MESOPO- TAMIA * BY GERALD REITLINGER THE FIRST STYLE BEFORE THE EVACUATION OF THE BRITISH Museum collections in I939, there stood for generations a highly mysterious object in wall case No. 34 of the Babylonian gallery. Num- bered gI8.950, it is a corpulent gray unglazed jar, more than two feet high and provided with four handles (Fig. 3). It is decorated in a mixture of molded and hand-modeled re- lief with a frieze of four saucer-eyed female figures in long skirts, and two long-necked bird- headed monsters. *The style of these figures is not unworthy of the jar's long sojourn in the Babylonian gallery, yet as an object the jar is unlike anything Babylonian. There have always been doubts about it. It is not even known where it came from or how it reached the British Museum. Botta or Layard may have discovered it in the eighteen-forties at * First and foremost, I must express my deep obligation to the Directorate General of Antiquities of the Government of Iraq, particularly the Directors Naji Al Asil Bey and Mr. Seton Lloyd. To Mr. Selim Levy of the Department, I owe the ex- cellent photographs he has taken and the inventory notes. Such genuine enthusiasm for the publication of their material does the greatest credit to the crea- tors of one of the world's most recent museums, the Arab Museum in Baghdad. I must also thank Dr. R. Ettinghausen for as- sembling much photographic material of objects in the United States and for other important informa- tion. I must thank Dr. Henry Field for the use of photographs of objects in the Chicago Museum of Natural History and of objects seen by him at Sindiar. Acknowledgments are also due to H. Kevor- kian, Esq.; to A. S. David, Esq., of Sunnyside, Long Island; to the Metropolitan Museum of New York; to the Louvre, Paris; and to the Islamic Department of the State Museums, Berlin, the last with the sin- cere hope that the object I have reproduced is still in their keeping. Khorsabad or Nimriud, but if so, there is no record. Archeologists were not concerned with the stratification of pottery for another half century. It may even have come out of Meso- potamia before the days of excavation.' When Sufak al-Faris, sheikh of the Shammar, was beseiging the town of Takrit on the Tigris in I834, the inhabitants unearthed a number of huge jars with figures of men and animals, while digging a defense-work. One jar was acquired by Dr. J. Ross of the Baghdad resi- dency while on his journey to the ruins of Hatra.2 It passed successively into the hands of Commander Felix Jones and Henry Rawlin- son, the British Museum's great benefactor. The present jar may or may not be Dr. Ross's jar but we know now that the jars unearthed in the seige of Takrit were certainly of this kind. The strange British Museum jar slum- bered in the Babylonian room till the second World War. It was not unique. There were fragments in the same style in the Louvre's Babylonian deposits,3 but even nineteenth- century savants doubted whether they were Babylonian and tended to call them Parthian. When more fragments with saucer-eyed fig- ures and bird-headed monsters were found at Assur toward I9IO, there was already reason to believe that they were more recent still. In I907 Sarre and Herzfeld had visited Takrit and investigated its historical associa- 1 F. Sarre-E. Herzfeld, Archaologische Reise im Euphrat- und Tigris-Gebiet (Berlin, I9I I-20), I, 223. 2 J.

Several more frag- ments came into their hands in Takrit, and Herzfeld sketched a whole jar, almost the double of that in the British Museum's Baby- lonian room.4 Their most significant discov- ery, however, was made in the Baghdad ba- zaar where Sarre bought the large jar which he presented to the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. This jar is clearly a near relation of the one in the British Museum (Fig. 9), but it has an inscription in Arabic characters of the "fifth or sixth centuries of the Hijra." Now in I90o Sarre had written a paper concerning four fragments from large jars in molded and barbotine relief, but of a more elaborate kind. They were said to have come from Mosul, and Sarre dated them in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D.5 Thus the jar acquired in Baghdad linked the primi- tive-looking jar from the Babylonian gallery of the British Museum with the magnificent pottery decoration of the high Middle Ages. The British Museum jar could now be con- sidered Islamic rather than Parthian, but it was still hard to date it. In I9II-I3 more fragments, showing the same peculiar frieze of women and monsters, were found in the German Samarra excavations. Buried in the Abbasid city and palaces, they could scarcely be older than the ninth century. The early excavators, who thought these things Baby- lonian, had been deceived by Mesopotamian conservatism into an error of a millennium and a half. Though this pottery had once been consid- ered Babylonian, its later development was so surprisingly different that to many students of forty years ago it could not have been native to the Tigris valley at all. It must have been an importation from Central Asia, 4Sarre-Herzfeld, op. cit., IV, I3. 5 F. Sarre, "Islamische Tongefaisse aus Mesopota- mien," Jahrbuch der Koniglich Preussischen Kunst- sammlungen, XXVI(1905), 69. as announced by Martin Hartmann and Josef Strzygowski. Sarre, however, continued to defend his theory of indigenous development and production. In I920, when many more specimens were available, he saw no cause to revise his views of I905. Today the rare pieces of I905 have become quite common. My list contains more than forty complete or half complete jars and there must be very many unrecorded. A new analysis is therefore not inopportune. The subjects of this article are the large water cisterns or coolers of porous clay, of a type still used and known as habbs, but the field is restricted to the highly decorated medieval kind on which molded, barbotine, and incised ornament are combined. Medieval unglazed pottery, showing each of these sorts of ornament, is so abundant in Iraq as to require more than a short monograph and to narrow down the scope of the present one to the combined ware alone. This combined ware occasionally embraces not three but four proc- esses. In Figures 2 and 9, for instance, there may be seen a band of ornament, cut in the soft clay in imitation of woodwork. German archeologists call it kerbschnitt, or chip-carv- ing. But undoubtedly the most striking feature of the ware is the ornament, applied to the surface in wet clay either by hand or with a pipette-like the icing on a cake. This is the barbotine process, and the North Mesopo- tamian habbs are sometimes described as bar- botine pottery. I prefer not to use this descrip- tion because other techniques are involved and because barbotine pottery in the Middle Ages was not restricted to Mesopotamia. It was made throughout the Islamic world, from Central Asia to North Africa. The best defini- tion is: "North Mesopotamian unglazed ware in molded and barbotine relief." The com- bined technique may be as old as the ninth century and it lasted as late as the fourteenth. The color and texture of the ware did not</page><page sequence="3">UNGLAZED RELIEF POTTERY I3 change in five centuries. By contrast, the style changed absolutely. On a large number of the pieces that have survived, the primitive Babylonian figures merge with the "Central Asian" look of the later pieces sufficiently to form a distinct intermediate style which I shall call Style II. This and the fully developed, or Style III, style can be dated by their close relation to other Islamic objects. Already forty-two years ago, Sarre was able to place them where they belong in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. But the dating of the earliest style, Style I, presents great difficulties. Little internal evidence is provided, since the art was so humble and traditional as to go its way ignoring the march of fashion. Interpretation is equally difficult. Take, for instance, Figure 3, the jar or habb in the British Museum. In the i908 Guide to the Babylonian collection,8 Budge and King rec- ognized it as "post-Assyrian." "Around the sides in relief are figures of snakes with feet, duck-headed dragons, and figures of snake charmers." But Sarre describes the subject as follows: 7 "Two birds (geese?) which hold a ribbon-like branch in their beaks and four female figures, standing side by side linked together with ribbons which frame the upper part of their bodies. With elbows bent out- wards, the women have their hands folded before their breasts. The origin of these fig- ures is clear. They are imitations of ancient Oriental Goddess-figures representing Nin- mach or Ishtar who were depicted in similar positions." Sarre's theory of origin rests on the attitude of the figures. Yet in a notice dated I922 8 he described the attitude quite differently. The women, he said, were pour- o British Museum, A Guide to the Babylonian and Assyrian Antiquities (London: 2d ed., I908), p. II6, No. I609. 7 Sarre-Herzfeld, op. cit., IV, I3. 8 F. Sarre, Die Kunst des alten Persien (Berlin, I922), p. 56. ing the water of life which also issued from the beaks of the birds or dragons. Referring again to Figure 3, it will be seen that, if this is the water of life, it is coming from the women's elbows, for it is plain that their hands are folded under their breasts. Figure 6 shows a similar confusion as if medieval tradition had muddled two distinct attitudes. I am in- clined to think that these zigzag wands, Sarre's bandartige Rahmen, are not consciously sym- bolic of water but merely an easy way of using the pipette, the way it is used in pastry. The zigzag wand is common in all early Islamic barbotine ware. Outstanding examples of it are found on the big blue-glazed oil jars from Samarra, Susa, and Shapur.9 Sarre offered no symbolical explanation for the animals which Budge and King called "snakes with feet" and "duck-headed dragons." He sug- gests they are geese. But if the figures repre- sent Ishtar, why should not this be Sirrush, the long-necked beast depicted on the Ishtar gate in Babylon? The attitude of the Baby- lonian Ishtar remained unchanged at least as late as the Palmyrene sculpture of the third century A.D. Moreover the Parthian Ishtar of Babylon was sometimes a draped figure wearing the long and decorous garment sug- gested in this medieval pottery.'0 But the hands remained below the breasts and the el- bows were bent outward even after Hellenism had given the figure grace and dignity. Moreover the original Babylonian and Assyrian figures were decorated in barbotine like the habbs. The fragment from the Iraq 9 F. Sarre, Die Ausgrabungen von Samarra (Ber- lin, I925), II, P1. VI. R.

This figure is stamped with rosettes or stars which seem to be the emblem of the goddess. Similar render- ings of the Ishtar figure occur in other Samarra fragments in the British Museum, reproduced by Sarre."' These things cannot be the effect of coincidence alone owing to a primitive method of modeling. Either the medieval pot- ter worked in a continuous tradition of thou- sands of years, or he copied the ancient fig- urines that littered his native soil. Imitations of local antiques were indeed not unknown in the early Islamic period. Among the early eighth century stuccoes found in I938 at Kasr al-Hair al-Gharbi, the Syrian desert palace of the Caliph Hisham, is a female figure hold- ing her breasts in the Ishtar position.12 M. Daniel Schlumberger suggests it is a copy of some third-century Palmyrene figure of Atar- gatis, dug up in the neighborhood. There were special reasons for such imi- tation at Kasr al-Hair al-Gharbi. In Hisham's reign, figure sculpture had all but died out in Syria and these were the only available models. In North Mesopotamia there were other rea- sons. The old gods may have retained some dim magical or astrological significance. Magic and astrology prolonged the life of several Babylonian traditions. The inscribing of clay tablets for this purpose continued in the old Babylonian language and character at least till the first century B.C. In I93I I ac- quired in Kufa, south of Baghdad, a crumbling unbaked tablet of Babylonian type. It was inscribed in Kufic characters of the eighth cen- tury A.D. with part of the 36th sura of the Koran, nicely stamped. Dr. Rhuvon Guest13 Sarre, op. cit., Fig. 4I . 12 D. Schlumberger, "Les Fouilles de Qasr el-Heir el-Gharbi, I936-38," Syria, XX(I939), 349. 13 R. Guest, "A Tablet in Kufic from Kuf a," Jour. Royal Asiatic Soc. (January, I933), p. I03. suggests that the tablet was made to be buried for magic purposes. The large jars with mys- terious figures of ancient deities, though not made for this purpose, might have been adapted to it. All over Mesopotamia one finds buried incantation-bowls, inscribed in Aramaic or pseudo-Aramaic characters. The practice con- tinued almost into modern times, though bowls of the same type found by Koldewey at Baby- lon may be Parthian or Hellenistic.14 Such traditionalism makes it all the more impossi- ble to establish a comparative chronology for the long and vague period covered by Style I, the "goddess and dragon" style. According to Sarre, the Arabic inscription in Figure g may be as late as the twelfth century but this is a piece verging on the intermediate style, or Style II. One of Sarre's fragments from Samarra is a replica of the four goddesses on the British Museum piece,15 but its discovery in the Abbas- sid perimeter of the palace does not relegate it neatly between the years 836 and 892 A.D. It is just the sort of ware which a humble popu- lation, living among abandoned ruins, might use. More of these fragments were found by the Iraq Department of Antiquities in I938 in the Kasr al-'Ashik which was one of the great West-Bank Palaces. In the tenth century, Ibn Hawkal noticed that the population of the town had moved to Karkh, a northern sub- urb,16 but he also noticed that the gardens on the West Bank of the Tigris were in good order, which suggests that the palaces might have been kept in repair. Style I may spread vaguely over the ninth, tenth, eleventh and even twelfth centuries, but clearly there was much older pottery with this sort of decoration, filling the gap since Parthian times. At Hira, many small fragments of un- 14 Koldewey, op.

Three fragments, however, were of very deli- cate barbotine ware, showing the "zigzag" wand decoration. Two very small fragments of this fine barbotine pottery are illustrated in M. Koechlin's work on Susa.-8 Both show birds and one is clearly the duck-headed monster of the British Museum jar. Finer in quality than the big habbs, these fragments seem also to be older, since the well deposit at Hlira contained material for comparative chronology in the fragments of a cup with a Kufic inscription around the rim. This form of Kufic is found on an unglazed bowl from Susa in the Louvre. M. Koechlin associates its molded decoration of vine sprays with the Syrian artistic revival under the Umayyads.'9 Thus the Hira deposit, which included the barbotine fragments, could be as early as 700 A.D. That the North Meso- potamian habbs should be more primitive in execution than these earlier fragments is ex- plained by the character of the period. Be- tween the Samarra century and the twelfth- century renaissance, the pottery found in Iraqi sites is almost uniformly bad. The earliest of the North Mesopotamian habbs are already decadent and the quality only begins to improve as the second style evolves, the figures of goddesses and dragons losing their original significance and new motifs taking their place. The process is shown in Figures 7 and 8, a complete hzabb dug up casually at the police post of Sinn al- Dhibban between FallQdja and Ramadi (Bagh- dad, Arab Museum, No. 26). These animals are decidedly more realistic than the "duck- 17 D. Talbot Rice, "The Oxford Excavations at 1{ira," Ars Islamica, I (I934), 65-66, Fig. i8. 18Koechlin, op. cit., P1.

IV, Figs. 29, 30. headed dragons," but the goddesses have become so stylized that their heads have dis- appeared and their skirts form a purely ab- stract design. The technical finish on this habb is rather superior, but the same trans- formation of human forms into cyphers oc- curs in Figures I, 2, and 4, which are rough, unfinished wares, an indication that mere technical finish is no criterion for dating. Fol- lowing the visit of Sarre and Herzfeld to Takrit in I907, Herzfeld suggested that the primitive habbs with the goddess and dragon figures were made at Takrit, while the later types, which I shall call Styles II and III, were made at Mosul. Undoubtedly there are sev- eral complete habbs which have been asso- ciated with Takrit, apart from the significant story of the find which was made during the siege. The excavation sites at Samarra, Assur, lKuyfundjik, and elsewhere have only yielded small surface fragments. In 1946 the Bagh- dad Arab Museum acquired a characteristic nearly complete specimen in Takrit, No. 36.465 (Fig. 4). Figure 24 shows a ewer, fourteen inches high, of orthodox Sasanian shape with the standard goddess and dragon figures, which I acquired in Baghdad in I930. It was said to have come from a "Christian cemetery" in Takrit. Writing in the tenth century, Ibn Hawkal says that most of the inhabitants of Takrit were Christians 20 and he says the same of most northern Meso- potamian towns. This ware was probably made and used by Christians. One may specu- late whether in Figure 4 the Babylonian god- dess has not transformed herself into a Nesto- rian cross. Yet grave burial seems improbable if only because an average height of thirty inches is too big for grave furniture. Habbs, found in casual places like those from Sinn al-Dhibban and Wadi Armush, may have been buried as incantation bowls, whereas Takrit itself may 20 Le Strange, op. cit., P. 57.</page><page sequence="6">i6 GERALD REITLINGER contain a kiln-site and store which should re- pay excavation. It is also possible that the habbs are found under the foundations of Takrit houses, for the later decorated habbs are found in this position in Mosul and Sin- djar. A century ago, Layard was presented with one when a Nestorian church was demol- ished in Mosul.21 Apparently large habbs were set upright in the ground and the floors laid over them. The porous shell of the habb thus drains the moisture from the surround- ing soil. At Hilra where habbs were found under eighth-century rooms 22 decorated pieces were used, and it seems that in Mosul even the elaborate thirteenth-century pieces were sacrificed this way. THE SECOND STYLE Figures 9 and IO in the Berlin Museum and Kevorkian (New York) collections show an advance from the primitive style with its "Babylonian" figures toward the finely deco- rated ware of the twelfth century. Both have six handles in place of four and the handles are richly decorated in barbotine. Between the handles are small suspension loops which are also to be noticed on the British Museum habb (Fig. 3) and the two primitive habbs (Figs. i and 2) in the Metropolitan Museum and David collections. Modeled in clay, the suspension loops are useless, and their pres- ence suggests an imitation of metal work. As the second style developed, these loops or excrescences were expanded to link up with the handles. Thus in the second style the handles, now again reduced to four, have been bridged so as to produce the effect of a series of rococo niches under the rim. The massively molded heads of women and lions on the handles still perpetuate the tradition of the goddesses and 21 Sir A. H. Layard, Discoveries in the Ruins of Niniveh and Babylon (London, I853), pp. 279-80. 22 Rice, op. cit., p. 70, Fig. I9. dragons of the first style, but the execution is in the latest fashion and altogether more lively than that of the goddesses and dragons. All this massive ornament tends to overload the upper part of the habb, since the belly, which has no base to it and only light surface ornament, is potted more finely. Consequently, in most cases the belly of the habb has been smashed while the upper part has stayed intact, preserving the outline of an inverted bucket. Figure I 3 was acquired by the Louvre in I 904, and for many years the upper part was mis- taken for a stand and placed in this way for exhibition. Sarre in I905 23 compared the Louvre habb with a fragment, belonging to the Com- tesse de Behague, which had been exhibited in the Paris "Arts musulmans" exhibition of I 903 as "Sasanian or early Islamic." In an ap- pendix to Sarre's article, Eugen Mittwoch was able to support the newly proposed dating by reading from the fragment some words of a Neskhi inscription which "could not be earlier than the second half of the twelfth century." Part of the decoration on the Louvre example appears archaic for so late a date. It con- sists of a little standing figure, executed in barbotine and many times repeated. The fig- ure's structure can best be seen in the frag- ment, Figure i6. In I875 George Smith had illustrated a fragment found at Kuyuindjik which showed this figure.24 He ventured no opinion, but half a century later Gaston Migeon described the figure as "very Hittite in character" though he recognized "Indo- Parthian" elements in the rest of the decor.25 The hieratic stiffness of this short-legged erect figure is only approached by some of the Mosul silver inlay on bronze of the same 23 Sarre, "Islamische Tongefaisse," p. 69. 24 G.

Though the style of the figure is the out- come of the barbotine technique, the North Mesopotamian potter became so enamored of it that he copied it even in molded pottery. Herzfeld has sketched and published a char- acteristic fragment of molded pottery in imita- tion of barbotine ware of this kind.26 On almost every example of the Style II habb there occurs, molded on one of the ex- panded false handles, a cross-legged figure drinking from a cup (Fig. iS). This figure is naturalistic and presents an extreme con- trast to the barbotine figures. The cross- legged position and the Mongol faces of the female busts, which surround this figure, sug- gest both India and China. Sarre preferred to see in them a normal West Asian develop- ment of Hellenism, though he was prepared to admit a Mongol element in the faces: "It is not difficult to establish that they belong to a period when Mongols were always strongly in the foreground." 27 This would not do for the more romantic school of orientalism. According to Professor Martin Hartmann, the cross-legged figure was a Buddha and the female heads, Bodhisatt- vas.28 The potters themselves were central Asian, coming from a place Hartmann called Uiguristan. His view was supported in I9I7 by Josef Strzygowski in Altai-Iran und Jol- kerwanderung.29 The figures were in a "typi- cal Indo-Chinese mixed style" and the original home of the barbotine technique was Trans- oxiana, Turkestan, and Khotan.

Strzygowski, Jltai-Iran und Vl1kerwander- ung (Leipzig, 19I7), p. 260. Mesopotamian relief-ware was "part of an established export trade from central Asia." Strzygowski illustrated his point with photo- graphs of relief-ware found in central Asia, yet none of this relief-ware is strictly barbotine pottery.30 Moreover, he chose to ignore the native Mesopotamian tradition of barbotine work going back to ancient dynastic times. Sarre had the easy task of replying that these motifs were hardly an argument for the wares being imported since they were employed in the local Mosul architecture. Hartmann him- self had noticed the Buddhist attitude, which he called Mudra in the surviving stucco fig- ures of the Kara Sarai palace. In Niehbuhr's day (I772) there had been eighty to a hundred of them seated in their little niches and "so alike that they must have been pressed from a mold." 31 Nowadays the student is more familiar with the characteristics of the Islamic artistic renaissance of the twelfth to thirteenth cen- turies. One need not believe that these heavy but fragile objects, over two feet high and of little commercial value, had to be carried from the nebulous fastness of "Uiguristan" to the very metropolis of Arab craftsmanship. That the Islamic renaissance contained a central Asian and Buddhist element is hardly to be denied but it was part of a very ancient in- heritance. Buddhist attitudes and Mongol faces occur in several pieces of Persian silver- work of somewhat post-Sasanid date, pre- served in Russian museums. The probably contemporary ninth-century Samarra frescoes show them too. It is doubtful whether the incursions of Turks and Mongols, innocent of art, into Persia and Mesopotamia had any- thing to do with these attitudes and faces which certainly do not reflect contemporary Far Eastern or Indian styles. In Figure I7, 30 Strzygowski, ibid., Figs. 207-20. 31 Sarre-Herzfeld, op. cit., III, P1. XCVI.</page><page sequence="14">GERALD REITLINGER for instance, the figure is not strictly speaking cross-legged but has one foot dangling down- ward, an early Graeco-Buddhist attitude. It is the attitude of the figure drinking from a rhyton on the silver dish from Buddigara in the British Museum,32 regarded by Herzfeld as the "stammvater" of the drinking figures common throughout Islamic art.33 Sarre and Herzfeld noticed that habbs were still being produced in Mosul in I907 and shipped down the Tigris to Baghdad. Fragments of ltabbs in Styles II and III are certainly found far downstream and perhaps all over modern Iraq. I have found unmistak- able handles and rims in the Kish area near Babylon. But the complete pieces are gen- erally found in the north and only in the north can one pick up fragments in profusion. Styles II and III coincide with the period of the Zangid atabegs who ruled in Mosul from A.D. II27 to their overthrow by the Mongol H1u- lgugf in I262. Branches of this Turkish slave family established secession states as far as Syria. The longest-lived was the Zangid king- dom of Sindjar (II70-I220), a city only a hundred miles west of Mosul.34 About as many habbs in Styles II and III have been found in Sindjar as in Mosul. They are found as far west as the sites along the Khabuir river in present-day Syria. Officials of the Iraq De- partment of Antiquities consider the specimens brought them from Sindjar to be the finest. Although mass-produced, there is great varia- tion of quality, an indication that there were several sorts of factories and not necessarily all in Mosul. 32 Y. I.

Lane-Poole, The Mohammedan Dynasties (Westminster, I894), pp. I62-63. THE THIRD STYLE The third style survived the Mongol con- quest of the Zangid kingdom in I262 though I know of only one example which is clearly later than this date. The third style differs from the second style in elaboration and finish rather than in innovation. A fine example was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum as early as I 899 (No. 340) as "old Per- sian." 35 Here the cross-legged figure is sur- rounded, as in all characteristic pieces of the third style, with openwork arabesque behind which there is an air space, a most sophisti- cated development of the barbotine ornament of the second style. The arabesque is of the vegetable kind which Germans call "kreislap- pen." Strzygowski in 19I7, in search of proto- types in the depths of central Asia,"6 compared the Victoria and Albert's habb with some sil- ver personal adornments in the Hermitage Museum found in the Kotskhar River in south Siberia. But these ornaments, which are un- datable, clearly derive from that advanced Islamic art of which Mosul, under the Zangid atabegs, was one of the centers. Strzygowski mistook the rim of the wheel for the hub. The openwork and the vegetation make Style III easily recognizable, and also the dis- appearance of the uncouth little barbotine figures. Their place is taken by a whole range of personalities, realistically made from a mold. For instance, in Figure I9 (No. 7150 of the Baghdad Arab Museum) the seated drinking figure is entertained by a maiden play- ing a harp. On either side stand dignified fig- ures bearing a rose and a cup, symbols of office. In Style III the drinking figure emerges as a Seljuk sultan surrounded not only by his dancers and musicians but by the symbolic bureaucracy of the day whose office is conveyed " Sarre, "Islamische Tongefasse," p. 69 and Fig. 3. 36 Strzygowski, op. cit., p. 260, Fig. i8o.</page><page sequence="15">UNGLAZED RELIEF POTTERY I9 by the objects in their hands, a sword, a cup, a rose, or a pen case. In Figure 2I the figures bear a spear and a flaming lamp. These erect figures or chamberlains wear a standard costume, a long embroidered frock coat with wide, open lapels, riding boots, and a kalansuwa, a conical fur-trimmed hat from which dangle two pigtails. A hundred years ago Sir Austen Layard copied such a figure from a habb seen at 'Araban on the Khabuir and published it as a woodcut in I853. In calling the costume Persian, Layard was on a true scent but he believed the style to be "later than the Christian era but earlier than the Arabs." " It must be added that the open lapels and the pigtails are not Persian fashions but Seljuk Turk. There is no need to asso- ciate them with Hildgu's Mongol host which did not vanquish the Zangids till I262. What we have is a true rendering of the costume of the many Seljuk courts of the early thir- teenth century. This costume is to be found in the "Minai" pottery of Rayy and in Syrian Rakka wares painted in underglaze black, blue, and red. Rakka, which fell to the Mongol Huilagu in I 259, was part of the Zangid dominions. The Style III habbs show a not uncommon blend of fashion and ancient tradition. The drinking potentate with musicians, dancers, and chamberlains certainly derives from Sasa- nian times, though the two famous silver plates depicting this scene in the British Mu- seum and Hermitage collections, are probably copies of the tenth- to eleventh-century Per- sian revival.38 In the scene, as depicted in North Mesopotamian pottery, the details have been brought up to date. In Style III the potentate, who is so constantly depicted in the enjoyment 37 Layard, op. Cit., pp. 279-80. 38 Smirnov, op. cit., Pls. XXXV, XXXVII; 0. M. Dalton, Treasure of the Oxus (London, I905), P1. XXVI. of his leisure, may be a real person, the Atabeg Badr al-Din Lu'lu' who ruled the Zangid kingdom from I233 to I259 and is famous for the dedications on several pieces of Mosul inlaid metal work and on a number of buildings. The chamberlains carrying em- blems may also represent actual persons. Figure 20 shows the reverse side of the fine Baghdad fragment with the sultan and his musician. A second drinking figure is sur- mounted by the emblem of a crescent. Pro- fessor Mayer has proposed that this common object in Islamic heraldry is really a horseshoe and that the persons who first used it as their device at this period had borne the office of amir akhuir, master of the stable.39 It is there- fore not impossible that Figures i9 and 20 portray Badr al-Din Lu'lu' and his otherwise unknown master of the horse. At Sindjar, the home of this fine fragment, there was found in I938 a magnificent carved- stone niche now in the Baghdad Arab Mu- seum.40 In little ogival panels, quite remi- niscent of the decorated habbs, there is a seated sultan, carrying not a cup but a sword, and a number of standing chamberlains or officials; two cup-bearers, two bow-bearers, two mace- bearers, and a sword-bearer. The style is that of Style II rather than Style III and the niche is closely paralleled by the fine mihrab of the Friday Mosque in Mosul, dedicated in II48 when the Zangid atabeg, who ruled Mosul and Sindjar, was Nuir al-Din Mahmuid. Such a carved niche would be typical of palaces and houses of the great. Ever since Sasanian times in the desert palaces of the Umayyads or in the town palaces of the Abbasids and Seljuks in Samarra and Rayy, this familiar court scene had been rendered in stucco relief, in fresco 39L.

How then did this scene, associated with royal habitations, find its way to the humble mass-produced habb or water cistern standing in the courtyards of the com- mon people? The answer, provided by quantities of Rayy pottery decorated in this fashion, is that by the beginning of the thirteenth century pos- session of such objects had become a sort of snobbery. Iraq, I believe, provides a further very curious example of this snob-art in addi- tion to the highly decorated habbs. In I94I the Iraq Department of Antiquities found a store of clay figurines or toys while excavating Wasit, the Umayyad metropolis of Southern Iraq. Associated coins suggest that the store is rather later than the Mongol conquest, per- haps as late as the early fourteenth century. Among the clay figurines are types which were clearly intended to form a court series, includ- ing chamberlains of various sorts, dancing girls and musicians. These figures, about a foot high, are flat and cannot be made to stand up. From a preview of the Depart- ment's report, which was not published at the time of writing this article, I gather that the excavators hold the opinion that these are simply dolls. But why are they flat? Detached heads of these flat figures in a variety of head- dresses are to be found on any medieval site in Iraq. Occasionally they reach the western market. In I930 I excavated two such heads in the Kish area which bore traces of bitumen at the back. The flat figures had, therefore, been stuck onto another surface, perhaps onto walls or onto the wooden jambs of doors where they would have made just such an ensemble as on the carved niche from Sindjr. The figures of birds, animals, and monsters on the Style III habbs are so completely char- acteristic of the twelfth to thirteenth century Islamic renaissance with its close adherence to the Sasanian repertory as to call for less spe- cial notice. Since Sarre's study of I905 they have been made familiar in countless published examples of textile and metal work. The anthropomorphic bird, or harpy, in Figure i 8 and the archer with the body of a lion in Figure 22 are curious enough, but they are part of the common grammar of thirteenth- century pottery decoration and in their sophis- ticated form have quite parted company with their remote Babylonian past. Figure 22, a recent acquisition of the Baghdad Arab Mu- seum (No. 5841), is sophisticated in other respects too. With a supreme effort of realism the busts of dancing girls lean out of their niches with a hand over the windowsill and their tiara-like headdresses protruding above the lintel. Even this attitude recalls Sasanian tradition, in particular, the stucco friezes with female busts from Kish and Ctesiphon. The Mongol conquest of the Middle East caused only a temporary, if indeed any, break in the output of decorated pottery. The pro- duction of the highly decorated North Meso- potamian habbs survived it, but not apparently for long nor in its previous profusion. I have only been able to illustrate one definitely I1- Khanid piece: it is Figure 23 (Baghdad Arab Museum No. i). The light and rather skimpy style of the undercut ornament suggests the earlier part of the fourteenth century. The habb is in orthodox Sunna taste. There are no human figures and the only animals are the very rudimentary lions heads under the rim. I have not been able to ascertain where this habb was found. Until the opening of the Baghdad Arab Museum, it stood for many years as a landmark for tourists in the court- yard of the Iraq Museum. It is the only one of the decorated habbs to tell its own story, but it is perhaps a pity that this habb should be a poet, interested only in eternal verities and not in the prosaic facts of time and place. Nevertheless, the fine Neskhi inscription has</page><page sequence="17">UNGLAZED RELIEF POTTERY 2I its own message and a very fitting one to con- clude this article: "I am a habb of water wherein there is healing. I quench the thirst of mankind. This I achieve by vir- tue of my sufferings on the day I was cast among the fiery flames."
