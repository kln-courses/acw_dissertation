<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHEMISTRY AND HISTORY IN LIVING ORGANISMS* FRANGO GRAZIOSI DISCUSSION, EVEN A SUMMARY ONE, of the histori- cal aspects of living organisms cannot dispense with some clarification of the term historical As a rule the adjective is used to designate a number of meanings having different impli- cations. Generically, historical means what happened in the past, for which reliable documents exist; in this sense, when we speak of the history of organisms, we refer to the diversely preserved re- mains of beings that lived in a more or less distant past. But his- torical also connotes a process, a becoming, of interconnected events, capable of interpreting the evidence by means of a theory. History thus makes it possible to find or postulate the existence of other data as yet unknown, and to understand the genesis of the present. A conception of this kind can not be applied automatically to any and all kinds of data. Not everyone considers human history an area susceptible to scientific analysis. Some people believe that historical evidence is not a sufficient foundation for working out theories about mankind's development. A recent instance of this attitude occurs in Mario Ageno's valuable work on the origin of life. According to Ageno, history does not become a science simply because historians adopt rigorous scientific methods in collecting, evaluating and interpreting the evidence. He explains: Hence, the historian must constantly face problems of criticizing em- pirical data not substantially different from those the scientist faces in the initial phase of his work, the phase of orientation, which sets the stage for experiments having a definite goal. However, science is based * Translated from Critica marxista, Quaderno No. 6, 1972. 278</page><page sequence="2">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 279 on the hypothesis that nature is governed by universal laws, which can be revealed by experiment. Such scientific experimentation is not ap- plicable to the historical reconstruction of human events. Thus the anal- ogy between history and science stops short at the initial phase.1 Natural History and Human History. Scholars dealing with human biology, psychology, linguistics and cosmology, must, even if for different reasons, give critical attention to the concepts of universal laws governing nature and of experi- mentation. Evolutionists can not restrict themselves to the problem of the origin of life but must aim to study and interpret, in a rigorous sci- entific manner, the entire evolution of organic forms. Certain sim- ilarities between the methodological problems of the science of evo- lution and those of the human sciences in general might be a good starting point for a discussion of this fundamental question. How- ever, we must first make more precise what we have in mind when we speak of the history of living organisms. Living organisms go back to a distant past; they have their roots in the chemical events that accompanied and followed the forma- tion of the earth's surface. Numberless fossil discoveries clearly show that morphological and functional complexity gradually increases from the past to the present, and even suggest a phylogenetic rela- tionship among various groups of organisms. There is thus abundant material to describe and order in the simplest and most logical way. If this were all there was to the matter, however, the history of or- ganisms would remain a fundamentally descriptive science, a sum of chronicles and biographies, without any possibility of finding the essential connections in an often confused congeries of past events. The Lamarckian theory of heredity, widely accepted by biol- ogists in the last half of the 19th century, was based on a plastic conception of the heredity process. Lamarckism precluded both the possibility of identifying the necessary memory mechanisms inter- connecting generations, and of attacking the problem of organic evo- lution in a scientifically correct manner. In point of fact, a funda- mental characteristic of historical processes is the presence of mecha- 1 M. Ageno, L'origine della vita sulla terra (Bologna, 1971), pp. 6, 25.</page><page sequence="3">280 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY nisms capable of memorizing experiences and transmitting them with a measure of stability and precision to subsequent generations. We speak of human history because in our species, and in it alone, there has come into being a new quality of the central ner- vous system, one which provides the preconditions for a collective memory, for the accurate transmission of that memory, and hence for the phenomenon of cultural evolution. History began, strictly speaking, when this mechanism first came into being, and it assumed major proportions when the mechanism was perfected by the dis- covery of new and powerful techniques- the alphabet, printing, etc. Analogously, we can speak of the history of living organisms from the time when certain physico-chemical systems acquired, along with the property of reproducing themselves, the ability to memo- rize and transmit definite changes to their progeny. These rather rigid physico-chemical systems, far from being plastic (as Lamarck conceived of them), react in well-defined ways when confronted by new conditions and contingencies in their environment. This fact holds true as well for many complex organisms with refined nervous systems that are rigidly determined in their structure and connec- tions; such organisms can be viewed as finely programed automata. However, the changes that organisms undergo in their interaction with the environment are not memorizable; hence, organisms, as single individuals, are incapable of evolution. In view of these state- ments, we may wonder what sense it makes to speak of the evolu- tion of living organisms. Evidently, what we have in mind must be a rather special type of evolution, one markedly different from the evolution of human culture and society. The rigid mechanism which determines the reproduction of or- ganic forms undergoes, in the course of its functioning and inde- pendently of the particular structure and functions of the organ- isms in which it is contained, changes of varying nature and degree. Precisely because of the perfection of this hereditary mechanism, these changes are memorized and transmitted to the offspring. This is not a matter of memorizing and transmitting experience, in the sense usually given that term, but of memorizing and accumulating chemical changes as a function of the success that these changes sometimes give to the organisms in which they take place, and to their descendants. These changes make populations heterogeneous,</page><page sequence="4">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 281 with the inevitable consequence of a continual selection of types endowed with a higher probability of leaving progeny capable of dealing with the specific environmental conditions to which they are exposed. Hence, the history of living organisms is the history of the ge- netic structures, of their becoming complex and evolving under the pressure of natural selection; it is the history of populations in their inevitable evolution. The possibility of studying and knowing this particular type of history is based on the recently acquired knowledge of the mecha- nisms of heredity and hereditary variation, of the ways in which new genetic structures constantly arise, and of their complexity. Fossil remains and similarities in anatomical structure and physio- logical behavior are traditional and indirect evidence for an his- torical approach to life; the molecular structure of its basic consti- tuents (nucleic acids and proteins) are new and more direct evi- dence which, it is interesting to note, is obtained not from organ- isms that lived in the past, but from those still living. This new science, which studies the history of life, is by now well developed from both the theoretical and experimental points of view; it enables us to formulate tenable and verifiable hypotheses as to the origin and spread of life on earth, and to modify popula- tions for either experimental or practical purposes. Finally, it en- ables us to understand the origin and evolution of our species and spurs us to identify and to locate in the past the links between our natural history and our human history- those essential changes in our nervous system which made possible the origin of human society and civilization. Molecular Bases of Heredity and Its Changes. Engels wrote in his Dialectics of Nature: ... so far not even the chemical formula of albumen has been established -we do not even know how many chemically different albumen bodies there are- and since it is only about ten years ago that the fact became known that completely structureless albumen exercises all the essential functions of life, digestion, excretion, movement, contraction, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.2 2 Frederick Engels, Dialectics of Nature (New York, 1940), p. 16.</page><page sequence="5">282 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Here the word albumen stands for the modern word protein, and we do not know exactly what particular researches Engels re- ferred to, even though we know that the properties of proteins be- gan to be defined only in the 1870s, when the book was written. The expression structureless evidently relates to the microscopic struc- ture observed in protoplasm, which was observed in finer and finer detail in those years, with the progress of the microscope and histo- logical techniques. I have cited this passage from Engels to point out an inadvertent error that it contains: attributing the power of self-reproduction to protein. Engels, like his contemporaries, could not realize that cau- tion was necessary on so crucial a question. Actually, geneticists al- ways held, up to 1945 or 1950, that the genetic material was com- posed of proteins. This widespread conviction was based, not on direct experimental data, but on the known extreme structural com- plexity of proteins, the most complex substances of which living things are composed. It was natural to assume that the genetic ma- terial responsible for the hereditary determination of every anatom- ical and physiological feature was a chemical material of extreme complexity, and proteins seemed the most likely candidate for that essential function. This error on the part of classical biology was undoubtedly reinforced by the observation that proteins constitute 70% to 80% of the dry residue of all organs (from the blood to the muscles) and that they are the molecular effectors of all physiolog- ical activities. No wonder, then, that Engels, even in the absence of solid ex- perimental backing, added that little word ' 'reproduction' ' to the list of essential activities of ' 'completely structureless albumen." But this error of classical biology contains the root of many errors, con- nected above all with the concepts of physiological response and regulation- functions often performed by proteins and therefore often extended to the phenomena of heredity. An apparently plausi- ble molecular foundation is thus given to heredity theories of the Lamarckian type. This error was corrected in the period from 1944 to 1952. In 1944 appeared the fundamental work of Avery, Macleod, and Mc- Carty,3 which gave irrefutable demonstration that nucleic acid, not 3 O. T. Avery, C. N. Macleod, M. McCarty, "Studies on the Chemical Nature of</page><page sequence="6">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 283 a protein, is the material basis of some heredity mechanisms in bac- teria. In 1952 Hershey and Chase4 demonstrated that a nucleic acid is the chemical constituent of the genome of a bacterial virus. In those years, from 1944 to 1952, a radical revolution took place in biological knowledge, and resistance to the change was neither in- frequent nor negligible. Avery did not live to see his work, the fruit of long and elaborate researches, receive definitive recognition. Later Nobel prizes rained down on the scientific avant-garde which today recognizes Avery as the founder of molecular genetics. Not proteins, therefore, but a nucleic acid (desoxyribonucleic acid, abbreviated as DNA) is the chemical support of heredity, and in its molecular properties have been found the mechanisms en- trusted with the genetic information of organisms- the faithfulness of reproduction and the possibility of permanent changes which are at the root of the phenomena of evolution. Thus, the corpuscular theory of heredity received definitive confirmation, and the gene emerged from the sphere of abstractions of formal genetics. The latter, which had started with Mendel's crosses and statistical meth- ods and had led to the formulation of the concept of the gene and the chromosome theory of heredity, made a decisive contribution to the elaboration of a new methodology based on the experimen- tal use of large microbe populations, refined selection techniques, and verification on the molecular level. This new methodology is now called molecular genetics and is usually identified with the generic and more commonly known term, molecular biology. The development of this new science has been broadly set forth in many publications and its basic concepts are in the process of as- similation even in the tardy academic structure. This is not the place, nor would it be possible in so little space, to give even a sum- mary picture of molecular biology; we can at most give a bibliog- raphy.5 I shall therefore confine myself to stating some general as- the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcus Type I.

In the first place, it has been shown that DNA contains all the genetic information of living organisms (the exception of the viruses containing RNA does not contradict this statement, but rather con- firms it). The genetic information is contained in DNA in the form of specific sequences of four monomers (nucleotides), and every gene is made up of hundreds or thousands of these units. Thus, the genetic information is written into DNA by means of a four-letter alphabet, and a gene may be compared to a complete sentence writ- ten in any language. The genes follow one another in the long DNA filaments without any break in physical continuity, but are separ- ated from one another by specific signals consisting of special se- quences of nucleotides. We see, therefore, that the corpuscular the- ory of the gene, founded by Mendel, has been verified in a rather peculiar manner- one in which the concepts of physical continuity and discontinuity are much more sophisticated and pregnant with consequences that had been only schematically expected. In and of itself DNA has no physiological activity, but functions exclusively to store genetic information, which it derives, for either reproductive or physiological purposes, from two special proteins (called DNA-polymerase and RNA-polymerase, respectively). The retrieval of the information from the DNA is made possible by the fact it consists of a crystalline structure in which two filaments are bound together by an elementary complementary rule. This rule is the basis of the mechanism by means of which DNA-polymerase is able to synthesize new DNA in the presence of a preexisting DNA matrix, an adequate supply of the four types of nucleotide, and en- ergy. The same rule is the basis of the retrieval of the DNA's ge- netic information by the RNA-polymerase, which is able to syn- thesize short lengths of ribonucleic acid (RNA), another nucleic acid, chemically very similar to DNA. These lengths of RNA, only a few genes long, are called genetic messages and consist of a single fila- ment. These genetic messages, true authentic copies of genes, are the matrices which, in conjunction with certain small cytoplasmic organs (ribosomes), direct the synthesis of proteins. The process by Ital. trans. (Bologna, 1972); P. Hartman, S. R. Suskind, L'azione del gene, Ital. trans. (Bologna, 1971); J. D. Watson, The Double Helix (New York, 1969); J. D. Watson, Biologia moleculare del gene, Ital. trans. (Bologna, 1972).</page><page sequence="8">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 285 which RNA-polymerase synthesizes the copies of genes to be used in the cytoplasm is called genetic transcription, for obvious reasons. There is a well-defined relationship between the order of se- quence of the nucleotides of a gene and the order of sequence of the amino acids of the corresponding protein, and all the chemico-phys- ical properties of protein depend on the order of sequence in which the amino acids are arranged along their filament. The synthesis of proteins, which is called genetic translation, may be thought of as a message written in the DNA-RNA language, whose alphabet has four letters, translated into a corresponding message (protein) written in a language whose alphabet has twenty letters (corresponding to the twenty amino acids). The translation mechanism is rather complicated and is of such a nature that the translation itself can take place in only one direction, from the nu- cleic acid to the protein, and not in the other direction. This is the molecular basis for impossibility of hereditability of acquired char- acteristics, inasmuch as only the proteins are effector organs of all the organic functions. Modifications of the same, induced by special environmental circumstances, cannot be translated into correspond- ing molecular lengths along the nucleic acids, which are the sole depositaries of genetic information. Genetic translation has been completely deciphered. We know that to every three nucleotides of the DNA there corresponds an amino acid in the corresponding protein, and we know which amino acid corresponds to each of the 64 possible triplets of nucleotides arranged along the DNA filaments. Some amino acids are specified by a single triplet, others by more than one. This list of precise cor- respondences is called the genetic code. The only changes that can alter the genetic material, and there- fore the proteins (with corresponding structural and functional variations in the organism in which the changes themselves occur), are those that are determined in the DNA and produce a more or less extensive alteration of the sequences of nucleotides. This al- teration may be confined to a single nucleotide (change, subtrac- tion, addition) or to many nucleotides, or even to very long stretches of DNA comprising an entire gene or many genes (deletion, dupli- cation, translocation, etc.). These changes, which by reason of the high precision of the</page><page sequence="9">286 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY molecular mechanism of heredity are very rare, constitute the basic material on which natural selection operates, and I believe it is evi- dent that we can now conceive an experimental approach to the history of organisms by means of studying the sequences of the DNA nucleotides or of the amino acids of proteins. Related organisms will have many sequences in common; organisms that are distinct with respect to their evolution will show great differences in se- quence. Further, we shall see that it is particularly important for studying the history of life to analyze those genes (or those proteins) that have a universal role and are present even in organisms very far removed from one another, from the evolutionary point of view. In point of fact, the major efforts of evolutionists have lately been concentrated on these critical molecules. I should like to conclude with a general observation. Molecular biology has shown, by independent and rigorous methods, that all the organisms living on earth are related to one another; in all of them the genetic material is the same, the genetic code is univer- sal, and the translation mechanism is substantially the same from the lowest microbe to man. This observation may suffice to give an idea of the heuristic value of the new discoveries for a global under- standing of organic life, and for an understanding of the flourish- ing of evolutionary studies of a new type, based on solid theories and rigorous methods of investigation. Organic Evolution at the Molecular Level. It is of interest to note that the possibility of better knowledge of the past of organic forms is primarily a byproduct of experimen- tal researches aimed at deeper knowledge of existing forms, of what is universal and essential in them, of the inner mechanisms that de- termine their more obvious phenomena, which is what we wish to dominate and transform for practical purposes. Classical evolution doctrine developed with the aid of the knowledge of anatomy, phy- siology, biochemistry, and microbiology that was perfected in the 19th century in an effort to understand living things and change them, use them, or heal their diseases for the practical needs of so- ciety. Even at that time, the discovery of the cell and the formula- tion of cell theory, which may be regarded as the first step towards</page><page sequence="10">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 287 a general theory of organic life, were determinant in the develop- ment of the ideas of evolution. The technical level that has been reached today and the knowl- edge that has been accumulated in these years by a molecular ap- proach to evolution deal chiefly with the sequences of the amino acids in proteins, and to a much smaller degree with the sequences of nucleotides in DNA. There are many reasons for the unequal de- velopment of techniques and knowledge in this sphere, despite the apparent lack of logic in taking up the proteins rather than the nu- cleic acids- for ideally the subject of these studies should be the structure of the genes, directly. In the first place, sequential analysis of proteins is older and is based on perfected and standardized methods. Up to twenty years ago the sequential analysis of a protein was regarded as a piece of spectacular work by some specialized laboratory; today, this type of analysis can be conducted in many laboratories. In addition, it should be recalled that proteins, as the molecular effectors of or- ganic functions, are of great practical importance and study of them has broad applications in medicine and industry; it is understand- able that they should be thoroughly studied. The situation is dif- ferent with DNA, which, with no physiological activity, does not at present provide applications of direct practical use. Furthermore, analysis of the sequence of nucleotides is technically difficult, and it is particularly hard to obtain genes in a pure form for perform- ing the analysis. Purification of a gene was achieved only recently; also recent is the artificial synthesis of certain nucleotide sequences. These facts entail very great difficulties in the study of the molecular evolution of DNA, and much of what we know thus far is limited to the nu- cleic acids of viruses. There is no doubt that in this field we shall see spectacular advances in the chemical manipulation of the ma- terial of heredity with a view to possible genetic engineering, but for the time being we are only at the beginning. However, the study of DNA has already yielded useful data towards fuller knowledge of the degree of affinity of various organisms. Techniques have long been known that make possible an approximate overall measure- ment of the degree of homology of the nucleotide sequences of DNA of different provenance; but thus far, in general, these methods ap-</page><page sequence="11">288 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ply only to microbic forms. The DNA of the higher organisms ex- hibits more complex and little known characteristics, and it is ar- ranged in chromosomic superstructures which have not yet been interpreted. To give an idea of the limitations prevailing in this sec- tor, suffice it to say that, from the quantitative point of view, a mam- malian cell contains enough DNA to support the presence of over a million different genes (as contrasted with the thousand or so of a bacterial cell, and the few units or few dozens in viruses). But it is possible that actually these cells do not have more than 50,000 different genes, while the rest of the mass of DNA might have regu- latory and structural functions. We see, therefore, that utilization of the data thus far gathered by molecular biology concerning the affinity of living things must at present be limited to study of the protein sequences, that is, to the translated copies of the genes. The proteins are undoubtedly the most complicated molecules of living things. In their structural patterns, composed of thousands of atoms arranged in relatively rigid structures, lies the seat of their essential property of being extremely specific catalysts. Every single biochemical reaction is operated by a well-defined type of protein, and if we consider the enormous variety of living beings and the tens of thousands of proteins that specify their structural and func- tional aspects, we may well wonder how it can be possible that there are so many different types of protein molecules. But the catalogue of theoretically possible proteins is so immense that it goes beyond the wildest imagination. Proteins are made up of a polypeptide filament (primary struc- ture) wound and bent around itself in various ways and made up of a linear sequence of about 150 amino acids (in some cases, many more) distributed among twenty types, whose relative frequency varies from one protein to another. The sequence of amino acids in the primary structure determines all the properties of a protein; for example, if two proteins were made up of the same amino acids in the same relative quantities but in different sequences, they would differ in their secondary and tertiary structure and their cata- lytic properties. How many different filaments, each made up of 150 amino acids, can be made with 20 different amino acids ar- raneed in all the possible ways? The number of possibilities is repre-</page><page sequence="12">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 289 sented by a figure one followed by about 200 zeros, a number far greater than even those we hear spoken of in cosmology, and one to which it is impossible to assign physical significance. It is evident that not even the tremendous variety of living or- ganisms can begin to exhaust the possible list of proteins, and I be- lieve that we are now beginning to see why the initial perplexity as to the ability of the chemical variety of the proteins to explain the variety of living beings has been replaced by the opposite prob- lem of understanding how a living being manages to conserve and transmit, with precision, its proteinic individuality. When the problem was stated in these terms, a strong stimulus was given to the effort to conceive of structures able to store the chemical information necessary for the synthesis of proteins, and it became urgent to make an experimental attack on the function of the nucleic acids and on decipherment of the genetic code. In the light of these considerations we can realize the great im- portance of the similarities of protein sequences in different organ- isms for assessing their degree of evolutionary relationship. The probability that such similarities are accidental is negligible. It is equally improbable that significant similarities of sequence could result from convergence phenomena- similarity of organisms of di- verse origin which have evolved for long periods in the same con- stant and highly selective environment, e.g., deserts, caves, the depths of the sea, etc. Particular importance attaches to the amino acid sequences of the proteins responsible for fundamental vital functions and pre- sent in a large variety of organisms. For example, cytochrome c is one of the proteins that enable living creatures to utilize the oxygen of the atmosphere as an acceptor of hydrogen in bio-oxidations. This is a type of molecule discovered by natural selection in the very distant past, and practically all aerobic organisms have it in more or less similar forms; study of it attests the evolutionary vicissitudes of the corresponding gene and the degree of relationship of the aero- bic organism derived from a common ancestral type. Measurement of the evolutionary affinities is made (using a large computer) by comparing the sequences of the molecules of purified cytochrome c from a great variety of living things. All the sequences studied, made up of something like a hundred amino acids each, show regions that</page><page sequence="13">290 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY are constant and others that are more or less variable. This derives from the fact that the catalytic activity of cytochrome c (as for all proteins) depends strictly on the conformation of some parts of the molecule, which therefore can not change without doing away with the catalytic activity itself. Hence, the changes occurring in these zones have always been unfavorable or indeed fatal and were elimi- nated by natural selection. Other regions of the molecule are less critical and can undergo alterations that are sometimes advantageous in combination with other anatomical, physiological, or behavioral changes; some of these changes were therefore favored and conserved by natural selection. When we examine all the available sequences of cytochrome c extracted from living beings of great diversity, it is observed that the molecular affinities can be calculated, and yield an evolution- ary tree; and it is interesting to note that this repeats qualitatively what was already known from the evidence of paleontology and com- parative anatomy. Thus we have a configuration, via a totally in- dependent path, of the evolutionary kinships obtained by classical methods, with the added possibility of quantitatively assessing the degree of relationship, the number of changes undergone, the time elapsed between the appearance of different forms, and finally, of identifying links and ancestral types that existed in the very distant past. In cytochrome c, for example, it is possible to identify the se- quences that developed in the primordial ancestors of the verte- brates, or the mammals, or the primates, or the primitive organism from which the entire class of aerobic organisms have evolved. It is also possible to calculate that mutations accumulated in that primi- tive molecule, compatible with its functioning, at the rate of about thirty every billion years.6 Other proteins have undergone a much more rapid evolution; in hemoglobin, for example, mutations ac- cumulated at the rate of 500 per billion years. Analysis of hemo- globins thus enables us to reconstruct in great detail the evolution of more homogeneous groups of organisms, such as the birds, the mammals, or the primates. The same is true for the antibodies, for the proteins in milk, for the proteins of albumen, etc. It is not possible to examine here the technical aspects and the 6 M. O. Dayhoff, "Computer Analysis of Protein Evolution," Scientific American, 221 (July 1969), p. 87.</page><page sequence="14">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 291 details of these researches nor to specify the uncertainties, the ar- tifices, and the limitations of the method; all this can be found in specialized publications.7 It is necessary, however, to point out that this method is capable of making important contributions in the identification of the mechanisms of evolution, and in showing how new genes arise and how genetic structures become more complex. The general mechanism of the formation of new genes is based on the occasional occurrence of redundance in the genetic struc- tures. Redundance usually occurs as the result of alterations in the DNA duplication mechanism and of the distribution of the mate- rial of heredity to the daughter cells. For example, when one or more genes (a long molecular tract of DNA) duplicates, both copies re- main in the same genome, with the result that two or more iden- tical genes are present along the chromosome. Or duplication of the chromosomes may not be followed by orderly distribution of them, so that one of the two daughter cells receives two copies of the same chromosome. Or duplication of the entire genome may not be followed by cell division, so that the cell becomes diploid. In all these cases one, several, or very many genes will be present in the same cell in two identical copies, one of which will be super- fluous for the normal performance of the cell's functions. The su- perfluous copy thus becomes a sort of passive, neutral material, in which can accumulate mutations of all kinds that would normally be eliminated by natural selection. These neutral genes may evolve in entirely random directions and differ increasingly from the orig- inal. The fact that phenomena of this kind occur with appreciable frequency in large populations implies that those populations con- tain, over and above the normal genetic material, a certain quan- tity of redundant and neutral genes. Sooner or later, inevitably, some genetic product of this neutral material, modified by repeated mu- tations, will supply new characters which natural selection will sift and possibly favor, resulting in the permanent acquisition of new genes. To give a concrete example, this mechanism was at the root of the evolution of two fundamental genes that control the synthesis 7 R. E. Feeney and R. G. Allison, Evolutionary Biochemistry of Proteins (New York, 1969); H. Harris, Genetica biochimica umana, Ital. trans. (Bologna, 1972); Nguyen van Thoai and J. Roche, Homologous Enzymes and Biochemical Evolution (New York, 1968).</page><page sequence="15">292 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY of the proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. Both these proteins fix and transport oxygen, but one functions in the red blood corpuscles and the other in muscle cells. As we see, the perfecting and compli- cating of the organic structures corresponds to the birth of new genes by differentiation of preexisting genes. In the case of hemo- globin and myoglobin, analysis of their sequences suggests that a simpler ancestral type had only a single gene to control oxygen trans- port. Duplication of this gene rendered possible the specialization of oxygen transport in two media as different as the blood and the muscles. Analysis of protein sequences, therefore, evidently can re- veal not only the evolutionary affinities between different organisms but also the process of genetic complication that took place within the organisms in the course of their increasing anatomical and phy- siological complication. We must realize that there is ample room for experimentation in this field to reproduce, in a known way, the genetic events that occur at the time of origin of new genes, and to study the detailed characteristics. It seems clear that the science of evolution received a decisive impulse from the development of molecular genetics, and that the history of living organisms has entered upon a new phase, one which is no longer merely descriptive and speculative, as was the case only recently, but which has the characteristics of a true and genuine ex- perimental science. In this phase of the history of living organisms, the collection and the evaluation of data are completely fused, along with rigorous analysis of the essential structures and the experimen- tation aimed at understanding the mechanisms of transformation. It is necessary to consider another important and more general aspect of the sequences of amino acids in proteins and of nucleotides in DNA. We have seen that these sequences are the result of re- peated sifting by natural selection, the consequence of major and minor changes in the life conditions of living organisms: occasional changes of the genome; alterations in the climate, the ecological equilibrium, relations with prey, predators, parasites, symbiotic or- ganisms, and symbions; changes in the availability of foods; inva- sion of new territories. This phenomenon depends on the fact that amino acids and nu- cleotides are interconnected, in their respective polymers, by con- stant parts of their molecules (the peptide group in the amino acids,</page><page sequence="16">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 293 a phosphoric ester in the nucleic acids) without any restriction of sequence imposed by their chemical structure. Their polymers therefore contain not only information strictly relative to the prop- erties of the atoms that go to make them up, but also and above all information of historical nature relating to the various events that have determined the sequence. It follows that if a given protein or nucleic acid is to be syn- thesized without employing preexisting matrices- if nature is to be imitated in this realm too- the amino acids and nucleotides must be aligned and linked one by one, by means of thousands of con- secutive chemical operations, each of which is in a sense a repeti- tion of a choice made by natural selection. This indicates the extreme laboriousness of this type of research, which forms an objective limit to applying the methods of organic synthesis in the field of informational macromolecules. It should be stressed that these macromolecules, by virtue of their historical con- tent, are unpredictable structures only according to the laws of phys- ics. This is an exclusive characteristic of living things, which dis- tinguishes them from all other material objects and makes them in- comprehensible without an historical approach. It is in this sense that Monod in his recent book applies the term unpredictable to all living organisms (the biosphere): I should not like to be misunderstood: in asserting that living things, as a class, are not predictable on the basis of first principles, I do not at all intend to insinuate that they are not explainable by those principles, that they transcend them in some way, and that others must be found which apply to them alone. According to me, the biosphere is unpredict- able neither more nor less than the particular configuration of atoms that make up the stone I hold in my hand, (emphasis by F.G.)8 It would appear, however, that Monod, in spite of his remark- able effort to penetrate into the significance and philosophical con- sequences of the new knowledge in biology, failed to grasp fully the historical aspect of organisms, which distinguishes them from all other material objects. A much more satisfactory analysis of this nexus of problems is to be found in Jacob's La logique du vivant. Une histoire de Vhé- 8 J. Monod, // caso e la necessità, Ital. trans.

I must limit myself to recommending the book and to citing a particularly significant passage: Biology has shown, on the contrary, that there is no metaphysical en- tity concealed behind the word "life." The ability to enter into combi- nation, to generate increasingly complex structures and to reproduce themselves is intrinsic to the very constitutive elements of nature. . . . This does not mean that biology has become an appendage of physics, that it is as it were a branch of physics characterized by a greater degree of complexity. New characteristics and new logical properties appear at every level of organization. No molecule, per se, has the ability to reproduce itself; this power belongs only to the simplest integrone that deserves to be described as living, i.e. the cell. But from this level on, the rules of the game change. Natural selection sets rather rigorous limits on higher level integrones and gives them previously unknown proper- ties. Living systems, without ceasing to obey the laws that regulate inert systems, become the site of phenomena that have no meaning on the lower level. Biology can not be identified with physics nor can it do without it. (emphasis by F.G.)9 We may conclude by recalling two aspects that emerge from an histor- ical approach to life. They seem to me to be particularly important for a more general conception of the historical sciences. First of all, we have seen that an analysis and scientific interpretation of the past can only be obtained by way of studying and experimenting on the present, on actual living organisms, on transformation proc- esses that take place under our direct observation and that we can modify and direct. Secondly, we have seen that we can learn the past of organisms only by studying their fundamental (genetic) structures and then formulating general theories. The superstruc- tural phenomena (modes of life, behavior, anatomical and physio- logical details of individuals) provide an approach that is only indi- rect and often misleading, which can at best be the object of chron- icles, biographies, or astonished admiration (which often covers an inability to understand!). It is clear on the face of it that once we discard the more superficial analogies between the human history and the natural history of living things, other and much more sig- nificant analogies appear. 9 F.

The age in which we live is marked by a more and more direct participation of science in war. Scientists of undoubted competence, as well as institutions and scientific societies with great traditions, are more or less directly involved in devising ever more refined tools of destruction. This makes it our duty to ask: what can be the fate of biological progress in this capitalist society, in which the ruling groups are willing to break through any and every ethical restraint in their panicky effort to preserve the system? It is not easy to give a satis- factory answer to this question. For one thing we do not know what is being prepared in military research centers, and for another we can not foresee the rate of development of the practical applica- tions that may be made of molecular genetics. The agreement between the great powers to prohibit biological (but not chemical) warfare and the dismantling of the large CBW center at Fort Detrick, Maryland, may lead us to hope that at least direct military applications in war will be avoided or at least re- duced. The objective that is attainable by means of the new scien- tific knowledge consists essentially of the power to destroy the ene- my's people, animals, and plants, in a war of extermination limited to organic matter and without the material destruction of conven- tional or atomic war. The attainment of this objective, however, is inevitably limited because of the great biological similarity of men of all races and all nations and the worldwide diffusion of the most important domestic animals and cultivated plants. There is an ob- vious correlation between the power of the arms employed and the probability that those arms would be turned automatically against the aggressor as well as against peoples and regions distant and un- aware. Actually, this aspect of biological warfare has set a serious limit to the attempts thus far made to develop and test biological techniques of aggression, and it is probably this limit, rather than hypocritical humanitarian considerations, that has led to the banning of such weapons. But is it not possible that the failure to reach an agreement on chemical weapons expresses a desire to retain the right to use biological and medical knowledge to act against people, ani- mals, and plants without running excessive risks? The use of de- foliants in Vietnam is an obvious confirmation of this. Or is the</page><page sequence="19">296 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY stratagem to quibble over what is chemical and what is strictly bio- logical, in view of the philosophical difficulty (which we have seen) of separating these questions? One thing is certain, however: if molecular biology is used in warfare, it will have to take the form of microbial aggression. Mi- crobes are unrivaled in their ability to multiply and diffuse at a rapid rate; they exhibit a certain specificity towards populations, individuals, organs, and tissues; and they can carry out a great va- riety of chemical operations at great speed. What might be expected, then, are improvements in the field of microbiological weaponry, with the aid of microbe genetics (something which is already in existence), genetic engineering, and the synthesis of new types of nucleic acids and virus proteins. The employment of science for military purposes is certainly nothing new; the history of science is inextricably tied up with all human activities, of which war has always been an important ex- pression. What is new is the dimensions of the phenomenon. The new feature is that, when confronted with discoveries of great hu- man and social import, our first thoughts are not of hopes for prog- ress but of fear of new murderous weapons, new suffering and hor- ror. Scientists certainly have no reason to be happy with this wide- spread state of mind, and should not be surprised that today science is often looked at with suspicion or open aversion, and that its pres- tige is more and more based on fear and not on the respect it for- merly had. Moreover, the new science may be subjected to new deforma- tions, may be put to other, more subtle uses, in order to conserve and reinforce a social order founded on discrimination and exploi- tation. The aim of science can be subverted to refurbish old reac- tionary ideologies, invoking high-sounding, prestigious scientific confirmation to support reactionary pretensions. Journalists relying on hearsay, superficial and often unscrupulous writers, and, alas, some biologists of meager culture and narrow minds have leaped at the results of molecular biology to wring from them arguments for their reactionary ends. For example, we are told that an extra Y-chromosome accounts for lunatic or criminal behavior. It is then asserted that those who are poor, who have dark skins, who do not get ahead, who do badly</page><page sequence="20">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 297 at school, or who are forced by the social structure to live at the edge of the law have this extra Y-chromosome. They are thus programed to a fate-without-hope, like the demon-ridden people of Lutheran memory. All this, of course, represents a gross misuse and misappropria- tion of the concepts of genotype, phenotype, genetic expression and regulation, not to speak of civilization, historical conditioning, so- cial structure, and so forth. It would certainly be of interest to ana- lyze the cells of captains of industry to see whether these men too, so adventurous and dynamic, tend to exhibit some kind of chromo- some anomaly. Perhaps their aberration is of the same type as that found with substantial frequency among prisoners. We will not here go into the distorted application and the scien- tifically groundless interpretations of the methods for measuring the genetic background of intelligence, especially for the purpose of serving racial discrimination; these matters have recently been sharp- ly criticized by authoritative scientists.10 The point to be stressed is that generally these methods of determining intelligence are applied to those who have been discriminated against from the beginning, who are suspect, who are insecure- those whom others want to main- tain as automata for the unrelenting mechanisms of capitalist society, in which, all too often, "intelligence" means adherence to the sys- tem, adaptation to exploitative machine labor, psychic resistance to the damage of pathologically intense emotional situations. This is an important aspect of the ideological deformation of the new biol- ogy. It is a new version of the old "zoologism," which in an earlier period took the form of social Darwinism. Now the discovery that living beings are at bottom automata, however finely programed, is used to justify the mechanical assimilation of man to other ma- chines, to assembly lines, to the repetitive and automatic tasks that characterize work in the present phase of industrial development. The effort is made to conceal the fact that man is unique, that civilization is an exclusively human phenomenon. Machines and the entire productive apparatus can be put into the service of man- kind, which has created them and can alter them for the sake of 10 C. Burt, "Intelligence and Heredity"; H.

Every means is used to reinforce the distortion that presents man as the slave of supposed "natural laws," of alien machines. But do not biologists say the same thing? At bot- tom, some maintain, we are all machines: the person who works at the lathe or the plow, the plow and lathe themselves, and the man who pockets the profits. Ultimately, perhaps, a way can be found to eliminate the mind, that annoying carryover from the old cos- mology which, conceiving of man as a unique being, is now an ob- stacle to the complete reduction of man to the level of the domestic animals. It is also necessary to mention some extremist deformations of molecular biology, which have a certain influence with the lay pub- lic and are fed by uncritical popularizations and by a new wave of neo-anarchist "critiques" of the increasingly alienated use of science and technology. Some people take an untenably catastrophic view of the outlook for genetic engineering as applied to man. We read that a couple of young American biologists have given up research because they oppose an inevitably distorted use of molecular ge- netics. Their action is pointed to as proof of the essential menacing nature of these developments, of a grave and imminent danger of changes in man's personality and genetic integrity. This conception must be challenged, for one thing because we are still very far from any effectual possibility of genetically mani- pulating the higher animals in the same way in which we are just beginning to manipulate simple model systems made up of bacteria and viruses. It should be noted, moreover, that it is along this lat- ter path that we may perhaps expect the most useful and positive fruits of the new discoveries: the cure for virus diseases, cancer ther- apy, and correction of many serious genetic defects that cause great human unhappiness and suffering. Rejecting genetic research would mean that a substantial step forward in medical knowledge and in the possibility of biological interventions would be totally precluded. This type of progress is, of course, to be considered in a strictly medical sense and subject to the precautions that the clinical sciences and the law have traditionally imposed. If some reactionary govern- ment wanted to make use of genetics for antihuman operations, it would not need to exploit molecular biology; its purpose could be</page><page sequence="22">HISTORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 299 quite adequately served by the scientific baggage of animal breed- ers, as amply demonstrated by the Nazis. Yet it must be said that apart from the justified apprehensions about possible future defor- mations of biological knowledge in a reactionary social context, there is reason even today to question many of the crude methods practiced, precisely because of our limited medical knowledge. We need only recall the lobotomies performed in certain psychiatric cases, without consideration of the personality and integrity of the patient. Finally, I should like to comment briefly on the difficulty that so many people with broad general culture have in seriously grasp- ing the discoveries of genetics and molecular biology. This is a case of anthropomorphism. Many people whose experience covers only the growth of human culture, its adaptive mechanisms of learning and transmitting individual experience, tend by analogy to conceive of natural history in substantially the same terms. It is understand- able that these instinctive tendencies should sometimes be reinforced by the grossly reactionary manner in which Darwinism, genetics, and molecular biology have been distorted. But we should remem- ber that these distortions can be fought effectively only by means of a fuller understanding of this fundamental science, which seeks to interpret correctly the differences between man's social and his bio- logical being, and so does not in any way detract from man's dig- nity and freedom, or from the ideals of equality and social progress. We have to free ourselves from any instinctive sympathy for Lamarckian fantasies and from attempts to invoke the classics of Marxism in order to find objections or confirmations there- some- thing which is impossible after a hundred years of scientific devel- opment. We may be sure that if Engels had at his disposal our cur- rent knowledge, he would have been enthusiastic and would have formulated critical reflections and suggested directions of thought. It is now our task to formulate such reflections and to suggest such directions. Rome, Italy</page></plain_text>
