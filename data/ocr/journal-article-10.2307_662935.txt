<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEST INDIES AND SOUTH AMERICA Anthropological Papers, based principally on studies of the prehistoric archeology and ethnology of the Greater Antilles. ADOLFO DE HOSTOS. (211 pp., 55 figs. San Juan: Office of the Historian, Government of Puerto Rico, 1941.) Most of the papers in this volume by the official historian of Puerto Rico had pre- viously been published elsewhere, a number of them in the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLO- GIST. The majority date back to the decade after the first World War, but a few refer- ences to the results of more recent research have been added. The emphasis is upon prehistoric art, as represented in the archeological collections from the West Indies, and the volume constitutes the first important contribution to this field since the earlier work of Fewkes, Joyce, and Lothrop. With the exception of a discussion of the effects of environment on the peopling of the West Indies, the initial papers are descriptive and analytical. The author exam- ines the nature of one of the styles of pottery in Puerto Rico, of the anthropomorphic stone carvings of the Greater Antilles, and of the stools or duhos characteristic of that area, ending this section of the volume with a paper summarizing the prehistoric art of the Antilles. The reviewer found this to be the most valuable part of the book. Although poorly illustrated and not as fully treated as one might expect from the leigthy bibliography at the end of the volume, the artifacts are discussed with commendable acuteness and attention to detail. The papers in the central part of the book are interpretative rather than descrip- tive, and are intended to demonstrate the religious significance of the art of the Antilles. The unique three-pointed stones of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, for example, are said to have functioned to produce fertility of crops through animistic and magical influ- ences over rainfall, insect pests, and the process of germination. This is not a novel viewpoint, but the author carries it further than it has been before, citing corrobora- tive data from the ethnography of the West Indies, from biology, and from Fraser's Golden Bough.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 129 The last two papers are purely speculative. The first presents a plan for the study of primitive art and the second a theory as to the origin of art. Both these papers suffer from limitations in awareness of the anthropological literature on art; in the final pa- per, for example, it is implied that Paleolithic art evolved originally from a geometric to a realistic stage. In general, the author's interest seems to center in the evolution of Antillean art forms, and in the explanation of these forms in terms of their physical and cultural environment. In pursuance of this interest, several of the papers present hypothetical stages in the development of certain types of art objects. Insofar as these types are functionally rather than stylistically conditioned and are limited to the Greater Antilles where the possibility of diffusion can be ignored, the stages postulated are highly suggestive and they should be checked with the stratigraphical data now becoming available for Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. De Hostos was the first to discover stratigraphy in a pottery-bearing site in the West Indies and in the first of the papers originally published in 1919, he presented a plan, unfortunately never carried out, for a stratigraphical study of Puerto Rican sites. Now, however, he deprecates the value of such work. In the foreward to the pres- ent volume, he states that the time for objective research in the Antilles is past, and that future students should concern themselves with interpretation of the facts already gathered. Insofar as the study of art objects, such as stone collars and three-pointed stones, is concerned, this statement may be true, for fewer and fewer of these antiques come to light as the years go by and they are largely duplicates of forms already known Other approaches, such as the chronological and the technological, however, have scarcely begun to yield the results in the West Indies that have been achieved else- where.
