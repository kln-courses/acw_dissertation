There is, as Gitlin says, a "lovely simplicity" in these words, and in an age when we expect national figures to communicate by way of speech writers it is especially lovely to think that Havel probably wrote the words himself. It is also heartening to see the president confronting, at the beginning of his tenure, the crucial problem any single democracy faces in an interconnected world: how to resolve the conflict between individual and communal needs without encouraging a chauvinistic re- jection of any commitments to the larger human community. But there is also an irony here, and to judge from remarks Havel has made in other contexts, he may be well aware of it. Eastern Europe is in the process of recovering from four decades of communal experience in which mere individual life was indeed transcended, even universalized, in something higher than family, country, firm, or personal success. For most, no doubt, this was an enforced experience of self-transcendence, but for some it was an experience of lovely simplicity, the residue of which, as Timothy Garton Ash has pointed out in The New York Review of Books ( 1 6 August 1 990) , is making the transition to democracy a pain- ful one. These people had known life lived in a grand idea, what Marlow in Heart of Darkness defines as "something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to." As Havel the literary man certainly knows, Conrad's great novel, with its anticipation of Kurtzean ideologues [235 ]</page><page sequence="2">236 THE GEORGIA REVIEW still unborn, dramatizes the dehumanizing consequences of an attraction to such grand ideas. For some time now- and not just for Eastern Europe but for all of Western Civilization- the environment has been the subject, perhaps the idol, of one of these grand ideas. Edward N. Luttwak calls this "com- munitarianism," seeing it as the new ideological challenge to democratic capitalism, and he is also worried about "the continued spread and inten- sification of environmentalist resistance to virtually all interference with nature."1 To appreciate the maneuvering room such resistance has, we might go back a half century to Primitivism and Related Ideas in An- tiquity, in which Arthur O. Lo ve joy and George Boas take into account sixty-six significant normative meanings of the word nature. Love joy and Boas help one see why environmentalists now are moving around in a semantic minefield, and they can make one suspect that a subconscious awareness of this fact has a good deal to do with the apocalyptic excite- ment environmentalists can experience and generate. When an Earth First! activist cuts down power lines or drives spikes into redwood trees to protect them from desecrating lumbermen, he is acting in defense of all the natures there are. Outraged responses to such acts are as likely to shock him now as Darwin's Origin of Species once shocked many funda- mentalist true believers. The Australian philosopher John Passmore is neither a fundamen- talist nor an antiecologist, but when he wrote the still very relevant "Re- moving the Rubbish," he was definitely a critical ecologist.2 To him the first thing necessary in the face of the ecological craze is to get rid of the worthless view "that mysticism can save us, where technology cannot." The philosophies of wholeness in Zoroastrianism and German Idealism he finds suspect because they appeal simultaneously to a need for imma- nence and for an aristocracy in which "the individual is totally sub- merged" (p. 73). Passmore thus anticipates Luttwak's apprehensions about communitarianism, but he is even more worried about our Stoic and Christian tendency to make nature sacred- and in consequence being disinclined to solve our ecological problems "by that old-fashioned pro- cedure, thoughtful action." I don't know whether Passmore would have considered "mysticism" the right word for Kurtz's view of himself and his charismatic effect on 1 "The Shape of Things to Come," Commentary (June 1990), p. 25.

SISK 237 others in Heart of Darkness. Kurtz may have taken "a seat among the devils of the land," but Marlow does not hesitate to place him among "those thunderingly exalted creatures" who are "altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds." Add to this Kurtz's "un- bounded power of eloquence," and we have the very model of a man capable of inspiring mystic adulation- someone like Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao, or Abimael Guzmán of Peru's Shining Path. The very extremism of such figures is itself a sign of their authentic connection with heavenly sights and sounds. However, "mysticism" may be the right word for the radical en- vironmentalism we see now in Bill McKibben's The End of Nature (1989) and Christopher Manes's Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization (1990). Behind such "deep ecology," as it is now called, is the conviction, untenable for Passmore, that "rights" must be extended beyond human beings. Once it is, of course, people end up on a moral level with redwoods, earthworms, Cape fur seals, and the nearest alley cat. "The land which a bad farmer allows to slip into a river," says Passmore, "did not have a 'right' to stay where it was" (p. 187). But for those whom Passmore opposes, a range of problems- nuclear pol- lution, acid rain, ozone depletion, the destruction of Amazonian rain forests and coral reefs- become darling issues in a new and intransigent morality, so that the green rage of Earth First! is a holy rage, and hu- manity, as Earth Firster Dave Foreman has put it, "is a cancer on nature." What's more, in the Earth First! perspective humanity is no less cancerous when its efforts to repair or reclaim the environment are motivated pri- marily by the selfish anthropomorphic desire to make the environment more available for human sport and comfort. In this morality, human beings (as conscienceless litterers and con- sumers) quickly lose their established rights and are ranked below spotted owls and old-growth forests. There are simply too damned many people, so McKibben, with a Luddite's holy logic, is in favor of a population limit of one hundred million. For him, as for Kurtz, the quality of life has priority over mere quantity. It is no wonder that less mystic observers have caught a whiff of totalitarianism here, being unable to forget the population reductions mandated by the economics of certain grand ideas with which the century is painfully familiar. Among environmentalists Earth Firsters are plainly a minority, but they are out on the cutting edge of the issue where the publicity is cheap and abundant, and where the opposition, no longer sure of its own rights, is easily shouted down. Like</page><page sequence="4">238 THE GEORGIA REVIEW all occupiers of cutting edges- the radical lesbians or the IRA in Northern Ireland, for instance- the Earth Firsters are the hyperbolic and visible instance that clarifies a self-transcending cause for many who are in silent agreement with them. For Passmore, of course, Earth Firsters are anti- ecologists because they tend to discourage the pursuit of more limited and realizable objectives. Passmore's restriction of rights to a moral community of human beings makes it unlikely that he would be entirely in sympathy with his fellow Australian philosopher Peter Singer, the renowned vegetarian and champion of animal rights, to say nothing of such activist groups as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, The National Wildlife Federation, and the Animal Liberation Front. In any event, it is just as difficult now to separate animal rights from the environmentalist program as it was in ancient Greece and Rome to separate animalitarianism from the cult of the primitive. On the latter subject Boas and Love joy have much to say. The Greek Cynics Antisthenes, Diogenes of Sinope, Crates, and Menippus advocated a program "which would have arrested all cul- tural progress in the future and have abandoned most of the results of it in the past." Their influence continues into the Roman world, where it can be seen in the works of Seneca, Lucretius, and Cleanthes, and of course their thought resurfaces in subsequent varieties of world-rejection, ranging from the early Christian ascetics to Thoreau. Always important in this tradition has been the belief that the world has degenerated from an earlier period when humans lived comfortably according to nature. Whether this was a condition of soft primitivism or that hard primitivism in which (as Tennyson puts it in In Memoriam) nature is "red in tooth and claw," it was an environment superior to the one the wistful primi- tivists immediately knew- one corrupted by the arts and sciences and the effects of money. We can easily imagine Diogenes (who may, like Havel, have been a playwright) resonating to the Earth First! slogan, "Back to the Pleisto- cene!" He was not enough of an activist to join a mystical gang bent on spiking trees or burning animal-research labs, but given his antianthro- pomorphism, he probably would not have been shocked by the suggestion in an Earth First! journal that AIDS might be a blessing because it prom- ises to reduce the human population without harming the wildlife. Diogenes had the highest possible opinion of the wild, having taken ani- mal life as the model for an existence according to nature. Along with others in his tradition, he believed animals to be physically and morally</page><page sequence="5">JOHN P. SISK 239 superior to people in all sorts of ways, as well as quite capable of teaching lessons that human beings were generally too stupid to learn. Anticipating Marx and Thoreau, Diogenes learned from the animals that the possession of property is what keeps us from living the naturally good life. Such sentiments, however, did not keep him from eating his brother animals (raw, of course, after the fashion of the animals themselves- the culinary arts being manifestations of the corruptions of effete civilization) . Peter Singer might have been scandalized, but Diogenes was only acting on his natural impulses. And if, as some believed, he died after eating a raw octopus, he was simply experiencing to the hilt the natural depths of his ecology. (He was, of course, no kind of feminist, women for him being simply more people; however, he probably would have agreed with the ecofeminists that the "devaluation of natural processes is a product of masculine consciousness."8) By the time of Euripides, according to Boas and Love joy, nature "was taking on the attributes of divinity and becoming an object of piety." Perhaps, then, there was already some of Passmore's mysticism and Luttwak's communitarianism in the primitivism of Diogenes and his kind. One thing is clear, however: the discontent and disgust with civili- zation that we find in the Cynics and some of the Stoics are thoroughly familiar to us. They believed that after a promising and perhaps Hyper- borean beginning in golden times, things had gone wrong as humans de- parted perversely from the way of nature. In due time this realization produced an immense amount of literature, ranging from elegiac regret to that despair of human reason and inventiveness always lurking in the dark shadows of romanticism. Civilization has thus turned out to be not only a painful way of discovering (or inventing) the nature we have lost but an evil magician who has duped us into believing that, in the fullness of time, nurture will triumph over nature- and perhaps, by way of genetic engineering, may even create a brave new world from which no falling away will be pos- sible. For many, no doubt, discontent with their time and place is no more than an expression of the anxiety of being that makes humans so suscep- tible to suggestions that they are not where they belong, that their true home is elsewhere. But others- searchers for a lost paradise who are en- raged with their victimage- are inclined to respond more definitively to 3 See the introduction to Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism , ed. Irene Diamond and Gloria Feman Orenstein (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1990), p.3.</page><page sequence="6">240 THE GEORGIA REVIEW the lure of the Pleistocene. Convinced as these activists are of our moral and physical deterioration, they see around them no signs of that sense of responsibility Havel believes to be so necessary for human survival. Havel was making a moral judgment. He no doubt assumed, as any of us would have in his circumstances, that his judgment was in accor- dance with nature, and he would not have had to worry about which of the sixty-six senses of the term he was assuming. Nevertheless, the ques- tion, What is nature? (with its related question, What is the proper rela- tion between nature and nurture?) is, if anything, more urgent than it ever was- and not least because the complexity of the question is being obscured by passionate simplifiers in the tradition of Diogenes and Con- rad's Kurtz. No one is doing more than the environmentalists, who can themselves be passionate simplifiers, to keep the question urgent and to force us to examine our assumptions; even if they do nothing more than counter the Cartesian habit of disjoining conscious life from nature (1 cogito , ergo non sum natura) they do a great deal. But if human nurtur- ing-our civilizing effort- is seen as hopelessly unnatural, then we are likely to encounter what we take to be nature with disastrously false expectations. Such is demonstrated most dramatically in William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Initially the youngsters in that novel experience the desert island on which they have been deposited in terms of their culture's pas- toral notions about sacred enclaves. Anticipating a soft Hyperborean primitivism, they discover instead the hard primitivism that Hobbes might have led them to expect. During their educational experience, the boys also learn how likely it is that the Kurtzean factor will be lib- erated when nature is separated from nurture, as happens when one group follows the charismatic Jack Merridew into an exciting and communi- tarian precivilized life. But they learn further that to reestablish some degree of civilized order they must oppose their own slothful and quite natural tendency to let nature take its course, as if it were a benevolent mother who must always be submitted to. As Passmore puts it, they learn that "man can only live as a predator, whether on plants or animals," that he "must act as lord and master over at least a segment of nature," and that "it is pointless to suggest that man should do nothing to disturb existing ecological systems, should in no sense attempt to master them." Golding's young men also discover, as William James did, that human life at its best is always lived "on the perilous edge," which allowed James in "The Moral Equivalent of War" to say those good things about the mili-</page><page sequence="7">JOHN P. SISK 241 tary virtues that have always been upsetting to readers who have never given up on soft primitivism. But James also knew how useful those same virtues could be to malcontents who, like Jack Merridew, opposed civi- lization in the name of a higher, self-transcending cause. There is of course no reason why an environmentalist can't accom- modate Passmore and James in his answer to the question What is nature? Thanks to the fancy camera work of television documentaries on wild- life, even the most inveterate couch potatoes know that nature is indeed red in tooth and claw in the interest of survival. Untroubled by the pieties of animal-rights organizations, animals spend a good deal of time pursuing and eating one another; some of them even eat raw octopuses, appar- ently without ill effect. Nature even teaches us to imitate its tough- loving ways in our nurturing of her ecosystems: thus, wildlife researchers would like to place a hundred or so gray wolves in that marvel of human nurturing, Yellowstone National Park, to eat some of the elk and bison whose excessive numbers are a threat to the preserve's well-being. This, of course, is bad news for nearby ranchers, who have little confidence in the wolf's ability to distinguish between bison and steer. Nature, unless one encounters it with the naïveté of the boys in Golding's novel, is conspicuously predatory and competitive. Indeed, it can be argued against intemperate and nature-adoring environmentalists that our familiar disgust with civilization has its roots in the fact that we have learned only too well from nature, so for some readers there is a bitter irony in John J. Mearsheimer's recent essay, "Why We Will Soon Miss the Cold War": "The remarkably stable system that emerged in Europe in the late 1940's," he says, "was the unintended consequence of an intense competition between the superpowers."4 In Mearsheimer's terms this bal- ancing standoff is a quite natural way to maintain the international politi- cal ecosystem. Perhaps such an ironic interplay of potentially hostile forces would disturb us less if we could see nature and nurture in the same creative conjunction that Polixenes does in Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. Perdita, who thinks she is a shepherd's daughter (though she is actually a princess who will ultimately become Polixenes' daughter-in-law), refuses to gather "streaked gillyvors" because their "piedness" represents a horti- cultural interference with "great creating nature." Polixenes counters that "Nature is made better by no mean / But Nature makes that 4 The Atlantic (August 1990), p. 50.</page><page sequence="8">242 THE GEORGIA REVIEW mean . . . so that the horticulturist's art "does mend Nature, change it rather, but / The art itself is Nature." Polixenes anticipates R. Buck- minster Fuller's much later refusal to accept the conventional distinction between the artificial and the natural: "I saw that everything I was ex- periencing couldn't be experienced unless nature permitted it, and it was all part of the extraordinary pattern of the universe, and therefore every bit of it was, I might say, not artificial but natural."5 Fuller, as he himself said, was a generalist who always looked toward the big pattern, and his perspective was thus always ecological. Passmore, however, might have sensed in Fuller's thinking another of those philoso- phies of wholeness "in which the individual is totally submerged." In such a philosophy, Havel's worry about the lack of individual moral responsi- bility would be relieved in a way he hardly intended, but was in fact al- ready too familiar with. And Fuller wouldn't have satisfied the deep ecologists either: by refusing to honor their pious distinction between the artificial and the natural, he threatens to take the high moral ground away from them. It would be like telling Diogenes that his awareness of him- self as a follower of nature was itself an artifice of civilization. Deep ecologists would sense yet another enemy behind the late microbiologist René Dubos' remark that "human intervention into nature can be creative."6 Fuller and Passmore could agree with this, though the latter would have a problem with Dubos' earlier rejection of "the fashionable theory that the Judeo-Christian tradition is responsible for the Western desecration of nature" (see his much-admired A God Within , still environmentally relevant after twenty-nine years).7 Dubos would reject mysticism for the same reason that Passmore does, but he is more concerned with the pessimism about the environment that goes with a false reverence of nature. Reverence is not enough "because man has never been a passive witness of nature: and cannot be now if he is to survive in his stewardship of his total environment" (p. 173). Neither was it enough for the Jesuit writer James V. Schall, who, contemplating the people- denigrating and nature-worshiping "new religion that is spreading in America," wondered if ecology wasn't an American heresy; the ques- 5 "What I Am Trying To Do," in The Oxford Reader , ed.

SISK 243 tion is as pertinent now as when he asked it twenty years ago.8 Certainly this new religion has elements of Manichaeism, Gnosticism, and panthe- ism, heresies with strong roots in American soil. Perhaps we should gather all three into an updating term like "telluric heresy" to indicate the ex- tent to which, for the deep ecologiste, the earth has become a God-replac- ing icon. "Despite what the conservationists say, nature will go on," Dubos remarks (as Darwin had in effect said earlier), "even if whooping cranes, condors, or redwoods are exterminated, just as it has gone on after the earlier extinction of millions of other species. . . . Destruction always re- sults in different creation." Dubos' admiration, therefore, goes less to the Franciscans (whose reverence for nature has been influentially admired by the historian Lynn White) than to the medieval Dominicans. The latter were creative manipulators of nature who, by destroying the old barriers between the manual and the liberal arts, "created an atmosphere in which European technology and science could develop." Having ac- cepted "man's unique place in the cosmos," Dubos would not likely be dis- turbed now by accusations of selfish anthropomorphism. By the same token, the prospect of a return to the Pleistocene would be for him out- rageously contra naturam-. "Early men, aided especially by that most use- ful and most noxious of all animals, the Mediterranean goat," he reminds animalitarians, "were probably responsible for more deforestation and erosion than all the bulldozers of the Judeo-Christian World."9 Dubos is as impressed by the ineluctable variety of nature as is Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet : The earth that's Nature's mother is her tomb, What is her burying grave, that is her womb; And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some, and yet all different. This was once known as the doctrine of the plenitude, the belief that the Creator by His very nature was bound to copious creation- so that, as another priest, Gerard Manley Hopkins, puts it in "God's Grandeur," "nature is never spent." When Tennyson's friend Darwin contemplates 8 America , 27 March 197 1, p. 308. ® A God Withvn , p. 160.</page><page sequence="10">244 THE GEORGIA REVIEW this copiousness at the end of Origin of Species , he exclaims, "There is a grandeur in this view of life . . . from so simple a beginning forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved." But without Friar Lawrence's or Hopkins' faith in a Supreme Ecolo- gist, this very copiousness can be unsettling. Tennyson was often un- settled in his faith, and his son Hallam reports him saying, "The lavish profusion too in the natural world appalls me, from the growths of the tropical forest to the capacity of man to multiply, the torrent of babies." In In Memoriam he wonders if God and nature are at strife, since "so care- ful of the type she seems, / So careless of the single life." And there is nature's appalling profligacy: "of fifty seeds / She often brings but one to life." Being a humane man, however, Tennyson would have been no less appalled by McKibben's thought that a little more carelessness about single lives might be a good thing. Tennyson in any event is expressing a sentiment with which we are now thoroughly familiar: the anxiety of affluence that entails not only the fear that abundance will prove so addictive that anything less will be in- tolerable but also the fear that, by proving ultimately to be unmanage- able, our affluence will terminate in unprecedented impoverishment. We are uneasy and guilt stricken in our abundance, and thus we are easy prey to cynical denigrations of our nurtured well-being- and to apocalyp- tic predictions that we are about to lose everything or to become so over- heated in a greenhouse universe that everything might as well be nothing. For radical environmentalists who have no faith in the economy of nature as understood by Friar Lawrence, Darwin, and Dubos, the everything we squandering spendthrifts are about to lose is Nature itself. Skepticism about language itself, which is a part of our uneasiness about our total environment, is now a cultural fixture in Western civili- zation. It is interesting to see Havel giving expression to this skepticism on the occasion of his receiving the Peace Prize of the German Booksellers Association. In his address Havel is concerned about the frequency with which, in all-too-recent memory, noble and liberating words have been used to debase and enslave. He is struck with "how easy it is for a well- intentioned cause to be transformed into the betrayal of its own good intentions" because of "the fiendish way that words are capable of betray- ing us. . . ." Therefore, "it always pays to be suspicious of words and to be wary of them."10 10 Reprinted in The New York Review of Books , 18 January 1990, pp. 5-8.</page><page sequence="11">JOHN P. SISK 245 But not much later Havel himself had to risk using some of those noble, liberating, but often abused words when he delivered his New Year's Day address to his countrymen. He even used words that might have led Bill McKibben and Christopher Manes to think of him as a likely recruit for their cause: "We have laid waste to our soil and the rivers and the forests our forefathers bequeathed us," he said, "and we have the worst environment in all Europe today."11 For Havel, however, it is clearly not the earth but humans on the earth who come first. Because he had no mystic simplicities to offer (he could assume that his audience had had enough of them), he could put his emphasis on the decayed moral environment which was the heritage of a regime driven by an "arrogant and intolerant ideology." That regime had been notable for its tran- scendentally motivated carelessness about the single life- the same amo- rality that had so disturbed Tennyson when he considered the copious operations of nature. For all Havel's earlier skepticism about words, then, in his address he spoke as if he believed that language is never spent- that, in language as in nature, fresh creation can follow corruption and destruction. If one cannot believe this, there is no hope for the writer, none for the single or communal life, and none for the environment either. Without such a para- doxically fecund nature, no ecology, however deep- not even that of the Earth Firsters' Pleistocene- could ever have recovered from the Medi- terranean goat. 11 Reprinted in News' week, 15 January 1990, p. 42.</page></plain_text>
