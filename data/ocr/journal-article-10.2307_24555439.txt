<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brown University Abydos Project: Preliminary Report on the First Two Seasons Laurel Bestock Abstract The first two seasons of excavation by the Brown University Abydos Project occurred in the Abydos North Cemetery in the winters of2008-9 and 2010-11. Our research questions focus both on specific time periods and on the longue durée development of the North Cemetery as a sacred space. Prelimi nary results have advanced our knowledge in important ways, particularly regarding Early Dynastic royal buildings in this area and Ptolemaic reuse of the same places. In particular, we have discovered a previously unknown monument of the type usually referred to as a funerary enclosure. This royal cultic structure is associated with pottery that dates it to the time of transition from Dynasty 0 to Dynasty 1, though no royal name has yet been discovered. Adjacent to this monument and in other parts of the site we have uncovered diverse Ptolemaic remains: finds excavated during the first two seasons included one large private tomb, parts of a hypogeum used for the burial of ibis mummies, and part of one domestic structure in an area shown by magnetometry survey to be a dense settlement site. The Brown University Abydos Project (BUAP) was founded in 2008 to conduct excavations in the western section of the Abydos North Cemetery (fig. 1). The project operates under the aegis of the larger University of Pennsylvania Museum-Yale University-Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Expedition to Abydos (PYIFA), which holds the concession for all of the North Cemetery and works in conjunction with the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.1 The research focus of the BUAP is explicitly diachronic, as this area of the North Cemetery has been in use from the Early Dynastic period until today. This report will briefly state the operational aspects of the first two seasons of the BUAP, will discuss the rationale for excavating in the areas that have so far been opened, and will then present a chronologically organized discussion of our major finds and preliminary interpretations. Background material from earlier excavations will be referred to when necessary to explain the impor tance of recent findings. 1 The PYIFA is co-directed by David O'Connor and William Kelly Simpson. Matthew D. Adams serves as Associate Director, and the author as Assistant Director. The BUAP project represents an expansion of excavations I first undertook for my disserta tion, which was supervised by David O'Connor. The intellectual and logistical support of David O'Connor and Matthew D. Adams have been essential for the formation of the BUAP, and I am happy here to express my deep gratitude to them both. Staff of the first two BUAP seasons were: Reis Ibrahim Mohamed Ali, Taha el-Saman Ali, Susanne Arenhôvel, Sean Bagge, Ahmed Mahmoud Berbery, Amanda Davis, Erin Fairburn, James Gill, Kathryn Howley, Christian Knoblauch, Alexander Makovics, Lisa Mawdsley, Gaea McGahee, Emily Russo, Timothy Sandiford, Ahmed Fahmy el-Saman, Nabil Fahmy el-Saman, Ramadan Mohamed Suleiman, Simon Sullivan, Caroline Swan, and Julia Troche. Our inspectors were Alaa Abdelhalim Abdullah and Samir Ahmed Abdelatif. I am grateful to all members of the two teams, without whom this work could not have been accomplished. I particularly thank Mr. Samir, who took the extraordinary step of moving to Abydos from Sohag for part of the second season to facilitate access to some of our finds when they had to be deposited in our magazines, under lock and seal, every night. The coins and sculpture discussed in conjunction with the Ptolemaic ibis hypogeum below could not have been documented in any suitable detail without his help. 35</page><page sequence="2">36 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 1. Plan of Abydos showing the North Cemetery in context. The first season of the BUAP took place between 15 December 2008 and 10 January 2009. This season included the opening of six excavation units and a ceramics study component. For the most part excavation units were laid out as 10 χ 10m units on the site grid established many years ago and in use by all projects operating as parts of the PYIFA. In areas that were constrained by the presence of modern walls or in places where the ancient architecture made grid units impractical, units did not follow the grid. Units are numbered sequentially in a series begun by the PYIFA in 2001, and a com mon artifact database is maintained by the BUAP and the PYIFA. This decision was taken to facilitate research on questions that require an integrated approach; the Institute of Fine Arts at New York Uni versity is also currently undertaking substantial excavations in many areas of the North Cemetery, and it was felt necessary that no arbitrary line be drawn dividing material that belonged together anciently. All excavation units were backfilled at the end of the season by the PYIFA, which held an excavation season following Brown's. The second season of the BUAP took place between 19 December 2010 and IB January 2011. This season included the opening of five excavation units as well as a ceramics study component. Again, most units were laid out as 10 χ 10m squares on the grid, with exceptions where architecture modern or ancient dictated. The units opened in 2010-11 were backfilled in February 2011 under the supervi sion of Ahmed Regab and Reis Ibrahim Muhammad. The PYIFA was not able to supervise the backfill ing, having left the country during the revolution.</page><page sequence="3">BESTOCK 37 Fig. 2. Plan of northern Abydos showing the three areas excavated by the Brown University Abydos Project in its first two seasons. Areas under Excavation The first two seasons of the BUAP included excavations in three discrete areas (fig. 2). All three were known to contain ancient remains prior to the BUAP excavations thanks to magnetometry survey or excavation or both, all conducted by the PYIFA prior to the formation of the BUAP. The three areas are 1) immediately south of the Coptic Village, Deir Sitt Damiana, directly in front of the modern Coptic cemetery; 2) in an "island" inside the modern cemetery that had been left free of graves; 3) over 300 meters north of the other areas, adjacent to Peet's Cemetery D and close to the modern village of Beni Mansur. For the purpose of this report these areas will be referred to as Areas 1, 2 and 3. This terminology has no application outside this report but is maintained here for clarity and simplicity. Area 1 contains a large Ptolemaic family tomb. This had been cut through an Early Dynastic funer ary enclosure that was excavated in 2004-5. The location and extent of this tomb were thus entirely known prior to the formation of the BUAP, but the tomb had not been completely excavated. The BUAP opened this area to complete the excavation and recording of this tomb for publication. The excavation has been completed but further study seasons are necessary to ready the artifacts for final publication.</page><page sequence="4">38 JARCE 48 (2012) Areas 2 and 3 had been covered by a magnetometry survey conducted by Tomasz Herbich for the PYIFA over several years from 2002 to 2009. Area 2, the grave-free island in the cemetery, had very strong traces of parallel walls of what was clearly a complex subterranean structure. A 5 χ 5m test unit excavated by the PYIFA in 2003 demonstrated the presence of a brick wall corresponding to a line shown by the magnetic survey, and pottery and coins suggested that the area had been in use during the Ptolemaic period. On the basis of these finds, the PYIFA negotiated with the local priests and villag ers to fence off the area and preserve it for future excavation. The BUAP excavations in this area were designed primarily to clarify the nature of the Ptolemaic remains, although it was also thought possible that there would be Early Dynastic remains accessible here. The basis of this hypothesis was a prelimi nary report published by John Garstang. In 1906 he excavated a "fine tomb of the First Dynasty," the location of which was described as being northwest of the Shunet ez-Zebib (the funerary enclosure of the Second Dynasty king Khasekhemwy, see fig. 2) and directly beside a Coptic cemetery. Furthermore it was cut by "a series of vast subterranean vaults"2 whose description seemed, even before excavation, not unlike the structure with parallel walls discovered in the magnetic survey. While we could not be certain that Garstang's tomb was within the area of the island—and we still cannot be certain, as we have not relocated the tomb—this was the only accessible place that well-matched the description of its location. This area has, in fact, yielded the remains of an Early Dynastic cultic structure of the type known as a funerary enclosure. Both the Early Dynastic and Ptolemaic remains in Area 2 are still under excavation. Area 3 appeared on the magnetic survey to contain settlement remains. As surface pottery was pre dominantly Late Roman, it was hypothesized that a settlement of that era was present. Initial excava tions have confirmed the urban character of the area but suggest that its date is Ptolemaic with limited Late Roman reuse. Analysis of the results from this area is extremely preliminary. Early Dynastic The Early Dynastic material excavated by the BUAP contributes to a still-evolving picture of royal cult at the very earliest period of Egyptian kingship. This topic is being illuminated not only by the work of the BUAP but also by work of the PYIFA in adjacent areas of the North Cemetery. Early Dynastic material has been uncovered by the BUAP in both Area 1 and Area 2. Area 1 was already known to have important early First Dynasty remains on the basis of PYIFA excavations; the Ptole maic tomb that is our focus there had been cut through a small funerary enclosure dated to the reign of Aha (the northernmost Aha enclosure is visible on fig. 6). This enclosure and its twin, another small enclosure of Aha immediately to the southwest, were excavated in 2004-5.3 A third enclosure dated to the reign of Aha is much larger and lies to the southeast of Area 1. Collectively, these three enclosures were the earliest definitively attributed such structures at the time the BUAP was formed. Another enclosure in the near vicinity also clearly dates to the early First Dynasty, but it cannot be attributed to a specific king as it has no associated material inscribed with a royal name. This enclo sure had donkeys in its subsidiary graves. It has been debated if it dates immediately before or im mediately after the reign of Aha.4 The discovery and excavation of these four enclosures by the PYIFA demonstrated the importance of this area and this type of monument at the very beginning of dynastic history and royal monu mental building programs. They also gave new insight into the function of enclosures. Two of the 2 J. Garstang, "Excavations at Abydos 1909: Preliminary description of the principal finds," AAA 2 (1909), 125; S. Snape, "Mortuary Assemblages from Abydos" (Ph.D. diss., University of Liverpool, 1986), 66. 3 L. Bestock, The Development of Royal Funerary Cult at Abydos: Two Funerary Enclosures from the Reign of Aha (Wiesbaden, 2009). 4 Bestock, Royal Funerary Cult, 86-87.</page><page sequence="5">BESTOCK 39 Aha enclosures had remains of small brick structures in their interiors; both had low benches in their northern rooms, and both had substantial remains of organic substances as well as ceramics. These buildings are analogous to those already known from the Second Dynasty enclosures at Abydos. This made clear that offering activity was a chief part of the function of the enclosures from their inception. Furthermore, destruction levels dating to an early period at the newly discovered enclosures supported the argument that ritual destruction of these monuments was part of their use-life. BUAP excavations since 2008 have continued to find loose Early Dynastic sherds in Area 1, presum ably associated with the known enclosures in the immediate vicinity. These finds do not change our understanding of the number or nature of enclosures in this immediate area, but they may offer nu ance to arguments about the use-life and destruction of enclosures. Analysis of the ceramics from the current BUAP excavations as well as PYIFA excavations in the Aha and donkey enclosure areas shows the regular presence of Second Dynasty beer jars5 despite an absence of Second Dynasty architecture. There is also no evidence from the currently known First Dynasty enclosures of cult offerings be ing given into the Second Dynasty, or indeed, over generations in the First. The presence of Second Dynasty pottery is thus perhaps surprising; it seems possible that it instead relates to the destruction phase of the enclosures. If this is correct, the destruction would have taken place somewhat later than is usually assumed.6 The BUAP excavations in Area 2 have substantially complicated our understanding of the early his tory of funerary enclosures. Beginning in the 2008-9 season, a wealth of broken Naqada IIIcl pottery was found in this area, substantially northwest of all funerary enclosures known at that time. In 2011, remains of a previously unknown enclosure were also found in this area. While the enclosure cannot currently be dated to a specific reign, it is possible or even probable that it dates prior to any previously known such monuments. The Naqada IIIcl ceramic material from the 2008-9 season includes at least two cylinder jars of standard size, two "elongated" cylinder jars, three red slipped bowls, five large storage "wine" jars be longing to three different types, one ovoid "beer" jar, and numerous rough, unslipped wares. Although found as sherds, the material is generally well preserved and multiple complete or near complete vessels have been reconstructed (fig. 3). The sherds were heavily concentrated in an area predomi nantly on top of the large Ptolemaic ibis galleries; the nature of this deposit suggested that the ceram ics might be from a context that was disturbed only after the construction of the hypogeum, possibly from Garstang's tomb or one associated with it. Excavation in 2010-11 in adjacent areas continued to uncover substantial numbers of early sherds. Many of these were found to join vessels that had been partially reconstructed in 2008-9. In total, remains of over forty vessels have been excavated. The as semblage is closely parallel to tomb assemblages known from numerous sites, including Abydos, dated to the Naqada IIIcl. In addition to ceramics, some other artifacts of comparable date were discovered loose in the sand above and adjacent to the ibis galleries. These include five fragments of mud sealing with the im pression of a cylinder seal or seals on them (fig. 4). Five fragments of early stone vessels were also recovered here. These finds are consistent with the finds from other funerary enclosures and their subsidiary graves. The discovery of the Naqada IIIcl pottery and other artifacts suggested that the nearby area would be the most likely place to find Garstang's tomb and/or otherwise unknown Naqada IIIc architecture. 5 C. Knoblauch, "Burial and Cult during the Reign of Aha: final report on the pottery from the Aha II and III enclosures at Abydos," forthcoming. 6 D. O'Connor and M. Adams, "The Royal Mortuary Enclosures of Abydos and Hierakonpolis," in Z. Hawass, Treasures of the Pyramids (Cairo, 2003), 84, suggest that the destruction took place immediately after the primary use of each enclosure was complete, presumably at the death of the king who built it.</page><page sequence="6">40 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 3.

Drawings by Christian Knoblauch. While no tomb has yet been found, part of the south-western wall of a funerary enclosure was found in January of 2011 (fig. 5). This wall is very poorly preserved, present in most places to much less than a single course of bricks. What remains of the wall is entirely typical of known early First Dynasty enclosures. Its bricks measure 11-12 χ 24-26cm (the height of the bricks could not be determined). The southwest, outer, face of the wall is decorated with a simple pattern of narrow niches. After</page><page sequence="7">BESTOCK 41 the niched wall was plastered, a construction was built abutting it; while this is so badly eroded here that its top is not present, analogy with other known enclosures and mastabas suggest this was a low bench built around the exterior of the enclosure. The wall and bench together measure 2.80m wide. In places the bench alone has remained while the wall has been entirely de stroyed or eroded. The total length of the bench or bench and wall as found through January 2011 is 16m. The wall and bench were built directly on a prepared gebel surface with no foundation trench. This relatively flat and hard surface ap pears to have been made by leveling the desert and pouring water over it. No evidence of wall destruction debris has been found in association with the new enclosure. It is impossible on present evidence to estimate the size of the newly discovered enclosure. The length of wall discovered in 2011 does make it certain that this enclosure is larger than the small est Aha enclosure, and almost certainly is larger than the other small Aha enclosure. It is possible that the south corner of the new enclosure is or was near the entrance to the ibis hypogeum. The stairway of that entrance is built at a noticeable angle and this may have been intended to accom modate the remains of an earlier building, even if it was only present as a footprint.7 This area is be neath a used part of the modern cemetery and is thus inaccessible to excavation. The west corner of the enclosure was not found during the 2010-11 season but may be accessible, depending on its loca tion, in future seasons. The southwestern wall itself is almost directly adjacent to a wall of the modern cemetery, meaning that none of the interior of the building nor its other three walls will be accessible. Despite the inaccessibility of much of the new monument, the mere presence of a new enclosure and its distance from the previously known enclosures are significant (fig. 6). In general, the progres sion of enclosures seems to follow a chronological arrangement from northwest to southeast.8 As the discovered part of the new enclosure is some fifty meters northwest of the previously northwestern most known examples—the small Aha enclosures—it is not unreasonable to suggest that we have here an earlier enclosure. This is in part supported by the ceramics, for while no royal name or other inscription has yet been found on them, they are dated by numerous parallels for individual types and for the assemblage as a whole to the early Naqada IIIcl, either the reign of Narmer or Aha.

This is presumably because the river and the line between the floodplain and the low desert run at this angle in this area. As such, the northwest to southeast progression of enclosures is notionally a north to south progression. Deciding whether to use cardinal or "local" directions is a perennial problem when writing about Abydos. Here I have chosen to use cardinal directions in most cases as it makes maps easier to read.</page><page sequence="8">42 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 5.

The arrow on a) shows the location and direction from which the photograph was taken. Note the proximity of the limestone wall of the modern cemetery. this enclosure is the earliest known, predating Aha, it is the first solid evidence we have of royal cultic activity. It is also the first known monumental royal building in Egypt. Since the royal tombs at Umm el-Qaab saw a marked increase in scale under Aha,9 any enclosure from prior to his reign suggests that the first impulse towards monumental architecture in the nascent Egyptian state was applied to cult structures rather than tombs. On the other hand, if the new enclosure dates to the reign of Aha, then this king had a remarkable, even exuberant, building program in the North Cemetery. Given the amount of space between the new enclosure and those already known, there is also a reasonable probability that additional enclosures were built. If the northwest to southeast progression always held true, these would then also have to date to Aha. Any additional Aha enclosures, on top of the three already known, call into question the previous interpretation that those enclosures were built for the king plus the two individuals interred 9 W. Kaiser and G. Dreyer, "Umm el-Qaab: Nachuntersuchungen im frûhzeitlichen Koniesfriedhof 1. Vorbericht," MDAIK 38 (1982), 214-15.</page><page sequence="9">BESTOCK 43 Fig. 5b.

The newly discovered enclosure lies some 50m northwest of any previously known enclosure. in the largest subsidiary graves at his tomb.10 If Aha had more than three enclosures, the apparent congruity between his tomb and enclosures is lost, and a new explanation for the proliferation of his enclosures must be sought. A third scenario is also plausible: that the lately discovered enclosure was built by Narmer or even an earlier king for cult during his reign, but that any subsidiary graves around it, from which the ceramics presumably came, were built or at least filled by Aha. Too little is currently known about the relation ship between the life-cycle of enclosures and the kings who built them to assess this hypothesis clearly. Furthermore, as we may or may not stand at the beginning of the entire practice of enclosure building, it cannot be assumed that the construction and use of this enclosure followed the same patterns that appear well established somewhat later in the First Dynasty. It is to be hoped that further excavations will provide more information about this enclosure, its presumed subsidiary grave(s), and its date. Before leaving the latest Early Dynastic finds at Abydos and the early development of enclosures, it should be noted that this monument type plays an important part in broader discussions of the de velopment of early kingship. Enclosures certainly go back to the reign of Aha and now possibly to the reign of Narmer. All Early Dynastic kings buried at Abydos seem to have built enclosures. No one who 10 Bestock, Royal Funerary Cult.</page><page sequence="11">BESTOCK 45 was not a king, with the possible exception of Aha's close relations as noted above, is known to have an enclosure. Enclosures were thus the most visible and specific statements about kingship we know of from this period. It is also quite possible that enclosures were built before the reign of Narmer. Giinter Dreyer first suggested this, hypothesizing that the tombs at Umm el-Qaab following U-j were smaller in size than that tomb because their builders were also constructing enclosures near the cultivation.11 If there were generations of pre-Aha enclosures, this strengthens their apparent relationship to that other unmistakable, incontrovertible, symbol of early kingship: the serekh. The visual relationship is clear and has long been recognized, for what do enclosures look like but three dimensional serekhs? They are rectangular structures with niched walls, enclosing a space of prime importance to early kings. Furthermore, each king built his own, just as each king had a unique serekh. The usual assump tion is that both serekhs and enclosures reflect the form of the royal palace, but need this be so?12 Is it not equally probable that serekhs represent enclosures, rather than enclosures representing palaces or serekhs? This argument is much stronger if the development of the enclosure as a built form coincides with the development of the serekh as a symbol of kingship, in Dynasty 0. Suggestive as the relation ship is, the question cannot be answered definitively in the absence of early royal palaces. First Intermediate Period/Middle Kingdom No Old Kingdom material has been recovered in Brown's excavations. First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom pottery was found in disturbed contexts in Area 1 during earlier seasons of the PYIFA.13 Very little architecture associated with that pottery has been found, probably because the extensive later activity in the area destroyed it. Likewise, a moderate amount of First Intermedi ate Period and Middle Kingdom pottery has been found in disturbed contexts in Area 2 within the modern cemetery. Only very small amounts of architecture that might be related to this material have been uncovered. To the northwest of the hypogeum, between the substructure and the superstructure wall, was part of a small brick wall. This is almost certainly part of the top of a tomb shaft. The brick lining of this shaft had been mostly destroyed by the construction of the hypogeum, the cut for which is clear. As such the shaft could not be excavated. Both the brick size and this type of shaft are typical of tombs of this period in the North Cemetery.14 Five meters northwest of this shaft was the bottom of a very simple chapel. Three bricks were placed together to form a U, with the open end pointing to the northeast (local east). Mud plaster coated the interior of the chapel and the ground immediately in front of it. A very small stela or ostracon could have been placed within this chapel, though none remained; a single ceramic "offering peg" was found in front of it (fig. 7). This size and type of chapel has been found many places in the North Cemetery in connection with shaft tombs of the Middle Kingdom and First Intermediate Period.15 The ceramics from the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom in this area consist primarily of bag jars, many of which have been found intact, loose in the sand above the Ptolemaic hypogeum. 11 G. Dreyer, U. Hartung, and F. Pumpenmeir, "Umm el-Qaab: Nachuntersuchungen im frùhzeitlichen Kônigsfriedhof. 5-/6. Vorbericht," MDAIK 49 (1993), n. 4; G. Dreyer, Umm el-Qaab I: das Pràdynastische Kônigsgrab U-j und seine friihen Schriftzeugnisse (Mainz am Rhein, 1998), 19.1 initially thought it likely that Aha, builder of the first monumental tomb, was also likely the first to build an enclosure. The new find makes me more comfortable admitting the possibility that the history of this type of monument may stretch back much farther. 12 For a recent discussion that makes this assumption, see D. Arnold "The Serekh Palace Revisited," in E. Czerny, ed., Timelines: studies in honor of Manfred Bietak (Leuven, 2006), 37-45. 13 Knoblauch and Bestock, "Four Thousand Years," 224-29. 14 J. Richards, Society and Death in Ancient Egypt: mortuary landscapes of the Middle Kingdom (Cambridge, 2005). 15 A photograph of nearly identical chapels, termed there "mini mastabas," as well as drawings of pottery of the same types discussed here, can be found in Richards, Society and Death, 162-63.</page><page sequence="12">46 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 7. Miniature offering chapel of the Middle Kingdom with pottery of similar date, Area 2. A smaller number of roughly shaped "offering peg" jars have also been found. All of the excavated ceramics and architecture of this date appear to relate to burial and related cultic activity. The con struction of the hypogeum probably destroyed the majority of the tombs and chapels in this area.16 The distribution of First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom pottery is worthy of note in part because it contributes to an ongoing dialog about how those working at Abydos define areas of the site and understand the limits of ancient uses of Abydos. Starting with Mariette in the 19th century the general term "North Cemetery" has been applied to a loosely defined area stretching from Kom es-Sultan in the northeast and from the processional wadi in the southeast to less defined lines on the north- and southwest.17 Janet Richards, who has done the most exhaustive study of Middle Kingdom remains in the cemeteries of Abydos, conducted a survey and subsequent excavation in the North Cemetery with a northwestern limit approximately equal to the northwestern line of the First Dynasty enclosures of Djer and Djet (see fig. 6).18 While the concession at that time and the practicalities of a field season would not have permitted an inclusion of areas farther to the northwest, that survey did seem to suggest a northwestern limit for Middle Kingdom remains that has subsequently proved not to 16 All of the ceramics are being studied and will be published by Christian Knoblauch. 17 B. Kemp, "Abydos," LdÀ I, 34. The difficulty of drawing a map that reflects the long and complicated history of excavation in the Abydos North Cemetery was addressed by B. Kemp and R. Merrillees, Minoan Pottery in Second Millennium Egypt (Mainz am Rhein, 1980), 287. 18 Richards, Society and Death, 159.</page><page sequence="13">BESTOCK 47 be the case. Work at the base of the village in 2004-5 already suggested that our understanding of the progression of development needed to be updated.19 The first two seasons of the BUAP have found similar First Intermediate Period and very early Middle Kingdom remains even farther to the north west than previously known. There does not seem to be any reason to exclude the area covered by the modern cemetery from our understanding of the ancient limits of the North Cemetery. The presence of an Early Dynastic enclosure makes this clear for the early period, and the ceramic and architectural remains of the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom make it equally clear for the late third millennium B.C. Unfortunately most of the area to the northwest of the current BUAP excavations has been converted into agricultural fields. As such it is unlikely that we will ever be able to map the ancient limits of what we call the Northern Cemetery. New Kingdom to Late Period Like the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom, the millennium from the New Kingdom to the Late Period is represented only sparsely in Brown's excavations. This is again more likely to relate to destruction by the later hypogeum and perhaps to the relative poverty of graves of these periods than to a lack of substantial use of the cemetery over this time span. Clear evidence of New Kingdom activity has been found by the BUAP only in Area 2. Here the New Kingdom may be represented by a single brick-built tomb that was incompletely excavated to the northwest of the staircase to the hy pogeum. This structure consisted of an attached small brick-lined shaft and a small brick vault. This type of tomb is known from other excavations in the North Cemetery that have uncovered examples clearly dated to the New Kingdom.20 The top of our example was not entirely cleared due to its depth and proximity to a wall of the modern cemetery. The top of the vault had a large hole in it, suggest ing it had been plundered. The interior has not yet been excavated at all, so the date offered here is speculative. Artifacts of the New Kingdom consist of small amounts of ceramics and shabtis. Fragments of one or more painted pots with hieroglyphs appear to be New Kingdom shabti jars. Numerous ceramic shabtis have been recovered (fig. 8). The shabtis and related material are being studied for publication by Emily Russo, who has dated them to the Ramesside Period. One almost complete and several partial coffin burials have been discovered in the excavations within the modern cemetery. Wood in general in Abydos fares quite badly, being substantially eaten by insects.21 All of the coffins or parts of coffins discovered were reduced entirely to frass, leaving only dark stains in the sand. As such, they could not be excavated as objects. The only intact coffin burial was an anthropoid coffin with a large wig, head pointed northwest, to the northwest of the hypogeum. Its foot had been cut during construction of the hypogeum. This coffin was cleaned and recorded as best as possible, but it was not removed nor was its interior excavated. No paint remained on this example, but other anthropoid coffins elsewhere in the North Cemetery have on occasion retained some gesso and paint. The coffin burials are undated, but the anthropoid coffin cannot be earlier than the Middle Kingdom and almost certainly dates to the New Kingdom or later. It is noteworthy that all of the activity documented by the BUAP in the North Cemetery from after the Early Dynastic Period and before the Ptolemaic Period relates to private burials. 19 Knoblauch and Bestock, "Four Thousand Years," 245-46. 20 For example, T. Peet, Cemeteries II, 84 and T. Peet and W. Loat, Cemeteries III, 29. 21 This can happen surprisingly quickly. The vaulted family tomb discussed below was first found and partially excavated in 2004-5. At that time a steel and wooden brace was built to shore up a part of one vault that was in danger of collapsing. Excava tions were not finished, and the tomb was backfilled. When this vault was reopened in 2010 the wood was found to be riddled with holes. It had lost all of its structural integrity in only five years, and the brace could no longer support the brickwork.</page><page sequence="14">48 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 8. New Kingdom shabtis found in disturbed contexts within Area 2. The Ptolemaic Period All three areas excavated by the BUAP have yielded substantial Ptolemaic remains, all of different nature. No longer were private burials the only activity in the North Cemetery. In discussing these remains I will address our areas sequentially by their arbitrary numbers. The specific relationship be tween these areas is unknown as the dating of each within the Ptolemaic period is not yet clear. In fact, it is highly likely that each was used over many generations. Whether or not the same people used all three areas is unknown. Area 1 : a large tomb In Area 1, the BUAP has completed excavation of a large private tomb first found in 2004 during excavations under the PYIFA. A preliminary discussion of the architecture and finds from 2004-5 has been published,22 but subsequent work has changed our understanding of this building. Its history is complex, with at least two major building phases in its life as a tomb as well as a subsequent phase when part of it was reused as a dwelling. The tomb was built entirely of mud brick (figs. 9 and 10). It consists of three separate barrel vaults, each fronted by a small antechamber, also vaulted. Two of the vaults lie parallel to one another while the third is perpendicular to the other two. Each antechamber had two arched doorways; in two cases these had clearly been sealed with bricks and plaster, and this was probably the case in the third an techamber as well. The antechambers were reached by short, sloped, ramps cut into the sand of the 22 Knoblauch and Bestock, "Four Thousand Years," 230-45.</page><page sequence="15">BESTOCK 49 Fig. 9.

This photograph was taken in 2004. desert. These were irregular and largely unpaved, though there were some bricks at the bottom of one ramp. The ramps were defined by short spur-walls on their sides. These portions of the tomb are en tirely subterranean. The main block of the substructure, consisting of the three vaults, covers an area 11.03 by 8.63m. The antechambers, still subterranean, stick out beyond this footprint in the case of the north and southwestern vaults; the current configuration of the antechamber of the eastern vault is partly contained within the large block of the substructure and partly protrudes. The superstructure of the tomb is largely absent, but was clearly once substantial. A wall enclosing the area was present on all sides. Where best preserved the outer walls of the superstructure measured 0.60m thick, and the total area covered was 14.84 by 12.30m. The vaults of the substructure of this tomb have different dimensions, though they all work together to form a regular rectangular plan. The notable discrepancy between the lengths of the parallel north ern and eastern vaults as well as various observed relationships of walls and vaults within the structure strongly suggest that there were two major building phases. The northern vault has an interior base measurement of 5.50 by 2.50m. The interior of the southwestern vault measures 7.25 by 2.85m. The original dimensions of the eastern vault are more difficult to ascertain as this chamber was extensively</page><page sequence="16">50 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 10. Plan of the vaulted tomb in Area 1. remodeled during die Late Roman Period. The main chamber now measures 3.60 by 2.85m. My cur rent understanding of the phasing and construction of the tomb is that this is the east vault's original length. I think this chamber existed alone, probably with an antechamber, as the original part of the tomb; the other two vaults were then added later. At the time of this addition the antechamber of the eastern vault was either added (if it did not exist before) or lengthened to extend the overall extent of this part of the construction to the same length as the northern vault and its antechamber. I do not think the main chamber itself was altered at that time. It is difficult to be certain of this sequence given the later remodeling; however, this description of the phasing best accounts for the obviously shorter length of the vault at some period and the fact that in its latest incarnation the entire antechamber was still much narrower than the main chamber. The current ramp to the eastern vault and the superstruc ture for the entire tomb belong to the second phase. As such, the only major change to the plan as a whole during the Late Roman period was the addition of a staircase. The plan (fig. 10) reflects the plan as found, and given the above reading of building history is also almost exactly what I reconstruct as the plan at the end of the second phase of tomb construction. Figure 11 shows the two major construc tion phases schematically. Despite the fact that the tomb appears to have been built in at least two major and distinct phases, the construction itself is quite uniform. Brick size was consistent, averaging approximately 33 χ 16 χ 10cm. All of the vaults had four courses of bricks and sprung from substantial walls. In only one place, the northeastern part of the eastern vault, was the span of the vault entirely preserved. In this case, the structural integrity was such that the chamber could be entirely and easily excavated—indeed, the</page><page sequence="17">BESTOCK 51 Fig. 11.

This is testa ment to the original strength of the construction. In other places where the vaults were not extant it seems probable that they fell only after looters dug holes through them. In the northern and south western vaults, where the tops had been partially removed and then had collapsed, the chambers were largely filled with brick debris. In these two places the remaining overhang of uncollapsed vaulting was unstable and had to be removed to prevent further collapse; an attempt to build braces was unsuccess ful. The removal occurred only after the intact brickwork was completely planned and photographed. The removal of bricks turned out to be quite fortunate, as it was only after this that the phasing history of the building became remotely clear (fig. 11). The northern vault most clearly preserves the process by which the chambers were sealed when their use was finished. The northeastern end of the vault consists of a wall with a vaulted doorway in its center; the top of this doorway was below the top of the main chamber. The doorway leads to the antechamber, which itself is a small barrel vaulted room that appears to have had a higher ceiling than the doorway connecting it to the main chamber. There is no doorway at the northeastern end of the antechamber, the end of which served simply as an entrance. Sticking out to the northeast past the walls of the antechamber are two rather poorly constructed spur walls. The space between these walls is the same as the width of the antechamber, and this space was a ramp leading down from the ground outside into the antechamber and thence the tomb proper. There is no indication that this ramp was covered, and it is difficult to see how it could have been and still allowed access to the tomb. The ante chamber for the north vault measures 1.46m long by 1.16m wide. The spur walls are not regular, with one projecting 1.90m and the other 1.70m. The door between the main chamber and antechamber and the northeastern end of the antechamber itself were each blocked off by narrow brick walls (fig. 12a; see also the plan, fig. 10). The inner blocking wall is slightly set in from the line of the outer perimeter of the substructure; the outer blocking wall is flush with the outer perimeter of the superstructure. Both blocking walls were plastered on the side that faced away from the tomb chamber itself. This plastering in plain mud was quite crude, but a round object dipped in a white substance was repeatedly impressed in the mud to form an imprecise pattern in white dots. The patterns, never very systematic, were different on different blocking walls (fig. 12b). The presence of a broken pot full of dried white plaster in one of the ramps suggests how this crude decoration was carried out, and additional deposits of pottery in the ramps were presumably left during funeral or offering rituals. The date for the use of the tomb to the Ptolemaic period is provided by these ceramics; it is possible, but not likely, that this was a reuse and that the construction of the tomb belongs somewhat earlier.23 The wall of the superstructure associated with this tomb appears most likely to have defined an enclosure around the tomb. The wall is not preserved to a great height, but does appear to have had straight rather than sloping sides. The preserved parts of the superstructure cross the substructure only at the outer edges of the antechambers before the vaults, such that the bricked-in outer doorways of those small chambers are precisely in line with the superstructure, essentially forming a downward extension of it. The spur walls that define the ramps leading to the doorways thus exist outside the superstructure; their tops are presumably flush with the ancient ground level, which is not much below the modern surface. In the eastern corner of the tomb, bricks pave the area between the superstructure wall and the substructure. It is not clear if this is original to the tomb; it may relate to the later reuse of the eastern vault (see below). Whether or not this tomb would have had a substantial superstructure other than the wall enclosing its area is unclear. No trace of any superstructure remains directly over 23 Bestock and Knoblauch, "Four Thousand Years," 235-40.</page><page sequence="19">BESTOCK 53 Fig. 12.

Some tombs with multiple subterranean brick vaults excavated by Petrie in the Abydos Middle Cemetery did appear to have sloping superstructures directly over the tomb chambers. Petrie reconstructed these as mastabas. He dated his tombs to "about the XXXth Dynasty."24 One interesting feature of the superstructure wall around this tomb is its relation to earlier struc tures. As mentioned above, this tomb cut through and largely destroyed an Early Dynastic funerary enclosure built by Aha, and this may have been deliberate.25 The southwestern wall of the tomb su perstructure runs directly over and partly cuts into the southwestern wall of the earlier enclosure. Its presence was unquestionably known, whether or not it was understood. Moreover, the northwest and southeast walls of the tomb superstructure ran directly over two of the subsidiary graves associated with the earlier enclosure. These graves were also clearly known to the later builders, and remarkably at least one of them was not disturbed. The Ptolemaic tomb enclosure wall had lower bottom courses in the two places it ran over subsidiary graves—essentially a foundation for the foundation. All of the tomb chambers were heavily disturbed, and analysis of their contents is not yet complete. Nonetheless, a preliminary discussion of the finds provides an indication of their use. The northern vault of the tomb contained the remains of at least three large coffins (fig. 13). Carved from limestone of varying quality, they are shaped into very roughly anthropomorphic form, with a narrower straight end for the feet and a rounded thicker end for the head. The interiors are more precisely defined as anthropomorphic, with space for the shoulders of the mummy also carved out; the resulting space is about the size of Gaea McGahee, who excavated all three chambers, indicating that an inner coffin was probably not provided. The limestone coffins are not smoothly finished, with chisel marks clearly vis ible on all faces. This type of coffin is well known from the Ptolemaic period. All of these coffins had been hacked to pieces, with the exception of one lid. The lid measured 2.33m long, 0.85m wide at its widest, 0.70m wide at the foot, and 0.28-0.30m thick. The most commonly remaining coffin part was the curved head, suggesting that a desire for flat pieces of stone may have been partially responsible for the destruction of the coffins. The one lid that remained was of such poor quality limestone it would have been difficult to reuse as well as heavy to lift. Some human remains were recovered from the northern vault. None of these were articulated. All of the human remains here were deposited, and disturbed, prior to the collapse of the vault; while there is no reason to doubt that they are the original occupants of the tomb, there is also no way to prove it. Artifactual remains were almost entirely ceramic. They included pieces of fine large ampho rae, a complete though broken large bowl, parts of small bowls with incurving rims, and two intact oil lamps. The southwestern vault had a larger amount of remaining artifacts and human remains, though it too had been heavily disturbed. Here there were remains of at least five large limestone anthropoid coffins, again largely destroyed. At least eleven disturbed burials were found under the collapsed bricks of this vault. Parts of some of these burials, including that of one child, were articulated. One complete and perfectly arranged interment was found lying directly next to one of the stone coffins (fig. 14). It is possible that it was removed from a coffin during an episode of looting, but the position of the body makes it more probable that it is in its original place. Since it is unlikely that this body could have been where it is while the adjacent sarcophagus was being hacked to pieces, this is probably a later burial. It did occur before the collapse of the vault. In one case, part of a body had been substantially burnt. Traces of burning in the surrounding dirt show this was done post-burial and in the tomb, so probably during an episode of looting. Ceramics included small offering bowls with incurved rims, some of which had traces of burning in the interior. Pieces of large amphorae were also recovered, 24 W.

Some of these texts are in Greek and others in Demotic. The Greek is fragmentary, but the Demotic texts consist of numbers and in four cases the same regnal date: Year 28. A limestone ostracon inscribed in Demotic with a list of names was also recovered from this vault.26 Other finds include a limestone libation table from the floor near the door, a small fragment of an ebony box, and leather shoes (fig. 15). Fragments of lime stone stelae that appear to be earlier than the Ptolemaic period were used as chinking stones between bricks of the vault. Such chinking stones are common and many may have been reused stone, but only a few retain traces of relief. The eastern vault was so substantially remodeled in the Late Roman Period that its original use can not be reconstructed; it was entirely cleaned out during remodeling. As noted above, it was probably built prior to the other two vaults and its antechamber, which is longer than the others, extended when the other vaults were added. Interestingly, one clearly earlier artifact of importance was found in this reused vault: in the sand above the floor in the antechamber of the vault was found a badly worn limestone stela (fig. 16). The lunette has a winged sun disc with uraei over two facing jackals. The main register has an enthroned Osiris with a standing deity behind him on the left.

The context of the stela might be explained either by movement during looting or by reuse of the stone in the Late Roman period, though if the latter was the case it appears to have been knocked from its precise position. Stelae of this type are well-known from Abydos but are difficult to date precisely even when they are more legible than this example. A Ptolemaic date, however, is not unlikely, and it may well belong to the original use of the tomb.27 Dating this tomb is not entirely straightforward, in part because of the heavy disturbance of its con tents. There are no precise architectural parallels for the substructure, and the superstructure is too poorly preserved to determine its nature. Nonetheless, the great preponderance of ceramics from the tomb and its surrounds date to the Ptolemaic period, and it is thus highly likely that the second phase of the tomb dates to this period. The texts on the ceramic ostraca agree with this date. With caution the ceramics from the deposits in the entrance ramps have been taken to indicate a third or second century BC date.28 The first phase, in which the eastern vault was built, might date either to the ear lier Ptolemaic period or to the Late Period. The size and nature of the tomb suggest it was used over generations. - m ANC 21381 Fig. 16. The limestone stela from the reused east vault of the tomb in Area 1. Scale is 20cm.

Plan of excavated remains in Area 2. The ibis hypogeum enclosure wall and subterranean galleries are indicated both in their excavated remains (dark) and in their hypothetically reconstructed location (light), which can be determined in part based on magnetometry survey. The irregularity of the outlines of the remains from excavated areas of the top of the hypogeum is due to the inability of loose sand to hold a straight balk (see fig. 18). Area 2: the ibis hypogeum Major excavation in this part of the cemetery has now taken place in both of Brown's seasons, with a total of eight units opened. These excavations have revealed two related major constructions of the Ptolemaic period and a wealth of artifactual material (fig. 17). The constructions are an above-ground enclosure wall defining the area, and a subterranean structure with a central vaulted corridor leading to at least ten vaults laid perpendicular to the central corridor. A brick staircase connects the vaults to the ground level. The material associated with this building includes a very large quantity of pottery in a limited number of forms, large quantities of cloth with some stamped seal impressions on mud, some small sculptures, and coins. Large quantities of mummified birds, chiefly ibises but also some raptors, and a number of egg shells were also recovered here. These finds make it clear that the whole complex served chiefly as a hypogeum for the interment of mummified ibises during the Ptolemaic period. While animal interments are common at Abydos, they are more typically in jars placed in the sand than in purpose-built structures. This is only the second formal catacomb for the burial of animal mummies known at the site; the other was a hypogeum for dog mummies in the Middle Cemetery.29 29 S.

The wall was built out of mud bricks measuring 33-36 χ 18-20 χ 10-1 lcm. The enclosure appears to have been roughly rectangular. Parts of the northwest, northeast and southeast walls have been found; the presumed southwest wall is not within the area available to excavation and must have been largely or entirely destroyed by the modern cemetery. The highest preserved section of the wall so far excavated is on the northwestern section, where it was seven brick courses high; in other places only a single course remains or the wall has been entirely removed. This enclosure wall was large and well built, but also somewhat irregular in construction over its length. This may be because it was built in phases or it may relate to other built features. That it should be considered one wall despite its discrepancies is clear from the combined evidence of excavation and magnetometry survey, which show that it acts as a conceptual unit defining the area of the hypogeum. The corners are not perfect right angles and the walls are not perfectly par allel with the underground edges of the hypogeum itself. Furthermore, the base of the enclosure wall is irregular. In some but not all places the bottom course of headers projects half a brick length out from the wall face; this is the closest thing to a foundation that is present. In one place, to the north west of the stairs that lead down to the hypogeum, there were three courses of bricks lower than the usual "foundation" level of the wall, the bottom of which comprised stretchers laid on their sides. It is possible that this unusual dip in the bottom of the wall relates to something underneath it, as was the case with the enclosure wall around the family tomb excavated in Area 1. This section of wall was thor oughly photographed and planned before being removed in the search for subsidiary graves related to the Naqada IIIcl funerary enclosure discussed above. No such graves have been found, but excavation is not yet complete here. The remaining anomaly in the enclosure wall is a narrowing on both sides of the staircase. This was clearly intentional and planned as it occurs on both sides in roughly the same place. The remains of the wall were missing adjacent to the staircase itself, and it is thus not clear if the two ever met, or if and how the above ground area defined by the enclosure wall was accessed. It is also not clear if there was ever a superstructure inside the enclosure wall above all or part of the hypogeum. No trace of such architecture remains, nor masses of displaced bricks, and on the whole it thus seems unlikely that a major superstructure ever existed. Three storage vessels of Ptolemaic date were found interred above the hypogeum; one of these was filled with desiccated grain (and weevils). The presence of what appears to be a contemporary offering deposit above the hypogeum argues against the pres ence of a superstructure, at least in that particular spot. The hypogeum itself was clearly built in multiple phases, the relationships of which are not yet entirely clear. The final result was a building, entirely underground except for the staircase, that re sembles from the outside a giant brick box sunk into the ground. The northwest to southeast width of this box measures 30.85m, but its length is not yet known. Excavation units over the middle of the hypogeum came down on expanses of brick; walking across them feels like walking on a brick floor (fig. 18). This effect was achieved by filling the spaces between vault tops with bricks. Despite this floor like quality, it is unlikely that the top of the hypogeum was ever meant to be seen. It lies close to a meter below the bottom course of the enclosure wall, which itself must represent close to the ancient ground level. Bricks have been planned and measured in several areas of the hypogeum. Measured bricks ranged from 31 χ 18 χ 10cm to 36 χ 19 χ 11cm, with the latter being closer to standard. The bricks of the hypogeum and its enclosure wall are thus similar in size, and slightly larger than the bricks of the vaulted tomb in Area 1. Excavation of the hypogeum is ongoing, and no interior surveying has been done due to the logistical difficulties of lines of sight. It is hoped that three dimensional laser scanning can be used in the coming seasons to accurately record the interior spaces. Because no surveying has yet been done, the measurements listed here are approximate. Not all vaults that have been entered have</page><page sequence="26">60 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 18.

Exploration of the side vaults is made more difficult (and more thrilling) by the complete absence of light and fresh air. The hypogeum is entered from a staircase to the northeast (fig. 19). Eight steps of this staircase have been uncovered, and it is likely that an additional one or two are still present but irrecoverable under neath the modern limestone wall of the cemetery. The stairs are composed of bricks laid on their sides, and each step is one brick-length deep. The staircase is bounded by brick walls on either side; now largely destroyed, these were originally covered on the exterior with a very thin and poorly applied white wash. A vault covered the flat area at the base of the steps before the doorway into the central corridor. The current incarnation of the staircase does not appear to bond with the substructure of the hypogeum. It is probably a later phase than the central vault of the hypogeum, and may not rep resent the first stair entry. That parts of one phase of this entryway (or another element of the super structure?) may have been built of stone is suggested by the recovery of two partial limestone ashlars, neither with highly finished surfaces. These were found in disturbed contexts immediately adjacent to the stairs - in one case, in the fill above the stairs themselves. The more complete measures 1.11 χ 0.49 χ 0.40m. Of interest is the fact that the staircase is off-angle to the hypogeum itself. The discrepancy is notable enough to have been surely intentional, and it seems possible, though not currently provable, that some earlier structure in this area was known and respected. The only currently known candidate for such a structure is the early enclosure. Alternately, its orientation may reflect either a change in the path used to approach the monument or the maintenance of an earlier path that was slightly skewed by the expansion of the monument as a whole (similar to Luxor Temple). The staircase leads down to the central corridor vault through a small arched doorway that may originally have been taller, as the current stairs are a subsequent phase. The current threshold of the doorway is a slab of limestone that is set higher than the bottom of the vault; one further broken step leads down from the door to a small platform. From this an additional four mud brick stairs lead to the floor of the vault (fig. 20). The central vault measures 1.6m wide and 2.2m tall. It can be followed underground for a length of about 20m. At the end of that length sand has filtered in from above, probably from a looter's hole, and blocks the corridor. Determining the full extent of the hypogeum may be possible in the future from underground, depending on structural integrity, though it will be impossible from above due to the modern cemetery. The floor of the central corridor is simply sand. The brick walls of the corridor rise straight for a height of ten courses of brick at which point they spring into the arch. While the underside of the arch is mud-plastered, the walls are not. Almost the entire central corridor vault is blackened, presumably by soot. This appears to date to the intensive looting of the monument rather than its initial use, as an area of unblackened wall was protected by sand that had filled the staircase. As such, when the stairs were in use, the walls were not black. As there is little evidence of ash, the soot is unlikely to have come from fires burning in the hypogeum, and probably came from torches carried by looters. A major looter's hole through the roof of the cen tral corridor is present 3.55m from the doorway. This was our initial entry into the substructure. Small arched openings lead off of either side of the central corridor to the side vaults, which lie perpendicular to the central vault. The openings on either side are quite regular, with vaults placed opposite one another. The small doorways to the vaults were partially bricked up from the bottom in all cases where they were clear enough of sand to see; this bricking up left a lunette of free space atop each doorway that was in some cases barely large enough to crawl through (visible in fig. 20). So far we have found five doorways on each side of the central corridor vault. It seems highly probable that this was not the original total and that more are present underneath the modern cemetery. The vaults were clearly built in separate phases, but it is not yet clear in what order they were built. Nor can it be deter mined on present evidence whether or not these represent sub-phases of a single planned construction or if the monument was expanded over time, perhaps when the vaults became filled with ibises.</page><page sequence="28">62 JARCE 48 (2012) mm -391 Fig. 19.

Although from the top of the complex it is clear that there is slight variation in vault size, overall they appear to be fairly consistent, especially in length. The one vault measured by hand had a length of 13.7m. All of the side vaults are wider than the central corridor. As was the case in the central corridor, the arch of the vaults in the side areas was consistently mud plastered, while the walls themselves were not. The walls here, however, are considerably shorter, only four brick courses high. The construction of these vaults is of very high quality. They are regular, and have obviously been capable of standing for more than 2000 years. The only places they seem to have fallen are where looters dug holes. The hypogeum was repeatedly entered in the past. Most or all entries appear to have been through holes hacked through the roof of the vaults. Looters (and/or archaeologists?—Garstang was almost certainly in this structure in the early Twentieth century30) would line the holes they dug with bricks taken from the structure; this may have helped keep loose sand from filling their holes. This was clear in several areas where we encountered rough circles of loose bricks. These provided the first evidence that we were close to the top of the monument. The effect of looting inside the hypogeum is near total destruction of original deposits; we have not found a single intact ibis burial inside a pot, and but few pots that are not smashed. The nature of the remaining deposits is notably different in the side and central corridors. The side corridors, which have not yet been excavated at all but some of which have been explored in a preliminary fashion, are carpeted with extremely broken pottery (fig. 21). This in cludes both jars and lids. There are also in some cases small mounds of unraveled linen strips. A scrap of a hand-written document in Arabic on paper was also discovered in a side vault. No intact ibis mum mies were seen and there were remarkably few ibis bones at all on the surface of the pottery mounds, though again no excavation was undertaken here. The effects of looting and the nature of original deposits are not quite as clear in the central corri dor, though this is the only part we have begun to clear. Unlike the side vaults, which rarely have much sand at all in them except directly below looters' holes, the central corridor was thickly carpeted with uneven mounds of sand. This also probably came from looters holes as well as down the staircase, it is simply that there are more holes through the vault of the central corridor than in most of the side vaults, some of which are undamaged. Excavations in the central corridor extended from the stairs to the looter's hole mentioned above, a length of about 3.55m. This area yielded a very large number of ibis mummies that were loose in the sand as well as substantial amounts of pottery. The concentra tion of birds was highest next to the doors leading into the side vaults. Some ibises from the central vault have a hardened black substance, perhaps pitch, on them that retains the shape of the interior of a pot; these were clearly ripped from pots. The ibises are posed in different ways, some with their heads and beaks turned back on their bodies, either straight or on the side, others with the head and beak extended (fig. 22). Most of these ibises were only lightly wrapped, but a few have elaborate wrap pings. Further study is intended of the methods of treating these birds. It is not possible to estimate accurately the cubic meters of sand removed from the corridor and stairwell, as the top elevation of the sand deposit was highly irregular. However, this relatively small area yielded 365 ibis mummies as well as smaller numbers of small bird mummies, probably raptors.31 These are all wrapped, sometimes elaborately, in linen strips. One broken pot full of the remains of eggs was also found here. The eggs were blackened with the same bituminous looking substance present on the birds. 30 Garstang, "Excavations at Abydos," 125. 31 None of the mummies have been x-rayed or scanned. Many have wrappings sufficiently decayed to be certain that entire birds are within, however it is common elsewhere to find raptor-shaped mummies in particular that are either dummies or include only a few bones: Ikram, "Animals in the Ritual Landscape," 422.</page><page sequence="31">BESTOCK 65 Fig. 21.

The pottery included large but not overwhelming amounts of the same type of jar and lid as constituted the vast majority of ceramic recovered loose in the sand above the hy pogeum and visible in the side vaults. There were also remains of another type of large storage jar. This type is less well attested in this area, but was likewise probably used for ibis mummy burials as the interiors of some of these jars retain bits of the pitch-like substance also found on many birds. All of the remains of birds, eggs and ceramics found in the central corridor were found in loose sand above the floor level. As the sand probably did not accumulate during the primary use of the hypogeum, it is unlikely that any of these were original deposits. This can be contrasted with two small copper-alloy Osiris figurines that were found laid in depressions cut into the sand of the floor immediately adjacent to the walls of the cor ridor. These were probably intentionally buried at the time the hypogeum was in use. Both had pegs at the base showing they were originally intended to be set upright in bases, though they were found otherwise (fig. 23). An association between this very common type of figurine and ibis mummy galleries has also been noted at Saqqara, and their burial may be a votive practice parallel to that of the ibis burials themselves. There are aspects of the distribution and numbers of ibises and pots that deserve further comment and attention in the field in future. The apparent near total absence of ibis remains in the side vaults is striking, as is the number and condition of the ibises in the central corridor. All of the probably thousands of storage jars seen in the hypogeum as a whole were broken, with most being completely smashed. Most remain in the side vaults where they were presumably both buried and later broken. If they had considerable contents, those contents were removed. The easiest explanation for the ibises in the central corridor sand is that they were removed from the pots in the side vaults. I am slightly uneasy about this interpretation only because the birds themselves are so often whole and undam aged, whereas the pots were utterly destroyed. It also seems fairly odd that the birds would have been removed from their pots and from the side vaults—making that trip often requires wriggling through a small space—only to be dropped in the central corridor. My general sense is that the number of pots from the complex as a whole far outweighs the number of birds, so either a large number of birds were completely removed from the hypogeum or else the pots were never very full, and were on occasion perhaps even empty. As almost all of the rims of pots examined show traces of plaster from the seal ing of a lid, it does not seem that empty or partially filled pots were buried with the intention of add ing more birds later. If large numbers of empty pots were buried, the practice would seem analogous to the creation of fake animal mummies. On the other hand, it is not entirely improbable that many ibises were removed, though the removal seems unlikely to be the result of looters looking for saleable goods: the level of destruction is rather breathtaking and more than can be easily accounted for by simple looting. One vault, discussed below, was reused as a religious space during the Late Roman pe Fig. 23.

It may be that Christians intentionally laid waste to the remains of pagan cult in the hypogeum, in which case the absence of ibises may be due to their removal and destruction. Perhaps, then, the ibises found in good condition in the central corridor were the detritus of earlier, less drastic looting. Pro tected by the sand that had drifted into the central corridor, they might have escaped the vengeance wreaked in the side corridors. It is hard to reconstruct aspects of the original use of the structure until we better understand its destruction, and it is hoped that future seasons in which we can systematically examine the side vaults will help answer some of these questions. There are other areas at Abydos that have yielded ibis burials in pots. Most notably, the Second Dynasty funerary enclosure of Khasekhemwy, known now as the Shunet ez-Zebib, has many places where torpedo-shaped jars full of ibises were laid either singly or in sometimes large groups. The pots were placed either in the sand or occasionally in brick-lined pits. These burials appear to have begun before the BUAP hypogeum is known to have been in use, with the earliest interments probably oc curring in the Late Period if not slightly earlier.32 A Roman ibis cemetery was found by W. Leonard Loat on a ridge leading from the cultivation towards the high desert.33 This consisted of large jars, many unbaked, filled with elaborately wrapped ibis mummies, interred in the sand. These appear to be unrelated to any architecture, earlier or contemporary. The extensive additional evidence of animal mummy activity at Abydos is summarized by Ikram.34 Ibises are the most common animal mummies at Abydos, and the BUAP galleries are by far the largest and most organized ibis cemetery yet known at the site. However, given that the other major ibis cemeteries known from Abydos seem to date to different periods, it might provisionally be suggested that there was a more-or-less centralized industry for the production and burial of ibis mummies at the site. For unknown reasons, the location of buri als moved from the Shunet ez-Zebib to the North Cemetery, West, to the ridge above the wadi, over the span of time from the Late Period to the Roman Period. Ikram and others have noted that the prolif eration of types of animals in cemeteries at Abydos is exceeded only by that at Saqqara, and in both places it may be related to cults of kingship.35 In this light it is worth noting the physical proximity of the newly discovered ibis hypogeum and what appears to be the earliest known royal monument in Egypt, as well as the previous ibis burials inside the Shunet ez-Zebib. I would suggest that the ibis mummy buriers were aware not only of the general connection between Abydos and early kingship but also that the remains of the North Cemetery funerary enclosures, whether standing or destroyed, had something to do with that connection. Immediately outside the ibis hypogeum was discovered another, smaller but potentially related, Ptol emaic feature. This very small rectangular structure was defined on three sides by somewhat irregular brick walls; these were a single course in most places but two courses on the northwest side (fig. 24). The rectangle thus defined measured 2.3 by 1.4m, and the inner area was covered with a mud plaster floor. This extended somewhat beyond the area of the rectangle itself. The location of this feature is such that it lies ever so slightly in the line of the enclosure wall of the hypogeum (see plan, fig. 17). As such, it seems likely that the feature was built after the wall was removed here, although this cannot be said with confidence because the wall itself may have run an irregular course, or the wall may not have extended all the way to the staircase of the substructure. On discovery, the size and nature of this feature suggested it was a tomb, perhaps built with reused bricks from the enclosure wall of the hypogeum. Removal of this feature revealed not a human burial, but a coin hoard and a small cachette of sculptures. 32 Ikram, "Animals in the Ritual Landscape," 426. 33 W. Loat, "The Ibis Cemetery at Abydos,"/£.4 1:1 (1914), 40. 34 Ikram, "Animals in the Ritual Landscape," 417-32. 35 Ikram, "Animals in the Ritual Landscape," 428-29.</page><page sequence="34">68 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 24. The small mud brick and plaster superstructure that sealed the coin hoard and statuary cachette. Plan shows the proximity of this structure to the stairs leading down to the hypogeum. Three hundred copper-alloy coins, all of Ptolemaic date, were buried together (fig. 25). Traces of linen on some of the outer coins suggest that the entire hoard—all 15.16kg of it—was buried in a single bag. The coins range in size from 25 to 48mm, and in weight from 9 to 105g. More of the coins are of medium or large size than small, with only six coins smaller than 20g. All the coins are of recognizable denomination. While the coins exhibit decay, there is no bronze disease. All of the larger coins are still legible, each bearing the head of Zeus-Ammon on the obverse and a single eagle on the reverse. Some have mint marks and other identifying symbols. Preliminary analysis suggests that they come from multiple mintings at Alexandria, and that they date to the reigns of Ptolemy III and IV (246-205 B.C.). Some of the smaller coins are much more worn and cannot always be clearly read in their current state. Three small statues were found sealed by the same feature as the coins (fig. 26). The statues were so close to one another that they were also probably buried inside a bag. In this small cachette were two copper-alloy Osiris figurines, and one stone, probably steatite, statuette of a seated child god. One of the Osiris figurines is in size and quality similar to those found inside the central corridor of the hypo geum. The other is somewhat larger and finer, though of the same general type. They represent the god crowned and mummiform, clasping the crook and flail in his crossed arms. Both figurines were originally pegged at the bottom for insertion into a base; only the smaller figurine retains its peg.

It depicts a child form of Horus—either Harpocrates or Horsamtus—in classic form: naked, finger to his lips, with a side-lock of youth (fig. 27). He is seated on a throne supported by two striding lions, and his feet rest on a platform supported by two smaller recumbent lions. He wears a nemes headdress and a hem-hem crown, and is embraced from behind by a smaller kneeling figure of Isis. The back of his seat includes a depiction of a doorway surmounted by a winged sun-disc. There is no in scription. The quality of this statuette is quite high, and I know of no perfect parallels. A cruder, smaller statuette of Harpocrates with many similar attributes was found at Saqqara.36 The child god statuette was covered with a thin but very hard layer of mud. This was originally thought to be a glaze, but careful cleaning showed that this was not the case. Such mud cannot have come from the context of burial, which was sand. This layer preserves an impression of cloth. Why 36 Cairo Museum 38.212, G.

The child-god statuette after partial cleaning. such a statue should be so dirty is not clear, but the mud layer is so regular that it seems likely to have been intentional.37 The muddiness obscured the features of the piece, and in fact we did not realize how detailed and fine it was until we began to clean it. Possibly obscuring the quality of the sculpture was the purpose of muddying it. The wrapping of the statue in cloth has numerous parallels, for instance at Saqqara where a cache of sculptures found in association with some of the ibis galleries included several wrapped examples.38 Our piece was about half-cleaned before the 2010-11 season ended; cleaning was done in consultation with conservator Lamia el-Hadidy. Further cleaning of this piece as well as cleaning and conservation of the Osirises and the coins is necessary before a complete study can be undertaken. The context as well as the content of these hoards lends to their interest. The hoards' close prox imity to the ibis hypogeum and their apparently similar date make it very likely that their interment is related to that building. What is less clear is the precise function of these deposits. Were they hoards 37 I thank Matthew D. Adams, who made this observation and noted that there were some parallel cases on unpublished pieces also from Abydos. 38 W. Emery, "Preliminary report on the excavations at North Saqqara 1968-9,'"JEA 56 (1970), pi. 5.</page><page sequence="38">72 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 28. A large deposit of linen (right) found directly outside the Late Roman stairs leading to the reused vault of the hypogeum. of precious things in a time of instability, buried near a religious complex for protection? Or were they votive gifts in connection with cultic activity or other ceremonies associated with the hypogeum? The latter seems more likely given the numerous parallels for both coin hoards and statuary cachettes as sociated with the animal mummy precincts of Saqqara.39 It is also perhaps surprising that the small su perstructure was built above these deposits. It might have been deliberately disguised as a poor burial, though the form is not one I am familiar with from contemporary tombs at Abydos. It seems surprising that any marker at all would have been erected as a signpost to potential looters. Aside from the architecture of the hypogeum and its related finds, there is a large quantity of loose material from disturbed contexts in this area that probably relates to the use of the structure. Some of it has not yet been dated or cannot be dated, such as the knees of a very fine small limestone statue of a mummiform figure, possibly related to the cultic activity associated with the ibis burials. A small number of copper-alloy Ptolemaic coins has also been found in the general area of the hypogeum but from disturbed contexts. A Demotic ostracon on limestone preserves a mostly legible text that includes many personal names and may be an account list or list of personnel.40 Several somewhat more coherent, concentrated deposits of cloth are likely to relate to the ibis hy pogeum. The most substantial of these measured more than two meters across and was found directly outside the staircase built for the reuse of one of the vaults (fig. 28). The cloth comprised strips of linen, mostly in disarray, though there were some coherent rolls, fringed pieces, and sewn pieces. All had been covered with a salt and had largely solidified into a single mass. At the bottom of the deposit 39 For example, M. Price, "The Coins," in D. Jeffreys and H.

Stamp sealings from the cloth deposit pictured in fig. 28. were numerous large pot sherds, all of jar types typical of the ibis hypogeum. A few stamped seal im pressions were found on small pieces of mud within this cloth deposit (fig. 29). Only a few ibis parts were found in association with this—a foot, some bones and feathers. It seems likely that this entire deposit was pulled from the nearby vault when that was remodeled. On balance it seems most likely that this represents a store of cloth, probably second-hand, that was kept in one of the vaults. It is not clear if this deposit was stored preparatory to wrapping birds or is the detritus left over after wrapping, but given the paucity of bird parts and the absence of the pitch-like substance seen on many bird mum mies it seems unlikely that this cloth ever actually wrapped mummies. Other deposits of cloth found above the hypogeum have been similar in nature but much smaller. Area 3: a settlement area In addition to the areas mentioned above, the BUAP has begun excavation of an area 300m to the north-northeast of the other BUAP areas, closer to the cultivation and modern Muslim villages. This area is near to Peet's Cemetery D, the location of early Old Kingdom mastabas as well as later tombs.41 Visible surface remains in Area 3 had always indicated this was a potential area of interest for settlement archaeology;42 its potential was confirmed when the magnetometry survey undertaken by Tomasz Herbich for the PYIFA revealed a dense network of walls apparently belonging to houses. The survey showed that the settlement area is separated from Cemetery D by what appears to be a road bounded by mud brick walls. Apparent settlement remains show up on an area of approximately 4000m2, and it is likely that the original area was larger, as the bounds of the survey were constrained by the presence of the modern village. Initial speculation and examination of surface ceramics sug gested that the settlement on the survey might date to the Late Roman period. A single 10 χ 10m unit was opened here in 2011 to test the nature and date of these remains. This unit was not excavated to virgin ground, but preliminary results suggest a Ptolemaic date for the main occupation with small amounts of Late Roman reuse. 41 Peet and Loat, Cemeteries of Abydos III. 42 Kemp, "Abydos," 39, noted "Coptic houses" in this area.</page><page sequence="40">74 JARCE 48 (2012) Fig. 30. The partially-excavated, very well preserved, remains of the home discovered in Area 3. The small room that is still partially filled in this image was reused in the Late Roman period, but remains from the rest of the house dated to the Ptolemaic period. Part of what appears to be a single building with multiple rooms was excavated, and a corner of a room belonging to an adjacent building to the north was also uncovered (fig. 30). The walls in this unit are no table for their regular construction and excellent state of preservation. All walls are one and a half brick lengths in thickness and extremely regularly laid out: all the angles are right. While the magnetometry survey is extremely accurate for showing the location of walls, the plan alone is insufficient to enable us to reconstruct divisions between discrete houses and phasing on current evidence. It is hoped that further excavation will make interpretation of the survey more accurate, so that limited excavations will allow a fairly comprehensive understanding of this settlement area. It seems likely that this area functioned as a sort of suburb. It lies some 310m from the main town site located at Kom es-Sultan, from which it appears to be disconnected. It is not clear on current evidence if this suburb was built over land that had been used as cemetery in earlier periods, if there were yet earlier houses here, or if it was previously clear land. Certainly by the Ptolemaic period it was not being used as part of the still very active North Cemetery.43 Post-Ptolemaic activity in the North Cemetery The Ptolemaic period is not the last period represented in the North Cemetery, even excepting the presence of medieval to modern settlements and cemeteries. Some of the most notable later activity was adaptive reuse of already ancient structures in the North Cemetery.44 In the case of the BUAP excavations, two Late Roman cases of reuse and one of new construction, are noteworthy. 43 \york on the Ptolemaic suburb is being supervised by Timothy Sandiford as part of his doctoral dissertation research. 44 The Late Roman reuse of earlier monuments as dwellings has been documented by many projects working at Abydos, for instance, Peet Cemeteries of Abydos II, 49, and W. Petrie, Tombs of the Courtiers and Oxyrhynkos (London, 1925), pi. 47. These seem</page><page sequence="41">BESTOCK 75 Fig. 31. The reused eastern vault of the tomb in Area 1. Ceramics date this reuse to the Late Roman period. The practice of Coptic hermits adoptively reusing earlier architecture in the North Cemetery has been documented in several places. Part of the tomb in Area 1 was reused, apparently as a dwelling place in the Late Roman period. The southeastern vault was entirely cleared of its earlier remains and was renovated (fig. 31). A staircase was partly cut through the fabric of the tomb and partly built; this entered what had been the ante chamber of the original vault from the northwest side. The space below ground was divided into two rooms. These appear to have been the original vaulted antechamber and chamber of the tomb vault. The northeast end of the antechamber, which had originally led to the ramp, was remodeled into three often or always to have been hermitages. The phenomenon is not limited to Abydos, and is increasingly the subject of scholarly attention. For instance, a recent workshop was held on "Adaptive reuse and 'spolia' in First Millennium AD Egypt: Perspectives from new fieldwork" at the British Museum, 11 July, 2012. I am indebted to Elisabeth O'Connell for information about this workshop and access to some of her own work at Thebes.</page><page sequence="42">76 JARCE 48 (2012) very deep niches. The floor of the antechamber was mud plastered, though this had been broken in places, and the walls and vaulted ceiling were covered with a very smooth and hard white plaster. A narrow arched doorway led from this room to the larger main chamber. Probably this was the original door between the antechamber and vault of the tomb though it was narrowed in its final incarnation. Brick benches were built on the northwest side of the main chamber, with another bench or step im mediately adjacent to the door. Small raised brick "pillows" may indicate that the benches were for sleeping. The benches and floor were covered with fine white plaster, but the walls in this chamber were simple mud plaster, perhaps original to the tomb. Some snapped long bones were stuck into the walls of this room, presumably to suspend lamps or other objects. The substantial amount of ceramic recovered from these two rooms included small open form fine wares, large storage vessels, cooking vessels and other types indicative of domestic activities; they date largely from the fifth to the seventh centuries A.D.45 A somewhat similar situation is present in one vault of the ibis hypogeum. This was the first part of the substructure that could be entered, thanks to the creation of an additional staircase by the people who undertook the remodeling. This very large and well-built stair led down into the fifth vault from the entrance on the southeastern side. This vault had been turned into two rooms by the addition of a cross-wall with an arched doorway in it. This is unlikely to be original to the hypogeum given that none of the other vaults have such cross-walls, but as the joins between the wall and the vault itself are plastered this cannot be determined with certainty. The back room, closest to the central corridor, was smaller and undecorated. The front room, into which the stairs lead, had been white plastered to part way up the arch of the vault. Several small niches were carved into the walls, and snapped long bones embedded in the walls were also present here (fig. 32). Inscriptions and small pictures were painted in red on the walls and in the niches. These are in Coptic. A few Arabic inscriptions are incised. No excavation has been undertaken in this remodeled vault, and the only record yet made of it is a set of preliminary photographs taken without proper light. The door from the hypogeum's central corridor into this space had been entirely bricked up, and no other parts of the ibis galleries show signs of Late Roman reuse, though as noted above some of the spectacular destruction of deposits may date to that period. This room is almost certainly that described by Garstang: "One of these chambers was found to have been arranged as a Christian Church, and the Coptic writing upon the walls may be as early as the fourth century A.D."46 In addition to this Late Roman reuse, an original construction dated to the same period was found just below the modern ground surface in an area above the ibis galleries (fig. 33). The tops of the walls of part of this structure were exposed, but excavation is not complete. The structure was built of mud brick with thin and somewhat irregular walls. All or part of four rooms have been found thus far. The small southeastern room was almost entirely taken up by a large, round, ceramic feature sunk into the floor. Much burnt material in this room suggests it was used as an oven. A very small chamber on the southeast side of this room may be storage related to cooking. The middle and northwestern rooms of the structure were white plastered on the interior. The middle room had a plastered niche in its southwest wall. The top of this niche was missing, but its base preserved very faint traces of a long, red, inscription in Coptic. Photography with different filters and lighting failed to make this inscription legible; it was re-covered with sand almost immediately to protect it. Floor level was not reached at any point in this structure, which was left largely unexcavated because the wall plaster was in very poor state and no conservator was present. We plan to return to this structure in the future. 45 Knoblauch and Bestock, "Four Thousand Years," 240-45. 46 Garstang, "Excavations at Abydos," 125.</page><page sequence="43">BESTOCK 77 lippi sippfe Fig. 32.

A undated later burial of a woman and two children dug into the top of the vaulted tomb in Area 1. Substantial burial activity continued in the North Cemetery in the Late Roman period and later. It is usually impossible to accurately date the simple interments in shallow pits, most of which have few if any grave goods. Notable amongst the late burials are several that were cut into parts of the vaulted tomb in Area 1. The stairwell down to the Late Roman chamber had a child buried in it; this must post-date the reuse of the chamber itself. The top levels inside the antechamber of the southwestern vault had multiple burials in it. One of these was an adult female with her arms around two juveniles (fig. 34).47 A third juvenile was buried to the side. The hypogeum in Area 2 did not see similar later intrusive burials dug into it, but this may be because its top was farther underground. Almost all of the human remains in Area 2 have been found in deeply disturbed states so that they cannot be even approximately dated; many may have been tossed around during the construction of the hypogeum itself and thus may be earlier than that monument. While not all the remains excavated by the BUAP can be dated, the continuity of practice and of the understanding of the North Cemetery as a sacred space is notable across the ages. The North Cemetery has been a cemetery for five thousand years with very little interruption and only a few other uses. In the Early Dynastic period the cemetery was also a place of royal cult, and in the Ptolemaic pe riod it included space for the ritual burial of animal mummies; the latter may have been conditioned in part by the early royal connection. In the Late Roman Period there were dwellings in the cemetery, 47 The human remains are being studied by Brenda Baker.</page><page sequence="45">BESTOCK 79 mostly built into older monuments, but these seem to have had at least sometimes a religious character and may have been hermitages. Both the use of the area as a cemetery and memory of its other uses are very much parts of the current incarnation of the Abydos North Cemetery. We stop work out of respect to funeral processions when they lead from the village to the cemetery. I cannot count the num ber of times I have been told there is a church "under there", with an arm swept towards Area 2. Such a story was common even before we rediscovered the Late Roman reuse of the vault in the hypogeum, though it seems likely that was the structure preserved in memory as a church. It is hoped that future seasons of the BUAP will continue to add to our knowledge and challenge our thinking about this dy namic sacred landscape in all the periods of its use.
