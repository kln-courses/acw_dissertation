<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Reviews 129  At another level, Stokes’s volume is a sensitive and penetrating social history  of race in America. Undoubtedly, many of the film’s first viewers squirmed un- comfortably during its most racist scenes. Perhaps even more cheered for the final  triumph of the KKK and the redemption of all things white. Starting at that point,  Stokes traces how the film has moved and challenged Americans. From the first  complaints by the NAACP, through the legal challenges against the showing of the  film, to more recent fights for and against censorship, he shows how The Birth of a  Nation has forced Americans to confront their past and to debate the role that race  has played in the country. Often it has been a fractious and painful debate, many  times acrimonious and even violent, but on the whole a healthy one. Nearly one  hundred years after its initial release, The Birth of a Nation still has the power to  shock and provoke.  Stokes’s research is impeccable. Using both archival and printed sources, Stokes  carefully documents every step of The Birth of a Nation saga in what could be de- scribed as a biography of a film. After lengthy chapters on Thomas Dixon Jr. and  D. W. Griffith, the effective parents of the film, he examines how the motion picture  was first received and how its reputation has changed over the years. Clearly, as  Stokes repeatedly demonstrates, critics and scholars traditionally have attempted  to separate the film’s artistic contributions from its ideological content. But recent  scholars, including Stokes, have challenged the notion that in The Birth of a Nation  filmgoers witnessed the birth of both an art form and an insidious brand of racism.  They have recently argued that there is no easy dividing line between Griffith’s art  and ideas, that the two have to be unified in a single interpretation.  Stokes’s approach to The Birth of a Nation shows how American society has  ultimately rejected Griffith’s racial thinking. In 1915 the NAACP was unsuccessful  in challenging the film. Today, as Stokes writes, “the film stands as a monument to  once-dominant cultural attitudes over race and, in terms of most people’s reaction  to it, as a reminder of just how much has changed since 1915” (p. 285). In the end,  Stokes’s D. W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation is about the slow death of an idea. Randy Roberts Purdue University The Colored Cartoon: Black Representation in American Animated Short  Films, 1907–1954. By Christopher P. Lehman. Amherst: University of Mas- sachusetts Press, 2007. 152 pp. Notes and index. $29.95 (cloth).  The year 2008 was a good one for scholarship about African American creators  of comic art and the representation of blacks in American cartoons: Christopher P.  Lehman’s The Colored Cartoon and Nancy Goldstein’s Jackie Ormes: The First Af- rican American Woman Cartoonist (Ann Arbor, MI, 2008) were released. Although  </page> <page sequence="2"> 130 Journal of American Ethnic History / Fall 2010 Goldstein’s biography about the first black woman cartoonist describes and explores  the comic strips and panels of Zelda “Jackie” Ormes, it also discusses the images  of black women in comic art from the 1940s to the 1960s. The Colored Cartoon  is not a biography but a critical examination of the images of African Americans  in animated short films from 1907 to 1954. It is a wonderful critical companion to  Henry T. Sampson’s That’s Enough, Folks: Black Images in Animated Cartoons,  1900–1960 (Lanham, MD, 1998). In That’s Enough, Folks, Sampson opens with a  brief historical overview of black images in animated cartoons from 1900 to 1960  and then devotes the rest of the book to the “blacks stars” of several animated  cartoon series, including for each series a description, production information,  and reviews. The Colored Cartoon broadens Sampson’s historical overview by  performing close readings of cartoons that featured African American characters  during the same time period.  Lehman’s main thesis is that the development of American animated cartoons is  inextricably tied to America’s relationship to African Americans. In each chapter  (of which there are seven, plus an introduction and conclusion), Lehman shows  through specific examples how African American culture served as the foundation  of the theatrical cartoon industry from 1907 to 1954.  In 1907 James Stuart Blackton introduced his “trickfilm” technique in Lightening  Sketches, which featured the metamorphosis of the word “coon” into a pair of eyes  on a blackface caricature. This began what Lehman labels as “blackface character  design” (p. 12). This design was established when producer Pat Sullivan and anima- tor Otto Messmer developed American animation’s first popular anthropomorphic  animal star, Felix the Cat, in 1919. At first, blackface character design involved  animals with jet-black bodies and large white eyes and lips. Even Walt Disney’s most  popular character, Mickey Mouse, was jet-black and white-mouthed in the early  days of his creation. Later, blackface design involved black human characters.  Sound-synchronization animation was a key technological innovation that affected  animated cartoons of the 1920s. The influence of African American culture on this  phase of animated shorts was evident in the use of blackface minstrel songs, a second  link Lehman makes between the development of animated films and African Ameri- cans. The period from the 1930s through World War II was marked by an increase  in the use of black characters in American animated film shorts. During this period,  the sambo, mammy, adult sharecropper, and jazz musician were the predominant  animated images of blacks. Lehman contends that the cartoon studios’ reliance on  traditional story formulas and characters allowed them to survive economically the  Depression and World War II: black character design and black characters were  profitable for most cartoon studios of that time.  An important figure in animated cartoons is director Fred “Tex” Avery, who ad- vanced the animated cartoon because he constructed jokes and characters with a black  aesthetic that helped to create a new star in 1940—Bugs Bunny. The “bebop-folktale  imagery” expressed through Bugs Bunny’s character further tied animated film shorts  </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews 131 to African American culture (p. 66). Even though African Americans had an increasing  presence in the political, legal, and military arenas through 1954, cartoon studios with  a few exceptions persisted in the production of traditional black stereotypes such as  sambo, mammy, and the jazz musician. The activism of such civil rights organizations  as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People caused cartoon  studios to begin to think about their actions and to stop certain practices. The last  cartoon to feature a black caricature came in 1954.  In The Colored Cartoon, Lehman convincingly shows that the analysis of the  content of such popular art forms as theatrical cartoons can reveal the hopes, dreams,  problems, and challenges of a society or nation. In short, the representation of African  Americans in animated film shorts illustrates the treatment of African Americans  in the United States over four decades. Indeed, the scholarly examination of black  representation in animated film shorts is significant because these “depictions stand  as primary examples of black imagery in popular culture from the era of lynchings  to the birth of the civil rights movement” (p. 122).

New Haven, CT: Yale Univer- sity Press, 2008. viii + 500 pp. Maps, photos, illustration, notes, index, and  bibliography. $35 (cloth).  Pekka Hämäläinen’s The Comanche Empire is a finely crafted account of the  cultural formation and transformation of the Comanches as a people and as a major  force to be reckoned with in North America for more than a century and a half.  Comanches capitalized on environmental and political realities of the eighteenth  century, eventually controlling a far-reaching raiding and trading economy of horses,  bison products, and slaves. The Comanches, Hämäläinen argues, built an empire  that reversed the tide of Euro-American expansion into the heart of North America.  His account weaves an impressive array of information into a compelling narrative  and provides a dramatic contrast to the familiar story of imperial adventures and  triumphs in North America.  Hämäläinen begins by reconstructing the ethnogenesis of the Comanches, a cultural  origin linked closely to Comanche acquisition of the horse, not long after the Pueblo  Revolt of 1680. The reader then follows the growth of a powerful, well-organized  society rapidly expanding its territorial domination of the Plains and northern Mexico,  soon subordinating all other powers in the region—Native American, Spanish, French,  and American—and continuing to do so for eight generations. Extended, recurring  droughts ravaged plains forage during the 1850s and 1860s, causing bison numbers  to plummet. With diminished food and trade items, Comanches faced serious dif- </page> </plain_text>
