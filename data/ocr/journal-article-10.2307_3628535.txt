<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PROBLEMS IN JAPANESE PREHISTORY BERTRAM S. KRAUS FOREWORD THE PROBLEMS of Japanese prehistory are at present little known to west- ern readers. The field is quite confused and much of its published record is inaccessible to many Occidental students. It is the purpose of this paper to syn- thesize and summarize the outstanding results of research in this field and to formulate some of the main problems that now exist. In the latter part of 1945 the writer, as a member of the United States Mili- tary Government program in Japan, had the opportunity of visiting several archaeological laboratories and university departments engaged in anthropological research. Through conversations with some of Japan's leading archaeologists, who were kind enough to provide him with numerous war-time publications in their field, the writer was made acquainted with the current problems and inter- ests in Japanese archaeology. Since returning to the United States he has examined some of the evidence that bears upon these problems and is preparing it for publication. The present paper omits the bulk of this evidence and attempts merely to restate the problems. It will also suggest in what direction their solu- tion appears to lie on the basis of the present status of research. The writer wishes to acknowledge particularly the guidance and cooperation of Dr Hisashi Suzuki, acting head of the Anthropological Institute of Tokyo Imperial Univer- sity, and Prof Sugao Yamanouchi of the Archaeological Laboratory of Tohoku Imperial University. The plates accompanying the text are the contribution of Prof Yamanouchi THE EARLY CULTURES Interest in Japanese archaeology was first stimulated by Morse's excavation of the Omori shell mound in 1879.1 Research, thereafter, was pressed so rapidly that several attempts at a synthesis of Japanese prehistory were published in Eng- lish in the period from 1890 to 1914.2 While foreign scholars were responsible 1 Edward S.

Their results were published in the various new Japanese anthropological journals that had been founded in the early period.3 The zeal with which Japanese archaeologists prose- cuted their research continued unabated throughout the years preceding the second World War and even during the war years archaeological expeditions were not far behind the conquering armies in Manchuria and North China.4 Cur- rently (1946) the Anthropological Institute of Tokyo Imperial University is conducting a series of shell-mound excavations in Shizuoka Prefecture.5 Despite the extensive archaeological literature that has resulted from recent research (1920 on) by the Japanese, earlier works are still regarded by occidental scholars as authoritative. The gradual elimination of investigation, if not inter- est, by American, English, and other foreign students has been due chiefly to two factors. On the one hand Japan's foreign policy gradually erected an "iron curtain" around the homeland which discouraged penetration by foreign institu- tions interested in scientific research. On the other, the difficulties presented by the Japanese language, in which the bulk of the newer material was written, have acted as distinct deterrents. True, a few Japanese scholars have, from time to time, treated briefly of their progress in French, German, and English articles, many of which are contained in publications not generally consulted by archaeol- ogists, and most of which fail to provide a sufficient amount of detail for proper appraisal.6 Some of the problems which exist in the field of Japanese prehistory are inti- 3 Koko-gaku (Archaeology); Zinruigaku Zasshi (Anthropological Journal); Kyoto Tei- koku Daigaku Bungakubu K6kogaku Kenkyu H6koku (Report upon Archaeological Research in the Department of Literature, Kyoto Imperial University); Shizengaku Zasshi (known also as Zeitschrift fur Praehistorie); Kokogaku Kenkyiu (Archaeological Research). 4 This work was carried on by The Far-Eastern Archaeological Society whose series of publications under the title Archaeologia Orientalis first appeared in 1935. 5 Personal communication from Dr Suzuki (June, 1946). 6 Among the most valuable are: Kashiwa Ohyama, Yayoi-Kultur: eine prahistorische Kultur der japanischen Inseln (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Natur- und Volkerkunde Ostasiens, Jubilaumsband, pt. 1, 1933) and Vorlaufiger Bericht iiber die Chronologie der Jomon-kultur der Steinzeit im Kanto (Mittel-Japan) (Prahistorica Asia Orientalis, vol. 1, pp. 77-99, 1932); J.

Others are peculiar to the Japanese archipelago itself. Throughout the history of archaeological research in Japan, interest in the prehistoric inhabitants themselves has been a dominant theme and has colored both the type and the orientation of research in the field. Recognizing two distinct groups now in Japan-the Ainu and the Japanese proper -scholars have taken it almost as a personal challenge to determine not only the racial origins of the two groups but their association with one or the other of the prehistoric cultural manifestations revealed through excavation. The efforts of Japanese archaeologists up to the present day, then, have been directed primarily toward identifying the prehistoric ancestors of the modem inhabitants of the archipelago. This predominance of interest has had a serious effect upon the quality and scope of their investigations of the purely cultural aspects of archaeology. Even a casual perusal of papers on Japanese prehistory reveals the inadequacy of certain prevalent terminology employed to describe "stages" of prehistoric cul- tural manifestations. The earliest assemblage of cultural traits found in Japan has been described by Japanese and European scholars alike as "Neolithic." With certain changes in content and form the "Neolithic culture" endured until about the beginning of the Christian era. Throughout this entire period there is no evidence that agriculture was practised, that the potter's wheel was used, or that polishing superseded chipping as a stone-working technique. The prehistoric peoples of Japan subsisted mainly by fishing and the gathering of mussels from both the sea and fresh water streams; they built their clay pots out of the mass or by coiling; and they fashioned their arrowpoints, axes, and adzes mainly by the percussion method of chipping. Only their stone hammers and the bits of their axes were polished. The various usages, then, of the term "Neolithic" by Childe, Smith, de Pradenne, and others to denote a stage of man's cultural history dis- tinguishable by "revolutionary" advancement in one or another specified activity, lead only to confusion when applied to Japanese prehistory.7 Until a less ambiguous terminology is devised, it might be wiser to refer to this period simply as the "prehistoric." It is generally agreed that a non-pottery, simple hunting stage of culture ("Palaeolithic") thus far appears to be lacking in Japan's early prehistory. Reports of extinct mammal bones found in association with stone artifacts in 7 Robert Braidwood has challenged the usefulness of certain current archaeological term- inology in his article "Terminology in Prehistory" (in Human Origins: an Introduction to Anthropology, a syllabus of selected readings for an introductory general course in anthropology at the University of Chicago, 1945). 59</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Hyogo (Harima) Prefecture8 have not been seriously received by most Japanese archaeologists in view of the fact that the site was not scientifically investigated. Nevertheless, Schnell appears to accept these finds and contends that "the gap that now appears to separate the Harima discovery from the earliest Neolithic discovery will eventually be filled."9 In 1941, however, the positive geological dating of these fossil forms (Palaeoloxodon) from their stratigraphical occurrence on Miyako Island in the Ryukyus to the Early Pleistocene,l? indicates a very broad "gap" indeed. Schnell himself rightly points out that the stone implements of Japan's prehistoric period are of such a primitive nature that they could hardly be distinguished from "Palaeolithic" implements. Torii expresses the prevailing attitude of Japanese archaeologists when he writes: In Japan proper and in Chosen there has been no discovery of any trace of the Palaeolithic Age. . . . But the mere fact that no remains have been found does not necessarily mean that there exists no trace of the Old Stone Age. All we can safely say is that it has not been discovered yet.1 When we point out that Japanese archaeologists have distinguished two "cul- tures" in the prehistoric period, the "Jomon" and the "Yayoi," we again run into terminological inadequacies. It is a great enough strain upon the concept of "culture" to so designate an assemblage of materials recovered from a group of sites. The excavating technique by itself can recover but a very small fraction of the total "culture"-using the term as defined in the fields of ethnology and social anthropology.l2 How much greater the strain when the term "culture" is applied to little more than a particular type of pottery ware; for "Jomon Cul- ture" and "Yayoi Culture" are distinguishable chiefly on the basis of pottery form and decoration. To avoid this misconception, we propose to speak of the "Jomon Phase" and the "Yayoi Phase," implying only temporal divisions of Japanese prehistory. 8 N.

When the term was first applied it was a satisfactory descriptive tool since the rope design was common to all prehistoric pottery then known. Not long after Morse's excava- tion, three types of prehistoric pottery came to be recognized. They were commonly called Atsude, Usude, and Mutsu. At first all three types were con- sidered manifestations of the Jomon Phase and there was difficulty in finding characteristics which they held in common and which could be set up as diagnostic for the ware known as Jomon. By 1906 Munro complained that "a large album would be needed to give an adequate idea of the primitive pottery, of its forms and the exceeding variety of its patterns."13 After examining descriptions of the Atsude and Usude types by Yamanouchi, Nakaya, Ohyama, Montandon, and others, it appears that they have only two traits in common: both types are hand- made and generally they are cord-marked. The type known as Mutsu (the old name for Aomori Prefecture) was found to be a late prehistoric and early historic ware, and to include the ware now known as Yayoi. Today all three terms are falling into disuse. Ohyama has proposed the name Katsusaka for the Atsude type, after the site in Kanagawa Prefecture; and the term Omori, after the Morse site, for Usude. In addition Ohyama has distinguished three other types of Jomon ware which he designates Sashiogi, Hasuda, and Moroiso.14 All five types are found in sites in the Kwanto Plain in central Honshu. The typological seriation-as shown in the accompanying table-was confirmed by Ohyama and his colleagues after a three-year study of the topographical distribution through- out the river valleys of the Tokyo Bay region of mounds composed of either salt-water or fresh-water mussel shells. In northern Honshu, in the district known as Tohoku, Yamanouchi and others of the Laboratory of Archaeology, Tohoku Imperial University, have set up a great number of types and subtypes of Jomon ware (see Table 1). Many of these correspond closely with pottery types recently found in the Tokyo area. Space does not permit their description here15 but Plates 1 and 2 will illustrate the wide range in form, design, and ornamentation embraced under the term "Jomon." Yayoi ware takes its name from Yayoi Street in Tokyo where this type of 13 Munro, Primitive Culture in Japan, p. 118. 14 Ohyama, Vorlaufiger Bericht uber die Chronologic der Jomon-kultur, pp. 86-88. 15 A full description of Jomon and Yayoi pottery types is contained in chapter II and appendix 1 of the writer's unpublished M.A. thesis (University of Chicago, Autumn Quarter, 1946). 61</page><page sequence="7">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY pottery was first found in 1889. This ware, in its later phases ("Bronze Age"), differs from Jomon in almost every respect. Design and decorative effects are rare to absent. There are only a few typical forms. Except in its earlier mani- festations ("Neolithic Age"), when certain Jomon influences were felt, it is wheel-made and often polished. Perhaps the difference between the two wares can best be summed up by describing Jomon as an exuberant florescence of indi- vidual artistry, and Yayoi as the product of the prehistoric "assembly line." Plate 3, A presents an early type of Yayoi ware and Plate 3, B shows the typical form and absence of surface treatment characteristic of developed Yayoi. Although several authors attest to the general uniformity, both spatially and temporally, of other cultural manifestations of the Jomon Phase, the writer suspects that preoccupation with the ceramic problems has led to a certain neglect of other aspects of the archaeological assemblage.16 It is difficult to believe that where so many local developments and variations in pottery occurred, no local differences in other traits, such as stone and bone implements, would have arisen. The factor of isolation which the very topography of Japan would have brought about, as it does to a certain extent even today, could be expected to result in some minor local differentiation. The study of these assemblages is a must for future research. In contrast to this situation, many monographs have appeared dealing with the subject of artificially marked or decorated human long bones found in the sites. The emphasis on this comparatively minor issue again reflects the intense interest in the prehistoric peoples themselves. Were they can- nibals? Did they have a cult or system of magic rites in which artfully incised human bones played a role? Arrowpoints found in sites of the Jomon Phase are generally unpolished and are of a great variety of shapes. Because of this variety attempts to arrange the points in a typological seriation were abandoned.17 Polished slate knives, of the semi-lunar type, are found in most Jomon sites. Usually they have two per- forations near the convex edge. None of the stone implements show very fine chipping. Polished stone hammers with a center groove protected by a ridge on 16 Discussions with various archaeologists in Japan in the early months of 1946 revealed a general unawareness of the importance of analyses of the total archaeological assemblage of a site. Dr Yamanouchi, on the other hand, has indicated that his correlation of Sendai and Tokyo ceramic types (see Table 1) extends beyond pottery into the total assemblage (personal communication, February, 1946). The writer is unable to state whether or not this has been expressed in publication. 17 K.

Violin-shaped chopping tools of crude workmanship occur frequently. They are similar to those found in the Hong Kong area18 and at Galoempang in the Celebes.l9 Seki-bo (stone clubs) have been considered phallic symbols. The knobs are decorated with incised designs which are occa- sionally anthropomorphic. Bone, shell, and horn objects as illustrated in various Japanese publications show no unusual features either in form or in decoration. Harpoon heads generally are undecorated and bear bilateral rows of two or three barbs. In addition to pottery, other clay objects include figurines, lamps, braziers, sinkers, masks, and various personal ornaments. Burial customs of the two phases of Japanese prehistory show sharp differ- ences. Jomon burials are generally flexed and are found as intrusives in the shell mounds or in trenches which served as a communal burial ground. Some have been found in caves and on the floors of pit-houses. Shell bracelets occur on the forearms of some skeletons and occasionally bone and stone ornaments are found near the chest and neck. Clay vessels were often placed near the head and fre- quently large sherds covered the skull or part of the chest. In the early stage of the Yayoi Phase infants were buried in two urns placed mouth to mouth. Later all burials were of the "double-urn" variety. This Yayoi trait has been found only in North Kyushu thus far. Grave goods rarely accompany this type of burial. In only a few other respects do Jomon assemblages differ from Yayoi. In both phases the dog was a domesticated animal but only in the Yayoi Phase was the horse known. The Yayoi potter made only pottery vessels, but the Jomon artisan fashioned many articles, as we have observed, from his clay. The polished stone adze with a one-sided cutting edge and short body is a Yayoi trait, as is the polished stone chisel with a groove extending across one face. Yayoi arrow- points are of polished slate and have thin bodies and oval points. Two axe-types are particularly characteristic of the Yayoi Phase: the horned-axe and the "Seir- yfto" axe. The former, found generally in the Kwanto region, has a cylindrical shaft, a round cutting edge, and a horn-like projection on either side of the upper part of the shaft. The latter is distributed from central Honshu south to Kyushu. It is characterized by a cylindrical shaft with a semicircular blade along the lower portion of one side of the shaft. The side opposite the blade is very thick, with a 18 D. J.

It is made of stone and was obviously suspended from the neck. Although some crudely made magatama have been found in Jomon assemblages, they are common in Yayoi sites and show some unusual developments. In later stages of Yayoi bronze lances, swords, and bells make their appearance, heralding the increasing contacts between Japan and the peoples and cultures of China and Korea. We have not mentioned the type of dwelling-places that was prevalent in prehistoric Japan. To date, only the remains of pit-houses (tateana) attest to the mode of shelter in both the Jomon and the Yayoi Phases. The manner of their distribution in Japan and the archaeological assemblages found in association with them raise a number of interesting and important problems which the writer will discuss in a future paper. Although their occurrence and forms are ade- quately described in Japanese texts, their significance for the study of prehistoric cultural inter-relationships and the Ainu problem has seemingly been overlooked. The exact nature of the transition period between the Jomon and Yayoi Phases is still undetermined. That there was not a complete break signaling the utter annihilation of the "Jomon People" is demonstrated by the association of Yayoi and late Jomon traits in the same assemblage in many sites. On the other hand, both archaeological and historical evidence indicate that the Yayoi Phase was the result of an invasion of people and culture from the continent. Yayoi- type assemblages have been found in Korea, Manchuria, and the Maritime Prov- ince of Siberia.20 Knowledge of rice-culture, as far as we now know, first came to Japan on the waves of this invasion. There are but few Yayoi sites where bronze artifacts are absent from the total assemblage of Yayoi traits, suggesting a brief duration for the non-bronze ("Neolithic") stage of the Yayoi Phase. The first bronze implements found in Japan bear unmistakable resemblances to Han Dynasty bronzes, although China had long been acquainted with the metal (throughout the Chou Dynasty). Coins of the Eastern Han Dynasty found in Japan are the earliest archaeological evidence of contact with China, while Chinese records of the middle of the third century BC hint at contacts with the people of Japan.21 We can therefore reasonably assume that a Yayoi invasion from Northeast Asia via Korea took place not long before about 300 BC.

With a superior culture and armament these newcomers found it possible to advance slowly northward against the Ainu and eventually to push them out of Honshu. Both archaeology and history record quite amply the story of the Ainu retreat. It is often inferred that the people who were responsible for the Yayoi suc- cession in Japan were the ancestors of the modem Japanese. It would then follow that the Japanese had a Northeast Asiatic homeland prior to their present one. This inference is by no means universally accepted. Some scholars attempt to show a generic relationship between the Japanese language and Malayo- Polynesian; others point out many unquestionably southern traits in the modem Japanese culture. Although the case for a language relationship between Japanese and Malayo-Polynesian is far from demonstrated, the ethnological findings are reinforced by the work of Hasebe and Matsumura on modem Japa- nese physical types. Hulse, making a comparative analysis of these types, finds that both narrow-foreheaded and broad-foreheaded types, though "obviously Mongoloid," may incorporate some non-Mongoloid elements. If we postulate an early occupation of the Pacific Coast of Asia by peoples intermediate between Australoid and Caucasian, then, Hulse concludes, "their mixtures with various Mongoloid peoples at different times and places might explain . . the Ishikawa and Wakayama [narrow-foreheaded group] in Japan."22 Although the evidence is still far too scanty, it is possible that the Yayoi culture, borne into Japan by Mongoloids from Northeast Asia, was infiltrated by cultural influences from Southeast Asia and perhaps Malaysia. The agents of this infiltration were perhaps of a mixed (Mongoloid and Caucasian) physical type, who interbred with the Yayoi Mongoloids to produce the modern Japanese. Undoubtedly careful comparative linguistic and ethnological studies will contribute much toward clarifying this vexing problem, but, as Hulse points out, neither historical nor ethnological data can reveal the racial background of the Japanese; only the direct study of physical types, both ancient skeletal and modem living, can yield this information. The same applies to the Ainu problem, where confusion reigns among both Japanese and occidental scholars. To the question: were the Ainu the prehis- toric inhabitants of Japan and therefore the makers of Jomon pottery?- Prof Koganei, the foremost student of Ainu physical anthropology, responds 22 F. S.

JAPANESE PREHISTORY 65</page><page sequence="14">66 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY unequivocally "das Japanischen Reich war einst ein Aino-Reich."23 Others refer to the skeletal remains from Jomon sites as representing a people "akin" to the Ainu but not their direct forefathers;24 or, as representing neither the ancestors of the present Ainu nor of the present Japanese.25 Torii's most recent pro- nouncement is indicative of the present status of the problem; he says "I cannot unreservedly accept this theory-that the Neolithic vestiges are of the Ainu. . . . It will suffice to say that they are very much Ainu-like, if not quite of the Ainu."26 Even more hotly disputed is the question of Ainu origins. Here too there is a wide variety of hypotheses based upon all too little scientific investigation. Sternberg sees in modern Ainu culture many survivals of southern traits and finds, as do Rivet and Matsumoto,27 linguistic affinities between Ainu and the Oceanic languages, on the basis of which he is convinced that the Ainu originated in an "Austronesian" homeland.28 To Montandon,29 Zolotarev,30 and others the Ainu culture is part of the Palaeo-Asiatic or "Arctic" cycle of cultures. Closely related to the problem of Ainu origins is the strictly archaeological problem of the source of the culture whose manifestations in the soil of Japan have been termed Jomon. If indeed the Ainu were the bearers of this culture it can be expected that determination of the region (or regions) from which it spread to Japan might throw some light upon the area from which the Ainu originally emigrated. It is at this point that the problem broadens its scope to include the archaeology of much of the Far East. Without a far greater knowledge of the prehistoric archaeology of this portion of the globe than we now have, negative evidence, for the most part, confronts us in our search for Jomon-like traits.

The earliest Jomon cultural assemblages thus far identified are located in the Kwanto Plain, a region remote from any possible route of entry into the Japanese archipelago. This situation argues for the existence of earlier, as yet undiscovered, assemblages located nearer a possible source of entry, such as northwest Kyushu. That there was a minimum of foreign cultural contact during the Jomon Phase is at least suggested by the fairly continuous line of ceramic development that can now be traced in certain areas of Japan. The general impression of more or less uniformity of the rest of the cultural assemblage, allowing for certain local differences which may come to light, further argues for the development of culture in comparative isolation during the Jomon Phase in Japan. Although we can estimate the date when the Jomon Phase came to an end (roughly 300 BC) on reasonably sure grounds, it is a different matter to deter- mine when it began. Certain clues exist, however, which invite an attempt in this direction. On the basis of the apparent factor of isolation, discussed above, and of the unusual advancement of the ceramic art during the Jomon Phase, we are inclined to agree with Sansom that "this early culture, in order to reach such a degree of perfection, must have gone through a very long development in Japan."31 Jomon sites have been found from Okinawa to Hokkaido but For- mosa and the Philippines, on the basis of archaeological remains, seem to belong to a different cultural sphere.32 Torii asserts that "there has scarcely been dis- covered anything that bears resemblance to them [Jomon traits] . . . either in Chosen, Manchuria, Mongolia, Siberia, China or the South Sea Islands."33 He admits, however, the occurrence of a "vestige of a similar type" at Gladekow, in the Maritime Province of Siberia, and of a "possible exception to this generaliza- tion" in Shantung Sheng. Recently Andersson reported on the Ch'i Chia and Yang Shao remains in North China, representing the earliest prehistoric cultural phases known in this area (with the exception of Chou Kou Tien).34 Ch'i Chia pottery shows close resemblance in decorative effects to early types of Jomon ware.

These hints of Jomon connections with Northeast Asia are offered as a suggestion that the problem of Jomon origins can be solved through more extensive research on the Asiatic continent and more thorough examination of the Japanese material. To assume a Northeast Asiatic origin for Jomon is not to preclude the possi- bility of the acquisition of certain traits from Southeast Asia and Malaysia, such as tanged axes, stone saws, quadrangular adzes, and the violin-shaped choppers. We have already suggested a long period of Jomon development in Japan. The early departure of the Jomon culture bearers from the continent is hinted at by the fact that neither the potter's wheel nor, apparently, rice culture were known throughout the Jomon Phase although as early as 1700 BC the prehistoric people of North Central China were using the potter's wheel and apparently had some knowledge of cultivated rice.36 The argument from such meager information becomes an exercise in dialectics if pressed too far. SUMMARY The writer has attempted to survey, very briefly, the current problems in Japanese archaeology as gleaned from recent Japanese publications and discus- sions with Japanese archaeologists. Space has not permitted the presentation of the results of various researches carried on in Japan during the past ten years or so, from which these problems have been formulated. Discussion of excava- tion techniques, pottery types, trait distributions, types of sites, etc., must be left to subsequent publications. It is clear, however, that in spite of the energy with which our Japanese colleagues have prosecuted their research, the following problems still await solution: 1. Who were the bearers of the Jomon "culture"? 2. From what area was the Jomon "culture" derived? 3. What was the nature of the transition from the Jomon Phase to the Yayoi Phase? 4. What is the connection, if any, between the Yayoi "culture" and the ancestors of the modern Japanese? 5. What are the racial affinities of the prehistoric peoples of Japan? Only a more refined and extensive examination of the archaeological evidence both in Japan and in the entire Far East can provide the answers. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 35 W. C.
