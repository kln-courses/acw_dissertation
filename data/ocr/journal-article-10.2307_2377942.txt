<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMANISM AND ETHICS EUGENE GARRET BEWKES W X THAT a confusion of tongues! What a mixture of loyalties under the conjuring word "humanism"! V T The word had a generally accepted meaning; but in the face of recent appearances we are mindful of Augustine, who said of space and time that we know what they are until we try to define them. There is definite historic content in the word. The students of philosophy and of literature can, with common agreement, point to the Greek period of Socrates and Protagoras, Plato and Aristotle, and to the Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with its names-Erasmus, Machiavelli, Montaigne. But "humanism" has never meant a doctrine. There never was a humanist creed. In Greece the word is properly applied to the movement away from cosmology to the exploration of human nature. The Renaissance earned it by reviving the lost Greek art of the humanities; by turning away from the other- worldliness of a theocratic civilization to man as a world in himself-man revealed, not as mere layman, but human like a Greek god. And humanism contributed abundantly of good and of ill. The spirit of humanism, never completely absent, has, as a wide movement, come to life again in our own time. This should cause us no surprise. It is a symptom of any age of tran- sition. As in other times of great change, this term again shel- ters under its wing peculiar fledgelings. Just as today we find moralists, economists, sociologists, ministers, writers, educa- tors, all accepting the word; so for the Renaissance we apply it in terms of religion, art, literature, and culture generally. Hu- manism is an expansive trisyllable, a veritable "big-tent" of a word, sheltering many varieties of performance under its I4</page><page sequence="2">HUMANISM AND ETHICS I5 spreading canvas. But it does not include as much as Norman Foerster includes in it when, among humanists, he enumerates not only Virgil, Plato, Dante, and Emerson but Jesus and Paul. There is a literary brand which has elicited much current at- tention from the magazines and reviews as though it properly belonged in the main ring, whereas its appropriate status would be ranking place with the sideshows. This reference is, of course, to the recent symposium, Humanism and America, edited by Foerster, which would pre-empt the label for a very select literary fraternity. We insist this will not do at all, for humanism is beyond such narrow confinement. Its application to religion, for instance, brings in a host of problems uncon- sidered by the symposium. And the literati are quite disagreed among themselves. The skeleton of sectarian warfare rattles with amusement as literary deacons accept into or reject from membership. This type of humanism is a fragment-a real portion-but not at all an adequate indication of the signif- icant nature of the movement. These men who are semi-ascet- ics and too particular about their area of fellowship are not at the foundations of humanism, nor will they affect any consid- erable numbers. They have really no philosophic position, and no bona fide message other than a vague ethical generality about self-restraint and temperance in all things. It stands as a hazy individualism deferent to the Golden Mean, which is good as far as it goes. This type of humanist has little expecta- tion of affecting humanity at large. The millennial hope of this secluded circle is exhausted in the prospect of "a few thou- sand genuine humanists in America" who "would make our so- ciety humanistic; a hundred humanist painters, sculptors, architects, musicians, and men of letters would make our art solidly humanistic." This is too supercollegiate, and we are forced to accept the judgment that a few thousand of this sort would exhaust the supply and leave untouched vast numbers of our people who are already affected by something less clois-</page><page sequence="3">i6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS tered in the humanist movement, something that goes down deeper into the stream of modern life. Modern humanism was at first a more or less vague attitude of mind, but it has become increasingly self-conscious. Hu- manism is descriptive of that crystallization or precipitation that has been taking place in the modern mind. It is our Zeit- geist. It has not been so much a resultant of philosophical in- quiry as a rebound from scientific acquaintance. Philosophical inquiry has contributed its share all along, but the genesis was more popular than that. The inception of humanism has been more naive than philosophy. It is a name for a feeling that has been stealing over not only the large and growing college-edu- cated stratum of society but vast numbers closely allied there- to. I am certain that it made its way upon us at first as an unavoidable, sophisticated, yet unphilosophic movement of thought reacting upon natural-science facts, principally those of biology and psychology. This is too familiar to us now to be at all impressive. I do not wish to dwell on this and shall, there- fore, not labor the point. It has been stressed and restressed. It is the customary condition discerned to lie at the base of our intellectual and religious upheaval. While this is a familiar state of affairs to us, it is none the less a pertinent fact still to be taken into account. But here I shall simply assume a gen- eral acknowledgment of the fact that the impact of the great mass of scientific data has tended to make doubt and skepti- cism widespread, particularly in regard to the validity of moral ideals and religious experience. Illustrations of this are legion, but a perfect example lies ready to hand in an Atlantic Month- ly article just now laid aside. At the very end are these words by a traveler who has come back to the town of his youth after years of wandering. Attending a religious service as of yore he reacts as follows: As the fathers, markedly aged during the years of my wanderings, knelt one by one and asked fervently for the same old impossible things . my eyes in roaming about the familiar place rested upon a print</page><page sequence="4">HUMANISM AND ETHICS I 7 of the crucified Christ hanging upon the wall. The gaunt body was raised against an utterly barren background, and as I looked at it the futility of altruistic goodness swept over me. Then, as if by a magician's wand, I saw poor humanity through His eyes, and suddenly loved Him. Quietly I got up and slipped out into the night. The sky was clear, and the stars in their fathomless black gulfs were sweeping on. . . . . What was I-the man on the cross-all life-in the face of that cold and heartless immen- sity? As the unthinkable aeons wore on, even those stars would be utterly annihilated and return into the void .... . Against such a spectacle those old men praying to their own collective shadow seemed less than nothing. . . . . Is science leading man into a deadly morass from which is no escape . . . . and will he continue to dwindle until all his glorious spiritual heritage is lost. Or will man eventually rise triumphant over a depersonalized universe, and reconstruct another spiritual kingdom nobler and more spacious than that which science has destroyed? This is precisely the feeling that comes over the modern mind quite independently of philosophy and literature. Follows then philosophical statement; and one of the most incisive and sys- tematic expressions of this mood is by Professor Sellars, of Michigan, who is a confessed humanist. And we can say that, on the whole, humanists have wished to be and have regarded themselves as being genuinely en rapport with the work of sci- ence, though the literary group aforementioned pretend-I wonder if they really mean it-that their affirmations stand quite aloof from the sciences. They do protest against human- ity's engulfment in a cauldron of molecules. The fact is, how- ever, that these natural sciences are after all largely the mother of humanism, even if by way of mild protest. Humanists in general are all for the sciences; and surely that is well, though one may be permitted to entertain the opinion that too hasty conclusions have been drawn as to what this alliance requires us to give up. There are those who think of humanists in purely negative fashion, as rejectors of old landmarks, a putting off of the old man, coming up naked through scientific baptism. On the con- trary, the evangelical humanist, the humanist with a message</page><page sequence="5">i8 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS and a degree of fervency, repudiates such a negative, sterile view of things. He has gone on beyond this. Faced by such a universe of "cold and heartless immensity," he has preferred to turn away from some of the gaping and oppressive implica- tions of this drear bleakness. He pauses momentarily to won- der, "Will man eventually rise triumphant above a deperson- alized universe, and reconstruct another spiritual kingdom nobler and more spacious than that which science has de- stroyed? " Then he courageously answers in the affirmative, and herewith it can be asserted confidently that the most genu- ine connotation of humanism is its use as a description of just this modern endeavor, in the face of, and on a background of, a cosmic order accepted and conceived to be impersonal and non-spiritual. Humanism means to be positive. It does not merely disen- throne anthropomorphic concepts from cosmic sway, crown- ing them anew to reign over the sufficiently wide domain of emergent humanity. The humanist will endeavor to be not simply a fatalistic Stoic wringing good out of an indifferent and bludgeoning fate: he means to do all this and more. He means that his courage is no vain gesture, no wishful thinking, not at all a whistling beside a graveyard of buried hopes. Nay; rather, humanism feels the security of intellectual dignity. It has become philosophically self-conscious. Humanism has con- siderable philosophic support, not alone from the familiar neg- ative or bald naturalism, but more especially from the move- ment of pragmatism. The greatest support for humanism as it faces away from the bleak past toward some sort of hopeful future is the current philosophy of instrumentalism. This is the real ally in the field of thought. It is the philosophic coun- terpart of a scientific age but is not usually recognized as pro- viding the intellectual structure of humanism. In instrumentalism I believe we have humanism come to philosophic maturity, for here is the most genuine support for the deep conviction or faith that humanity has within it its own gods. Instrumentalism provides a philosophical approach</page><page sequence="6">HUMANISM AND ETHICS I9 much more subtle than the earlier naturalism. The older view, with its dualism of mind and matter, things spiritual and things material, is quite simple to grasp and not unduly diffi- cult to debate. We were asked to give up many things, but at any rate we were left one thing in common, e.g., the possibility of a theory of knowledge. Truth was considered to be an object of knowledge, and the knowledge process revelatory of reality. Instrumentalism puts philosophy on a different basis. It does not even debate the theistic or teleological problems; it has a way of sweeping these questions aside as irrelevant to a philos- ophy really modern and scientific. Grant the premises, and you must perforce admit these questions to be relics, toys of philosophic childhood, put away in the maturity of intellectual manhood recently attained. While this is, to be sure, a natural- ism, it purports to go beyond former crudities. Here, if any- where, we have the intellectual flower of humanism. It is a significant fact, and yet, but for Schiller's identification, I am not aware that the two terms have been frequently coupled together. Our philosophic habit has been to note the passage of the mind from some view of reality as materialistic, mechanistic, idealistic, realistic, to the practical consequences for morality and religion. While this is still a valid procedure, we have in the case of instrumentalism a passage, not from some theory of ultimate being, but from a theory of knowing to ethics; and it is a unique state of affairs. On this view, theories about reality are irrelevant human questions, and our concern is with the knowledge process and whatever this implies for human con- duct. I am leaning on the term instrumentalistm" rather than bracketing it together with pragmatism, for, while they are as intimately associated as father and son, there is considerable difference between them. Pragmatism, at least in the William James meaning, had room for a "will to believe" and other philosophical discussions antedated by the more recent posi- tion. Professor Montague sees a close connection between the</page><page sequence="7">20 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS pragmatic-instrumental movement and ethical utilitarianism, in that the ethical relativity of utilitarianism suggested the pragmatic method, which holds to relativity in regard to truth. That is to say, because of the apparent success of utilitarianism in making the moral good consist in the expedient or satisfac- tory in the way of conduct, so, by suggestion, came the prag- matic idea that logical value or truth consisted in the expedient or satisfactory way of belief. I am not disposed to quarrel with the statement that there was historically this one-way traffic from utilitarianism to pragmatism, though many would regard it more as a revolt against absolute idealism. Be that as it may, as matters stand now, the horse's head is where its tail ought to be. For my point is just this, that instrumentalism stands now on its own feet, in its own right as a logical theory with resulting humanistic ethical implications, quite independently of any connection with nineteenth-century ethics. The ethical position is here so closely bound up with the general theory of knowledge that it seems impossible to discuss one without at least stating broadly the other. The fact of this connection is brought out specifically by John Dewey in his Gifford Lectures at several points, as well as in earlier writings. The visual imagery which insists on presenting itself to my mind whenever I try sympathetically to look through Dewey's eyes upon the world at large is a world of movement, the world of Heraclitus. It is like the surface of a churning sea, or more like the boiling, seething movement of molten lava. Life and its activities is this heated mass, and philosophy is the attempt to make one's intellectual way in it. There are too many fac- tors to know anything final about it. We never know what will come to the surface next. While, on the one hand, we are coun- seled to sum up the "aggregate consequences," on the other hand we are impressed with the fact that it is always a "run- ning account" we are keeping. The oft-referred-to "continu- ing consequences" are like the quest for certainty-always beyond us, futile for pursuit.</page><page sequence="8">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 2I The position is that formerly, and even still in current an- tique philosophy, knowledge is looked upon as superior to sense experience, as though knowledge was concerned prima- rily with what accounted for change. Knowledge sought the permanent, the immutable. But philosophy, as well as science, has business with activity, with changes that are occurring taken as facts; knowledge is concerned with relations between changes, but these are not constituents of some higher realm of being. Rational thought is one of the elements of experi- ence-not a something distinct from experience. Only, "the correlations between changes . . . . when measured by a series of operations, constitute the definite and desired object of knowledge." Thus scientific method is not viewed as one form of reflective thinking: it is the whole of reflective thinking. Knowledge and action are one process. We are not selves watching a world and trying to estimate or evaluate it or dis- cern its meaning as a whole; we are completely submerged in and of the process. At best we can direct and control changes and should not hope to get a total view. The function of mind as knowing is an instrument of control; in short, acquaintance with correlations of change is the whole aim and extent of knowledge. For nature is merely "plastic material of human desires and purposes"-not something which has in it ends as intrinsic tendencies of nature's own operations. So we become "interested in the mechanism of occurrences instead of in final causes." Injection of interpretations on the conclusions of sci- ence is irrelevant philosophy. Drop that conception of knowl- edge, and there is no problem. Knowledge is concerned only with specific problems open to controlled analysis, and truth is the funded sum of such relations without interpretation. "Ideas are statements not of what is or has been, but of acts to be per- formed." We are told that "ideas are worthless except as they pass into actions which rearrange and reconstruct in some way . . .the world in which we live." Knowledge is denied a uniquely privileged position as a mode of access to reality. It</page><page sequence="9">2 2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS is merely a way of interaction, a mode of practical action, by which other natural interactions become subject to direction. Before stating the ethical result of this, it is essential to note that the chief justification which is relied on to support this whole theory is the assumed necessity of accepting for all knowledge purposes the recent scientific methods of modern physics in defining terms. "Length," for example, is a term which has a meaning determined by, and relative to, the par- ticular set of operations adapted for this particular occasion of measuring. The concept "length," therefore, is a dependent variable without absolute meaning. Thus all physical con- cepts, it is said, by Eddington, who is quoted for verification, "should be defined according to the way in which we recognize them when actually confronted with them, and not according to the metaphysical significance which we may have antici- pated for them." Dewey generalizes from this for all knowl- edge; and one might with warrant suspect this to be a case of oversimplification, which I really think it is. But more espe- cially is one impressed with the possibility of other interpreta- tions on the facts. I may not linger here other than to remark in passing that the relativity of terms like "length," "dis- tance," "mass," has changed our view of the material world, removing, if anything, the foundations of dogmatic material- ism, without compelling the introduction of a dogmatic theory of relative knowledge as its modern substitute. Our concep- tion of physical reality has been changed. Let it change! Let the objective world reveal whatever operations on it will bring to light, but it does not follow that this in itself sets any barrier to the attempt to discover the connotation or meaning of things thus experienced. But the position as now stated might be called "humanistic philosophy"-the philosophic statement which is the essence of humanism. Get behind the articles, papers, pamphlets, addresses, sermons, eulogies; trace humanism to its base; and this is what stands implicitly revealed. That is to say, between</page><page sequence="10">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 23 these two taken together, the older naturalism, which regards ultimate reality in terms of material substance in infinite com- plexity, and the more recent position called "instrumental- ism," which carries naturalism farther still to new conceptions of the nature of knowledge, mind, and ideas, we have the fun- damental philosophical background of modern humanism. So that now the whole process of logical or reflective thinking, which heretofore was able to stand somewhat aloof from the older naturalism as a kind of reality independent of atoms in motion, is claimed at last for the new naturalism. In the one case, we have what might be called the "negative view," which tended to minimize humanity as a by-product of nature; whereas in the second and intentionally more positive view, humanity has, or must determine to have, nature in its own control, in order to direct its changes. For, there are no dis- coverable urgencies in nature, no directing power which has or is ordering the whole process of change by purposes toward ends. As human, we are aware of an aspect of experience known as "ideas" which function to control changes. We know of no other directing agency. There is none else but this direct- ing power of man himself. The movement away from theism can hardly go farther than this "human-ism." The ethical results from both the foregoing lines of thought might be said in the long run to converge; yet, as a matter of fact, it is well to distinguish the two avenues by which we pass to that long-run convergence. The first may be quickly stated: It is the now familiar path from that reality of bleak nature to the fact of humanity with its altruism, its sympathies, co-oper- ation, and sociability. It was made famous by Huxley, who thinks of ethics as a human construct arising somewhat inde- pendently in defiance of the ordinary course of nature. It can quite legitimately receive characterization as a Stoic attitude. A modern untechnical form of it is found in Lippmann's Pref- ace to Morals, where the mature man is he who "feels the vast indifference of the universe to his own fate, and has placed</page><page sequence="11">24 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS himself in the perspective of cold and illimitable space." And "to one who takes the humanistic view, the problem is how mankind deprived of the great fictions is to come to terms with the needs that created those fictions." The background of this attitude is plainly what we have here called the "negative view." Lippmann tries wistfully but un- successfully to build an ethical hope on this. The technical form of such ethics is called "scientific ethics," which insists that ethics is a separate scientific discipline without further need of philosophy. But more of this anon, for it is closely allied to what follows. The second line of approach is from a working relativity of truth to a relativity of moral values, from ideas or knowledge as instruments to values as instruments, neither one pointing beyond itself to a reality that is not relative. The significant step here is from epistemology to ethics, an application of the theory of knowledge to theory of morals. Just as ideas have nothing to do with existence, but are merely effective ways of thinking or adjusting; so values have nothing to do with being, but are judgments about the regulation and formation of de- sires, affections, and judgments. The world of change in which ideas function is just as much a world of flux for morals. There is no more of reality for the one than the other; no more clues in regard to ultimate meanings in one than the other. There is no possibility of rational or a priori guidance for morals any more than there is for a priori guidance to knowledge. We must, as in the case of ideas, so also in values, rely completely on definite operations and method. But what is a value? Many experiences we have are casually valued, and these are always enjoyment experiences; but since all enjoyment ex- periences are not really valuable, we have to evaluate these experiences. What makes an enjoyment experience valuable? This is a difficult question; but it is correct to answer, I think, that there are states of affairs, relative to what we now are, which will, when revealed by carefully directed operations,</page><page sequence="12">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 25 yield experiences judged to be valuable. But we cannot be as- sisted in our judgment by any table of values. There are no such norms or objective factors; and any attempt to appeal to a theoretical hierarchy of values is a confession, it is said, of our inability to frame intelligent judgments. Dewey is not definite enough here. However, on what has been stated, we can allow this valid inference, as given by Dewey, that the acceptance of his approach "would place method and means upon a level of importance that has in the past been imputed exclusively to ends." So that of these ends or ideals it is said, "They hover in an indefinite way over the actual scene; they are expiring ghosts of a once significant kingdom of divine reality. . . . ." The sum and substance of these ethical sug- gestions is that ethics must adopt scientific method and hope to discover at least hypothetical values. We have reached a point where we are able to formulate cer- tain broad and distinctive characteristics of humanistic ethics. Whether one's philosophic outlook is dominated by the older naturalism or the more recent pragmatic or instrumental the- ories of knowledge, we have the basis for a humanistic ethics. And further, there is a place of meeting here also on the plat- form of humanist ethics for all those realists who, though they may not accept any instrumental theory of ideas, yet set a gulf between ideas and values, accepting the one as valid for what is, but regarding values as relative to desires and appre- ciations. In reality, then, there is no state of affairs for value. A humanistic ethics appears thus to be a prized goal as well as the inevitable result of varying philosophical drifts. A set of fundamentals is given by Mr. Sellars, who has announced himself as a representative of this newer-evolving view of ethics, which he claims is neither utilitarian nor Kantian, and is called by him "experimental humanism." He writes: It asserts that the basic thing in ethics is human good and that human good is the satisfaction of human interests. The living soul is an integra- tion of interests having what may be called a dynamic balance or moving</page><page sequence="13">2 6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS equilibrium. These interests manifest themselves as specific desires which are then valued in the light of one's general system of values or plan of life. It must be remembered that such desires are, at the level of ethics, rationally interpreted desires, that is, they are brought into relation with one another and with their bearing upon the individual and the social group. The living soul is, then, what we call a system of interests and ac- tivities. These interests may be called values or things valued. Another point. The living soul is always a socially molded soul, and its interests are never purely biological and personal. The human self embraces all that it is interested in, all that it identifies itself with. The flaw in much of the past egoistic hedonism was its inadequate conception of the human self. What does duty mean for such a position? Surely the fact of moral choice. Values conflict and a preference is often demanded. . . . . Here we have our idea of the self, the objectives and standards which we with the help of society have built upon; and here we have a desire, a demand, a danger. What decision shall we make? . . . . It would seem that there is a principle of harmony-seeking in our souls and that we are constantly checking up on the lastingness of the satisfaction which various lines of activity give us. It is to be noted in this ethical program that human good is defined in terms of satisfaction of human interests. The inter- ests are called "values or things valued." The interests are manifested by specific desires which are valued according as they do or do not fit into one's plan of life. Duty and ought are smothered under the assertion that they reveal or indicate the fact of choice required by our accepted interests. As a mat- ter of fact, I seem to find in this only a new form for some older ways of thinking, as well as an attempt to eat and have one's cake at the same time. In other words, the good does not de- termine interest, but interest determines the good. Now that differs only in form, but not fundamentally from the genius of utilitarianism, which defined the good in terms of human desire and then singled out pleasure as the interest. The dif- ference is only a matter of improved psychology, which would include more interests, pleasure counting for one. And I have also some doubt whether Kant has been left behind, for what is one to understand by this alleged "principle of harmony-seek- ing in our souls"?</page><page sequence="14">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 27 It becomes increasingly clear, not alone from the argument and illustrations of this paper, but as one pursues this ethical trail in a number of the writings of the present time, that the significant aspects of any humanistic ethics now or at any time are three: the attempted severance of ethics and metaphysics; the consequent effort to make ethical good and moral values relative to human desires and interests; and, finally, the con- fidence that scientific method in ethics is completely sufficient to meet the needs and problems of ethics. If this trinity can be sustained, let it be sustained; but I have the assurance that its acceptance involves considerable faith over and above any support thus far advanced. I do not deride the element of faith but merely point to the fact that we need to be aware of its presence, for humanistic ethics is not an irresistible intellectual requirement. Consider briefly these three general aspects of humanistic ethics. Take the confidence in scientific ethics first. One may have a high regard for the application of scientific method to ethics, and one should have. There is no intent here to cast aspersions on science as such. We are quite sincerely respect- ful toward any scientific effort. I am a little reluctant to con- fess that I once thought scientific ethics offered the virtual solution of ethical problems; but now, while I still think it es- sential to be developed as far as possible, a few considerations have made me question the finality of this ethical panacea. Scientific ethics goes something like this: Learning from bi- ology, we think of the human as an organism. It has needs and functions. Instead of theorizing about the good, we get down to the business of finding out what these functions and needs are. Manifestly, the good of the organism lies in the direction of the fulfilment of our being in its relation to the environment. It must be properly adjusted. What are the real needs? Medi- cine can tell us quite objectively what the needs of the body are, and man is morally responsible for flying in the face of what medicine can tell him. Psychology and psychiatry can tell us about the necessity for a well-balanced, integrated,</page><page sequence="15">28 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS harmonious personality freed from morbid complexes, phan- tasies, and overcompensations. It also can certify to the neces- sity for ideals, individual and social, which are human ends functioning in an organizing capacity with reference to the competing activities and interests individual and social. And I submit that these are very valuable data, providing ethics with a considerable amount of objective fact. But this emphasis on adjustment raises a difficult problem- in fact, a dilemma. What kind of an adjustment or equilibrium do we have to make with the environment? It is either a static or a moving equilibrium. If a static equilibrium is argued for, then ethics should discover fixed relations that are actually re- quired by the environment, which would certainly give us ob- jectivity; and if we could effect the adjustment, the evolution- ary process would have ceased. This seems to have been imbedded in the positivist view of Comte, who said, "If socio- logical laws are positively established as certainly as the laws of gravitation, no room is left for opinion; the proper function of every member of society admits of no question; therefore the claim to liberty is perverse and irrational." In order to avoid this undesirable position, the current habit is to argue for a moving equilibrium, thus protecting the theory of evolu- tion and allowing for continued change, which is Dewey's main theme. But then, what is the ground of change, the principle of change? What is to be the use of all this method we are told about unless it reveals at least some basis of change? Equi- librium is now no test. How do we know we are going forward? Undifferentiated human interests are admittedly no test. What are the criteria? Are there no higher and lower interests so that an increase of one or the other shows an increase in real values and therefore reveals progress in some direction? Sci- entific ethics seems to be required to evade this question. Furthermore, scientific ethics has a very hard time with such terms as the "self,' the "will,' "character," 'motive." From</page><page sequence="16">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 29 a strictly scientific point of view, the tendency is to describe these in physical terms, with a half-hearted recognition that of course there is the psychic side. What the relation is be- tween the two is never decided, but the drift is toward the mechanics of the situation. This is well illustrated by Trol- land's book, Fundamentals of Human Motivation, where a psycho-physical parallelism is accepted; but the explanations of terms are almost wholly physical. For example: Character may be permitted to denote the system of established specific response mechanisms, together with the corresponding psychical phenom- ena; while temperament can stand for the system of conditioned retro- flexes and associated uniformities of affective experience [p. 467]. And in like manner, Sorrow is an affective state, resulting from the removal of an accus- tomed stimulus which strongly conditions one or more positive retroflex mechanisms. It may also accompany the loss of a stimulus which stands for protection against nociceptive excitation [p. 448]. This may all be, and may represent the physical counterpart of the sorrow experience or the physical explanation of char- acter without helping us to understand it from the standpoint of moral experience. But suppose now we actually go beyond Dewey and con- struct a value theory scientifically. Let us suppose we had, as I really think we have, already much material drawn from ra- cial experience out of which to construct a value theory of ethics. This calls for the acceptance of a group of ethical val- ues derived from racial experience, and then these are set up as representing the best we know in the way of human attain- ment. This provides considerable ethical objectivity, leaving room for subjective selection in accordance with necessary in- dividual variations. It is of very considerable worth and pro- vides not only ethical guidance for the individual but offers the best approach to social ethics now available. For this very pur- pose it has been taken advantage of by Professor Edward C. Hayes in his Sociology and Ethics, and also by the noted Brit-</page><page sequence="17">30 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS ish economist, J. A. Hobson, in his very recent Economics and Ethics. It is our opinion that this is the best road to the reconcilia- tion of the subjective and objective requirements of ethics. But let this approach be as scientific as possible; even so it can only bring us to a certain point and say to us that such and such things have been valued or are now valued. And having done so, it can add-I quote from Everett-"Now the moral task of the individual is to appropriate the values which have been thus won in the historical life of the race, and to strive for their further enrichment and extension." What is here in- volved is the problem of motivation. Does the scope of ethics stop short of, or does it include, motivation? Since, or if, knowledge is not virtue, we cannot assume that the bare state- ment of achieved values is enough. And if scientific ethics must include motivation, then it is in danger of regarding morality in terms of habit patterns or controlled behavior, which pretty well reduces to automatic action or mechanization. In this case moral lapse becomes a kind of unfortunate but uncondemned error of the organism. Moral judgment becomes somewhat unreal. Scientific ethics cannot wrestle with the question, "What really makes men moral?" The humanist may answer that if a man studies ethics, he ought to have sense enough to be ethi- cal. Somehow our racial judgment is that men are not made moral that way. In regard to the problem of motivation, I am inclined to think that humanism, in its attempt to be strictly scientific, by isolating man as a lone detached island in the cosmos, has severed itself completely from any possible opti- mism concerning the worth of human personality, which I think is crucial for moral motivation. I have often been im- pressed with a fact, which I was interested to note has also caught the attention of Mr. Lippmann-in the stories of he- roes, sages, explorers, patriots, pioneers, There is almost this same underlying theme of sacrifice and unworldli- ness . They are poor. They live dangerously ... . They live</page><page sequence="18">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 3' for ends which seem to yield them no profit, and they are ready to die, if need be, for that which the dead can no longer enjoy .... . And yet, though there is nothing in our current morality to justify this unworldli- ness, we continue to admire them greatly. Now Mr. Lippmann seems to sense an impotence on the part of humanism to create that type of character which he admires and feels is very much needed, and he reaches out but finds nothing in his grasp. It seems to me humanism has cut itself off from producing such fruitage, because there is no profound moral dynamic in a position, which, no matter how profuse in lip service to ideals, nevertheless metaphysically makes men insignificant, unimportant to the cosmic or even the evolution- ary process. I see no possibility of moral vigor on any view where fundamentally we think in terms of the "futility of altru- istic goodness." Despite these inadequacies of scientific ethics to meet all the problems of ethics, especially that of motivation, I should maintain that scientific ethics can be instrumental as providing a stage from which man's rational interpretations and efforts can take off and reach out toward values discerned to lie in some definite direction. On the basis of reasonable probability, we must go beyond nature as now given, in the hope of gaining further revelations of what is in nature to be discovered and re- vealed. Employ method, but also interpret the results. Let us for a moment consider humanism and the problem of value and good. The point of view of humanism toward value is that values are relative and based entirely on human inter- ests which are themselves changing, and that the good is what- ever is valued. Value judgments are attributive only in so far as the object is linked to human life appreciatively. As noted earlier, this is a philosophical meeting ground where the lion and the lamb lie down together. To be sure, we should be able to agree at least that values require judgments of appreci- ation; but the real question is as to the status of these judg- ments and why we appreciate some things and not others; why these things satisfy human interests and some others do not.</page><page sequence="19">32 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS We cannot lightly ride over the fact that human interests are not completely at random but appear to have some measure of compulsion or moral necessity. And to say human interests change does not dispose of the question but rather raises a more insistent one, e.g., "In what direction are they changing? " The humanist really values the values. He is endeavoring to accept the bare fact that the interesting human biped values the pursuit of "knowledge" and truth, that he loves beauty and creates art, and that he regards some types of conduct better than others. He wishes to give second place to no one in recog- nizing the great values that give life dignity. The humanist is aware that man will struggle for knowledge, suffer for it, search it out as a pearl of great price for which he will pay. Knowledge is and has primarily been for man an intrinsic value first, and only secondarily instrumental. The humanist is aware that man at his best recognizes kindness to be intrinsically better than meanness, and sincerity far above hypocrisy, and sym- pathetic understanding far beyond cold indifference. But he tries to accept all these value experiences merely as facts about humans-interesting to be sure, but not revelatory beyond the bare fact. On such a view of the relativity of values you cannot consist- ently maintain any compulsion or obligation to achieve these values; and yet, as a matter of fact, there is no morality at all without the fact of ought. There is thus, not merely the prob- lem of motivation, but also the problem of obligation. Mr. Dewey admits the absence of any logical basis for obligation, yet he wrestles with it without solution. He appears to recog- nize that there are some things (he calls them in this instance "tastes" instead of "values") that ought to be cultivated though "logically there is no ground for introducing the idea of cultivation. . . . .." This is a very important admission, and I cannot help feeling that on this very point Sorley, in his Gifford Lectures, has stated the situation in a form that cannot be ignored. He has shown that whenever or wherever in our</page><page sequence="20">HUMANISM AND ETHICS 33 philosophical arguments we try to derive ethical truths from non-ethical premises "there must be some proposition which, in our system, contains for the first time an ethical notion. ...." Yet, "Where are the non-ethical premises which, of themselves, justify an ethical conclusion?" I think it correct to say further that whatever the subject of our proposition when we say, "This being or this kind of life, or this attitude, is good," the predicate "good" enters as a new notion which is superadded to, and not derived from, the logical or mathe- matical or causal relations already involved. Whether one cares to follow the road farther with Sorley is beside the point here. But at this juncture I wish to make clear that the humanist is too easily exhausting the meaning of val- ues by calling them relative. The loss of any real obligation is involved in such procedure. For, if we completely sunder exist- ence and value, we can expect to erect an ethics only as a virtual side-product opposed to reality. We cannot logically pass from one to the other, and yet the fact of obligation we needs must have if morality is to be genuine. We have now observed that the attempt to make of ethics a kind of self-explanatory descriptive science has two primary limitations. While it can utilize facts from anthropology and physiology and psychology and from the evolution of morals, it is impotent to say where we should go from here and why. It is inadequate from the standpoint of motivation. Further, sci- entific method as such is unable to account for obligation, for it cannot bring the value judgment within the scope of natural- ism. And it has these inadequacies because it is trying to evade the metaphysical implications of ethics. Humanistic ethics thinks it can get along without metaphysics. One can achieve such separation only by an arbitrary insistence on keeping his eyes closed. On this point we may be permitted to refrain from saying more than this: even though we be as scientific as we can, in so far as ethics can be made a science, it stands then on a</page><page sequence="21">34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS level with the other sciences. That is, a scientific ethics is no less related to philosophy than science in general stands to philosophy. Rather, there is a unique relation between ethics and philosophy. There needs to be, over and above scientific ethics, a philosophy of ethics, just as for evolutionary theory there needs to be a philosophy of evolution. Sooner or later we wish to have something to say about the value of values. It still remains true that science is not philosophy, and we cannot give up the task of interpretation and the discovery of meanings implicit if not scientifically explicit in things, as hu- manism would have us do.
