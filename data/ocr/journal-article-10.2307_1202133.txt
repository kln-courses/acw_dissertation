<plain_text><page sequence="1">"To the Unknown God": Luther and Calvin on the Hiddenness of God B. A. Gerrish There are those who commend the reply of Simonides, who, when asked by the tyrant Hiero what God was, begged he be granted a day to consider. The next day the tyrant repeated the question, and he requested two days more. Finally, after he had frequently doubled the number of days, he replied: "The longer I consider, the more obscure the subject seems to me." It was indeed sensible to suspend judgment on a subject he found obscure. But from this it appears that, were men taught by nature alone, they would hold nothing certain or solid or clear, but would be so attached to confused principles as to worship an unknown God.1 Calvin borrowed the anecdote from one of his favorite classical sources, Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods. The moral of the story he learned, not from his classics, but from the Acts of the Apostles (17:16-34).2 When the Apostle Paul was at Athens, we are told, he disputed in the market- place, his spirit aroused by the city of idols. Curious and eager to hear about Paul's strange gods, certain of the philosophers led him to the Areopagus (" Hill of Mars "), for at Athens one spent one's time hearing and telling about the latest thing. In his eloquent address, Paul declared to the Athenians the Unknown God, whose altar he had noticed as he passed by. Nobody can really be sure what the inscription "To an 263 1 John Calvin, Christianae religionis institutio, 1559 ed., 1.5.12. For the 1559 Institutio (henceforth, Inst., cited by book, chapter, and section), I follow the Latin text in Ioannis Calvini Opera Selecta, ed. Peter Barth and Wilhelm Niesel, 2d ed., 5 vols. (Munich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1958-62), vols. 3-5. Unless otherwise stated, trans- lations in this essay are mine. 2 Although Calvin uses the expression deus incognitus in the passage cited, rather than the more customary Latin rendering deus ignotus, an allusion to Acts 17:23 is supported by the frequent echoes of the Areopagus address throughout this chapter of the Institutio (see secs. 3, 9, 13, and 14).</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion Unknown God" may have meant.3 Possibly someone had received a good turn and did not know which god was to be thanked for it. Or perhaps a timid worshipper was afraid of missing out from his devotions some lesser deity, whose name he did not know (which would be like not inviting the thirteenth fairy to the birthday party). But whatever may have been meant by the inscription reportedly seen by the Apostle Paul, the expression "the Unknown God" passed into Christian litera- ture as a description for the total otherness of deity.4 Paul's discourse, we learn, was not a very great success. When he announced that the Lord of heaven and earth, in whom we live and move and have our being, had appointed Jesus to be judge at the last day and had raised him from the dead, some laughed; others said, more politely, "We will hear you again" (that is, some other time, not today); but a few be- lieved. And among the believers was Dionysius. Luxuriant legends have grown up around the figure of Dionysius: they bring his story to a remarkable end at Paris, where he became bishop, was martyred, and made patron saint of France. His name has fittingly, if incorrectly, been given to a body of mystical writings which constitute a moving tribute to the Unknown God. Through John Scotus Erigena, the theological vocabulary of Dionysius the Areopagite passed permanently into the Western tradition, especially in the form of the familiar "way of negation." Oddly perhaps, Dionysius is most often upbraided by his detractors for professing to know too much, rather than too little, about the deity. Calvin found The Heavenly Hierarchy subtle and keen in many respects, but "for the most part mere prattle." "If you were to read that book, you would think a man fallen from heaven related, not what he had learned, but what he had seen with his eyes." The Apostle Paul, on the other hand, though caught up to the third heaven, did not talk about it.5 A comparison of this negative assessment with a passage from Luther's Babylonian Captivity (1520) in- 3 Besides the commentaries on Acts, see Martin Dibelius, Studies in the Acts of the Apostles, ed.

Indeed, the language of the mystical tradition remained always congenial to him in some respects.7 I As early as the first Lectures on the Psalms (the Dictata of I513-16), Luther speaks of the incomprehensibility of God, and, in so doing, he refers favorably to Dionysius. Commenting on Psalm I8:II ("And he made the darkness his hiding-place"), Luther offers a fivefold applica- tion for the expression God's "hiding-place": God hides in the darkness of faith, in light inaccessible, in the mystery of the Incarnation, in the church or the Blessed Virgin, and in the Eucharist. But it is immediately noticeable that he speaks of God here, not as "unknown," but as "hidden" (absconditus).8 In tracing the development of Luther's the- ology in and beyond the first Lectures on the Psalms, Luther scholarship has gathered under the general rubric of "the Hidden God" several different theological ideas.9 6 So McNeill suggests in Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill and trans. Ford Lewis Battles, 2 vols., Library of Christian Classics, vols. 20, 21 (Philadelphia: Westminister Press, I960), I:164, n. 14. The phrase "that Diony- sius, whoever he was" does seem to echo Luther. It may be added that, in his com- mentary on Acts 17:34, Calvin expressly denies the identity of Dionysius the Areopagite with the author of the pseudo-Dionysian writings: Corpus Reformatorum: loannis Calvini Opera quae supersunt omnia, ed. G. Baum et al., 59 vols. (Braunschweig, 1863-1900), 26.423 (hereafter C.O., cited by volume and column). 7 A complex problem in itself, Luther's relations with mysticism were discussed at the Third International Congress on Luther Research (Jarvenpiii, Finland, 1966): see Ivar Asheim, ed., The Church, Mysticism, Sanctification and the Natural in Luther's Thought (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1967). 8 Martin Luther, D. Martin Luthers Werke: Kristische Gesamtausgabe (Weimar, 1883-), 3.I24.29 (henceforth, W.A., cited by volume, page, and line). The reference to Dionysius is under the second application of the text. Besides absconditus, Luther also uses the adjective occultus (" Quinto Sacramentum Eucharistie, ubi est occultissimus ") and the verb latere in this same passage. In his commentary ad loc., Calvin shows himself aware of the use made of Ps. 18:11 by previous exegetes, but judges that it refers, in fact, to God's anger (his retirement behind the clouds as his tent), not to the impenetrability of his glory (C.O. 31.176). A similar cautiousness marks his com- ments on Isa. 45:15 (C.O. 37.141-42): although the interpretation is close to the general motif of the theologia crucis, Calvin will not permit the text to be referred to Christ as the deus absconditus. 9 There are two major studies of Luther's doctrine of the deus absconditus: John Dillenberger, God Hidden and Revealed: The Interpretation of Luther's Deus Absconditus and Its Significance for Religious Thought (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, '953); 265</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion After a long period of relative neglect, the Hidden God was redis- covered in the pioneering work of Theodosius Harnack.1o He found that the notion of hiddenness expresses a double relation of God to the world: outside of Christ he is the free, all-working, majestic God of the Law; in Christ he is the gracious Redeemer who has bound himself to his Word and Sacraments. Not absolutely unknown, but rather un- known in respect of his grace, the Creator-God is the God of wrath. A second milestone in the interpretation of the deus absconditus was set up by Ferdinand Kattenbusch, who pointed to a quite different strand in Luther's thinking: God hides himself in his revelation, so that revelation and hiddenness are not opposed, but coincide."1 It goes without saying that each of these distinguished scholars based his case on careful 266 Hellmut Bandt, Luthers Lehre vom verborgenen Gott.

The question naturally arises, then, whether the rubric deus absconditus covers two distinct strands in Luther's theology, which have nothing in common with each other except the notion of hiddenness itself. It is not difficult to group Luther interpreters, despite differences within each group, according as they stress that the Hidden and Revealed Gods are antithetical (Theodosius Harnack, the two Ritschls, Reinhold Seeberg, Hirsch, Elert, Holl), or identical (Katten- busch, Erich Seeberg), or both (Althaus, Heim, von Loewenich).12 In his distinguished monograph on the subject, Hellmut Bandt asserts that the existence of two very dissimilar lines of thought side by side "is the fundamental problem given to the interpreter of Luther's doctrine of the Hidden God." is The problem is further complicated, we might add, by the fact that the elevation of the term deus absconditus to the status of a general rubric is, in part, a scholarly device. Luther's own language displays characteristic variety. To mention only the most im- portant variation, he sometimes speaks-especially in his latest period- of the "Naked God." His language clearly indicates that, at this point, the image of God fades into sheer negativity: the deus nudus is God in himself, a strange, terrifying, unapproachable abstraction.14 This being so, it appears that one must take into account, not only a dual relation- ship of God to the world, but also a conception of God as deus absolutus, out of relation to the world. This God, too, stands in antithetical rela- tion to the Revealed God, for the deus revelatus is the deus indutus-the God who is not naked, but clothed with his Word. So different have the two main lines of thought been felt to be-God hidden in his revelation and behind his revelation-that the effort has been made to distinguish them by different terminologies, whether the intent is to expound Luther's vocabulary or to improve upon it. Emil Brunner argued that Luther's "revealed" God is simultaneously "veiled," but not strictly "hidden";15 and, in one of his systematic 267 12 All of these interpreters, except the younger Ritschl, are discussed by Dillen- berger (n. 9 above), chaps. 1-3 and chap. 5 (von Loewenich).

Brunner acknowledges his primary indebtedness to Theodosius Harnack.</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion works, Paul Althaus contrasts the "hiddenness" of God apart from Christ with the "mystery" of God in Christ.'6 The most fascinating attempt to distinguish the two strands and give them different terminologies was made by Walther Koehler, who contrasts der verborgene Gott and der sich verbergende Gott.17 The "Hidden God" is the Unknown God of the ancient world, God beyond the reach of human intelligence: he belongs to the domain of Logos, but marks its boundary or limit. The "God who hides himself" belongs to Mythos: he is the divinity who achieves his ends by disguising himself. It is the ancient myth of the hidden savior which reappears in Luther's notion of revelation, complete with the picture-language about the deceiving of the devil. And yet the other line of thought remains "on the margin": it stands for the tran- scendence of the Naked God, who cannot be seen even with the eye of faith, but remains the Unknown.'8s Now, one can safely hazard the generalization that whereas the hiddenness of God in his revelation (let us call it "Hiddenness I") has been found theologically fruitful in recent years, the hiddenness of God outside his revelation ("Hiddenness II") has been found something of an embarrassment. The extraordinary power of Luther's theologia crucis, in which the hidden form of revelation finds its sharpest expression, has been fully appreciated and appropriated. In Christ, God works in a paradoxical mode sub contrariis. His wisdom is hidden under folly, his strength under abject weakness. He gives life through death, right- eousness to the unrighteous; he saves by judging and damning. The Hidden God is God incarnate, crucified, hidden in suffering (deus incarnatus, deus crucifixus, deus absconditus in passionibus). In contemplation of the cross, Luther's fertile mind filled with vivid expressions of God's hiddenness in his revelation, and they have been gratefully appropriated in Protestant dogmatics.19 Less welcome have been Luther's thoughts on Hiddenness II: first, because this is another line of thought, which seems to defy harmonization with Hiddenness I; second, because it implies a knowledge of God outside of Christ; and, third, because it converges upon the problematic doctrine of double predestination. 268 16 I owe this reference to Dillenberger (n. 9 above), pp. 58-59- 17 Der verborgene Gott (n. 9 above), pp. 4-5- 18 Ibid., pp. 22 and 25 if. 19 The classic study of this theme is Walther von Loewenich, Luthers theologia crucis, 4th ed. (Munich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1954). Rudolf Koehler (n. 9 above) was even prepared to argue for the philosophical fruitfulness of the notion that God works sub contrariis since it marks the overcoming of dualism.</page><page sequence="7">"To the Unknown God" It is not my intention to attempt a synthesis of the various lines of Luther's thought on God's hiddenness. I do not find myself driven by the kind of systematic impulse which motivates the excellent study by Hellmut Bandt. Neither have I the least wish to soften or explain away Luther's most extreme utterances on predestination. (I am, I trust, too good a Calvinist to want to do that.) I want, rather, to inquire about the ranges of religious experience which lie behind the notion of Hid- denness II and to show how they shape the Reformation's idea of faith.20 Finally, I shall suggest that the experience of God's hiddenness, however disruptive it may be of theological tidiness, must be taken with the utmost theological seriousness especially at the present day. I may add that no disrespect is intended to Luther and Calvin if I thus presume to inquire into the religious roots of their statements on the deus abscon- ditus. Hellmut Bandt insists that Luther wished his remarks in his work On the Bondage of the Will (1525) to be taken as a presentation of his theological judgment, not as an "eruption of his volcanic experience of God."21 I agree. But this does not alter the fact that the most critical passage does reflect the "depth and passion of the religious experience" of the reformer (as von Loewenich rightly maintained). And our war- rant for focusing our attention at this point could be taken from Luther himself, who once wrote that "it is by living-no, rather, by dying and being damned-that a theologian is made, not by understanding, read- ing, or speculating." 22 With this in mind, I shall not neglect the theo- logical argument of On the Bondage of the Will, but I shall attempt to deal sympathetically with the experience of God which can be sensed behind the argument as Luther tells about the God who hides himself and wills to remain unknown.23 269 20 In this respect I find myself in general sympathy with Rudolf Otto's sensitive approach to Luther in his celebrated study, The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non-rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine and Its Relation to the Rational, trans. John W. Harvey, 2d ed. (London: Oxford University Press, i950), chap. I2, as also with his treatment of predestination in the preceding chapter (pp. 86-91). But it may be noted that, unlike Otto (p. 135), I regard deus ignotus as a fitting equivalent for deus absconditus (in one of its senses). 21 Luthers Lehre (n. 9 above), p. I8. The phrase is from von Loewenich, whom Bandt is here criticizing. 22 W.A. 5.I63.28 (Operationes in Psalmos, I519-21). On the role of Anfechtung and Erfahrung in the making of a theology, see W.A. TR. (= Tischreden) I, no. 352 (146.12). 23 W.A. I8.685-5. The phrase ignorari a nobis vult justifies the use of "Unknown God" as a description for the God of Hiddenness II (as distinct from Hiddenness I), and the inherited associations of the title do not render it inappropriate in a Reforma- tion context. Bandt's effort to ground the limits of theological knowledge christo- logically seem one-sided and even doctrinaire (see Section V, below). Luther presents</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion II Both forms of divine hiddenness can be found in Luther's treatise On the Bondage of the Will.24 In his review of Erasmus's preface, Luther writes: Faith is concerned with " things not seen" [Heb. Ii:I]. So that there may be room for faith, all the things that are believed need therefore to be hidden. But they are not more remotely hidden than under the contrary object, perception, experience. So, when God makes alive, he does it by 270 the incomprehensibility of God as a limit which reason itself recognizes (W.A. I8.784.27), and from the earliest statement on the Hidden God in the Dictata to the later utterances on speculation and the Naked God in the Commentary on Galatians (W.A. 4ol.75.27 ff.) and the Lectures on Genesis (e.g., W.A. 42.10.3 ff.) he did not hesitate to appropriate the inherited language concerning God's incomprehensibility -the hiddenness of God in himself. The contrast between the Unknown God of the apophatic theology and Luther's revealed deus crucifixus is undeniable. See Fritz Hahn, "Faber Stapulensis und Luther," Zeitschrift fir Kirchengeschichte 57, no. 3/4 (1938): 358. But the two lines of thought are not wholly exclusive: rather Luther differs from pseudo-Dionysius chiefly in his attitude toward the deus nudus (cf. the first of the Antinomian Disputations, 1537: W.A. 39.-389.I3 ff.) and, what amounts to the same thing, in his emphasis upon the deus revelatus. It may further be questioned whether even the revelatio sub contrariis (i.e., Hiddenness I) is as peculiarly Luther's doctrine as Albert Brandenburg, for instance, maintains (following Hahn): Gericht und Evan- gelium. Zur Worttheologie in Luthers erster Psalmenvorlesung, Konfessionskundliche und Kontroverstheologische Studien, vol. 4 (Paderborn: Bonifacius-Druckerei, 1960), PP. 32-33, 114-15. Some of the parallels drawn in Weier's study of Luther, Faber, and Nicholas of Cusa are, I think, strained and unconvincing (e.g., between Faber and Luther on the opus alienum dei): Reinhold Weier, Das Thema vom verborgenen Gott von Nikolaus von Kues zu Martin Luther, Buchreihe der Cusanus-Gesellschaft, vol. 2 (Munster: Verlag Aschendorff, 1967), pp. 200 ff. But see the citations from Faber Stapulensis on the arcana et abscondita filii Dei incarnatio (p. 185, n. 71) and from Nicholas of Cusa on the formula ex contrario contrarium (p. 179, n. 46); further, the reference to Nicholas's thoughts on the coincidence of humiliation and exaltation in the life, passion, and cross of Christ (p. 193). Although he argues that Faber served as the bridge between Nicholas and Luther, Weier does not, of course, limit the medieval influences to a single route. Indeed, it needs to be remembered that biblical and patristic thought patterns already lie behind the medieval heritage. Calvin found much of his material on the hidden will of God in Augustine. For some of the biblical material see Hellmut Bandt, "Verborgenheit Gottes," in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3d ed. (Tuibingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1962), vol. 6, cols. I256-59. 24 On the major themes of the treatise and the extensive literature about them see the excellent study by Harry J. McSorley: Luther: Right or Wrong? (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1969 [published jointly with the Newman Press]). Another recent study is Klaus Schwarzwiiller, Theologia crucis: Luthers Lehre von Prddestination nach De servo arbitrio, 1525, Forschungen zur Geschichte und Lehre des Protestantismus, vol. 39 (Munich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, I970).</page><page sequence="9">"To the Unknown God" putting to death; when he justifies, he does it by making guilty; when he transports to heaven, he does it by bringing to hell. As the Scripture says in I Kings 2 [I Sam. 2:6]: "The Lord slays and makes alive; he brings down to hell and raises up again."... So, God hides his eternal mercy and kind- ness beneath eternal anger, righteousness beneath injustice.25 Luther excuses himself from giving any fuller account of this doctrine since those who have read his books will be well acquainted with it. Plainly, these remarks fall under the heading of Hiddenness I, the hidden form of God's revelation.26 But the logic of Luther's main argu- ment drives him to speak also about the God who is hidden outside of his revelation (Hiddenness II). For, as he has already remarked earlier in his treatise, "nobody doubts that there is a great deal hid in God of which we do not know." 27 Luther's central purpose throughout the treatise is to affirm the sole agency of God in bringing about man's salvation. In his judgment, those who, like Erasmus, wish to speak of free will are really seeking to find a place for merit. Indeed, Erasmus had asked explicitly: "If there is no freedom of the will, what room is there for merits ? " The answer, Luther retorts, was given by the Apostle Paul: "There is no such thing as merit, but as many as are justified are all justified freely, and this is ascribed to nothing but the grace of God." 28 Were it not so, the source of assur- ance would be snatched away from us: our confidence rests in the knowledge that God has taken salvation out of the control of our wills and has placed it under the control of his.29 It is but a short step from here to a full-blown doctrine of divine determinism. Perhaps Luther did not need to take that short step. He could have rested content with the claim that only our salvation is taken out of our hands. He does indeed suggest that a man can enjoy a limited measure of freedom in other ranges of his daily existence. But, whatever that limited freedom may mean, it does not prevent Luther from asserting a general doctrine of divine determinism. " God foreknows nothing contingently: he fore- sees, purposes, and does all things by an immutable, eternal, and in- fallible will." 30 "All things happen by necessity." 31 And Luther does 271 25 W.A. 18.633.7. 26 Cf. W.A. 18.689.22: in the incarnate God, Jesus crucified, are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, only hidden (Col. 2:3). 27 Ibid., 6o6.I2. 28 Ibid., 769.30. 29 Ibid., 783.I7. 30 Ibid., 6I5.I2. 31 Ibid., 617.19.</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion not shrink from confirming this doctrine by appeal to the pagan notion of Fate: " We see that the knowledge of predestination and of God's foreknowledge has been left to mankind no less than the notion of divinity itself." 32 With the mention of the word " predestination " the heart of the prob- lem lies open before us. The uncompromising argument has been that if a man is saved at all, that can only be because God has irresistibly directed the impotent human will, which is utterly incapable of turning itself toward salvation. If it is asked, then-as has been asked in every generation of the Church's history-why some accept the good news and not others, it cannot be answered: Because men are free to accept or reject as they please. It is God who accepts or rejects as he pleases. But is it not written that the Lord desires not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live (Ezek. i8: 23)? The question can therefore only be: Why does he not choose to change every man's will from bad to good if he alone can ? Naturally, Luther answers that we just do not know. The source of grace is the predestinating purpose of God. Beyond that point we cannot go. We run up against that "concealed [occulta] and dreadful will of God, who, by his own design, ordains whom he wills to receive and partake of the mercy preached and offered, and what sort of persons they shall be. This will is not to be enquired into, but reverently adored as far the most awe- some secret of the divine majesty, reserved to himself alone and for- bidden to us.... ."33 This is all very well, but what a monumental theological problem Luther now has on his hands! And can it be resolved simply by counseling us not to think about it? A fundamental 272 32 Ibid., 617.23, 618.13. Calvin was not so eager as Luther here shows himself to claim a point of contact between predestination and fate. See Inst., 1.16.8. 33 W.A. I8.684.32. The fact that God hardens many and chooses few is not itself hidden, but revealed. What is hidden-i.e., outside the scriptural revelation-is the reason why God so works (630.I9-632.2). He reserves to himself the freedom to determine quos et quales. The hidden will is the divine counterpart of the very human question: Why some and not others? (See also 686.8, 689.25, 712.24, 724.30.) But to persist in the question is to be guilty of the arrogant "Why?" of the objector in Rom. 9:19 (729.11). This, admittedly, does not hinder Luther from suggesting at least some partial answers (632.21 ff., 730.1o, etc.). Erasmus also spoke of impene- trable mysteries in God (" Corycian caves"), but he wrongly located them in the scriptural revelation itself (607.I f.; cf. 653.31 ff.). So, at least, Luther judged. But there is surely a counterpart here to Luther's experience of Hiddenness II; and it could further be maintained that in his fascinating reflections on the Sileni Alcibiadis (see Margaret Mann Phillips, The "Adages": A Study with Translations [London: Cambridge University Press, 1964], pp. 269 ff.) Erasmus presents a counterpart to Hiddenness I.</page><page sequence="11">"To the Unknown God" distinction has been made within the conception of God: we are to recognize that there is "'' God hidden'' and " God revealed." 34 Erasmus's error, in the final analysis, is that he did not make this distinction. And yet, says Luther, to deny the distinction is to make God an idol, depriving him of his freedom.35 Admittedly, Luther does not consider the antithesis within his conception of God to be indicative of a contra- diction in God himself, although he grants the appearance. The problem is noetic, not ontic-in our understanding, not in God's being. Luther is confident that there is a solution even if it lies beyond history. " By the light of grace it is inexplicable how God da'mns a man who is not able by any of his own resources to do anything but sin.... But the light of glory declares otherwise. ..." 36 In the meantime, we have to admit the antithesis between God as revealed and preached, on the one hand, and God as hidden and unknown, on the other-indeed, as Luther puts it still more sharply, between the Word of God and God himself.37 The practical solution-and it is only temporary-is to leave alone the nature and majesty of God, to view him solely as he clothes himself in the Word. But how satisfying can this practical solution be? The seriousness of the theological problem must not be glozed over. By a strange, circuitous route, Luther's argument ends up by jeopardiz- ing his own theological starting point. He insisted at the outset that he proclaimed nothing but Christ crucified.38 But one of the doctrines that "Christ crucified brings with him" finally forces us to acknowledge an inscrutable will of God behind and beyond the figure of Christ. We began from God's revelation in Christ as the only secure basis for a knowledge of God's gracious will; we end by discovering that, after all, God wills many things which he does not show us in his Word.39 And the problem is not merely that there is a hidden will alongside of the revealed will of God, but that the two are found to be in apparent contradiction. Says Luther: "He does not will the death of a sinner-in his Word, that is. But he does will it by that inscrutable will." 40 And 273 34 W.A. 685-3 ff. 35 Ibid., 706.I5. 36 Ibid., 785-29. It should be noted from this passage (pp. 784-85) that for Luther the problem is focused more on the justice than the mercy of God, though he mentions both. More precisely, the problem is whether it is just for God to have mercy only on some (cf. Rom. 9:14-15). 37 Ibid., 685.26. 38 Ibid., 638.24- 39 Ibid., 685-27. 40 Ibid., 685.28. The problem had already taken much this form in Luther's</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion the Incarnate God must weep as the Hidden God consigns a portion of mankind to perdition.41 It is not easy to respond, except with agree- ment, to those who proclaim the collapse of Luther's doctrine of God at this point: the two wills fall apart in a bifurcation which Luther does not profess himself able to overcome. And the question seems inescap- able which Luther elsewhere rejects as misguided and wrong headed: Granted that Christ speaks nothing but comfort to the troubled con- science, who knows how it stands between me and God in heaven?42 Luther's assurance that we have the Father's will in Christ, and his counsel that we should flee to God in the manger or contemplate the wounds of Jesus, do not resolve the theological problem, and he does not pretend that they do. Even as a theological problem, Luther felt the difficulty of pre- destination deeply enough: "This is the highest degree of faith," he admits, "to believe that he is merciful who saves so few and damns so many.... " 43 But it is impossible to read him and not to recognize that there was a terror in his encounter with the hidden, predestinating God and that the emotional, religious, or spiritual content of the experience burst the limits of the merely rational and conceptual. We can judge from his own testimony that the encounter was a shattering one, which brought him right up to the rim of the abyss, where the Naked and Unknown God waited and threatened. True, even common sense and reason are offended that the merciful God should behave as though he delighted in the torments of the lost. But, asks Luther, "who would not take offence ? I have taken offence myself more than once, down to the 274 earlier Lectures on Romans of 1515-16 (see W.A. 56.182.14). Especially in the older literature, it has been suggested that Luther inherited the late scholastic distinctions between potentia absoluta and potentia ordinata and between voluntas beneplaciti and voluntas signi. See Dillenberger (n. 9 above), pp. 6 ff. (on Albrecht Ritschl) and pp. 43-44 (on Reinhold Seeberg). 41 W.A. 18.689.32; cf. 686.5. The debate at this point centers upon Jesus' weeping over Jerusalem (Matt. 23:37). 42 W.A. 21.467.I6 (Postil on John 14:23-31, 1544); 28.11 6.I4 (Sermon on John 17:4-6, 1528); 45.520.2 (Sermons on John 14-15, 1538).

The despair is assigned to the past tense, to a time before Luther had learned to think of it as "health-giving" and "close to grace." But if the crisis belonged to the past, it seems clear that the predestinating God remained in the shadows. This is, indeed, implicit in the recognition that only a practical solution is open to man in via. Only the constant renewal of faith through contemplation of Christ, the mirror of God's heart, can vanquish one's anxieties con- cerning his own standing before God; and even then the hidden will stays to challenge faith's confidence in the goodness of a God who permits many others to be lost. The practical solution is not instan- taneous and final. We do not simply turn from the Hidden God, and then forget all about him. The forbidding figure waits on the edge of faith and, for this reason, determines (in some measure) the content of faith, which has the character of a turning from the Hidden God. The luminous object of faith is set against a dark, threatening background. Awareness of the Hidden God, therefore, qualifies faith in Christ. How, indeed, could it be otherwise if, as Luther tells us, we should adore the Hidden God? If the deus absconditus is thus endowed with religious meaning as the object of our veneration, it cannot be strictly true that we have nothing to do with him.45 He is always there as the terminus a quo of the movement of faith, even though he does not have comparable significance to the Word of God, which is the terminus ad quem. Faith returns constantly from the God on the perimeter of human experience to the punctus mathematicus which it makes its centre. III The significance of the debate with Erasmus is not that it furnishes material for a favorite theological puzzle-how can grace be sovereign and man be free ?-but that it points to reaches of religious experience which may be overlooked if faith is defined purely as personal trust in Christ. Or, to make the same point from the side of the doctrine of God, 275 44 Ibid., 719.9. 45 Luther cites the "Socratic" principle: " Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos" (ibid., 685.6). But this is an implicit imperative, not a statement of fact. On the other hand, if the Hidden God is adorandus, he is still not deus cultus (cf. 685.3).</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion the celebrated free-will debate points to another moment in the Reforma- tion concept of God, a moment antithetical to the attributes of mercy and love. The image of God does not, after all, fully coincide with the picture of Jesus. Now, it is important to recognize that predestination was not the only problem which led Luther to acknowledge this "other" God. The "concealed and dreadful will of God," which freely disposes of grace or freely withholds it, is "the most awesome secret of the divine majesty," but it is not the only one. It is one way in which we are reminded of the God who hides himself beyond his revelation. But there are others. The Hidden God stands for the "God" of everyday experience apart from Christ-the force behind the mysterious universe as we encounter it without the help of the Word. "'God preached' so acts that, sin and death being taken away, we may be saved ... But 'God hidden in majesty' neither deplores nor abolishes death, but works life, death, and all in all. Nor has he set bounds to himself by his Word, but has kept himself free over all things." 46 It is surely clear enough that "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" does not exhaust Luther's conception of God. It is but one side of it.47 It is, no doubt, widely assumed that the Protestant notion of God leans heavily to anthropomorphism and transcendence: God is the Supreme, Personal Being "up there." But one does not have to read far in Luther to realize that there is a remarkable tension at least in his idea of God. When Luther looked directly at nature, apart from the Word, he was aware of an awesome, creative power quite other than the God he encountered in Jesus Christ. It has often been noted how he appealed to this other aspect of deity in his controversial writings on the Eucharist. God is not to be pictured as a "great fat being" who fills the world like straw in a sack. His power cannot be contained or measured. He is "a supernatural, inscrutable being, who is at once wholly in every kernel of grain and yet in all, and above all, and outside all 276 46 Ibid., 685.19. 47 The two-sidedness of Luther's conception of God has been eloquently main- tained by Heinrich Bornkamm, who speaks of " power" and "person," held together in tension, as the mystery of the real God (n. 9 above), p. 48. (This essay also appears in Luther's World of Thought, trans. Martin H. Betram [St. Louis: Concordia Pub- lishing House, 1958], along with other essays pertinent to our theme.) See also Born- kamm's The Heart of Reformation Faith: The Fundamental Axioms of Evangelical Belief, trans. John W. Doberstein (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), chap. 6. A recent study which deals with the hiddenness of God in creation is David L6fgren, Die Theologie der Sch6pfung bei Luther, Forschungen zur Kirchen- und Dogmengeschichte, vol. Io (G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, i960), esp. chaps. 5 and 6.</page><page sequence="15">"To the Unknown God" creatures."48 This God creates and preserves all things by his im- mediate presence and power. And "his very divine being can be wholly in all creatures and in each individually, deeper, more inwardly, more presently than is the creature itself. . . ."49 It is this God who "works life and death and all in all." He is the creative, and at the same time the destructive, Power that seems incredibly indifferent to the life of the creature. Similarly, when Luther turned his thoughts from nature to history and contemplated it apart from the Word of God, he could not claim that the fatherly providence of God was evident.50 The good cause is not always vindicated; the bad as often triumphs. "Just see! God so governs this physical world in outward affairs that, if you regard and follow the judgment of human reason, you are compelled to say either that there is no God or that God is unjust. As the poet said: 'Oft am I provoked to think there are no gods.'" 51 The God of history, like the God of nature, is hidden. An important element in Luther's doctrine of the hiddenness of God, this line of reflection nonetheless lacks the anguish and pathos of his experience of the God of predestination. The very images which Luther employs in this context suggest that he was much more able to come to terms with the hiddenness of God in history. God "disguises" himself in the progress of world events. History is his "sport." And although it is certainly clear enough that Luther could not offer anything like a theistic "case" by reasoning from the course of the human story, nevertheless as a man of faith he can penetrate through God's disguise and see the actor behind the mask.52 As deus ludens, so to say, God does put our faith to the test, but he hardly pushes the test to the limits of despair. Indeed, the "light of grace" has given away the secret of history: if the wicked sometimes flourish and the just suffer, the believer knows that there is a life hereafter in which the imbalance will be redressed.

"What looks overwhelm- ingly like the injustice of God and is traduced by such arguments as no reason or light of nature can withstand, is very easily disposed of by the light of the Gospel and the knowledge of grace, by which we are taught that, though the ungodly do flourish in their bodies, yet they perish in their souls. And a short explanation of this whole inexplicable question is in one little word: namely, that there is a life after this life. . . ." 53 It is easy to see why for Luther the problem of predestination was "far the most awesome secret of the divine majesty": because there faith cannot find the way out, but can only wait for the light of glory. And if it lingers too long, tries to penetrate the mystery of the hidden will, it can only lose itself in the abyss of the Unknown God. We must then, so it seems, construct a kind of scale for Hiddenness II, which at one end approaches the horror of the Unknown God and at the other the paradoxes of Hiddenness I. Indeed, Luther seems to betray more intensity of feeling in speaking of Hiddenness I than when he speaks of God's hiddenness in history. But, in any case, outside of Christ the hiddenness of God always means one thing: faith cannot rest in the God who is hidden beyond his revelation. For, as Luther states in his Large Catechism, God-for faith-is "that to which I must look for all that is good." 54 The God who hides himself outside of Christ, whether in nature, history, or the eternal decree, does not move me to trust. What is perhaps most astonishing in Luther's thoughts of God is that he speaks of the Hidden God as "God himself." But it was not, of course, his intention to admit that faith is fancy, inventing a God for its own comfort other than he is in himself. On the contrary, he insists that faith in Christ is knowledge of the Hidden God. The resolution of the antagonism between God hidden and God revealed is admittedly practical-in that it consists in the counsel to flee from the one to the other-but it still points to the truth hidden in the one and only God. "Who can direct himself," Luther asks, "by a will that is utterly inscrutable and incomprehensible ? " 55Here is the practical motivation: we must be guided by the Word because there is no guidance to be had in the hidden will. And yet, Luther also claims that, in his Word, the one God has lifted the corner of the veil, taken a step out of his hidden- ness: "Begin from below, from the Incarnate Son.... Christ will bring 278 53 W.A. I8.785.I2. 54 W.A. 301.133.1. Cf. Bornkamm (n. 9 above), pp. 45-46, 48. 55 W.A. I8.685-3I.</page><page sequence="17">"To the Unknown God" you to the Hidden God.... If you take the Revealed God, he will bring you the Hidden God at the same time." The mystery of deity is not dissipated, but what we do see is a visible piece of the mystery. Like Moses, we are permitted to catch a glimpse of God's "back parts." 56 It all sounds like an artful dodge, of course, and Madam Reason is scornful: "Here our smart, sarcastic Reason will surely say: 'This is a nicely devised way of escape-that, whenever we are pressed by force of arguments, we run back to that dreadful will of majesty and, when our adversary becomes annoying, reduce him to silence! Just like the astronomers who devised their "epicycles" to evade all questions about the movement of the heavens as a whole!' "57 But there Luther rests his case. To reason it may well seem like desperation to invoke a sacred mystery. But that is the way things are. IV Luther's doctrine of the deus absconditus has been subjected to intense study in more than a dozen books and articles devoted directly to the theme, to say nothing of longer or shorter discussions in more general works on his theology; and incidental excursuses upon it or allusions to it abound even in books not mainly concerned with Luther. Not that the problems have all been resolved. Far from it! The debate continues. Surprisingly, however, there is no such body of literature on what Calvin thought about God's hiddenness.58 Possibly, Calvin scholars have been skeptical about the genuine unity of the various motifs that have been clustered under the common rubric of "God's hiddenness." More likely, the problem has simply been neglected, at least in its full scope; and it would require a major monograph even to assemble the relevant sources and shape the "problematic" for an adequate, com- prehensive analysis. The following remarks make no pretence at meeting that need. For the most part, they rest upon certain key sections of the Institutes, as the previous discussion grew mainly out of Luther's On the 279 56 W.A. TR. 5, no. 5658a: 294-24-34; 295-5; 294-4. Similar thoughts appear in the Lectures on Genesis (e.g., W.A. 43-403.8, 460.26; 44-376.15, 603-9). 57 W.A. 18.690.9. 58 T.H. L. Parker, in his Calvin's Doctrine of the Knowledge of God, 2d ed. (Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1969), p. 27, remarks that " the concept of Deus absconditus is as native to Calvin's theology as it is to Luther's," but he does not relate this remark to the various types and contexts of hiddenness distinguished by the Luther scholars. I am not aware of any discussion that does.</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion Bondage of the Will; and, although no belittling of theological and exegetical arguments is intended, the focal interest, as before, is in the experiential roots of Hiddenness II.59 In point of fact, it could be shown that Calvin's thoughts on hiddenness parallel Luther's in their full range.60 But, for him, too, the profoundest depths of hiddenness are located in the problem of double predestination, in which the will of God appears divided against itself and the individual is threatened with the possibility of rejection and loss. Here Calvin, no less than Luther, finds himself on the brink of an "abyss of sightless darkness." The revelation of God in Jesus Christ does not mean that God no longer has secrets which he withholds from mankind. Some secrets are now open, insofar as this is good for us. Certainly, faith understands that the passage of events is nothing but the outworking of a divine plan, which, though formerly hidden, has now been brought to light.61 But this does not mean that we as yet fully understand the divine pur- poses. The plan is still partially concealed from us in the governance of the world and in the disposition of individual destinies. Indeed, "secret" (arcanum) remains Calvin's most characteristic description for God's "design" (his consilium), since we cannot always perceive why God moves events in just the way he does.62 The secretness or hiddenness of God's design may be affirmed, on occasion, simply as an expression of pious surprise at an unexpected turn of events. So, for instance, Calvin speaks of the secret leading of God's providence in his own spiritual pilgrimage, when he was turned aside from the study of law.63 Or "secretness" may testify to the perplexity of the faithful at the fact, and 280 59 McNeill (n. 6 above), 2:932, n. 4, rightly draws attention to the pervasiveness of Calvin's appeal to experience in the discussion of election. As I shall indicate, Calvin makes a similar appeal in discussing providence. 6so On Hiddenness I, which I cannot discuss here, it should at least be noted that for Calvin, as for Luther, revelation is a veiling of the "naked majesty" of God (Inst., 2.6.4; cf. i1.11.3); and God's presence in Christ, through whom he emerges (in a measure) from his hiddenness (3.2.1), is accordingly at the same time a form of hiddenness (2.I3.2). The interesting question with regard to Hiddenness I is whether Calvin could follow Luther into the sharpest paradoxes of the theologia crucis, which culminate in the thought of the deus crucifixus. But the pertinent sources and literature are too scattered even to list here. 61 Inst., I.I4.1; 3.21.I (last sentence); I.I6.8; 3-24.3. 62 On the hidden "Why" see C.O. 8.311-13 (De aeterna dei praedestinatione, 1552); C.O. 9.257 (Brevis responsio . . . de aeterna dei praedestinatione, 1557). I regularly translate arcanus by "secret," absconditus by "hidden," and occultus by "concealed." All three terms, and others of similar import, are found together in Calvin, as in Luther, and tend to be used interchangeably. 63 C.O. 31.21 (Commentary on the Psalms, 1557).</page><page sequence="19">"To the Unknown God" even the triumph, of evil and disorder in the world. Good things and bad simply are not distributed in this life according to strict desert: in testifying of the man born blind that neither he nor his parents had sinned (John 9:3), Jesus indicated that there is more than that to the justice in God's secret design. Similarly, it is unthinkable that the afflictions of the epileptic boy in the Gospel (Mark 9:14-29) should be understood as punitive (even though he was not exempt from original sin!). Here the justice of God is hidden from us, and we can only bow before it in humility.64 On a grander scale, the orderly progress of history itself sometimes dissolves, or so it appears, into utter confusion; and the thought insinuates itself that human affairs are whirled around under the blind impulse of Fortune, or else the "flesh" is incited to complain that God plays games with men and throws them about like balls. True, God's wisdom becomes plain in the end to those who are patient. But Calvin cannot deny that the hand of God and the identity of God's people, alike, are hidden in the passage of events. God's secret design is worked out in history through opaque judgments (occulta, obscura iudicia), and the meaning of history is disclosed only to those who hear his Word in faith, at least until the Last Day when his judgments will finally be vindicated and faith superseded by sight.65 Small wonder, then, that Calvin could picture men in the world as stray sheep wandering in a maze before gathered to the flock of God!66 But beyond surprise and perplexity, the hiddenness of God's design in the world can also instill something like dread (extrema anxietas et formido) into the heart of the man who lives without the Word. Perhaps Calvin is distinguished from Luther by a stronger sense of the visible orderliness of the world, through which the power of the Maker "shines forth." So deeply impressed was he with the tokens of design in the cosmos that he envied the natural scientists, whose observations enabled them to penetrate more deeply than most into the secrets of nature (which are divinae sapientiae arcana).67 It has even been claimed 28I 64 Inst., 1.17.1; C.O. 45-494-95 (on Mark 9:21). 65 Inst., 1.17.1 , I I.

The ecclesia abscondita theme also belongs within Luther's range of thoughts on hiddenness: see, e.g, W.A. 18.651.24 ff., 652.23 (On the Bondage of the Will). 66 "Per mundi labyrinthum dissipati" (Inst., 3.6.2). 67 Inst., 1.5.2, possibly echoing a statement of Seneca's.</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion that the spirit of Calvinism may, in this respect, have contributed to the impressive growth of scientific research in the period immediately following upon the Reformation. And yet, in Calvin, too, there is a deep sense of awe before the cosmos, not merely because of its order and grandeur, but also because of its sheer enigma, which is impenetrable to the human mind. Nor can the shortcomings of the intellect be traced solely to the effects of the Fall. True, the blindness of sin effectively negates God's self-disclosure in nature and prevents it from leading man to a saving knowledge of his Maker. But even for the redeemed, whose vision has been restored, the divine purpose in the world order cannot simply be read off from the face of nature and history. Calvin's doctrine of providence, so far from being inferred from the visible tokens of God's presence, is in fact developed despite God's hiddenness. We do not invariably see that God's hand is at work. We believe it on the basis of the Word.68 However things may be disposed in the design of God, to us, Calvin admits, they are fortuitous. "The order, reason, end, and necessity of events lie hidden, for the most part, in God's design." Calvin describes the First Cause of events as "hidden" (procul abscon- dita), at any rate to the superficial view. (He does insist that a few sparks have always glowed in the darkness.) Similarly, providence is described generally as "concealed" (occulta), and the movement of God's hand as "secret" (secreta).69 Calvin expressly distinguishes the "mysteries" of revelation from the "abyss" of God's hidden will at work in the government of the universe: that is, he conveys the dis- tinction between Hiddenness I and II through distinct terminologies: It is certainly true that in the Law and the Gospel are comprehended mysteries which extend far above the bounds of our sense. But since God illumines the minds of his own with the spirit of understanding, so that they 282 68 Inst., I.I6.1,2,4,9. In other words, Calvin asserts of providence what he has asserted already of creation (1.5.14): it is known only to faith. Calvin himself draws the reader's attention to this connection, repeating his scriptural proof (Heb. I :3), in I.16.I. One would think that the hiddenness of God in his providence is a matter much more germane to the question of natural theology than is commonly recog- nized; but some careful distinctions need to be made which cannot detain us here. 69 Inst., I.I6.9. With the expression nobis fortuita compare fortuitum natura, ut est, used in the same section: Calvin wants to insist that fortuitousness is not just an illusory appearance of things (an imago), but a proper attribute of things as they are. Hence his approval of the scholastic distinctions between relative and absolute necessity and between necessity of consequence and the thing consequent. But he finds it hard to make up his mind just how obscure the hand of providence is! With the utplurimum used in the present section with respect to the hiddenness of providence contrast the more optimistic interdum in I.I7.I.</page><page sequence="21">"To the Unknown God" may grasp these mysteries which he has deigned to lay open by his Word, now no abyss is there, but a way in which we are to walk in safety and a lamp to guide our feet, the light of life and the school of certain and manifest truth. Yet his wonderful way of governing the world is justly called an "abyss" because while hidden from us, it ought reverently to be adored.70 Perhaps the last phrase--"it ought reverently to be adored "-gives the impression that the Christian can make peace with the hidden will of God. But the point which must not be overlooked is that, for Calvin, the hiddenness of God in the world order is subjectively apprehended as a sense of terrifying contingency-apart from the Word of God. He could portray the threatening insecurity of human existence (its "ultimate anxiety and dread") with quite extraordinary power. Life itself is " enveloped with death." " Half alive in life, [man] hardly dares to draw an anxious, feeble breath, as though he had a sword per- petually dangling over his neck." Ignorance of providence is therefore the ultimate of all miseries.71 The horror of this ignorance may even lead to voluntary self-destruction.72 But the fact of providence is none- theless anything but obvious. Calvin would surely agree with Luther that there is, in truth, no contingency apud Deum simpliciter, only coram nobis.73 But he took that coram nobis-the subjective awareness of con- tingency-with utter seriousness. Only with the Word of God is it overcome, and even then problems remain. Moreover, we have yet to" approach the point where God's design is most deeply hidden. Among those things which he chooses to keep secret, even after his revelation, is the reason why some are destined for eternal life and others for eternal damnation.74 283 70 Inst., I1.17.2. The favorite proof-texts for Hiddenness II are faithfully cited in this section: Deut. 29:29, Ps. 36:6, and Rom. 1 1:33-34 71 Inst., I.I7.I0-I I. Cf. C.O. 8.35I (De praedest.). 72 As an example of the plight of pagan man under the sway of fortune Calvin refers to the youth in Plautus's Bacchides who committed suicide (Inst., I.I7.3). 73 W.A. 56.383.19 (Lectures on Romans). 74 Predestination and reprobation are both described as "concealed" or "hidden" (Inst., I.15.8, 3.23-4). The fact of double predestination, however, is not hidden, but revealed; and in some measure it is attested by certain tokens, such as the call of Israel and the preservation of the remnant (3.21.5,7) and the call and justification of the elect (3.21.7, 24.1). What remains hidden is the reason why, particularly why this one and not another (3.21.5; 3.23-5,8; 3.24.1). Naturally, Calvin-like Luther- nonetheless goes a long way toward showing the wisdom of God's general design in making a distinction among men (e.g., 3.2 1.1). Also hidden, of course, is the identity of the elect, who are known only to God: see 4.1.2 and 8 (on the church and the iudicium caritatis) and 4. I2.9 (on church discipline).</page><page sequence="22">The Journal of Religion Like Luther, Calvin too finds the secrets of divine majesty illustrated, but not exhausted, in the "horrible decree" (as he himself calls it)75 by which the hidden will of God foreordains a portion of mankind for final loss. The Pavlovian reflexes which the mention of this doctrine invariably lets loose may obscure some interesting features of Calvin's discussion. (As he himself remarks, it is as though the petulant human intellect had heard the trumpet sound a charge.) 76 To comment on just one important point: although talk about eternal decrees has the sound of rampant speculation, the doctrine of election is in fact woven into the fabric of human experience. It is about experienced diversity, and Calvin finds this diversity inseparable from the notion of grace and its counterpart, gratitude.77 Like Luther, he begins from the observed fact that some do, and some do not, believe the Gospel. To trace this diversity back to a "horrible decree," whatever else it means, surely indicates that Calvin finds it a source of anguish, yet ultimate (in the sense of being an inexplicable "given" of human existence).7" Further, he observes that a principle of selection belongs to the strangeness of human existence as such, and is not limited to the matter of faith. Ingeniously, he finds this testified in the fact that, from the moment of birth, one infant discovers a full breast to suck, while another must endure a breast that is nearly dry. The mystery of predestination is continuous with a more universal mystery of human existence: life's goods, from birth onward, are bestowed or withheld with a discrimina- 284 75 Inst., 3-23.7. For Calvin's doctrine of predestination see, in general, Paul Jacobs, Prddestination und Verantwortlichkeit bei Calvin, Beitraige zur Geschichte und Lehre der Reformierten Kirche, vol. I (Neukirchen: Buchhandlung des Erziehungsvereins, 1937). For the particular problem of God's hidden will, however, Jacobs has little help. 76 Inst., 3.23.I. 77 Inst., 3.21. I, 21.6, 23.10. In his interesting study Der Prddestinationsgedanke in der Theologie Martin Luthers (Berlin: Evangelische Verlagsanstalt, 1966), Gerhard Rost argues that Luther's idea of predestination has a "fundamental-apriori character," being grounded in his doctrine of God, and is not simply derived a posteriori from the experience of justification. This, I think, is true, and it holds good also for Calvin. But it needs to be pointed out further that the a posteriori element (at any rate in Calvin) is attached to the experience of diversity and not only of grace. 78 The will of God is ultimate; to seek a cause for it is, therefore (oddly), to picture something outside of the ultimate reality-or to want the world to be other than it is (see Inst., 3.22.4, II; 3.23.2,4). But although God's will is ultimate and hidden, we are certain it cannot be either capricious or unjust as the scholastic doctrines of voluntas (or potentia) absoluta and deus exlex wrongly implied (1.17.2; 3.23.2,5,9). Cf. C.O. 8.310, 361 (De praedest.) ; 9.288 (Calumniae nebulonis... de occulta dei providentia, i558).</page><page sequence="23">"To the Unknown God" tion which we ourselves do not control. Experientia demonstrat! It is a fact of experience.79 Men are preferred above beasts, one nation is preferred above the rest, one brother above another.80 Neither do the lesser inequalities determine the greater: for the preference of Jacob reversed the priorities of birth, and the calling of the Gentiles transcended the advantages of race.81 Not all are privileged to hear the Gospel; and yet of those who hear not all receive it with joy. The seed may fall among thorns or on stony ground. Hardening and blessing alike are finally beyond our ability to explain: they are in the will and hands of God.82 As Augustine exclaimed: "Peter denies, the thief believes. 'Oh, the depth!' Do you ask the reason? I shudder at the depth." 83 Awe, humility, confidence, and thankful activity in the world are not, however, the only possible modes of response to this recognition of the facts of life. That many are called, but few are chosen (Matt. 22:14), may, as Calvin well knew, give rise to an acute theological problem; and, as he also knew well, it could evoke anxiety and paralyzing despondency. Perhaps Calvin went further than Luther toward a resolution of the theoretical problem of the " two wills," although at the fearful cost of reducing the universal benevolence of the revealed will to a mere appearance.84 But the existential problem remained: Who 285 79 Inst., 1.16.3. Cf. 1.5-5 (on intellectual gifts), 2-3.4 (on moral gifts). so Inst., 3.22.1; 3.21.5, 24.17; 3.22.5. Cf. 3.21.5-7, on the "stages" or "degrees" of election. It is sound Calvinism in principle, if not in tone, when J. S. Whale writes: "... the modern mind which is revolted by this doctrine of Election cheerfully accepts the modern doctrine of Selection, and is not appalled by the thought: 'The warm-blooded mammals have I loved, but the Ichthyosauri have I hated"' (The Protestant Tradition: An Essay in Interpretation [London: Cambridge University Press, 1955], P. 143). 81 Inst., 3.22.5; 3.23.10. 82Inst., 3.24.12,16 (cf. 3.21.1); 3.24.12-14, 22.1o, 23.13; 3.23.1. Cf. 3.22.2 (that not all are members of Christ is open to observation); 3.24.15 (experience teaches that God does not touch every heart). 83 Quoted in Inst., 3.23-5. The sense of the ambiguity of human existence-the two-handedness with which our lot is dealt out-seems to be at least as firmly rooted in the religious experience behind predestination as the "creature-consciousness" to which Otto tries to reduce it (n. 20o above, pp. 88-90). Not the "futility of one's own choice " (p. 89), but the diversity of human choice-and of human destiny in general -is brought to expression in the doctrine. But I think it is fair, borrowing a term from Otto (p. Io2), to describe Calvin's doctrine of election as (from one point of view) a "caricature " of authentic encounter with the divine, and this might prove more fruitful than faulting it for lack of christocentricity (i.e., for being a tacit theologia naturalis). 84 The "hidden will" is mentioned by Calvin in three main contexts: the origin of evil (Inst., 1.15.8; 3.23.4,7,8), God's providential use of the wicked (1.17.2, 18.3;</page><page sequence="24">The Journal of Religion knows how it stands between me and God in heaven ? And here Calvin's counsel is no different from Luther's: to move beyond the Word (the revealed will) is to find oneself in terrifying darkness, a maze without exit, a pathless waste, a bottomless whirlpool, inextricable snares, an abyss of sightless darkness.85 Assurance of our own election is to be found solely in Christ, the mirror of our adoption. Anxiety that what Christ tells us in the Word might, in the end, prove to be something other than the will of the Father is groundless, for Christ is the Father's eternal wisdom.86 And yet.. . the anxiety is very persistent!87 The threat of the Unknown God does not quite disappear. If it did so, the exhortation to embrace Christ would surely be superfluous. V Reluctance to acknowledge the reality of the deus absconditus (in the sense of Hiddenness II) goes back at least to Albrecht Ritschl, who charged Theodosius Harnack with unwarranted neglect of Luther's predestinating God, but proceeded himself to reject him as an un- fortunate medieval figment. In giving a fresh direction to Luther research on the deus absconditus, Kattenbusch again tried to suppress the embarrassing sections of On the Bondage of the Will, but by interpreting them harmlessly rather than drastically rejecting them. His remarks can only be considered devious, even preposterous. Luther "had nothing else in mind," he explained, "than that God's love is not soft- ness," and he denied that Luther "saw in God the deus creator omnium 286 3.20.43), and the double decree by which God withholds from some what he seems to offer to all (3-3.21, 22.10, 24.1-2, 24.8, 24.I5-17). The problem is further discussed in certain of the treatises (De praedest. [C.O. 8.300-30 1, 364 ff.], Brevis responsio [9.262 ff.], Calumniae nebulonis [9-302 ff.]) and commentaries (on Ezek. 18:23 [C.O. 40.445-46], Rom. II1:33-34 [49-230-31], 2 Pet. 3:9 [55.475-76]). In his insistence that there is no division in God's will itself, but only as it appears to us, Calvin cannot take such passages as Ezek. I8:23 or Matt. 23:37 to convey a genuine universal will to mercy: the former simply states the condition (namely, conversion) upon which God grants life but which he alone can fulfil; the latter uses accommodated language-namely, a very human expression of complaint and disappointment-to display the wickedness of God's people. 85 Inst., 3.21.1,2; 3.24-4- 86 Inst., 3.24.3-6; C.O. 8.306-307, 318 (De praedest.). 87 "At subit futuri status anxietas.. . ista sollicitudine liberavit nos Christus..." (Inst., 3.24.6). That Calvin has a perennial oscillation in mind is supported from his sensitive treatment of anxiety and doubt (3.2.16-28)-not to mention his demonology (0.I4.I3- I9)-</page><page sequence="25">"To the Unknown God" 'behind' the deus salvator."s88 God's majesty was reduced by Katten- busch to a function of his love, whereas the problem is precisely that Luther speaks of a majesty beyond or beside his love. As Kattenbusch himself admits in a couple of coy footnotes, love, for Luther, has its limits. More recently, Karl Barth's disapproval of the offending passages gave rise to a new flurry of interest. Even the hiddenness of God, accord- ing to Barth, is known only by revelation: it is not a general truth. It does not mean that there is a terrifying mystery behind God's revelation of himself as love. God really is what he has shown himself to be. The mystery is rather the freedom of his love: that is, the fact that he decided to reveal himself. Luther failed to affirm consistently the identity of the deus absconditus and the deus revelatus. This, however, does not alter the fact that he often did affirm this identity, and Barth freely avails him- self of the acceptable passages in which Luther writes of the deus absconditus in passionibus. For Barth, as for Luther in one side of his thinking on God's hiddenness, the mystery of God is the revealed mystery of his grace.89 It was with Barth's questions in mind that Hellmut Bandt undertook his thorough study of the deus absconditus. In this respect, his work recalls the earlier book by John Dillenberger, of which Bandt was apparently unaware. (In the 1950s, the Germans had not yet heard that there was such an unlikely thing as an American Luther research.) Bandt tells the reader in his foreword that he disagrees with Barth. The disagreement is not elucidated, but the reader can readily infer that it must be directed against Barth's interpretation of Luther, not against Barth's own view of God's hiddenness. Bandt is in fact plainly motivated by a very Barthian concern to demonstrate the christo- centrism of evangelical theology (der christologische Ansatz). Only, he wants to argue that Luther, too, was a consistent practitioner of this method, not least in his doctrine of the deus absconditus. The thesis is presented on page 94, spaced out (in the original German) for em- phasis: "In the final analysis, there is no other hiddenness of God for Luther than the hidden form of his revelation." A part of what this means for Bandt is that the deus absconditus must not be linked with any general sense for the enigmatic character of life nor with any merely 287 88 " Deus absconditus" (n. 9 above), p. 205, n. 31. 89 Among the passages in Church Dogmatics critical of Luther see vol. 2, pt. I (Eng. trans., New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1957), PP- 541-42; vol. 2, pt. 2 (ibid.), pp. 65-66. Barth's own presentation of the hiddenness of God is in pt. I, pp. 179 ff.</page><page sequence="26">The Journal of Religion philosophical doctrine of the unknowability of God, and he opposes those scholars who make this erroneous link as energetically (almost) as Barth engaged the advocates of a natural theology. The content of hiddenness must be derived strictly from God's revelation in Christ.90 In my judgment, Bandt's pursuit of the "inner unity" of Luther's doctrine, his attempt to demonstrate that all the various utterances are only extensions of the notion of the hidden form of revelation, leads to interpretations which are strained and unconvincing.91 Hiddenness II is not the most prominent line in Luther's thoughts on the deus absconditus, but I think I have shown that it is not a mere extension of Hiddenness I either.92 John Dillenberger had shown himself more ready to acknowledge the traces in Luther of belief in a knowledge of God apart from Christ; but 288 90 Luthers Lehre (n. 9 above), pp. 40 ff. (against Erich Seeberg), and pp. 71-72 (against Fritz Frey). 91 So, for instance, the argument that the hiddenness of God in creation is a hidden- ness which is "not yet" the hiddenness of revelation and in just this sense belongs to Luther's fundamental notion of revelation (ibid., pp. 127-28). A further, more basic problem is whether Bandt takes seriously enough the sharpness of the antithesis between the two wills in the much discussed passage from the De servo arbitrio. He is eager to show how even this passage can be brought under the single rubric of the hidden form of revelation. But he makes his task too easy by setting up Otto Ritschl's interpretation as the alternative (pp. 157-58). Ritschl accused Luther of a Marcionitic dualism of two gods, which was inferior to Marcion's view, however, in that Luther assigned omnipotence to the Hidden God. This is manifestly a piece of bull-headed literalism. But I cannot see that Bandt himself takes the passage sufficiently earnestly when he explains it as indicating "two aspects of the Christian knowledge of God" (p. 159). The problem is that they are contradictory aspects! It is, moreover, surprising that Bandt only turns directly to W.A. I8. 685.28 after (as he says) his interpretation of hiddenness and predestination in De servo arbitrio is already in essence completed (p. 155). If this is the most difficult passage for Bandt to assimilate, the most con- genial to his line of interpretation is undoubtedly 633.7 ff. It can certainly be granted that there is a formal harmony or functional parallel here between the two types of Hiddenness insofar as each exercises faith. But there are also large differences. It is a single act by which God slays and makes alive in the justification of the sinner, whereas the antithesis between eternal wrath and eternal mercy refers to two different divine acts or series of acts directed to two different objects. More importantly, Luther plainly implies in this very passage that the one series is hidden, not in the sense of being a revealed paradox, but because it lies outside of revelation. Of course, it must be added that the fact of reprobation, according to Luther, is not hidden in this sense, only the way in which this fact is to be reconciled with another revealed fact, God's will to mercy. 92 Bandt's case is strongest, I think, when he argues, not from der christologische Ansatz (a tergo, so to say), but from the movement toward faith (a fronte). As will be clear, I, too, acknowledge that there at least may be a functional subordination of Hiddenness II to Hiddenness I.</page><page sequence="27">"To the Unknown God" he, too, wished to minimize them, and he accused Brunner of perversely isolating and elevating this belief, which was taken for granted in Luther's day, and making it normative for our own day. To speak of man's natural condition as existence under the wrath of God (the deus absconditus) makes no sense when belief in God has itself ceased to be "part of the fabric of the age." Brunner "elaborated a dated side of Luther as if it were a matter of permanent theological significance." 93 If, for a moment, we can set aside the obligation to preserve the purity of a christocentric principle and simply ask whether the notion of Hiddenness II in fact corresponds to something in the way we encounter hard reality (whether or not the insight came to us by revelation), then I think it is obvious what the answer must be. To be assured that it is raining, one need not depend on the weatherman: it is enough to look out the window. Or, as Luther puts it, Reason herself can see the way the world goes, and she concludes that, if there is a God at all, he is not just. Belief in Christ is not needed for the attainment of that insight, but it does heighten the anguish. In 1955, the distinguished German historian Gerhard Ritter published a report on the last days of Karl Goerdeler, condemned to death as one of the conspirators against Hitler. The painful reflections of the condemned man express the anguish of the conflict between faith and experience, and Ritter rightly claimed for them a more than individual significance because they pose the cardinal question of our time: the question of the reality of God. Goerdeler wrote: In sleepless nights I have asked myself whether a God exists who shares in the personal fate of men. It is becoming hard to believe it. For this God must for years now have allowed rivers of blood and suffering, mountains of horror and despair for mankind . . . He must have let millions of decent men die and suffer without moving a finger. Is this supposed to be a judg- ment? ... Like the Psalmist, I have a controversy with God because I cannot understand him. ... And yet through Christ I am still looking for the merciful God. I have not found him. .. .94 Ritter explains this as the collapse of the old liberal theology of the nineteenth century, which closed the door on Luther's deus absconditus and the Christ who was forsaken on the cross. In his response to Ritter, Julius Richter challenged this use of the deus absconditus: it brings the despairing no comfort, but only the demand for submission to the 289 93 Dillenberger (n. 9 above), p. i57. 94 Quoted by Richter (n. 9 above), pp. 289-90.</page><page sequence="28">The Journal of Religion mystery of God. Here, concretely posed through connection with the most shattering experience of our time, is the question: What validity does the deus absconditus theme possess for theology today ? Even if the notion of God's hiddenness does correspond to something in our common experience, does that really help us? On one point Julius Richter was perfectly right. As far as Luther's own under- standing of the deus absconditus is concerned, "it is certainly not very appropriate, if someone is despairing of God, to refer him to the 'Hidden God.' That would be a burden which could only push the despairing still deeper into his despair." 95 There is no comfort in the Hidden God. We flee from the Hidden God, not to him. But there may be comfort in company-that is, in the recognition that we are not the first to have met him. Rather, hiddenness belongs essentially to the conception of God which we inherit. The negative side of our religious experience has already been thematized. Further, I cannot agree when Richter asserts that if Luther could expect a demonstration of God's justice in the light of glory, "then strictly (im Grunde) the deus absconditus thereby loses his fearful character already; indeed, for the believer he loses even (iiber- haupt) the character of hiddenness. .. ." 96 It is not, I think, a "manifest inconsistency" if one continues to speak of the Hidden God, precisely because the appeal to the deus revelatus must be understood within the concrete movement of experience and not as the final, logical resolution to an intellectual puzzle. The thought of God's hiddenness arises where the sheer mystery of human existence becomes the object of reflection. Questions crowd in upon the believer-no less than the unbeliever-which evoke a sense of the strangeness or even the terror of being human. This strangeness, this terror, are the other side of God's hiddenness. Faith does not over- come them-not in the sense of superseding them. There is an un- resolved dialectic in Reformation faith corresponding to a dialectic in the conception of God.97 Luther's faith struggled constantly with strange assaults which he called his "attacks" (Anfechtungen). At such moments, 290 95 Ibid., p. 297. 96 Ibid., p. 293. 97 Klaus Schwarzwailler rejects the terms "dialectic" and "dualism" as inappro- priate to the distinction between deus absconditus and revelatus on the grounds of the " identity of God " (n. 24 above), pp. 197-98. I do, of course, agree that there can be no talk of an objective dualism, as far as the reformers are concerned; but a subjective dialectic seems to me inescapably present: that is, a perennial exchange between two images of God. The art of faith is to move the mind in one direction; but it cannot halt the reverse movement, only counter it.</page><page sequence="29">"To the Unknown God" he discovered that the gracious God cannot be taken for granted. This experience undoubtedly shaped the form of his faith. Not, to be sure, in the sense that the object of faith became the Hidden God. This could not be so, because faith's object is always the Word of God.98 The Hidden God is never the object of faith. But faith nonetheless takes on an urgency, perhaps even a passion, because of the Hidden God, who prevents faith from becoming complacent. Faith, in Luther's sense, was a dare, a risk, or-in one of his favorite words-a "flight." Under Anfechtung, a man must dare against God to flee to God (ad deum contra deum).99 Faith is not repose, but movement. Hence, faith really does take into itself something of the meaning of God's hiddenness even though it is not directed towards that hiddenness: rather it is movement away from the Hidden God. The symbol of the Hidden God, so far from being ready for the rubbish heap of discarded medieval superstitions, may even be said to have a peculiar strength, vitality, modernity about it. "Anyone," says Hans Grass, "who speaks of the Hidden God can count on a greater understanding from the man of today than one who speaks of the Revealed God." 100 Perhaps it is Luther's flight to the manger, where he found the cradle of the God made flesh, that will sooner strike the modern as most typically (or "charmingly") medieval. It is the strange, threatening deus absconditus-the God who takes upon himself the features of the devil-who strikes a chord of response. We could even, I think, add to the regions of experience which summon up the Hidden God. Recall, for instance, the crushing, terrifying sense of God's naked majesty which Pascal evokes by portraying man as "lost in this remote corner of nature." "What is a man in the Infinite ?" 101 Here, in the anxiety of finitude and insignificance, modern man experiences the hiddenness of God. And faith can only mean that in the Revealed God he finds the possibility of affirming the meaning of life in spite of this anxiety-this other dark possibility that he really is lost in a boundless and senseless universe. In my judgment, it is precisely here that, despite admitted differences, our faith will come closest to the faith of Luther and Calvin because, for them too, in their own way, faith was a flight from the Hidden God. 291 98 Cf.

It should certainly prevent us from adding to them gratuitously by misrepresentation of what we inherit. God, in classical Protestantism, is neither pure transcendence (in the sense of "distance" or being "out there") nor pure benevolence. It may be that our problems are not solved with the Hidden God, but it is more certain that they cannot be solved without him. A further step, how- ever, can hardly be taken towards dealing with the religious problem of hiddenness unless much more is said than I have been able to say about the Revealed God, to whom Luther and Calvin turned in faith. For this God reveals himself precisely in the experience of forsakenness and despair, that is, in Christ as der Angefochtene, the archetype of man assailed by sin, death, and hell. It is remarkable that, in the figure of Christ, Calvin found the strangeness of human existence portrayed in respect of both its inequality (or "diversity") and its dread. In the very Head of the Church--conceived a mortal man, yet already chosen in the womb to be the salvation of the world-is, as Augustine discerned, the " brightest mirror of free election," and we may not ask: Why this man, and not another? 102 But God's Chosen One was destined to take upon himself the agony of a man forsaken by God. "And surely no more terrifying abyss can be imagined than to feel yourself forsaken and estranged from God; and when you call upon him, not to be heard." 103 I do not see how it could be claimed that the experience of Hiddenness II arises from the christological centre. But that is where Luther and Calvin thought it must lead: to Hiddenness I. If the enigma of human existence is to be identified as the hiddenness of God, for many (one would not wish to say all) that will be because, like all things human, the experience of hiddenness was not alien to the Redeemer himself. In the passage from the abyss of the Unknown God to the mystery of faith assailed by doubt lies the efficacy of the Christian story. 292 102 Inst., 3.22.I. Cf.
