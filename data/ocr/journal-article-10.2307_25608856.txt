This means that for there to be a secret there must be keepers of the secret, those invested with the authority to either abscond it from, or reveal it to, others. They can imbue their secret words and objects with this intention, though this power may not be intrinsic to the nature of either: Spoken words are naturally meant to be shared, and as such cannot be considered to have a secret vocation, while material things are both visible and tangible. Yet, if the word can be absconded by not being uttered, then the universe of words may also be seen as a vast, secret realm, unheard and invisible, occasionally pierced by flashes of revelation. An object, for its part, is mute, and words can only be attached (or attributed) to it externally: They can be addressed to it, though they will not penetrate it. But an object can hide other objects inside it: It can be made of things that its surface and form make invisible. This holds for natural objects as well as artifacts, although their origin is different. Despite the unending search of science, the uItimate origin of natural objects is unknown (though not a secret), as if absconded in God's mind. If artifacts can be absconded, physically as well as in relation to the intentions of their makers (in the sense, for instance, that something may be absconded about them), such intentions can only be transmitted to the object, and communicated among its users, through the utterance of words?whether hidden or revealed?so that the word that originally became the artifact can be 1.

While the object's name establishes it as something other than its physicality, the narrations relating to its origins and history confer to "it" a character to which inevitably anthropomorphic qualities are attached. But these attributes?acquired through language?are also like a mask for the original thingness of the thing?its mystery, or secret, as it were?and the gap between the two layers of significance can never be bridged, because the thing itself has its own language?its silent Gestalt Around the thing is where the two languages can meet?about the object, though never quite of the object, never fully coinciding with the object itself, which in this sense remains absconded under, or by, its appearance. Felines may hide their feces in order to better abscond from other predators, but also because their survival depends on their ability to avoid detection by their potential prey. Many animals avoid contact with the corpses of members of their own species, as if absconding from death itself. In many archaic societies, the belongings of the dead?their property and things in some way attached to the memory of their identity?were destroyed (together or separately from their lifeless bodies) or buried with them. Generally, the human corpse is cast away?or, in the extreme, cremated?although the killed enemy was sometimes (at least partly) eaten so as to incorporate?and abscond within oneself?his "foreign" power (dangerous if left roaming about). While ornaments and decorations came to mask the naked (hence vulnerable) identity of the living (thus helping to keep death itself at bay?), they also protected it in death, somehow both masking and regimenting its possible return. But already in antiquity these same accoutrements provided the motive for anti-sacred action, once they acquired more value (of whatever sort) than the corpse itself, or, in other words, once the power (or fear) of the corpse was superseded by the exchange value (or price) of the ornament itself. This is what is called the profanation of the corpse and of its burial?that is, in the etymological sense of the word, the uncovering and willful utterance of the (secret) word knowledge meant to keep it absconded: The sacredness of the corpse?once protected by the very permanence of their insignia within the secret of their emplacement? soon fell victim to the irresistible appeal of the riches it was buried with, until these were transformed, in</page><page sequence="2">348 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 Figure 1.

Thus, so many artifacts, over centuries and millennia, once carriers of a secret memory were dragged back from their otherworldly caches into the light of day and the world of the living, only to be eventually reburied in the overprotected showcases and sancta sanctorum of our museums. Such a close archaic association of body and things (and of body and being, as well as of being and things), though intuitively plausible, is not unproblematic. Because if the object, in some instances, must vanish from view, along with the remains of the person, this may imply that any notion of people's subsistence beyond death must also in some way apply to their belongings, so that these would need to be buried, or destroyed, not just as a measure of self-protection on the part of the living (as against the possible contagion, or mimesis, of death), but rather as a way of ensuring for them a sort of metaphysical permanence?that is, a sort of immortality of their own (but again, with different motivations than in our museums). Then, at some point (perhaps before the middle of the first millennium b.c), in parts of the West and in conjunction with the progressive desacralization of the written word, a new divergence between body and artifact took hold: The dead body began its journey towards becoming just a corpse, an object, while the artifact started on its way towards becoming a work of art (thus acquiring a new "life"). So it was, too, that the sites/times-of-absconding of both the corpse and the artifact were gradually separated?into the tomb/urn, and the private/public antecedents of the modern museum. It would perhaps be too schematic an interpretation of these parallel shifts to surmise that through time, space, and different cultural configurations to the progressive dispelling of certain modes of occultation (and secrecy) necessarily corresponded the development of new ones?as if an equilibrium of sorts in the balance of the absconded and the revealed, the patent and the secret, were a constant of civilization. Even if some truth could be found in such a metahistorical hypothesis, it would be impossible to gauge specific equivalences among different forms of archaic, ancient, and modern obfuscation and display, particularly in the fashioning and use of artifacts: Their very craft, despite being often closely guarded, is more often than not also formally transmitted, taught, hence at least partly revealed. But even such transmittals will not fully account for what will become the invariably unique relation between techniques and attitudes in the work of the recipient of those transmissions of skills and dispositions. In traditional settings, that uniqueness will Figure 2. Figure with removable helmet mask (possibly a kponiugo, worn by a Poro secret society impersonator), Senufo, Northern Ivory Coast, West Africa.

Covert expressions Once modern art appears?with its claim on a rediscovery of "pagan mysteries" and an ever more explicit aim to reach beyond craft (but without divine guidance)?the transmission of its techne tends to merge with that of the secrets of optical representation. Yet, already in early modern art, a new and more elusive form of absconding may also gradually be taking hold, though in plain sight, as it were. Because what</page><page sequence="4">350 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 is this rising intention to both re-present and meta represent, in the same gesture, if not the postulation of a content that would heretofore have remained hidden, invisible?analogous in this to those (supposedly) absconded qualities of nature that were at that same time becoming the object of experimental inquiry?3 From this perspective, art?an art that became secular even when it dealt with religious themes?would then come to be caught in an impasse: While its forms and techniques became ever more patent, its contents and aims remained intentionally elusive. This is still so even in recent times when?as in so-called conceptual and related sorts of art?the artifact purports to be discursively explicit about its content. Because if it really could be (that is, if it had nothing to hide), in what sense would it still be "art" and not just some sort of sermon, propaganda, ideological statement, or the like? Thus, a partially hidden?or at least not discursively evident?element must somehow be postulated both for the making of modern art and for its reception, and critical discourse is constantly wrestling with the task of penetrating, or at least displacing, this worldly secret. In much so-called primitive (or archaic) art, almost the opposite holds: The procedures, and often even their products, can be absconded?for example, in the Paleolithic cave paintings, in most funerary art, in many cult objects belonging to secret societies, and in the ritual knowledge and exclusive privileges (ownership) over the making of certain artifacts?while their content and aims are generally patent and declared (at least among the cognoscenti). In other words, the archaic artifact, which is neither a work of art in the modern sense, nor simply a representational device?even when it closely mimics the human/non-human world?hides both its origin and destination, so as to preserve its power. This secret, however, may derive, in turn, from some awareness of the magic interchange by which, in mimicry, the subject becomes the object, and vice versa. It is in this identity-swap between the maker and the made that one might detect the incipient rise of a sense of the subject?that is, in the very recognition of the 3. It is perhaps significant that the self-conscious resurfacing of an ambition to accomplish the highest realistic proficiency in representation?including the "magic" and secrets of perspective? parallels the technical breakthrough that produced the large mirror, with its undistorted reflection (and reversing) of the "real" image from which in turn the discovery of the magic lantern effects, themselves a prelude to photography, may have sprung. But the mirror only reflects what is presented to it and that can also abscond, or be absconded, from it?per speculum in aenigmate, as the alchemists would say. object's irreducible separateness, which is also its secret, and, in fact, what makes it sacred. In 1914 Marcel Duchamp exposed the unprecedented nature of the modern (and modernist) art object by setting it apart as a diverted (detourne) tool, a readymade. It implied an inevitably ironic post-Romantic awareness of the absconded, or unspeakable, mysteries of I'art pour I'art, that is, of the art object's motives, function, and destination, as well as of the identity, role, and function of authorship.4 If his Nude Descending a Staircase (1912), perhaps in a response to the Futurists, had already introduced a pictorial reference to time in pictures, into the pictorial representation of movement, thereby revealing its problematic fixity?in uncanny anticipation of quantum physics' indeterminacy principle?the readymade, and the found object, make evident the chance element in perception ("un coup de 4. In 1921, Duchamp absconded his own appearance under the veiled, transvestite image of Rrose Selavy (as photographed by Man Ray), and attributed the same name-identity to an assemblage, or "readymade sculpture," called Why not Sneeze, Rrose Selavy??"sugar cubes" carved in marble, an oral thermometer, and a fish bone inside a small bird cage. Andre Breton noted the artistic trick represented by the unexpected heaviness of the object, and in fact its title may refer to the artistic mask falling off as a consequence of an irrepressible sneeze, dispelling the magic of the disguise. In those same years, a still-young Jun'ichiro Tanizaki had published a short story (The Secret, 1917), in which a young intellectual recounts how after seeking solitude and anonymity as the guest of a monastery in a remote and obscure part of town, he rekindled by chance?while roaming at night under female disguise?a past love affair with a mysterious woman whose true identity he still did not know. But once her identity, and where she lived, were finally revealed to him, the magic of his secret passion evaporated. There is a final hint that from then on stronger sensations, "of the color of blood," would be needed to stir the hero from his melancholia: the dispelling of the secret (and fetish) would lead to sacrifice. Although I cannot go into it here, Jacques Lacan's theory of the "Veil" that separates the "Subject" from "Object-Nothingness," which is a corollary of the one of the relation between the "Symbol" and the "Image" could be evoked in this context: "As we know, the first theory of psychoanalysis had as its pivot the Freudian identification conceived as identification with the image. . . . Lacan's imaginary register emphasized the power of what can be seen. This implies the connection of the imaginary and the symbolic and thus a thesis that is separated from perception: the image is a screen for what cannot be seen. ... the image that is showing [emphasis mine] is both an image that conceals, and that shows in order to conceal. . . . Mimicry also introduces a small variation on the function of the veil . . . the mask in the place of the veil. . . . Lacan suggests that it is through the intermediary of masks that the masculine and the feminine encounter each other in the most ardent manner."

Or rather, they turn the way the object is received into an art of arbitrary valuation, displaced and removed from the object's true origin, which is now doubled by the authorial gesture that turns it into a "work of art" (again, in a way radically opposite to that which produced the archaic artifact, and its "magic"). Significantly, almost at the opposite end of his trajectory, Duchamp made a point of documenting photographically (though never publishing this record while alive) every stage of the long and "secret" construction of his Etant Donnes ... (1946-1966) installation (which was permanently displayed behind a sealed wooden door at the Philadelphia Museum of Art). In so doing, he also set up a sort of "deconstruction" of the long process of the making of the piece, as if reversing it just as it was occurring. The theatrical artificiality of the faux-diorama look of the work (which is more like that of cinema, because of its fixed and restricted point of view), could also be seen as an echo of the illusion effects of an eighteenth-century magic lantern. Only the scene here is materially "real," though also, quite literally, impenetrable and partially absconded. The photographic documentation itself, with its jotted instruction notes, is the expression of a certain conceptuality displayed up front, as if the "object" itself were little more than a portmanteau for it, an artifact without intrinsic meaning (precisely because the work may be all about voiding the very notion of "meaning"). But here again we cannot surmise that the artifact?in absconding with its meaning and its origin?somehow revokes, in a sort of Primitivist reflux, the mysteries presiding over the making and reception of many archaic artifacts: There is no claim to transcendence here?beyond that of the artist working out his secret, in secret?no other mediation than that represented by the author's name and the work's title (the nominalism covering up the tricks of its factura). Still, both the readymade and Etant Donnes are quasi-sur-real artifacts, because the idea of a concealment of their making has been staged, and a hollowing out of the representational function (which is then as if hidden away). In this sense, Etant Donnes and the readymade?conceived one generation apart?situate themselves at opposite poles, within Modernist antirepresentation, of those Cubist/ Futurist attempts (to which the Nude was still related) to capture reality simultaneously as if from multiple viewpoints and as if in a space-time flow. They are fixed conceptual devices that transfer to the viewer all responsibility for the aesthetic impact of the object, in the moment of his encounter with it.

Little, on the surface of it. Both artists do seem to relate to a post Duchampian artistic order?one rooted in the stark departures of Andy Warhol and Josef Beuys. Almost simultaneously, though in opposite ways and on opposite sides of the Atlantic, they found a new approach to tackling the real world, while also absconding from it. Beuys translated the (possibly made-up) memory of his traumatic survival experience in World War II (where he claimed to have been saved from freezing to death by Russian peasants who hid him away, wrapped in rough felt) into an edgy sense of the precariousness of life and a Utopian vision of new forms of communal sustenance. His own person (and persona) was at all times on view, as if on stage, as the very embodiment of human/animal frailty and resilience: By exposing the universality of hidden power relations (Macht), he strove to unveil their ultimate inanity. One could almost say that Beuys, as an artist, was ostensibly oriented towards a neutralization of any possible form of absconding. The limit, however, or not-so-hidden residue, in Beuys's enterprise, is precisely what is most explicit in it: the programmatic texture of his productions and actions. One is left wondering what might lie hidden under this eminently late-modern ideological mask.6 At the American end of this post-Duchampian spectrum, Warhol recognized that what was donne, readymade, and found, was not just the object itself, or even its image, but the very means of its transmission. The image-as-image, in fact, becomes content, irreducible to any model, so that its variants and aliases acquire a status equal to any (supposed) original, which in turn becomes as if fully absconded behind its replicas. The potential for such a blinding plethora of images and their replicas had of course begun long before, with the development of early modern printing and engraving.7 But Warhol?fully embodying the spirit of the times and even anticipating the rise of electronic virtual imaging? brought it to an apex. There is absolutely nothing in Warhol's art that is absconded?all is on the surface, brought to it by a quasi-mechanical gesture, often under the guise of decoration. Yet, for this very reason, it is as if an immeasurable amount were left unsaid (while Beuys spoke incessantly). In that sense, it is a reductive process, so that there may be a closer kinship than is immediately evident between the starkness of Warhol's "Pop" images and that of the material abstractions of Minimalism, with their claim to a suppression (or absconding?) of expressiveness and emotions. It is on this register of hiding under the banality and, now, physicality of the most patent and obvious, that one can see a transatlantic parallel today between the works of Koons and those of Hirst. If a Warhol-like, almost Factory-style mode of production and a relative transparency about the financial dimensions of their operations is common to both, one can detect in the British artist a whiff of Beuys's ideological fixation on the sustenance of life and on the conditions for the preservation of its traces (see Hirst's medical glass cabinets, talismanic reliquaries of science rather than sainthood). In Koons, all corporality?paradoxically, in a way, because he is principally a "sculptor"?is as if distilled into an image of itself that invests the material surface with its glossy, impenetrable veneer. All is at once revealed and absconded about the object, not just its function and destination?again a la Duchamp?but also its very status and standing as a thing. Similarly, the large, colorful, mock hard-porn photographs in which Jeff Koons engaged in various acts of copulation with his then wife "Cicciolina" are also a gesture of total devoilement?on one level?though, on another, they radically subtract (and abscond) any hint of depth, passion, or subjectivity from the purely representational event.8 Thus, here, the gesture of absconding desire, chased from the privacy of the studio, comes back on to public walls through the impersonal window and mechanical showcase of the camera lens and the chemical reproduction of what it optically registers. 6. Andy Warhol, with irony and characteristic finesse, but also with empathic insight, caught the contradictory poetic dimension of Beuys, by producing?once they finally met?a series of silk-screened portraits of his iconic hat-clad and "impassible" countenance, in various combinations of colors, but many of them sprinkled with diamond dust. The anticapitalist bad boy?a fellow traveler of Fluxus?was transfigured into a golden image of the artist-as-guru by the radically anti-ideological philosopher of the faux-naive deadpan. 7.

These pictures, prominently displayed in a prominent New York art gallery, remind one?but perhaps also counteract??a series of Polaroid shots of naked male prostitutes, at one point taken nightly by Warhol in his Factory. These photographs remained hidden at the time, and he may have never intended to exhibit them.

Now, the mask, as an artifact and a ritual instrument, is like a boundary between that which-cannot-be-concealed?the contingent identity of the performer?and that-which-must-be-concealed, the epiphany of the hero/ancestor's presence-in-absence. The mask is the signpost of such an event, as it points simultaneously to an occurrence in time and outside of it, in life and beyond. The sequence of ancestral iconic identities that the mask refers to?or rather, makes apparent in the very act of absconding them?is quite the opposite of that "filtering" (filtrage, according to Foucault) by which Mendel's Law detached heredity from the species (or lineage) and sexuality that transmitted it, "obscuring it" in the indefinite series of generations where it appears and disappears according to statistical regularities. It is a new, differently measured (and differently hidden) genealogical object, which requires new conceptual instruments and new theoretical foundations.10 Foucault also noted how while in traditional pre-modern societies "the new is not in what is said but in the occurrence (evenement) of its return," for us, after the advent of science, "one asks the author to reveal . . . the hidden meaning that goes through him" (ibid., p. 29). Hence the modern text is not a mask. But this does not mean that it can be free?except "in the space of a wild (sauvage) exteriority"?from a "discursive 'policing' of rules . . . through the play of an identity that takes the form of a constant re-actualization of rules" (ibid., p. 37). So we would seem to be back where we started, at the old absconding action of ritual, one in which "apprenticeship gave access simultaneously to a communal entity and to a secret manifested but 9. M. Foucault, L'ordre du discours (Paris, 1971), pp. 12-14. 10. The distant origin of this new uncovering of a scientific discourse surrounding what might be "true" as against what is "false," that is of an irreversible chasm between what discourse once was, or did, and what it now says, occurred, according to Foucault, sometime between Hesiod and Plato?when true discourse became no longer "tied to the exertion of power" (ibid., pp. 17, 18). Yet power, as we well know, can also appropriate, distort, and displace the "truth" of the discourse of science. not divulged by its uttering: Between the word and its reception (I'ecoute) the roles were not interchangeable" (ibid., pp. 41-42). Foucault advocated against these remnants of the archaic in modern discourse through his principles of "reversibility," "discontinuity," "specificity," and, especially, "exteriority" (ibid., pp. 53-55). The last, in particular, is relevant to some of the issues relating to "absconding" and art that have occupied us in the preparation of this special volume of RES. For Foucault, "exteriority" warns us against the temptation to go "from discourse towards an interior and hidden core," promoting instead a movement "from discourse itself. . . towards its external conditions of possibility, towards what furthers the random (aleatoire) series of. . . events . . . which delimits [the discourse's] boundaries" (ibid., p. 55). This, finally, brings the philosopher and metahistorian to ask himself how one could/should characterize these "events" in which modern discourse (the avatar of Classic logos) is expected to at once realize and dissolve itself, a problem he recognizes as presenting "ostensibly frightening" difficulties: Because being neither substance nor accident, neither quality nor process, the event is not of the order of bodies (n'estpas de Yordre des corps). Still, neither is it immaterial: it always occurs (prend effet) at the level of materiality, where it has its place (lieu), [that] consists in the relation, the coexistence, the dispersion, the recoupement, the accumulation, the selection of material elements; it is not the act nor the property of a body; it takes place as an effect of, and in a material dispersion. ... Let us say that the philosophy of the event should progress in the at first glance paradoxical direction of a materialization of the incorporeal. (Ibid., pp. 59-60; my translation.) A discussion of the possible implications of this "incorporeal" today?absconded as it appears to be through countless, and faceless, facebooks?would take us too far. Suffice it to note here that what they abscond (and abscond with) may be as potentially fruitful as what they ostensibly reveal about the new spiritual conditions of our materiality. Da capo: measure and melancholia In the Ancient Roman conjunction of Saturnus (an agricultural god) with Cronos (Time devouring his children), one finds one of the earth-sky symbols, but perhaps also a foreshadowing of the conception of an evolving?that is, measurable?nature. At appointed (solar and lunar) times, the seed must be hidden into the Earth's darkness before it can be reborn and flower (as Jupiter from Cronos's cavern).

Thus, if destruction is the condition of survival for the hunter, in agriculture dissolution and burial become that for regeneration.12 The early-modern Saturnine black bile of Melancholia?the Measuring One, in Durer's canonical representation?remains hidden and never actually seen (except by its effects), and will eventually be recognized as materially nonexistent (perhaps another instance of Foucault's "materialization of the incorporeal"). Melancholy contemplates, from an earthly-astral perspective, the hidden (but commensurable) finitude of life.13 But if hidden melancholy is the condition of the 11.

All this is deemed to be cyclical, and yet not all simply returns: In parts of Mesoamerica, for instance, several subsequent creations were fathomed where destruction did not announce the rebirth of the same. 13.

The hidden and absconded in it must take on new forms?assuming it can still exist. Similarly, encryption is a way of absconding (both the uttering and the uttered), but its reliance on randomness abstracts (and hence absconds) the very principle of concealment?in what one might call a sort of hyperquantification?making chance the unlikely narrow door to any epiphany or revelation. As in high finance, it is all in the numbers, but what the numbers actually say depends on concealment, not on their future significance, which is, by necessity, derivatively hidden /ntime. As noted at the start of these comments, the archaic absconded is that which cannot be said?the ineffable. Its hidden condition is akin, quite literally, to that of the dead, of the ancestors. The institution of a cult of the dead?possibly simultaneous to that of agriculture?may have transposed the stealth camouflage and mimesis for self-protection and effectiveness in hunting (for killing versus being killed) into the realm of death. In the rare hunting-and-gathering societies that have been observed before contact with agriculture and husbandry, funerary rituals, relatively simple ones, are chiefly collective gestures of severance, and accordingly genealogical memory tends to be short. While the latter varies greatly</page><page sequence="9">Pellizzi: Further comments on "Absconding" 355 among agriculturalists, common to them is what could be interpreted as a prescription to counter the way in which death?by nature accidental and unforeseeable? interrupts the flow of social time, which in these societies is modeled on the seasons and the cyclical revolving of the stars. Death must be ensconced in ritual, so that time can resume and continue its course?and just as the planted (and absconded) seeds must surface again to the light of day and regenerate, so the dead will be elaborately absconded but will live on in their descendants and be ensconced in their lives as relics, names, narratives, and also iconic and aniconic images. An elaborate play of hiding and revelation, disguise and recognition, mortality and immortality was set in place around ancestral cults in archaic agricultural societies, of the sort that in urban Ancient Greece eventually gave rise to the tragic theatre (always masked, as was its comedic counterpart): It is then that "the saints came marching in." So, perhaps one could also say that graduated initiations, while progressively opening up the area of the secret (or of the absconded, that is, the ancestral realm) for the initiated, also in a way expand its mystery for those who are not (or not yet) initiated (and/or cannot be). But in this perspective, the ancestral secret progressively embodied in the elders grows as it is reduced, reaching its apex when it touches its ultimate limit?or revelation?that is, its void-of-(potential) knowledge. Such might also be the secret of the Greek mysteries at Eleusis, never revealed in antiquity: The nothingness absconded at their core, which may have counterbalanced what Aristotle saw as the postsacrificial catharsis of tragedy, an ostensibly anti-mysteric one (though still speaking through masks), which has recently been convincingly reinterpreted as the "appearance" (Erscheinung) of "that which inspires fear" (Schrecken).u From my perspective here, one might then speak (provisionally) of the shift in the nature and role of the absconded, and of the secret, from archaic to classic (or proto-modern) society, as that from secret initiation into the patent staging of the emptiness of all worldly power and the pathos of this very condition. The veil of unveiling In Classic-age Sparta, according to the rigid codes established by Lykourgos, young men exercised naked in their gyms and young girls only wore a short tunic.15 In Athens, and elsewhere in classical Greece, nakedness was not as consistent or extreme, but it is striking that such a rigorous uncovering of the body?a trait we used to generally associate with savagery?should have been so prevalent in what we now view as one of the starting points of our civilization. But only for a few centuries, until Christian and Oriental body-covering again prevailed for almost two thousand years (transgressed, ante literam, by Salome's quasi-incestuous and murderous unveiling of herself). If a key element of the rediscovery of Classical Antiquity, in the Renaissance, was the resurgence of the heroic naked body in representation, this contrasted with the often soberly clad portraiture of the time. It was only with the rise of modernism, at the peak of the industrial revolution, when unclad human representations lost their poignancy and significance in high art (Duchamp's Nude is a depiction of motion, not of nudity), while they gradually took hold in popular commercial imagery (and mores): Parallel to the diffusion of the mechanical reproduction of images, we had the beginnings of an accelerated re-uncovering of the Western body. Then, since World War II and the spread of the new visual media (and despite some recurrences of pruderie, whose rise might be termed the contemporary "porno-puritan" complex), there is almost no limit today to generalized exposure of the body and its functions. Such a common display of what was long absconded has paralleled the new electronic visualization of what is naturally absconded in the universe, its once-invisible, immeasurable distances and infinitesimal components. This progressive unveiling may also relate to the rise of the evolutionary theory of natural history?the dynamic transformations of physical shapes no longer related to immutable forms?as well as to the theory of depth psychology, as this one represents the desirable uncovering of an unconscious psyche absconded within the recesses of the mind and covertly motivating and guiding many of its impulses 14. See George Steiner, "The shock of the black/' review of Karl Heinz Bohrer, Das Tragische: Erscheinung, Pathos, Klage (Munich, 2008), in Times Literary Supplement, April 24, 2009, p. 8. This transition could also be seen as corresponding to the passage from the sapiential to the "political" conception of metaphysics in early Classic Greece, from the Pre-Socratics (and Hesiod, as Foucault saw) and Plato. See Giorgio Colli, Filosofi Sovrumani (Milano, 2009) and Platone Politico (Milano, 2007). Both books were originally written in 1939. 15. Adolescent sexuality, in both sexes, notoriously transgressed our modern standards of relations between age groups. (See Roberto Calasso, Le Nozze di Cadmo e Armonia [Milano, 1988], pp. 95-105.) One may wonder if and in what way the Persian Wars (perhaps by contrast or opposition) may have played a role in the uncovering of the archaic Greek body. The complex history of the absconding/unveiling of our bodies, between modesty (pudicitia) and "naturism," can only be mentioned here.</page><page sequence="10">356 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 Figure 5.

It operates through the interpretation of a discourse on dreams, which in fact focuses on the relations between verbal and visual images (these ones by and large absconded, because no one has ever "seen" a dream while awake), so that now one can/must be helped to discover one's own individual secret, which will then be safeguarded (re-absconded) by the therapist (and his or her discourse), so that the vision of the cosmic and human forces once provided by myth is now hidden away by a meta-confessional discourse in the control of scientists.16 An ideology of uncovering, of letting it all hang out?perhaps already foreshadowed in the public confessions of certain evangelical sects, particularly in America?appears to be explicitly or implicitly dominant 16. In Television (Paris, 1973; Television, New York, 1990, trans. D. Hollier, R. Krauss, A. Michelson), Jacques Lacan broached a view of the psychoanalytic relation quite opposite from its supposed analogy to the one between the penitent and his confessor (in which the hidden is spoken, but only so as to be canceled, or buried away), and instead more similar to the encounter of the (at least potentially) faithful with the traditional "saint." This one, in his view, operated on a register of trachitas: a sort of anti-car/fas turning conventional compassion into "trash" (dechet). See Francois Regnault, "Saintliness and the Sainthood," Lacanian Ink 33 (Spring 2009):115-125; pp. 118-123, and passim. today, which is quite the opposite of the ostensible praise of privacy, and, though in a different way, of the secrecy, tempered by gossip, that generally prevails in traditional societies. On the dark and more or less hidden side of these, aggression and counter-aggression are also channeled in covert ways. Witchcraft must operate in secret, so that even its countermeasures cannot openly be displayed. Still today, for instance, when multicolored candles among the Maya of the Chiapas Highlands are surreptitiously lit around offerings to the Lord of the Earth?himself an "absconded one"?so that (other) brujos might not "look into them" through the chromatic barrier?a sort of light-in-darkness?and steal or divert them to their own purposes. This is also the gaze?akin to that of the shaman-as-healer?that pierces through the "surface (or face) of the earth," which is both the veil over things, people (and bodies), represented by their daylight appearance, and the one that separates waking knowledge from what can be weaned off the experience (visual, emotional, etc.) of "dreams." So, it can be said that as in the case of the progressive secrets of initiation, the chromatic barrier of the witchcraft candles makes visible the limit between the two realms of "waking" and "dreaming" reality, the unspeakable separation that denotes its sacredness. If this is so, we may then see in this ambivalence a striking example of how archaic, prevalently oral thought symbolically tackles what must</page><page sequence="11">Pellizzi: Further comments on "Absconding" 357 remain absconded through formal objectifications: the fatal encroachment of death upon the realm of the living. Hidden powers There is, of course, a modern political dimension to veiling and unveiling that is not always attached to the production and use of artifacts. The Republic of the United States of Mexico was dominated for about seventy years by the nominally democratic regime of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, an oxymoron of sorts), which established a presidential system of government based on a strict principle of "non-reelection" to any electoral post. No Reeleccion was such a capital tenet of this system that streets and even children were named after it. This translated into a play of musical chairs between party notables and those aspiring to enter the ruling familia revolucionaria. A peculiar feature of this rather ingenious mechanism, which ran parallel to and narrowly outlived that created by the architects of the Russian Revolution, was the shadowy figure that every six years, a few months before a presidential "election," was referred to as the Tapado (the "covered," or absconded, one). It was someone (invariably a man) whom the outgoing president had secretly designated? in pectore?as the next presidential "candidate" of the ruling party. Names of potential candidates were floated right and left, but these, invariably, ended up being the quemados, the "burnt out ones," whose chances were actually dispelled by premature exposure. Oddly enough, while El Tapado's elevation (by el dedazo, or "the big-finger-pointing") to imminent absolute power infused him with the sacred aura of an untouchable, once his identity was revealed, this was not deemed incompatible with a postrevolutionary and populist ideology that disguised its autocratic underpinnings.17 17. While it lasted, such a practice of selective unveiling had its merits for the perpetuation of a relatively orderly system of succession, and of the political class that controlled it. I had the opportunity to follow at relatively close range the elections of the last seven Mexican presidents; nevertheless, mine here is still a very sketchy account of but one aspect of a very complex system for the transmittal of power and legitimacy in twentieth-century Mexico, which certainly underwent subtle (and mostly hidden) changes over its long history. So much so that when the Institutional Revolutionary Party started showing signs of entropic weakness, its destapado was killed soon after being revealed: The candidate had been caught for the first time in a new state of weakness, unprotected by the aura of his traditionally autocratic designation and unveiling. This pointed to new forces that unseen had entered and taken hold of the political arena, and have in time become quite apparent. It may have been precisely this never-resolved tension between oligarchy and populism, concealment and visibility that became a symbolic banner for the regime and contributed critically to its remarkable longevity Certainly however, and despite its covert features, what we have in this Mexican instance is quite distinct from the process by which many archaic and traditional societies co-opted progressive levels of authority through various forms of initiation. In these, the knowledge of the secrets on which power rested was conferred by and large through various sorts of trials, whose inanity only became apparent after the fact and for that very reason could never be revealed. In the case of modern Mexico, the trial itself was like an absconded door to unlimited power: The potential candidate could never be sure of when, or on what grounds, he would be chosen. And yet the two forms of secrecy are also in some way analogous. In both the name of those co-opted into or by secrecy are changed, at least by the addition of a key attribute, and their identity altered forever, even beyond death. The factual triviality of the secret revealed to the archaic initiate, which may have corresponded to the opening of a path of enlightenment, may also be somehow analogous to the sudden void faced by one whose destapo opens the way to the top of the modern power ladder: Where else can one go, when there is nothing left to be absconded and revealed?18 Burial and beauty While a good portion of all artifacts, for millennia, were meant to be buried with the dead?forever absconded and concealed from the living?for us moderns, visibility has become the dominant parameter of art. Yet even for us the ideal final destination of art might be said to be a burial of sorts?often into the 18. According to Nonnus {Dionysiaca, XV, 409ff.), Telete?the "initiation," the "last completion"?is the daughter of Nikaia, the hunter (huntress? the slayer?) and of the "impure" god of mystery and trance, Dionysus (see Calasso, note 15, p. 48). Certain contemporary artistic confrontations with the experience of the void may point to a sort of nostalgia (not always as naive as it may at first seem) for traditional forms of revelation-through-initiation. In the "ephemeral and immersive presentation titled Le Vide (The Void)... at Galerie Iris Clert in Paris [1958] Yves Klein cleaned out and whitewashed the gallery so as to 'impregnate' the empty space with his consciousness; filling the freshly whitened gallery (emptied of figurative presence) with Le Vide, through which [he] led small groups. . . . Klein's famous photomontage Leap into the Void, which depicts him floating above a street, is a symbol of the desire to overcome gravity and thus enter into the unlimited aspects of virtuality."

Though in both cases artifacts are cast off into cave-like abodes, the modern museum is a paradoxical setting in this respect, because it removes objects from general circulation, while also striving to promote their viewing by the greatest possible number of people (museums count, that is, measure, the number of visitors, and a museum's success is in turn measured by these numbers). Between being entombed and being relegated to a museum, the artifact has gone through various relations to the site, to its producers and users, and one of these has been the shift from providing pilgrimage destinations (a function rekindled by the museum) to becoming itself (like the old holy relics) a traveling object, and commodity, which is absconded/revealed by the accidents and manipulations of exhibition and trade. Concealment is not unknown to art in modernity, as when works are tucked away for longer or shorter periods, waiting for the moment of demand?or so as to provoke desire by their absence. A work previously unknown to the market ("fresh" as it is sometimes termed) may be more valuable than the one that has become well known through multiple exposures. To be successful, the merchant must hoard and abscond, as much as reveal, his goods (this is in fact true of all commodities). There is, thus, a phantom quality to trade and its markets. Not surprisingly, great repositories of tales of adventure and deception (a critical element of absconding), such as The Thousand and One Nights and the Decameron, were produced in highly developed and far-reaching mercantile milieus. Thus the ostensible and ideological antinomy between modern art (or rather, its historians and critics) and "the market" is in itself a mask, absconding a case of intimate and intricate codependency. But it is also a fact that to be true to his art, the artist true to his name must to some extent abscond from the market, at least in the process of nurturing his creative source and conditions. The exception that confirms the rule is the latest exploit by Damien Hirst, who at the height of the recent ten-year rise in the art market (though perhaps a moment too late) decided to embrace it to the point of staging his own one-man auction.19 Here again an antiabsconding gesture, which polemically embraced commercialism, turned out to have rather hidden undertones, enhanced by the fact that the privately owned auction house is not required to make its books public. You might say that the sale was in itself a work of conceptual art on the part of 19. At supposedly very high "reserve prices." The auction was managed by Christie's and sales were in the mid-range of estimates, if all that was claimed by the auction house and the artist is true: Rumors circulate that the artist himself may have been an absconded buyer at his own auction.</page><page sequence="13">Pellizzi: Further comments on "Absconding" 359 the artist and a rather profitable one at that (no matter to what degree). In Yoko Ogawa's haunting novella, The Ring Finger {Kusuriyubi no hyohan), a strange establishment, owned and single-handedly run by a director-technician, is devoted to making "specimens" out of objects brought in for that purpose by clients who desire by that means to both enshrine and be rid of them (along with their emotional and mnemonic associations). It is stipulated that the specimens remain available for inspection by their consigners, but actually very few clients, if any, ever return for that purpose, as their aim is to forget them. The motto of this eerie operation is "there is nothing that cannot be turned into a specimen here." Somewhat in the vein of Jun'ichiroTanizaki's exploration of various forms of fetishism, Ogawa's story also has an erotic/perverse twist. But in relation to my absconding theme, one may note its disquietingly sinister take on the relation between objects and personal memory (souvenirs), on the one hand, and between depersonalized memory and its museum-like repository on the other. Each object "represents" a story, and yet each story is also encased, imprisoned, in the object and separated from its subject. This is the sort of separation . that in archaic and traditional settings establishes the sacred, but that here, in the secular setting of industrial and mass culture?where an equivalence of artifacts and mechanical products and the anonymity of agency prevail?takes on a demonic character, not in the old sense of a power rooted in the wild, but as inner?hence hidden?drives caught in self-perpetuating cycles of stimulus and appeasement. I have recalled only a few of the ways in which artifacts can be buried, found, then buried again for different reasons and purposes that fall between the serendipitous, the aesthetic, the magical, and even the political. In his Commentarii, Lorenzo Ghiberti described two Classical sculptures that had recently been unearthed?an intact Hermaphroditus, in Rome, "the size of a thirteen year old girl," apparently buried at some point as part of the top of an underground sewage tunnel {cloaca), and a naked female figure, in Florence, "found underground while digging beneath the houses of the Brunelleschi family, which statue, when the Christian faith prevailed, was hidden in that place by some gentle spirit, who, seeing such a thing of perfection and made with such marvelous skill (arte) and subtlety of conception (ingegno), moved by compassion, had a brick tomb made, buried this statue within it and covered it with a big stone slab, so that it might remain Figure 7. Ray Smith, Retrato de mi madre, 1988. Oil on wood, 213.36 x 259 cm, (4 panels). Private collection, New York. unharmed (lacerata affatto) . . . and in this way (forma) it was preserved in our city for a very long time, buried thus."20 But what astounds Ghiberti, the sculptor, about these buried Classical treasures suddenly restored to the light of day, is the fact that in both cases, with regard to their many qualities (dolcezze), "sight could discern nothing, unless the hand found them with its touch" ("nessuna cosa il viso scorgeva, se non col tatto la mano la trovava"), and "sight cannot comprehend them, either in strong or in subdued light, only the hand finds [them} by touch ("le quail il viso no le comprende ne con forte luce ne con temperata, solo la mano a toccarla la trova"). A parallel appears to be established, on a most sensuous level, between the attractiveness of these beauties long absconded from sight (even, in the case of the adolescent Hermaphroditus, the indignity of the context), and the physical intimacy required to truly understand and enjoy them (in ways strictly forbidden by all of our museums). Does blind touch translate automatically into visual images in the mind? This could perhaps be investigated by neurological experiment. Of some relevance for our semiabsconded theme is that right after these sensuous and haunting accounts of 20.

Private collection, New York. art buried and retrieved, and of invisibility versus tactile beauty, Ghiberti chooses to relate a third contemporary instance of the wondrous unearthing of an ancient statue: a "Venus," inscribed as being "by Lysippos," found buried in the foundations of the house of a Sienese family of prominent craftsmen, the Malavolti. The statue, which was at first enthusiastically adopted by the whole township, was even drawn by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Ghiberti had actually only seen this drawing of it by the eccellentissimo maestro), and had been proudly enshrined on a fountain, in the middle of a piazza. But soon afterward, when it was found that?as an incitement to "idolatry"?the monument's very beauty had caused divine wrath and misfortune to be visited on Siena's continuing wars with Florence, it was violently wrenched from its plinth, cut to pieces, and spitefully buried in Florentine ground ("in su nostro terreno").21 It is hard not to see the uncanny symmetry with the previous instance of art exhumation: To a careful burial so as to preserve the beauty and integrity of sublime "craft/' here corresponds a defacing and destructive inhumation; to hidden preservation and eventual oblivion (another form of "timeless" absconding), a murderous gesture of concealment, in which what had been recognized as a devilish beauty is surreptitiously planted to poison the eternal enemy's soil?like a broken voodoo doll?meant to bring fracture and ruin to its intended victims, in some sort of secret antisacrifice. Absconding art and the art of the absconded, like Orpheus's music, would appear to swing between the two poles of death and resurrection: Erst in dem Doppelbereich werden die Stimme ewig und mild.22 (Paxos, July 2008/St. Barthelemy, January 2009) 21. A member of the City Council had proposed that the statue be "taken down, all defaced and broken up, and sent to be [secretly, one presumes] buried in the territory of the Florentines" ("si ponesse et tutta si lacerasse et spezassesi et mandassesi a seppellire in sul terreno de' Fiorentini") (ibid., p. 63). The object became, in its new, intentional fragmentation and secret burial, an instrument of sorcery, like certain offerings hidden in caves by the Highland Chiapas Maya, so as to secretly harm their enemies (for instance, by "selling them out" to the infernal powers). Or, perhaps more precisely, the gesture may have been intended to provoke the Divinity's or even "fetish's" blind wrath against the Florentines, who were surreptitiously turned into (involuntary) idolaters and desecrators. Sacrifice must be carried out through shared rituals, to be communally acceptable and beneficial: Absconded sacrifice is the work of black magic, of asking for the forbidden. 22. "Only in the dual realm / do voices become / eternal and mild," Rilke (see note 1), 9.12-14.</page></plain_text>
