<plain_text><page sequence="1">BROWNING'S PYGMALION AND THE REVENGE OF GALATEA BY CATHERINE MAXWELL I will make an Eve, be the artist that began her, Shaped her to his mind! -'Women and Roses," 47-481 In Browning's poetry, the creative act is epitomized by a male artist's desire to immortalize his feminine ideal. For these male artists, the creation of woman represents the primal scene of aesthetic production: it is not simply the human but the feminine subject who is the image and end of creative endeavour: "I always see the garden and God there / A- making man's wife" ("Fra Lippo Lippi," 266-67). Man, succeeding to the position of the anthropomorphic and masculine deity, becomes the maker of his own match. Woman, rather than being a subject in her own right, functions as the device that completes man's lack, simultaneously reflect- ing him back to himself in a reassuring fullness. The poems' male actors, whether genuine or aspirant artists, have constant recourse to a vocabu- lary that frames their female partners as art-objects, and the repetition of this pattern raises the question of whether Browning exposes or colludes with this identification. U. C. Knoepflmacher opened this debate with the well-supported contention that Browning ironizes the Romantic epipsyche in his poetry, revealing the extent to which woman as other is narcissistically conceived as a prop, extension, or guarantor of male identity.2 Carol Christ's slightly later examination, "The Feminine Subject in Victorian Poetry," adopts a more suspicious tone. Having made the entirely legitimate claim that, "like Tennyson, Browning associates woman with the poetical character," she proceeds to assert the significance of woman in Browning's poetry as the focus of the male and frequently murderous gaze "Browning's ... male characters seek to appropriate a woman of their desire."3 She suggests, however, that this appropriation is part of the poet's own larger project: "Fearful of the feminization of culture, the poet of the period strove to make the female subject bear his name."4 Thus she reads the struggle of Browning's male protagonists to control, master, fix the women of their desire as a reflection of his own creative anxiety: "Browning reveals and obscures the erotic transgression of the artist by controlling ELH 60 (1993) 989-1013 ? 1993 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 989</page><page sequence="2">the looks of others."5 The taming of the woman's own gaze, the control of her license to survey, is as much the preoccupation of the poet as it is that of his male monologuists. "The female subject satisfies the desire to look and be looked at, while it shields the creator from direct regard."6 This view, a more sophisticated version of that critical rationale which reads Browning's dramatis personae as masks for his own desires, is problem- atic. Although Christ acknowledges Knoepflmacher, her perceptions seem to jar with his judgment of ironization. If Browning is in league with his male monologuists, to what extent can his project be ironic? And does he endorse the views of his male protagonists; does he really believe that the poetical character can be appropriated in this way? Christ's alliance of poet with his monologuists makes her miss the fact that the strategies of appropriation pictured in the poems are severely flawed, fail even, that the poems stage the very impossibility of appropriation. Isn't 'poetical character' something that exceeds man's grasp? Surely the ironization that Knoepflmacher remarks is most powerfully in force when Browning yokes sexuality and art, and thus emphasizes the very fabrication of male fantasy and its constituent role in a masculine myth of creativity? Although critics have spoken of Browning's obsession with the myth of Andromeda's rescue by Perseus, this story seems to me to be a reaction to a larger mythic influence and one in which the poet shows that preserva- tion by the male is not necessarily synonymous with rescue and libera- tion.7 For Browning's real compulsion is Ovid's story of Pygmalion who, disgusted by the women he sees about him, sculpts his ideal woman, and then falls hopelessly in love with the statue he has created. The goddess Venus at last takes pity on him and animates the statue so that it can become his flesh and blood bride.8 Browning lays bare the misogyny of Ovid's Pygmalion, for whom no living woman is good enough. His poems show how male subjects, threatened by woman's independent spirit, replace her with statues, pictures, prostheses, corpses, which seem to them more than acceptable substitutes for the real thing. Browning's male speakers typically invert Ovid's myth, reducing a woman, even through her death, to a composition of their own creating. They desire feminine simulacra, static art-objects, whose fixed value will reflect their self- estimation. Yet these attempts are always equivocally presented as, time and time again, Browning shows us their fatuity. We see exposed the confusion of values that allows these speakers their justifications. But not only is the error of judgment made plain; increasingly, as he explores the myth, Browning reveals how the speaker's plan goes askew. The female subject consistently eludes her captor, unmasks the poverty of his suppo- 990 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="3">sitions, or returns to haunt him. Allied spectres of memory and history cloud his presentations, while intermittent moments of vision and the recognition of the repressed disturb the reader's apprehensions. Art- objects cannot be fixed any more than human beings; contexts change them, and no artist or owner can control the divergent responses they may arouse in the viewer. Just so, Browning shows that what Christ calls "poetical character," and what I would call imaginative energy, cannot be subject to possession; can only be glimpsed, fleetingly experienced, not permanently stayed; that it is always in excess of prescription and delimi- tation. "Porphyria's Lover," one of the earliest of Browning's monologues, is an assured critique through myth, through literary revision, of a form of appropriation typified by a male speaker's narcissistic sexual mastery of a woman.9 It accumulates its power by borrowing from the Pygmalion story not once but twice. Browning's parodic "good minute" (36) centers the poem whose second half macabrely reverses the action of the first in which Porphyria appears as actor. Porphyria enters the poem as the dominant partner, the maker and doer, while her sullen lover is silent and recalcitrantly passive. She composes the scene, even choreographing his posture, in order to rouse his response, to "bring him to life" again. All this is narrated, crucially and with a certain amount of implied criticism, by the lover, whose sudden inversion of the roles and attitudes might initially be seen to be a kind of rough justice: the woman has manipulated him, now he turns the tables on her. The problem with this neat symmetry is that he has produced it, and to accept it overlooks the fact that we see Porphyria only through his eyes. His picture of her as free agent is conditioned by his subliminal resentment of her autonomy: she is a rich girl selfishly indulging a whim at a poor man's expense, Marie Antoinette playing the cottager in her spare time, a seductress, an agent provocateur. Various identifiable oppositions-male and female, active and passive, rich and poor, socialite and solitary-are manipulated by the speaker in an attempt to upset more disturbing oppositions such as aggressor and victim, life and death, art and murder. In spite of the speaker's camou- flage, the difference between himself and Porphyria is that however self- centered he may represent her behavior to be, her intent is to arouse and awaken and his is to fix and preserve. The lover's narrative impresses us with its linear recounting of events, but we need to remember the importance of reading backwards, and thus credit the speaker's retrospec- tive reading of Porphyria as his attempt to rationalize, to recast her as a reflection of himself. Porphyria's lover is a Pygmalion who thus continues Catherine Maxwell 991</page><page sequence="4">to work his designs on the body of his beloved long after he has achieved his end, not only by his projection of his desire as her "will" (53); for while she features as his dead Galatea, he makes her also a version of himself, a lesser Pygmalion. As various critics have pointed out, the name "Porphyria" recalls Keats's Porphyro in The Eve of St. Agnes. Knoepflmacher's comments on this name are particularly suggestive in their reference both to status and statuary: Porphyro's name (as well as Porphyria's) is derived from the Greek word for purple (as Keats knows when he alludes to the "purple riot" in Porphyro's heart); as such the name suggests a warm hue, as well as a high station. But the vermilion dye of porphyry is obtained by pulver- izing ("porphyrizing") a hard red shell or equally hard red slab of rock (as Keats again suggests when he describes Porphyro as a "smooth- sculptured stone," a "throbbing star," a "vermeil dyed" shield for Madeline's beauty).10 When Keats names his lover, he stresses his nobility; the youth is a gentleman, who offers true love, not "ruffian passion" (K, 149), and it is important that his love-making is the fulfillment of Madeline's own pri- vate fantasy. Porphyro is seen to awaken her from sleep into the reality she desires. Keats's Porphyro can be read as correctly interpreting and enact- ing the dream of Madeline; the lover in Browning's poem imputes Porphyria's desire as part his flawed self-justification." If the story of Pygmalion or its Miltonic Biblical parallel touches upon The Eve of St. Agnes, Keats's revision represents both man and woman as achieving their dream.'2 Both lovers, with their elaborate rites and preparations show the tendency for composition and scene-play we associate with the figure of Pygmalion. Both, too, in either the deep repose of sleep or in pale immobile trance, enact the sculptured pathos of Galatea; and if Porphyro summons Madeline from her sleep, she implores his release from his frozen posture. It's possible to see Browning's poem either as a direct challenge to Keats's romantic vision or, as Knoepflmacher suggests, a revision exaggerating those latent ambiguities in The Eve of St. Agnes which suggest that the story is less than ideal.'3 Another reading (and the most likely in my opinion) results from a combination of these two responses: Browning understands the seeming mutuality of two lovers who get what they want by playing Pygmalion to be no real mutuality. Hillis Miller indicates the strong auto-erotic element present in Ovid's account of Pygmalion's fashioning of Galatea, and to the extent that both lovers act out their fantasy without reference to the conscious desire of 992 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="5">the other, their consummation could be said to derive from auto-erotic impulses; desires coincide by happy fortuity not by what one might term true consensuality.'4 It is this paradigm of desire that I think troubled Browning, elements of which he transferred into his own de-idealizing poem. The monologuist makes the lady Porphyria seem first like the heroic well-born Porphyro when she comes to awaken her lover from his lassitude; she is also Madeline with Madeline's sexual desire writ large.'5 Both are versions of Pygmalion; both preserve the sense of an actor who sees herself as the source of animation; but both versions are ultimately narcissistic reflections of the speaker, this poem's true Pygmalion, an onanist in deed and word, who in the second part of the poem reduces his woman to sculpture, to the rosy-hued porphyry, or, within the less rose- colored connotations of the poem, a doll with a painted face thenceforth represented by a neuter pronoun: "the smiling rosy little head / So glad it has its utmostwill."''6 The final irony of this poem is the speaker's Pygmalion- like wish to see the woman he has murdered as somehow animated, perfected, achieved, one could also say "finished," through the force of the desire he has imputed to her. Remade in his image, and in his eyes reconciled to her better self (which is the self he has fixed and fashioned for her), her life-likeness promotes the suggestion that she is now, as refined essence, more alive for him than "dead," a word Browning artfully suggests is repressed in the rhyming couplet "fled/instead" (54_55).7 Browning follows up "Porphyria's Lover" with another version of Pygmalion in the verse drama Pippa Passes (1841). This time the artistic motif is more overt as he examines the relationship between the young sculptor, Jules, and Phene, an artist's model.8 Jules, a follower of Canova, becomes the jape of his fellow students who resent his supercilious airs and write him a love-letter purporting to come from the hand of Phene. A correspondence develops, the impressionable Jules falls in love and pro- poses marriage, and the students persuade Phene, the unfortunate pawn in this charade, to marry Jules on the condition that she will not speak to him until after the ceremony, then to reveal to him by means of a memorized poem the nature of the trick played upon him. During this scene, the reader cannot fail to notice the extent to which the unhappy girl, rendered speechless and thus even more statuesque, is addressed by the man in a language that situates her as art-object. Even as Jules claims that she outstrips his own artistic efforts and conceptions, that she is a "live truth" (23), the "real flesh" (82), his idealization, his total lack of real knowledge of her (represented most fully in his hypothetical pre-nuptial sculpture of her as Hippolyta), implies he regards her as a superlative work of art. Phene's affective revelation is followed by Jules's resolve to Catherine Maxwell 993</page><page sequence="6">leave her and avenge himself but, true to the structure of the drama, this decision is reversed by the song of Pippa, heard as she passes by the house. The problem is that Jules's subsequent apprehension of Phene as person, freshly animated by the vitality of her speech, is still clouded by his appropriation of her as objet d'art, and the notion of himself as creator: Look at the woman here with the new soul, Like my own Psyche,-fresh upon her lips Alit, the visionary butterfly, Waiting my word to enter and make bright, Or flutter off and leave all blank as first. (288-92) "This new soul," he declares, "is mine," (300). One version of Pygmalion and Galatea has thus given way to reveal another lurking beneath the surface. Browning shows that new-found soul, supposedly a deeper truth, is just another construct or obstruction to authentic love. Jules's (admit- tedly exquisite) verse makes Phene speak, though she departs both from his script and that of the jokers. But after Jules's conversion by Pippa's song. Phene is once more silent, a tabula rasa, awaiting Jules's shaping hand, and even her very soul is something he has bestowed or will bestow upon her. The Jules and Phene episode underlines the emphasis of "Porphyria's Lover," but it also provides a fascinating number of elements that Browning will use to very different effect in later work. It would be easy to see "My Last Duchess" as simply another elegant variation in the same vein. This poem, written some six years after the publication of "Porphyria's Lover" and a year after Pippa Passes, has obvious affiliations to both pieces, and although the chronological gap between the two shorter works seems quite large, the later poem, which makes its first appearance with "Porphyria's Lover" in Browning's first published collection of poems, may still be reckoned as one of his earliest monologues. Nonetheless there are important advances made in "My Last Duchess," which is a more complex and troubled poem than the earlier monologue. Porphyria is deprived of her voice to be ventriloquized by her lover, and although the reader perceives the devious doublings and equivocations in his speech, the speaker himself, however doomed and fragile his attempt at constructing his own identity, retains his spurious voice of mastery. To date, Browning has shown us the hollow victory of the appropriating male, but "My Last Duchess" does something much more truly dramatic. The poem stages a confrontation in which the dead returns to challenge the living, and thereby empties and renders null the gesture of appropriation. 994 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="7">I have written elsewhere of how the Duke's language is fissured and disfigured by a latent power which I identify with that of the woman he has tried to suppress.'9 The poem writes the scene of the Duke's compul- sive reviewing of a woman who disturbs him as much in her death as she did in life. As the Duchess's "looks" continue to break the boundaries of his self-definition with disrespect for his "nine-hundred-years-old name," the Duke is forced to admit that the passionate "glance," which discourses so eloquently with her beholders, has neither origin nor sanction in himself. The erosion of verbal control over meaning which signals the Duke's involuntary admission also admits the troubling presence of the Duchess. I suggest that in this revival Browning makes his elusive female subject complicit with the uncontainable power he ascribes to imagina- tive energy. As I return once more to the poem, I want to back my case for the Duchess's reanimation with specific reference to the myth of Pygmalion. If in "Porphyria's Lover" Browning refers to Ovid's myth directly, and then indirectly through his meditation on Keats's The Eve of St. Agnes, he uses a similar approach in "My Last Duchess," save that here the inter- mediary text is even clearer in its Ovidian echoes. Readers of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale can hardly fail to notice that the famous "statue scene" in which Hermione is returned to her contrite husband by Paulina borrows crucially from Ovid's narrative. Readers of Browning will be struck by the many echoes that find their way into "My Last Duchess."20 In Shakespeare's play, Leontes and others are taken by Paulina through her "gallery," which, rather like that belonging to the Duke, possesses "many singularities" (WT, 5.3.10, 12), but whose piece de resistance is said to be a statue of Leontes's deceased wife, Hermione, by the famous sculptor Julio Romano which is kept concealed behind a curtain.2' Here are Paulina's words at the moment when she unveils the statue: As she lived peerless, So her dead likeness I do well believe Excels what ever yet you looked upon, Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare To see the life as lively mocked as ever Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say 'tis well. She draws a curtain and reveals the figure of Hermione, standing like a statue I like your silence; it the more shows off Your wonder. But yet speak. (WT, 5.3.14-22)22 Catherine Maxwell 995</page><page sequence="8">Leontes is moved by the resemblance to cry: 0, thus she stood, Even with such life of majesty-warm life, As now it coldly stands-when first I wooed her. I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it? (WT, 5.3.34-38) Browning's recall of both -Shakespeare and Ovid is illustrated in his ingeniously layered recasting of the myth. The Duke replaces Paulina, Shakespeare's parodic Pygmalion. The actual painting of the Duchess is, of course, the handiwork of the artist Fra" Pandolf, but, in his equation of the woman with her portrait, it is the Duke who plays Pygmalion in this drama. As in "Porphyria's Lover," the action seems at first to invert the myth: the woman may be read as reduced to her likeness. The portrait, made while the sitter lived, now after her death takes on the symbolic status of mortal remains, a secret memorial curtained off for private view like a wife in purdah. It is in this guise that the work can be said to be of the Duke's execution. At one level, as Lionel Stevenson has pointed out, Browning's revision "ironically controvert[si" Shakespeare's play: it is the widowed husband, the Duke, who apparently unmoved, unveils an image and a history which seem to betoken death rather than life.23 Yet the Duke is but "apparently unmoved." In actuality, he is moved not by pathos but the anxiety of experiencing the shifting grounds of his identity. The moments when he directly refers to the portrait show a confusion between the once-living woman and her painted image, yet this confusion is also one of the means by which he lets the Duchess revive. The Duke is Pygmalion in that he animates the portrait. Porphyria's lover tried the strategy of animator in his conclusion, but it was just a strategy and thus a failure. The difference with the Duke is that Browning plays the joke against him; this animation is unwilled and, as such, is the revenge of Galatea. Echoes from the hidden script of The Winter's Tale and the vivification of Hermione thus function not only ironically but in complicity with the more cryptic maneuvers of the poem. Shakespeare gives the role of Pygmalion primarily to Paulina, who first "creates" the statue, and then, acting as Venus, animates it when she sees the penitent longing of Leontes. By placing the power of reanimation in the hands of Paulina and Hermione, Shakespeare revises the misogyny of the Pygmalion myth. The women reassert their own image and significance and so, too, does Browning's Duchess; for while she owes her revival to the Duke, she 996 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="9">effectively steals his show. In The Winter's Tale, the wonder of the onlookers is provoked by the blurring of verisimilar art with vital reality. While Browning indicates the dehumanizing potential of such a combina- tion, he is also able to invert, as Shakespeare does, the banal tendency to objectify, and thus contrives a movement from the mere mimicry of art to something altogether more troubling. In the following exchange with Paulina and Polixenes, Leontes is agonized by the signs of life that disturb the portrayal of his wife: Paul. No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy May think anon it moves. Leon. Let be, let be! Would I were dead but that methinks already. What was he that did make it? See, my lord, Would you not deem it breathed, and that those veins Did verily bear blood? Pol. Masterly done. The very life seems warm upon her lip. Leon. The fixture of her eye has motion in't, As we are mocked with art. (WT, 5.3.60-67) These voiced tributes to a perplexing vitalism can be heard echoing through "My Last Duchess," where they discompose the Duke's facility. This mocking by art of the boundaries of life and death confounds the strategist who would confuse them for his own shallow purposes. The blush, supposedly a sign of animation, is horribly faked by Porphyria's lover, but the Duchess's spot of joy, unelicited by the Duke, reverses the power relation. Although painted, the spot defies the Duke's control or suppression, betokening an uncanny animation. As with Hermione, in the Duchess's "dead likeness" we see "life as lively mocked as ever / Still sleep mocked death."24 The Duchess's return, her intrusion on and distortion of the space of her husband's self-justification makes him into a mockery of his very self. As we move into Browning's most famous single volume, Men and Women (1855), the poet continues to innovate upon the image of Pygmalion. "Women and Roses," which I cited in my opening, is Browning's magnificent rewrite of the meditation on the aesthetic object we find in Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and "Ode on Indolence." The poet- speaker in Keat's "Grecian Urn" is teased and thwarted by the cool impenetrability of the urn which he characterizes as an icy-hearted vir- Catherine Maxwell 997</page><page sequence="10">gin-a "still unravished bride of quietness." The frozen scenes on the urn both attract and repel the viewer who is unable to effect the complete imaginative entry he desires. The "Ode on Indolence" presents a dream in which three female figures "like figures on a marble urn" (K, 5) circle about three times "as when the urn once more / Is shifted round" (K, 7-8), and the speaker subsequently identifies the figures as Love, Ambition, and Poesy-figures he eventually dismisses. In Browning's "Women and Roses," the speaker dreams of a red-rose tree around which circle three groups of women representing women of the past, the present, and the future. Each of these groups corresponds to one of the three roses on the rose-tree, but all three groups resist the poet speaker's attempt to arrest them. The speaker's address to these different women fuses amorous expression with that of the would-be artist who wishes to capture the moment forever: How shall I fix you, fire you, freeze you, Break my heart at your feet to please you? Oh, to possess and be possessed! (18-20) When the thwarted speaker at last turns to contemplate the "Beauties yet unborn," for a moment he believes that through his artistry he can himself create the feminine models that will dominate the future. The motif of Pygmalion is recast in the image of the Christian God who creates the first woman: What shall arrive with the cycle's change? A novel grace and a beauty strange. I will make an Eve, be the artist that began her, Shaped her to his mind! (44-48) However, this desire, like the speaker's previous desires, is also blocked by the realization that these women, once created, cannot be stayed or controlled even by their creator: -Alas! in like manner They circle their rose on my rose-tree (48-49) Again, in this poem, the combined figure of woman with art conveys the elusiveness of what a male speaker vainly struggles to control and master. The great monologue "Andrea del Sarto" recasts the language of "My 998 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="11">Last Duchess." The painter, who seems so much more sympathetic a character than the Duke, has recourse to essentially the same ideas of encapsulating the feminine. He is unable to master his wife Lucrezia who, far from being contained, is a free agent, at liberty to take other lovers. Her implied promiscuity is made one with the freedom of her looks: My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, Which everybody looks on and calls his, And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, While she looks-no-one's: very dear, no less. You smile? why, there's my picture read made (29-33) In spite of what is presented as his beguilingly indulgent affection for her, there is no doubt that the painter holds his wife responsible for his artistic failure. She has not provided him with the "soul" (118) or "mind" (126) necessary for his inspiration. Her freedom, her defection from the enclosure of his work-room, has condemned him both to mediocrity and a lonely confinement "inside the melancholy little house" (212). Blind affection is pitted against single-minded genius. Appealingly tender though he seems, Andrea's rationalization of his unachieved success has its roots in a version of Pygmalion. Lucrezia is no epipsyche. Because she does not submit to his project, provide the reflection necessary to his self-determi- nation, Andrea sees his work as lacking colour and verve: "A common greyness silvers everything,- / All in a twilight you and I alike" (35-36). At the same time, his famous credo of inspiration that "a man's reach should exceed his grasp" and his understanding that his technical skill is not matched by inventiveness does not fully cohere with this reckoning of his wife's ideal role. Andrea's under-achievement is rehearsed in one of Browning's most acclaimed monologues. It seems that out of the striving to account for what animates conception, invigorates looking, and out of the failure to capture that which tantalizes, slips, eludes, exceeds, is born the strongest poetry; it is not only that Browning declares this failure in his poems, but that this "failure" becomes a way of presenting the imagination in its elusiveness, as he reaches and cannot grasp it. What we glimpse in his poems is that which eludes the speaker. The poet makes the site of this failure into the ground of the appearance and vanishing, the drama, of the imagination. As Browning strategizes these scenes, as he modifies the myth of Pygmalion, he begins to effect an inversion which allows him to stage more directly the feminine subjects who express the uncontainable power of the imagination. He begins this innovation most forcibly in Catherine Maxwell 999</page><page sequence="12">Dramatis Personx (1864), the first collection published after his wife's death in June 1861. "James Lee's Wife" is the monologue of a female speaker, and as such is cited by Knoepflmacher as the culmination in Browning's critique of male-female relations.25 In the ninth section of the poem, the speaker, alienated from a husband who has tired of her, understands that only by evading him can she ever hope to force him to grasp her true import. Her removal may cause James Lee to re- imagine-and re-image his own selfhood; only then will he be able to take the next step and recognize his wife's image as a speculary analogue or epipsyche of himself.26 Knoepflmacher then cites the following lines: Strange, if a face, when you thought of me, Rose like your own face present now, With eyes as dear in their dear degree, Much such a mouth, and as bright a brow, Till you saw yourself, while you cried "Tis she!" (353-57) When he quotes the poem's conclusion, however, Knoepflmacher makes no direct comment on its radical aggression in which the specular lan- guage a man traditionally uses to describe his female epipsyche is vio- lently revised by the woman. Although apparently self-deprecating, the woman turns her husband into a version of herself, and the theme of appropriation signaled in yet another of Browning's "possessive" poem titles undergoes the strangest metamorphosis: Why, fade you might to a thing like me, And your hair grow to these coarse hanks of hair, Your skin, this bark of a gnarled tree,- You might turn myselfl-should I know or care When I should be dead of joy, James Lee? (368-72)27 This theme of the man turning woman has already been launched in, of all places, Jules's first speech to Phene in PippaPasses: "Nay, look ever / This one way till I change, grow you-I could / Change into you, beloved!" (2.8-10). Mixed in with the appropriative language of Pygmalion, a lan- guage devoid of any real acknowledgment of the woman's self, Jules's protestation carries no real challenge for its speaker. But in "James Lee's Wife," the sentiment is not a man's idealizing, but a woman's attempt to convert and disfigure a man who has deprived her of identity. 1000 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="13">The same theme reoccurs more forcibly in an often overlooked lyric included in the second edition of Dramatis Personx in 1868. "Eurydice to Orpheus" was written to accompany Frederic Leighton's painting in the Royal Academy exhibition in 1864. Leighton, and Browning after him, follow a variant of the Orpheus legend invented by Gluck and his librettist Calzabigi for the opera Orfeo ed Euridice (1762).28 In Ovid's account, Orpheus is allowed to retrieve his wife from Hades on the condition that he does not turn to look at her as they make their long return to the world. However, Gluck includes the detail that not only is Orpheus not allowed to look, but that he is not allowed to tell Eurydice why he won't. Eurydice is naturally distressed by Orpheus's refusal to look at her, and it is on her insistence that he eventually looks round and thus forfeits her once more. Browning repeats the desire of Gluck's Euridice for "un sguardo solo [a single look]," but with the difference that his Eurydice seems to have an instinctive understanding that what she asks for may cancel out her redemption from the Underworld. Yet still she asks-her argument being that the moment of the look transcends the penalty it may incur. One look now Will lap me round for ever, not to pass Out of its light, though darkness lie beyond: Hold me but safe again within the bond Of one immortal look! (2-6) Again it is the woman who speaks in her own voice, and again, in spite of the logic of the myth, it is her triumph. Although the lyric has a pictorial origin, picture is unformed and disintegrated in Eurydice's speech. "My Last Duchess" launched a process of subtle disfiguration whereby the man is compromised by a woman; the lyric accelerates this process. Its curiously ambivalent language implies the defacement of Orpheus; it is he that disappears and not Eurydice: But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the brow! Let them once more absorb me! (1-2) The listed features are dislocated, form no definite portrait, and sound at the same time personal and impersonal; lacking possessive pronouns, they could be attributed either to Eurydice or Orpheus. As Eurydice's, they might be the features she had in the world before she became a shade and which Orpheus has the power to restore by his reclaiming look of acknowledgment.But they can also be the features of Orpheus, his Catherine Maxwell 1001</page><page sequence="14">familiar look, from which Eurydice has been separated during her stay in the underworld, and which she now wants. But wants for what reason? To behold him? For him to see her? Is she to be reconstituted by his look or does she demand his features for her own self-recovery? How much Browning lets saturate into that word "absorb," meaning entrance, fasci- nate, demand the whole attention of, as well as subsume and engulf. Thus Eurydice may want not merely to study her husband's features, but to be wholly engaged by them, mentally and physically, as if her essence should blend into and combine with them. And in this process, Orpheus' dislo- cated features are given to his wife, become no longer his. Absorbing Eurydice necessitates Orpheus' own disfiguration. The more orthodox telling of the Orpheus-Eurydice myth makes the male poet-singer the active role and gives Eurydice a passive dependency. Browning reverses these roles, and it is Eurydice who becomes the lyric speaker. What does this erasure and disfiguration of Orpheus portend? Does Browning's lyric anticipate the later dismemberment and decolla- tion of Orpheus, torn apart by women who resent his apparent mi- sogyny.29 In a simple sense it might be viewed as the resolving correction of the Pygmalion theme that has been developing throughout Browning's work; the female victim, first suffering and then subversive, finally tri- umphs in her own voice.30 The Pygmalion narrative occurs as an episode in the Ovidian Song of Orpheus-poetry's Song of Songs, but also the song that identifies poetry with a masculine point of view.31 The violent revenge of the Ciconian women, so abhorred by Ovid, could be seen as an inevitable response, and Browning's lyric, involving the subtle incorpora- tion of this violence into Eurydice's petition, a feminist revision of both classical and operatic myth. Browning could also be seen to propose or create a male epipsyche for his female speaker, who then appears to be engulfed by her just as countless feminine figures have been by male speakers. Certainly the language and style of the poem suggest a revision of Shelley's early narcissistic and epipsychic sonnet "To -" (1814/15), with its opening line "Yet look on me-take not thine eyes away" (as well as Phene's humble honorific to Jules: "You creature with the eyes! / If I could look for ever up to them.... Keep me so, / above the world" [129- 40]).32 But is the symmetry that simple, and what does Browning intend by this feminine subsumption? The figure of woman and particularly the charged focus of her face thus seems to be identified in poems with the imagination, appearing not as a trite and conventional muse, but as a power that cannot be appropri- ated, a power which can, nonetheless, exceed, subvert, and break bound- aries. It is projected as that which could overwhelm the rigidities of 1002 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="15">"masculine" identity, and even reconstruct it. Eurydice, like the Duchess, coalesces with the poet's own imaginative power, and the poetry pictures to the reader the imagination as it traverses the poem. Browning's repre- sentations of women are not attempts to embody "female consciousness" or stage "feminine experience," any more than one would expect his men to represent "male experience." Having said that, of course, the poet is beautifully observant of the ruses, strategies, and assumptions that con- tribute to the complexity of sexual politics, but these are given a poetic significance and become part of the symbolic fabric of the poem. Swinburne was right when he "denie[d] Browning the skill of impersonating a true woman," because I do not think impersonation and experiential truth was Browning's primary concern: "How does it fare with his Colombes, Constances, Mildreds, Phenes, who are visibly fleshless and senseless?"33 To lack visible flesh and sense is proper when these phantasmal female forms upset regular pictorial and representational coordinates as some- thing so peculiarly elusive and something so potentially disruptive; imagi- native energy conceived as femininity exceeds and disturbs the strictures of more orthodox protocols conceived as masculinity: the artist Pygmalion is out-maneuvered by Galatea, the poet Orpheus is rendered speechless by Eurydice. Even when creativity is imaged as masculine appropriation, as in this extract from the "Parleying with Charles Avision," that control may be absorbed or blurred by an effect that shifts concentration from creator to creation and to the fortuities of pathos in the looks of the women represented: Give momentary feeling permanence, So that thy capture hold, a century hence, Truth's very heart of truth as, safe today, The Painter's Eve, the Poet's Helena, Still rapturously bend, afar still throw The wistful gaze! (243-48) I would suggest that the tendency to represent woman as vitally disfiguring poetic energy, a conception subliminally present as far back as "My Last Duchess," becomes fully operative in Browning's later work. In this we may speculate that the death of Elizabeth Barrett played some considerable part. Dramatis Personae (1864) is a volume as much touched by the death of Elizabeth Barrett as is Hardy's "Poems of 1912-13" touched by the death of his wife, and its contents are subsequently marked with loss and bereavement. Knoepflmacher tells us that "Barrett ... furnished Browning with a further link to the Romantic idealization of Cathertine Maxwell 1003</page><page sequence="16">a female complement who might restore an incomplete male self."34 But if, after her death, Browning dwells upon the return of the woman who called him "my Orpheus," this works out in the poetry as something more extraordinary than Knoepflmacher's formula would imply; it is as if Brown- ing comes to identify her with poetry itself, imagines himself as absorbed into her and thereby partially erased.35 Whether this is an extension of Browning's self-effacing respect for his wife's work, as shown both during her life and after, the guilt of the survivor, a form of the introjection or incorporation that characterize mourning and melancholia, or a combina- tion of all or part of these, is not my quarry here, though it seems necessary to indicate how force of circumstance could accentuate or catalyze a tendency already present in the writer's work.36 Carol Christ has made the interesting comment: "A feminized lyric, associated with his dead wife, comes to take the place of Shelley in his poetry as the unreachable and unspeakable ideal before which he claims his own poetic space."37 Browning's "Eurydice to Orpheus" is, as I have indicated, a Shelleyan lyric which owes some of its inspiration to Eliza- beth Barrett's death. But Christ also makes the claim that, "Browning's absorption of the lyric within the dramatic effectively contains the femi- nine." Yet Browning does write straight lyrics-"Eurydice to Orpheus" included-and it is debatable whether the feminine-identified lyric mo- ments one encounters in the dramatic verse are contained; rather they appear to arrest attention only to displace themselves and disrupt narra- tive continuity; produce the uncanny; modify the nature of the dramatic, deregulating notions of coherent persona and personality. Browning himself thought "Beatrice Signorini" the best poem of his last volume, Asolando: Facts and Fancies (1889). This neglected but fascinating poem is a satirical comedy of sexual manners. Notable for its delineation of woman as artist, it may also be regarded as Browning's last use of the Pygmalion motif. In this poem, Browning maps the tensions which arise for a male protagonist when he deliberates between wife and mistress, a theme central to the earlier Fiflne at the Fair (1872). Art, in particular painting, is subjoined to the plot, for not only is the male protagonist, Francesco, a painter (and, it would seem, a decidedly medio- cre one), but his mistress, Artemisia, is a painter too, and one whose skills far exceed those of her lover.38 Browning's mischievous treatment of Francesco's internal debate is an ironic variant on the old King's notorious apportioning of sex roles in Tennyson's The Princess (1842): Man for the field and woman for the hearth: Man for the sword and for the needle she: 1004 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="17">Man with the head and woman with the heart: Man to command and woman to obey; All else confusion. (The Princess, 5.437-41)39 This domestic pietism is translated with a comic and cynically realist tone into Francesco's understanding of sexual division: Man boasts mind: Woman, man's sport calls mistress, to the same Does body's suit and service. (135-37) Francesco, whom the narrator calls sardonically "Our true male estima- tor," reflects anxiously on the possibility of submitting himself to Artemi- sia: If I crouch under proudly, lord turned slave, Were it not worthier both than if she gave Herself-in treason to herself-to me? (86-88) The narrator then mocks the ratiocination that ensues when Francesco considers this espousal of what would be more conventionally "the woman's part."40 And, all the while, he felt it could not be. Such love were true love: love that way who can! Someone that's born half woman not whole man: For man, prescribed man better or man worse, Why, whether microcosm or universe, What law prevails alike through great and small, The world and man-world's miniature we call? Man is the master. (89-96)41 When Francesco and Artemisia end their affair, she dispatches him back to Viterbo, and marriage, with a gift intended for his wife, but properly a challenge to Francesco himself: She twitched aside a veiling cloth. "Here is my keepsake-frame and picture both: For see, the frame is all of flowers festooned About an empty space,-left thus, to wound No natural susceptibility: How can I guess? 'Tis you must fill, not I, Catherine Maxwell 1005</page><page sequence="18">The central space with-her whom you like best! That is your business, mine has been the rest. But judge!" (162-70) In this teasing gesture, Artemisia shows she recognizes the limited terms of Francesco's sexual consciousness and the male desire for appropria- tion. Her request for Francesco to become Pygmalion seems to be as much a mocking framing of him as is the flowery border she has painted for the canvas.42 Overwhelmed with sudden passion for Atemisia, Francesco bids her turn model and produces a masterpiece-which we never see clearly but of whose "perfection" we are, perhaps ironically, assured: "That face was worthy of its frame, 'tis said-/ Perfect, suppose!" (244-45).43 The couple then part never to meet again. But the portrait resurfaces later, once more as challenge, this time to the woman Francesco patronizes as "my placid Beatrice-wife." Set upon the "whim" of confronting Beatrice with her rival's portrait, Francesco stages a second unveiling, and one might note that, unlike Artemisia's parodic gesture, this is an unveiling which the narrator hints is that of the onanistic connoisseur: He drew aside The veil, displayed the flower-framed portrait kept For private delectation. (291-93) This reminiscence of the Duke and the autoeroticism of Pygmalion is then violently assaulted by another challenger. Beatrice's unanticipated reaction is first to evaluate the flower-frame, and then "disengage" (303) it from the picture, in sum to cut the actual portrait to shreds with a dagger- like hair ornament-"woe to all inside the coronal!" (310). The effect this has on her surprised husband is to increase both his love and estimation of her; the marriage continues enriched and happy, and the narrator decides magnanimously that maybe Francesco wasn't such a mediocre painter after all. The reader is left wondering over this strange passage of events: does Browning tame the poem and deprive it of its more radical aspects? It seems at first that Francesco gets off lightly as the clash is between the two female rivals with the image of the mistress being symbolically stabbed and disfigured: Stab followed stab,-cut, slash, she ruined all The masterpiece. Alack for eyes and mouth 1006 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="19">The dimples and endearment-North and South, East, West, the tatters in a fury flew: There yawned the circlet. (311-15) And yet it is Artemisia's work, her frame, her original gift to Beatrice, that is left unscathed, and Francesco's fantasy that is destroyed. What is damaged, as the mastery contained in the "masterpiece" is abruptly emptied out, is not the woman but the epipsychic ideal created to gratify masculine voyeurism and corroborate Francesco's anxious male identity.'4 Artemisia starts and Beatrice finishes a process that implicates and ex- poses Francesco as Pygmalion. The disfiguration of the portrait is thus, in principle, a shift from ideal to reality, and as such represents the necessary disfiguration of Francesco himself; it demands a volte face, the need to face up and address neglected issues, to turn and see Beatrice as she really is-which is what in fact she seems to be demanding: "look at me; look at me again."' Browning's naming of the poem after Beatrice herself reem- phasizes this new focus. Browning is not so innocent as to suggest a complete transformation. There are a few equivocal notes. Francesco's words of acclamation, like those of Jules, still derive in part from the language of the artist, and it is hard to tell whether this is a redemption of that language or a residue of the former attitude. To Beatrice, who is shown "with mien defiant" of death (or worse), and yet "Passively statuesque" (317, 319), Francesco declares: Then you ever were, still are, And henceforth shall be-no occulted star But my resplendent Bice, sun-revealed, Full rondure! Woman-glory unconcealed, So front me. (324-28) Beatrice is not condemned to be locked up (or "kept for private delecta- tion"), but in calling her "full rondure" or 'Woman-glory," is this a correction or simple evocation of the painting's rondure and Francesco's tentative question to Artemisia: "This glory-guarded middle space-is mine? / For me to fill?" (211-12). While Browning leaves us pondering the blurrings of these words, we can see that Francesco, for all his faults and lack of delicacy, is a far more interesting character than Jules in that he has a self-questioning faculty and some sense of his own limitations. The conclusion may be less than perfect-perhaps because Browning is Cathertine Maxwell 1007</page><page sequence="20">sceptical about perfection in earthly relations-but Francesco's change of heart is certainly an advance on Jules's alarmingly empty conversion. Moreover, as in The Winter's Tale, the women are responsible for the turn of events and the control of their own identity. Beatrice's disfiguration of the portrait marks her own transformation: the demure wife becomes critic, surprises her husband with her unforseen interpretive skills, and avenges herself in an act of violence. Artemisia's gift to her communicates a cryptic message that indicts Francesco. Browning hints at the partner- ship involved in the shared framing and disfiguration of Francesco as Pygmalion, Beatrice's vandalization of her husband's work preserves Artemisia's flower-frame and "restores" its central space. She abuses Francesco's ideal image of Artemisia as a "serpent" (306), but immedi- ately afterwards Browning describes her own hair with a serpentine metaphor-"coils / On coils" (306-7)-which suggests he sees a co- identity. After all, both women outstrip the idealizing flower-imagery satirically offered by Artemisia to Francesco.46 Furthermore, Beatrice's laceration of the portrait, whose unveiling she rightly regards as an act of sexual threat and aggression, uncannily makes her an archetypal Gentileschi heroine. The historical Artemisia's most famous painting is the superb Judith beheading Holofernes in the Uffizi, in which two women, Judith and her maidservant, mercilessly decapitate her would-be rapist.47 The extreme violence of Beatrice's reaction is Browning's own invention; it represents the uncontainable energy he associates with the feminine, and with the imagination that destroys the "masculine" striving for possession, capture, and completion. This article has argued that Browning examines creativity through a shrewdly observed dialectic of masculine and feminine types. Not only does feminine imaginative energy elude Browning's male speakers, but it splits and disfigures them. However, this gendered critique dramatizes a larger process that is at work in all of his attempts at portraiture where human identity is made up, as Pater claimed it was, of a perpetual weaving and unweaving of the self, and creativity is characterized by a continuing process of construction and dissolution.48 One, if not the primary plea- sure, of reading Browning is our sensation of a release of energy when the speaker disfigures; when an apparently solid core of identity is broken and begins to dissolve and evaporate. For this very moment of loss is also a moment of creation: in the gap or fissure, we glimpse the forces that underlie portraiture and which give it its appeal. In the time and space of the portrait, there is also the space of a radical decomposition vitally integral to the total picture. Again and again Browning's portraits radiate energy, but that illumination is not the high finish of a coherent speaking 1008 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="21">likeness, but the flash of brilliant disfiguration which momentarily irradi- ates the shifting imaginative terrain that grounds composition.

I use throughout the Loeb edition with English translation by Frank Justus Miller, 2 vols. (London and Cambridge: William Heinemann and Harvard Univ. Press, 1916). Ovid does not name Pygmalion's bride; later writers call her Galatea. J. Hillis Miller's recent study of the Pygmalion story as it impinges on various nineteenth-century novels has an excellent Proem "Pygmalion's Prosopopoeia"'-con- taining a detailed discussion of Ovid's myth. Miller writes: "For Pygmalion, the other is not really other. Pygmalion has himself made Galatea. She is the mirror image of his desire. . . . It is as if Narcissus' reflection in the pool had come alive and could return his love." Versions of Pygmnlion (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1990), 4-5. 9 "Porphyria's Lover" was first published as "Porphyria" with "Johannes Agricola" in the Monthly Repository for January 1836, and both were reprinted with slight revisions under the general title "Madhouse Cells" in the Dramatic Lyrics of 1842. A generative kernel for "Porphyria's Lover" can be found in Browning's earliest published work, Pauline (1833), where we encounter the image of the sculptor Pygmalion and the murderer-creator who imputes his own desire to his mistress (896-902). It seems likely that Browning, embar- rassed by what he later regarded as the ingenuous self-exposure of that piece, then reflected critically upon some of the postures and impostures struck by its speaker. For the 1833 text, see The Poetical Works of Robert Browning, ed. Ian Jack, 4 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983-1991), 1:96. '0 Knoepflmacher (note 2), 151. Knoepflmacher's article makes some important connec- tions between the two poems. The link was first recognized by Alice Chandler in "'The Eve of St. Agnes' and 'Porphyria's Lover,"' Victorian Poetry 3 (1965): 272-74. While Michael Mason pointed out near sources for the poem in Bryan Proctor's Marcian Colonna and Blackwood's Magazine, these seem less important to me than Browning's examination of myth and his determining revision of a great precursor in Keats. See Michael Mason, "Browning and the Dramatic Monologue" in Writers and their Background: Robert Browning, ed. Isobel Armstrong (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1974), 231-66. For Keats's poems, I use throughout The Poems ofJohn Keats, ed. Miriam Allott (London: Longman, 1970). Line numbers are included parenthetically in text and abbreviated K. The passages cited by Knoepflmacher come from "The Eve of St. Agnes," 297, 318, 336. 11 Various literary critics have seen Porphyro's behavior in a more equivocal light: Catherine Maxwell 1009</page><page sequence="22">Knoepflmacher, following Jack Stillinger, writes of "the hoodwinked Madeline" ([note 2], 146) and claims that "Porphyro played on Madeline's wishful and childish trust" (152). The problem with such a view is that it casts Madeline, stereotypically, as a wronged woman, and discounts the force of her own desire. If Madeline herself has recourse to the stereotype in stanza 37, it is because she momentarily fears that Porphyro will abandon her. Stillinger's seminal article saw Madeline not only as "hoodwinked," but "self-hoodwinked"- the gull of her own superstition. Space forbids discussion of Stillinger's essay with its curious description of Madeline's condition as "pitiful yet, ... reprehensible," but one wonders if the author is not unduly disturbed by the heroine's desire. See the revised form of the essay in Jack Stillinger, "Skepticism in The Eve of St. Agnes," in The Hoodwinking of Madeline and Other Essays on Keats's Poems (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1971), 67-93; 84, 86. Marjorie Levinson refers more frankly to Madeline's "masturbatory dreaming" in her Keats's Life of Allegory (Basil Blackwell: Oxford, 1988), 111. My own ensuing com- ments on Keats's poem in relation to Browning's try to indicate a difficulty present in the picturing of both lovers' desires. 12 The Biblical and Ovidian parallel evokes spontaneously Keats's pronouncement in his letter to Benjamin Bailey (22 November 1817) that: "The Imagination may be compared to Adam's dream-he awoke and found it truth." The Letters of John Keats 1814-1821, ed. Hyder E. Rollins, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1958), 1:185. One does not necessarily have to be what Stillinger ([note 11], 69-70) calls a "metaphysical" critic of the poem to see Porphyro and Madeline playing-turn and turn about-the Adam and the Eve of St. Agnes. See also Adam's dream in Milton's Paradise Lost 8.452-90. 13 These are, variously, depending on one's critical stance: Porphyro as voyeur and ravisher, Madeline as superstitious gull or overly voluptuous virgin, the storm, negative imagery, Keats's jokiness and parody. 14 For references to Pygmalion as onanist, see Miller (note 8), 6, 8, 10. 5 Knoepflmacher indicates the influence of various of Coleridge's poems on "Porphyria's Lover" ([note 2], 152), but doesn't cite the one that had the most determinable effect on Keats's poem-"Christabel." The erotic content of "Christabel" is admittedly blurred, but "The Eve of St. Agnes" picks up on the theme of a night-time visitation and tryst in a Gothic pile, and the strange fusion of nightmare with the reality of a possible sexual violation is transmuted by Keats into the more acceptable seduction as realized dream. "Porphyria's Lover," lifting the storm from the end of "St. Agnes" to its own beginning, reinstates the theme of sexual violence: Porphyria is the last in a line of blue-eyed maidens, not as saintly as Christabel, nor as ambiguously fortunate as Madeline. 16 Incidentally we might notice Browning's dark-humored reference to Ovid's text when he mentions the blush induced on the dead woman's cheek. In Metanorphoses 10, when the ivory statue becomes mortal, we are told she blushes at Pygmalion's kiss: "dataque oscula virgo/sensit et erubuit [The maiden felt the kisses and blushed]" (292-93). This blush seems significant in the light of the fact that Pygmalion abjures women because of the behavior of the Propoetides, who become so accustomed to a life of shame they lose the power to blush "sanguisque induruit oris [the blood of their faces hardened]" (241), and are eventually turned to stone by Venus. Pygmalion's successful animation of his ideal is, of course, a reversal of this petrification. At the same time, as Alice Chandler (note 10) has pointed out (273), Browning also makes contact with Keats through the image of the "rosy little head" and "the shut bud that holds a bee," which remind one of Keats's (possibly sceptical) remarks on Madeline, who falls blissfully into her St. Agnes' Eve dream-fantasy "blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, / As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again" (242-43). If Keats is sceptical, Browning's evocation of this line in the context of death is emphatically so. "7 Miller's comments on Ovid's story are pertinent ([note 8], 7): It "embodies a male 1010 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="23">fantasy whereby a woman cannot be the object of sexual desire and cannot desire in return unless she has been made so by male effort." Commenting on Ovid's use of the phrase "ars adeo latet arte sua" (252)-so cleverly did his art conceal his art-Miller writes: "Pygmalion is so skillful an artist, skilled even in concealing his art from himself, that he is taken in by his own fabrication: it seems to him that Galatea must be a real girl" (9). This self-delusion is that also practiced by the lover in Browning's poem. 18 The Jules and Phene episode is heralded at the end of "Part I: Morning' of Pippa Passes, and is developed in "Part II: Noon." All references are to Part II. 19 Catherine Maxwell, "Not the Whole Picture: Browning's 'unconquerable shade,"' Word &amp; Image 8 (1992): 322-32. 20 The only reference I have found to the play in Browning criticism is an essay on sources in Victorian poetry entitled "The Pertinacious Victorian Poets" by L. C. Stevenson in Victorian Literature: Modern Essays in Criticism, ed. Austin Wright (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1960), 16-31; 26-27. The essay, slightly revised from its original publication in 1952, makes thematic links between play and poem, but does not cover the shared Ovidian source. 21 All Shakespearean references are to William Shakespeare: The Complete Works, ed. Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986). References to The Winter's Tale are included parenthetically in text and abbreviated WT. 22 Ian Jack has posited that "My Last Duchess" echoes a moment in Tennyson's "The Gardener's Daughter; or, The Pictures" (1842), in which the elderly speaker tells his auditors to view a picture of his dead lover: "Raise thy soul; / Make thine heart ready with thine eyes: the time / Is come to raise the veil. Behold her there, / As I beheld her ere she knew my heart." The Poems of Tennyson, 2nd ed., ed. Christopher Ricks, 3 vols. (London: Longman, 1987), 1:267-70. See Ian Jack, Browning's Major Poetry (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), 92-93. It seems to me that while Browning's poem may take in this reminis- cence of Tennyson's, both derive ultimately from Shakespeare's play. 23 Instead of the penitence of Leontes, Browning seems to substitute the frantic mania of that other jealous husband Othello, hidden under the mannered tones of the Duke's speech. The Duke's repetition of the word "smile" reminds me of Othello's cruelly derisive reiteration of "turn" when he rebukes his wife in front of the scandalized Lodvico (Othello, 4.1.250-61). Other fragments of Othello's speech, such as "sir" and "command," find their way into Browning's poem, and the seminal phrase "O well painted passion!" bears a distinct fruit when it becomes "the depth and passion" seen in the "pictured countenance." 24 The word "mocked" here carries the primary sense of "imitated," but it seems also to have the connotation of "made a nonsense of," "ironized" or "parodied." 25 Knoepflmacher (note 2), 139-41. 26 Knoepflmacher, 140. 27 Cited in Knoepflmacher, 139. Browning originally called the poem "James Lee." 28 A fuller account of the background to this poem can be found in my "Robert Browning and Frederic Leighton: 'Che far6 senza Euridice?'," forthcoming in The Review of English Studies 44 (1993). For the myth, see Ovid Metamorphoses 10.1-77. 29 Metamorphoses 11.1-43. For Orpheus' misogyny, see Metamorphoses 10.78-85. Orpheus, after the death of Eurydice, is said to have shunned women and turned his attention to boys. Ovid, who tends to take the male part, trivializes the reaction of the Ciconian women, and sees their revenge only as an outrage. There is evidence to support the idea that orphism was a predominantly misogynist cult. 30 One might note that the power relations inherent in the question of who speaks and who is deprived of voice are central to Browning, although resolving this question (as in "My Last Duchess") requires more than just a simple face reading. 31 The Ovidian narrative, the Song of Orpheus (Metamorphoses 10.148-739), which Catherine Maxwell 1011</page><page sequence="24">contains the story of Pygmalion, is indulgent towards its male and censorious of its female characters. 32 Shelley: Poetical Works, ed.

(14 Sept. 1846), in Kintner (note 35), 2:1073. 41 From the published version of The Princess, Tennyson omitted these disparaging lines: "if there be / Men-women, let them marry women-men / And make a proper marriage." Ricks (note 22), 2:290. 42 The image occurs also in the epigraph to Jocoseria (1883): "-Where is the blot? / Beamy the world, yet a blank all the same, / -Framework which waits for a picture to frame: / What of the leafage, what of the flower? / Roses embowering with naught they embower! / Come then, complete incompletion, 0 comer, / Pant through the blueness, perfect the summer!" (4-10). 43 In a rare article on the poem, John G. Rudy sees Francesco's preoccupation with artistic perfection as a substitute for a genuine relationship with a woman who is his superior: "He endeavours to capture her in his art and to hold her beauty in an eternal stasis divorced from earthly love and morality... [He] hopes to acquire through art what he cannot have in life." See "Browning's 'Beatrice Signorini' and the Problems of AEsthetic Aspiration," in Browning Society Notes 7 (1977): 89. 1012 Browning's Pygmalion</page><page sequence="25">44 Rudy corroborates: "Beatrice, in preserving the flowers round the portrait, is not necessarily attacking art, nor even Artemisia. Rather, Beatrice is destroying perhaps unconsciously, her husband's delusion of perfection in the portrait" ([note 43], 91). 45 "Poetics," another poem from Asolando, is, in the tradition of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130, a denial of empty poeticisms in favor of the beloved's reality: "Be the moon the moon: my Love I place beside it: / What is she? Her human self,-no lower word will serve" (7-8). 46 In swapping an innocuous femininity for something more canny and redoubtable, Browning may recall Lady Macbeth's words: "Look like the innocent flower, / But be the serpent under't" (Macbeth, 1.5.64-65). 47 For an illustration, see Germaine Greer, The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and their Work (London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1979), 190. It has been suggested that Gentileschi's painting is informed by the experience of her own rape as a young woman. Browning would have seen this painting-mentioned in Baldinucci (note 38), 5:293-then in the Palazzo Pitti. His friend, the art critic Anna Jameson, had commented on the painting in her Visits and Sketches at Home and Abroad, 4 vols. (London: Saunders and Otley, 1834), 2:119; 3:252-53. 48 Walter Pater, The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry, The 1883 Text, ed. Donald L. Hill (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press), 188.
