<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal Electroencephalography by W. R. Klemm. 292 pages. $14.50. Academic Press, 1969. The strength of this book lies in its dis cussion of technical methods and in its final chapter on animal diseases, rather than in the revelations that electrophysiology can bring to an understanding of the normal brain. Since its discovery in 1875, the electrical activity of the brain has increas ingly proved to be the most potent objective indicator of its function. This is not only true for the adult brain but also for the insight obtainable from ontogenetic and phylogenetic studies. It is lack of the latter that disappoints the reader of a book carrying the title "Animal Electroencepha lography," for only brief glimpses of com parative observations are given and one has to search for them. The greater value of the book is in its discussion of methods for recording; the chapters describing electrodes and record ing circuits will have considerable didactic value for technicians and students learning to understand their recording circuits and, for example, how to implant electrodes stereotactically. In this sense the book makes an excellent laboratory manual and is recommended as such. Unfortunately, however, the animal takes second place in the descriptions of how to proceed in the laboratory. Most valuable would have been some practical guidance from the author for the anes thetization in the different species for it is the veterinarian who knows this best: e.g. type of agent, dosage, pupillary signs of level of anesthesia, the shivering stage (so difficult for the recorder), and the perils of chloralose except for rather restricted special purposes. The reader has to turn from the section of practical instruction to a later chapter on drugs to learn some EEG effects of the various agents though even then he is not told how to use them. In the section teaching the reader opera tive procedures the strength of the local anesthetic to use in the region of excision should be stated and (just as importantly) the interval after which it becomes ineffec tive and must be repeated. Some instruc tion on the use of antibiotics in animals designed to have long-indwelling electrodes would also be helpful to all workers in the field of animal electroencephalography. This question of anesthesia is not merely desirable from the instructional point of view at operation but also for the reader to assess the illustrated EEGs in this book. They carry such captions as "during light anesthesia in a normal dog" (no mention of the agent or the dosage or the size of dog as this affects interelectrode distance). The EEG is very sensitive to levels of "light anesthesia" and differs in pattern from agent to agent. In Figure 5-7, for example, the author calls attention to the progressive decrease in amplitude from anterior to posterior and suggests it may be caused by changing thickness of bone, whereas it is a common effect at the stage of light anes thesia shown, especially with barbiturates. At the deeper stage when fast activity is lost (as in Fig. 5-8) this amplitude domi nance of the frontal regions is also lost. But if, as just noted, the first word of the title of this book yields place to the second, the latter is presented in great detail and is clearly an area of special competence of the author. The chapters on electrodes and their insertion, on artifacts in the record ings, and on recording systems, will be most useful to all beginners. One wishes the author had had more experience with com puter analysis for this section is very weak and rather misleading. In the chapter on behavioral correlates the changes with sleep are described but one must protest against the use of the phrase "dream stage" of sleep in the lower animals, though perhaps those of us who are disturbed by this anthropomorphic inference from electrical events may be comforted by the author's statement that "frogs did not display any other signs of dream sleep." In common with many others, the author perpetuates the term "paradoxical sleep" although there is nothing whatever paradoxical about the brain at this stage or about the EEG?the term merely reflects the surprise of its originator that the find ings did not fit his hypothesis. We get just a hint of species differences in the chapter on maturation. This section reports the work of others presented as empirical statements descriptive of changes in the recordings. How interesting it would have been to have these changes inter preted in terms of the maturing brain? such as a comparison of the electrical cor relates from newborn animals that stand at birth and those that are incapable ; or from those whose eyes are open at birth and those that fumble blindly. It is inconceiv able that these profound maturational differences are not reflected in neuronal activity. Where this book stands out from the plethora of books about the EEG is the chapter on "naturally" occurring brain diseases in the lower animals. Information in this area is sparce and this forms a valu able contribution of this book. The data, although restricted to dogs, are well pre sented here and well illustrated. It is interesting to compare these with those of Pampiglione (also in the dog). Perhaps some day the author will give us more information about other species, for between the lines of this book we per ceive how rash it would be to generalize about behavioral correlates from rabbit to man, and it would be good to be encour aged sometimes to know that we can be differentiated from sheep.?Mary A.
