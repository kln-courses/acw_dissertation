Pp. 413. Price 21 sh. net. This book embodies twelve lectures, which form a comparative study of the modern biologist's attitude towards the mysteries of life and the views propounded by Jean Fernel, a physician philosopher of the sixteenth century. His work "On Hidden Causes" printed in 1548 was one of the most widely read books of the time, judged by the number of editions it passed through. Its reputation and popularity must have been largely due to the fact that it was a clever and fairly comprehensive exposi tion of some of the obscure philosophical and theological problems which agitated the mind of Christendom. It is only natural that Sir Charles Sherrington, whose whole life has been spent on the detailed investi gation of the structure and function of the nervous system, should have made Fernel's work, the text for his lectures. They deal with independent topics and can be read without a previous knowledge of the earlier discourses, but yet together they constitute a composite dissertation on the funda mental theme whether the modern scientific researches justify a logical division of matter into living and non-living bodies. Firm in the grasp of his subject and with an outlook rare in its sympathy and range, the author has striven to prove that the boundary line separating the sentient and the non-sentient objects is only apparent, but at bottom the biological processes are indistinguishable from the complex of interatomic physical and chemical electrical changes. Every student of biology is aware of the competing claims of the mechanistic and vitalistic theories offering solution to the mystery of life, which, in spite of the immense advances in biology and physical sciences in recent times, still remains a deep mystery. It must be remembered that all theories and hypotheses,—more or less in the nature of accretion of analogies,—are not all inferences from positive knowledge, but to a very large extent must be "correct guesses". If nothing is to be gained by claiming living matter as colloidal, there is equally nothing to be gained by claiming that life processes belong to the province of atomic physics. The mystery of life is just as great now as it was to the first speculator, for the obvious reason that a "subject" in the philosophical sense cannot be also an "object". We may know all about the physical machinery, but when we come to analyse "consciousness" and "mind", we needs must enter the region of speculation, for neither the one nor the other can be seen and handled, except what we know of their manifestation. Pasteur has been called a vitalist, but in 1884 he wrote "not only have I not set up as absolute the existence of a barrier between the products of the laboratory and those of life, but I was the first to prove that it was merely an artificial barrier, and I indicated the general proce dure necessary to remove it by knowing that it would be necessary to have recourse to those forces of dissymmetry which you have never employed in your laboratories". Sir William Bate Hardy adds "and yet the hypothesis of a special vital force and the search for it is as likely to lead to our goal as any other. I would even go further and say that the physical and chemical impro babilities of living matter are so great as to make an hypothesis of special creations more restful and almost as valid as that of continuous evolution." We have read the lectures with profound interest, but nevertheless we cannot dis guise from ourselves the feeling that "the biologist's philosophy" so fearlessly and invigoratingly expounded in them leaves a sense of incompleteness. This is not due to any want of adequacy and clarity of \ treatment, for few books can be regarded as more clear, and comprehensive, or fuller in respect of experimental details support ing the arguments. It is the very nature of the subject that must baffle ultimate analysis. We may succeed in finally reducing the concept of life as a mere convention, but can we also treat consciousness and mind,— the two "functions" of life,-—as mere phases of physical phenomena. "Is there any guess which comes within whooping distance of</page><page sequence="2">Jnlyïui] kevieWS 337 the shifts and tricks by which the primordial slime clothed itself in diffraction gratings to give the birds the colour they need in a tropical forest?" The inner sanctuary of biology may not open its doors,—perhaps not at all,—by uttering the physico-chemi cal barley, wheat, but possibly a glimpse into the inner treasure vaults may be vouchsafed by Upunishadic sesame. The twelve lectures deal with topics such as Nature and Tradition, The Natural and Superstition, Life in Little, The Wisdom of the Body, Earth's Reshuffling, A Whole Pre supposed of its Parts, The Brain and its Work, The Organ of Liaison, Brain Col laborates with Psyche, Earth's Alchemy, Two Ways of One Mind and Conflict with Nature—thus traversing the whole field of known facts in science, physical, biological and mental. On going through the chapters, we are tempted to exclaim the excellent sentiments so nobly expressed by the author, "There will be much to which man has not access. The distances are immense and he is near-sighted. He peers into a small patch and what he sees there he sub mits to his reason which after all is very newly hatched. What wonder if his con clusions be meagre and insecure. What wonder they are narrowly anthropomorphic. Such they must be." The central point of enquiry is, "Is there a Mind that directs and controls the operations of organic and inorganic Nature." If there is none, then it is arguable that the boundary line sepa rating Nature and Mind vanishes; in the sense that Mind is self-conscious and con scious of the electrical-chemical forces by which matter exists, Mind and Nature are different. But are these "forces" blind, fortuitous and independent? They are known to be governed by definite laws expressed mathematically or in the language of physics and chemistry. These are the Laws of Nature. But what is Nature? Is it the assemblage of phenomena in the objective world, does it also comprehend the sub jective world? We are aware that the mental phenomena are to a large extent— the purposeful and directed phenomena— governed by intelligence. Is there an in telligence controlling the forces and pheno mena of the objective world? Perhaps a tentative answer is furnished by the query —not an impertinent one,—is the book under review, undoubtedly a remarkable event, just a product of atomic physics and chemistry, or have the operational processes culminating in the book been guided, directed and controlled by a purposeful intelligence? Sir Charles Sherrington has answered this and other intricate questions in his own inimitable way. This book has brought together several provocative thoughts, has analysed them and shown the many inherent difficulties confronting the enquiring mind. • Most of its contents are stimulating and easy to digest. None can read the volume without the sense that Sir Charles Sherrington has felt the grand sweep and majesty of the theme which he has set out to expound in a firm, clear and crisp style, so rare in scientific treatises dealing with philosophical problems. We have the intense conviction that this book is a masterpiece of balanced exposition of problems which lure and perplex thoughtful minds.</page></plain_text>
