MOSCATI IS PROFESSOR OF SEMITIC PHILOLOGY in the University of Rome and a well-known Near- Eastern archaeologist. In this book (published simultaneously by Weidenfeld and Nicholson in London), he has given us an orderly and sagacious account of the Phoenician civilization, and he has employed the latest archaeological information. The first part deals with the Phoenician homeland and the island of Cyprus; the second part is con- cerned with Carthage and the other settlements in Africa; the third part surveys the colonies in the West (Malta, Gozo, Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia and Spain). There are numerous photographs and line drawings. The usefulness of Moscati's book to teachers of Homer and Herodotus, Livy and Vergil, is self- evident. The Phoenicians, perhaps deservedly, are not a popular subject and on the whole re- main somewhat shadowy and mysterious. They suffer from the disadvantage of being known only through their enemies. Their homeland was K'na'an, a word of uncertain meaning; one and all, they were Canaanites, as the Carthaginians still called themselves in the time of St. Augustine. The words ,DOIVLKES and Piini (cf. the Egyptian Fnhw), probably of ultimate Semitic origin, can- not be disassociated from the gentilic Pi2ni, cited in Num. xxvi.23. Moscati refuses to consider the problem of Canaanite origins; furthermore, he limits his account to a study of the maritime cities after c. 1200 B.C., i.e., to the period after the descent of the Sea-peoples upon Egypt. The splendors of the Ugaritic period are thus excluded. Within two centuries after the general destruction caused by the Sea-peoples, Tyre (S.6r, "rock") had assumed the hegemony over the other cities, and the Golden Age of Phoenicia was under Hirdm or Hfirbm ('"hi-rdm, "my brother is the Exalted"), son of '"bi-Ba'al, "my father is the Lord"), a contemporary of Solomon (c. 961-922 B.C.), for whom he built the temple. The loss of land caused by the agressions of Hebrews, Philistines and Ara- maeans drove the Phoenicans overseas. They were already mariners of considerable reputation. Even- tually, they lost even their coastal strip to the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Persians and Macedonians; their "empire" or "commonwealth" abroad was destroyed by the Romans. Yet great prosperity returned to the cities of Phoenicia under the Roman Empire. Moscati is hard put to illustrate the art and architecture of the homeland. There has not been sufficient excavation in the important coastal cities to reveal much of Iron-age Phoenicia before Roman times. Most material thus far brought to light dates from the Bronze Age and so is excluded from this book. Thus Moscati is forced to rely heavily on objects found at Nineveh and many other distant places, especially the sites on Cy- prus, where Moscati would push back Gjerstad's date for the foundation of Citium to the eleventh century B.C. He reconstructs the formal history of Phoenicia from the literary sources of many nations, since the native records have perished. He gives us king-lists with suggested dates. It is interesting to note that the "wicked" Queen Jezebel was the great-aunt of our Dido, Vergil's tragic heroine. That Dido lived more than three centuries after the supposed time of Aeneas dis- turbed neither Vergil nor his sources. Moscati, like Donald Harden and certain other Phoenician archaeologists, accepts the historicity of the Dido story, but much to our disappoint- ment, he does not say a great deal on the subject. Following the reconstructed Annals of Tyre, he says that Mettenus, the father of Elissa, lived thirty-two years and reigned twenty-nine (849- 821 B.C.), while her brother Pygmalion lived fifty-six years and ruled forty-seven (820-774 B.C). The flight of Elissa occurred in the seventh year of Pygmalion's reign. Moscati seems not to care for the name of Dido, dismissing it as a later intrusion. It is evident on page 115 that he con- siders the name Elisha to underlie the Graeco- Roman Elissa, and that Pumay-yaton is the original form of Pygmalion. Despite his eminence as a philologist, Moscati leaves the reader in the dark concerning these im- portant matters. I shall therefore make a few remarks here concerning these familiar names. Some years ago A. M. Honeyman suggested that Elissa derived from a compound of 'il, "god," and 'iSic, "woman," i.e., "goddess." This formation is often cited, but it does not seem very plausible. It has an unsemitic cast to it, and anyway, the Canaanites already had a perfectly good word for "goddess," 'ilat (the word is seemingly unattested in Biblical Hebrew). The fact that Dido was worshipped as a goddess in late Carthaginian times cannot be used to impugn her humanity. Since Dido came to Africa from Cyprus, where she secured eighty temple-maidens (q"djs', "holy one," i.e., sacred prostitute) to ensure continuity of cult in her new foundation, it may be that the name of Elissa is simply that of Cyprus itself or its chief town, that is, ' liU, which name appears as Ala'ia in the Amarna Letters. Personifications or eponyms of this variety are well known. On the other hand, I am convinced that she was indeed a mortal woman. A feminine personal name, 'LST, appears in some four inscriptions of the Corpus inscriptionum Semiticarum. The final taw of fem- inines regularly drops off in later times, but we cannot restore the vocalization, and it is perhaps more likely that the name of Elissa began with</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 135 aleph. Yet this remains a possibility. For the present, we must prefer the form 'elis'; it means "'El [the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon] is safety [or ease]." This was, in fact, the name of the prophet Elisha, but we must not allow Judaic notions to intrude here. The names im- posed upon children were generally theophorous, expressing in a complete sentence some religious belief or observation of the parents; if the nom- inal sentence was too long, it would be later abbreviated into a so-called hypokoristikon. The name of Elissa, however, is a very short sentence indeed, and it makes sense as it is. It is comfort- ing to note that Moscati, too, has settled upon this, but he nowhere explains his reasoning. The name Deido is explained by the Etymologi- cum magnum as meaning "wanderer," and this would suggest some form of the Canaanite and Hebrew verb NDD, "to wander." What is the feminine participle, if this is what we want? We know so little of Phoenician, really, that we cannot even guess. The Hebrew verb is nddad, and the feminine participle is n6dedet. And how are we to account for the loss of the first syllable? On the other hand, the name may be from the verb DD, thus Hebrew d6d, "beloved" or "uncle" with a feminine d6dd, "beloved" or "aunt"! (Cf. the Akkadian dddu, "beloved," etc.) The name of Dido may well have been a Lallname, falsely ety- mologized as "wanderer." The father of Dido is MTN-B'L, Hebrew Matan-Ba'al, "gift of the Lord," which appears as the hypocoristic Belus. The uncle and husband of Dido is ZKR-BcL, Hebrew Zkar-Ba'al, "the Lord remembers," variously rendered as Acerbas, Sic- harbas, or even Sychaeus in the Aeneid (the prince of Byblos in the Wenamun report of about 1100 B.c. bears this same name). With Pyg- malion, Dido's brother, we run into bewildering difficulties. Cypriote and other inscriptions, perhaps including the one from Nora on Sardinia, reveal the existence of a god, PMY, as a com- ponent of personal names. Thus PMY-YTN, regarded by Moscati and others as *Pumay-yathn (the latter element must be the Phoenician form of the Hebrew perfect ndtdn) is also held by them to be the original of Pygmalion, that is, "Pumay has given." This is not a new theory; it was proposed years ago by the British scholar S. M. Langdon. The vowels for the vocalization of Pumay were obtained from the form IIvtCirwvL, which occurs in the manuscripts of Athenaeus IV,167d, a form corrected by G. Kaibel to read IHvyaXtowvL in view of the obvious reference to the Cypriote king or kinglet put to death by Ptolemy I in 312 B.c. This person, who spelt his name on the coins as PMY-(Y)TN, is also mentioned by Diodorus XIX,78,4 under the very name of Pygmalion. The whole business is thrown into confusion by the actual appearance of PGMLYN as the name of a god to be invoked along with the goddess Astarte ('Aftdrt, Aphrodite) on the gold pendant in the Lavigerie Museum at Car- thage, an object to be dated about 600 B.C. and not even mentioned by Moscati. As for Iarbas, the importunate suitor of Dido, he must be '(W)R-B'L, Yd'ir-Ba'al or Ydr-Ba'al, "the Lord awakes," while Anna, the sister of Dido, if her name is Semitic at all, must be HNN, Hannd, "grace," perhaps even "grace of the Lord" as in the name Hannibal. The "Lord" referred to in these names is the heroic son of 'El and local Zeus of Tyre, regarded as the owner or hus- band (ba'al) of his city and its fertile land. The city over which the god Melqart (Greek Melicertes) presides (milk, "king"; kart, "city") has been shown by Professor Albright to be the city of the underworld, not Tyre itself. But was Carthage (Kart-hada't, "new town"- there was also a settlement of this name on Cyprus) actually founded by Dido in 814 B.C.? Moscati says he has no reason to doubt the traditional date; the excavations in the Precinct of Tanit on the west side of the rectangular harbor have yielded in the lowest level ("Tanit I") pottery to be dated about 800 B.C. (red amphoras used as urns with short wide necks, red-burnished wares in general with black linear bands and triglyph pattern on the shoulder, jugs with mushroom or trefoil lips). Moscati repeats the old belief that the name of the settlement here-"- pbpa, "the hide," really represents some lost Canaanite word for citadel or stronghold, but this seems more than doubtful. The lowest stratum of the precinct is now below water-level and rests upon bedrock. There is no doubt that the level of the Mediterra- nean is now about ten feet higher than it was in classical antiquity, as Professor Rhys Carpen- ter has recently showed. The causeway linking the Carthaginian fortified island of Motya with the mainland of Sicily is also beneath the waves. This lowest stratum at Carthage contains urns covered with heaps of stones; the two strata above also contain urns but with many cippi or stelae. There was a succession of shrines from the tiny Cintas Chapel upwards. This area was the tdfiet (Aramaic, "fire-place"), of which no certain example has been found in Palestine or Syria, but many in the western colonies. We know about their existence in the homeland mainly from scriptural sources; for example, Jerusalem pos- sessed such a place until it was defiled by King Josiah (c. 639-609). These urns contain the bones and teeth of children burnt alive as piacular offerings to the gods. If Dido was a historical person, then her tomb must have been here and perhaps still awaits discovery. G. Charles-Picard was inclined to see in the earliest chapel, named</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 137 after its discoverer P. Cintas, an original me- morial of Dido. One obelisk-like stele, surmounted by signs of the sun and crescent moon, actually depicts a Carthaginian priest with a little child held firmly beneath his left arm; his right arm is raised in a sign of greeting or benediction. The bones of ani- mals or birds are sometimes found in the urns of the higher strata, but the misfortunes of Carthage were attributed to this practice of cheating the gods of their due by substituting animals for children. The story of Abraham and Isaac (or of Agamemnon and Iphigenia) will be recalled. Readers will also remember the Ammonite god Moloch, to whom sons and daughters of various ages were made "to pass through the fire." Mos- cati rightly identifies the word molk as meaning "sacrifice," especially by fire. This dreadful busi- ness was performed in the mother-country at a "high place" (bdmd, the possible origin of pflwo6), such as that built by Solomon on the Mount of Olives. In the West open-air precincts continued to be used, but they were not so remote from the city. Here stood the sacred pillar (massibd) or baetyl (bet-'l, "god-house"), objects often depicted upon the votive stelae or aedicula. The dieties are not often anthropomorphic, but most are represented by mysterious symbols, such as triangles and bottles! Moscati remarks upon the sudden fourth-century appearance of the goddess Tanit-pene-Ba'al, "Tanit the face of the Lord," without making it clear that she is a projection or hypostasis of her father, and is, in fact, a duplicate of Athena, sprung from her father's forehead and also with important Libyan con- nections. Moscati cannot explain why the elder pair of divinities, Melqart and his daughter 'A'tart, came to be replaced by Ba'al Hammon ("Lord of the incense-altars") and his daughter Tanit. Was there some sort of religious revolu- tion in the West? Moscati discusses very well the Canaanite and Carthaginian art; it is mostly a crude adaptation of Egyptian or Greek styles. The Phoenicians were certainly not an aesthetic people; probably they had no real interest in art because they could see no purpose or profit in it. Since Phoenician architecture has not survived to any degree anywhere except at Tharros in Sardinia, we are driven to imagining temples on the order of that built for Solomon by Hiram. Moscati thinks that the Phoenicians invented the Proto- Aeolic capital, since examples have been found here and there on Phoenician sites. The most surprising thing about Carthage is her reluctance to strike and use coins. Moscati attributes this to trade with uncivilized areas, where the idea of coinage would not be understood. Carthage was compelled to coin to pay her mercenaries. Moscati also has the strange idea that Carthage rejected coinage in order to avoid exploitation by the Greek adepts in the new money-economy. There was certainly a strong spirit of anti-Hellenism amongst the Carthaginians; at one time the teaching of Greek was forbidden. We cannot forgive the Carthaginians for their vicious extirpation of Selinus, Agrigentum, Gela and Himera, whatever emotions may have been involved. The colonies of Carthage coined freely. Of great interest is the discovery of P. Cintas of what he calls "the Punic facies," a certain appearance of the land from the water, which inevitably invited coloni- zation (a promontory or small island with a beach for drawing up ships, a source of fresh water, and a cliff for excavating chamber-tombs). Moscati is convinced that the Biblical Tars'is' is indeed Tar- tessus in Spain. He does not mention that the name of Gades (modern Cadiz) is easily explain- able as Phoenician gader, "walled enclosure." Many good things are explained by Moscati. He is certainly justified in treating the Phoenicians and Carthaginians as one people, in spite of the differences in dialect and script which slowly develop. The official language and spelling of Carthage were always very conservative. Moscati is inclined to push backward the dates of Phoe- nician exploration and colonization to the ninth or even the tenth century, arguing that the disap- pearance of the Mycenaean sea power created a vacuum into which the Phoenicians were drawn. The early forms of the letters in colonial inscrip- tions tend to support these dates. It is a pity that the book is marred by so many misprints, and there are also certain infelicities on the part of the translator. This is nonetheless a worthy and informative book. T. T.
