<plain_text><page sequence="1">P. R. S. MOOREY: Ancient Persian bronzes in the Adam collection. 207 pp., front., 3 plates. London: Faber and Faber, 1974. ?9. This luxuriously printed book is a companion volume to the same author's Ancient bronzes from Luristan. The 188 pieces in the Peter Adam collection are fully representative of the rich metallurgy of Iran and cover periods which range from the early third millennium until Parthian times, although there are only a few Parthian bronzes. The series treated in the catalogue is com- prised under the headings 'Weapons and tools ', ' Horse-harness ', ' Finials, mounts, and decorated tubes', 'Pins, personal ornaments, and cosmetic equipment', 'Vessels', and 'Statuettes and pendants'. Students and experts concerned with Iranian metallurgy could hardly do better than to consult this concise and well-documented work which in abbreviated form contains much that was more elaborately treated in the same author's Persian bronzes in the Ashmolean Museum (1971). The introductory pages which give an account of techniques, alloys, and ores are a model of compression and should be examined by all students in addition to Moorey's con- clusions in Persian bronzes. It may justly be said that the author, after years of con- centrated work, is now our leading authority on Iranian metallurgy. The extraordinary range of information which this collection has yielded must be its justification, but its historical value depends entirely on the rela- tively scanty evidence from controlled ex- cavations which throw beams of light on the chronology. The two main bronze-producing centres here discussed are Amlash (Gildn) in the north, and Luristln. Here were centred two very different sources of production. For Gilln our main information derives from the remarkable excavations conducted by E. Negahbdn at Marlik, c. 1200-1000 B.C., which have the advantage over Lurist5n in wealth of gold and silver. The bronzes of Luristin are in effective contrast and lasted very much longer, down to the invasion of Iranian tribes in the seventh century B.c. when the Medes, and subsequently the Achae- menians, took over metalworking for the country and effectively exterminated the thousand-year-old production in Luristin itself. There are available for consultation a few Luri centres of controlled excavations which supplement those conducted further afield, such as Caspian Marlik in the north which complements the information from Luristin itself. First comes Bani Surmah excavated by</page><page sequence="2">178 REVIEWS Vanden Berghe, with rich cist graves of the mid-third millennium B.c.; Tepe Tattulban not far from Surmah, rich in metal probably about 750-700 B.c.; Dum Surkh excavated by Schmidt, 800-700 B.c., revealed a stone-built shrine and many LuristAn bronzes; Tepe Guran where the Danish Luristan Expedition excavated graves, one of which was dated by a Carbon 14 determination c. 1315 + 124 (5730 half life). Finally, among other sites must be mentioned the fortified manor on the citadel rewardingly excavated by Clare Goff at BAb&amp; Jan, 800-700 B.c. These sites to- gether with others have helped to pinpoint the chronology, although there are still many areas of production which remain in com- parative darkness. Future excavators should be richly rewarded with contributions to scientific information. In surveying this metal work we cannot fail to be struck by the comparative conservatism of Mesopotamian copper and bronzes which reveal a puritanical outlook when com- pared with the imaginative exuberance of Luristdn, particularly in the production of animal forms. There can here be no doubt that behind the exotic twists of both animal and human figurines, particularly evinced by the finials, there lies a deep-set magic and a mythology for which we have at present no written record. An inkling of imaginative Luri ideas was obtained by the late Professor R. C. Zaehner who was regaled with tales by a Luri tribesman, unfortunately now vanished and probably dead. This man wrote a remarkable book named No Heaven for Gunga Din, and left behind him a mythological story, a long manuscript some 800 pp. in length replete with ancient Luri folk-lore, though the author him- self was unaware of its antique significance and primitive religious ideas. Our lost Luri author indicated that in the country there was still an oral tradition of folk-lore which needs urgent examination before it disappears. There can hardly be a doubt also of a humorous outlook which lies behind some of the iconography, and this I think corresponds with Layard's own observations when he spent many months living among the tribesmen. In short, these comic finials are a unique phenomenon peculiar to Iran, and may yet be capable of inter- pretation. Examination of many of the objects rein- forces our previous observation that we are dependent on understanding these unwritten local products by reference to excavated sites that have provided dating evidence. For example the fibulae are exact counterparts of seventh-century types from Nimrfid and some of the decorated, fluted, and embossed bronze bowls are purely Mesopotamian. We are fortunate in possessing a seventh-century specimen from Nimrfid, and one from Assur, not mentioned in the text, which can be precisely dated by an eponymous inscription mentioning Aiurtaklak, to the year 806 B.c. Almost every object could provoke comment. We may allow ourselves space to attend to one series, the remarkable decorated bronze sheetmetal jars with trough spouts. Moorey quotes an interesting example of an anthropomorphic terracotta figurine dis- covered by Clare Goff at BdbR Jdn illustrating the carrying of a spouted ritual vessel, Iran, vii, 1969, plate 3, of a different type. It is difficult to resist the surmise that these extraordinary long spouted bronze cauldrons which range over the upper half of the first millennium B.c. were containers for the sacred drink haoma. At about the same period the corresponding Indian liquor, soma, was being imbibed, as we may deduce from the R1gveda. It is significant that these cauldrons are reported to have been found in tombs, and that the spouts were applied to the mouths of the dead who would thus have been drinking the elixir of life, but it is regrettable that the identification of a haoma priest on one of the Treasury tablets from Persepolis has been withdrawn by Professor Cameron. None the less on that site a series of inscribed stone pestles have been plausibly identified by the excavators as instruments used for the grinding of this plant. A comparison of the Avesta with the R.gveda shows clearly that soma was already an important feature in mythology and cult of the Indo-Iranian age, as has been affirmed by A. A. Macdonell. Mortars of green chert bore Aramaic in- scriptions in ink and occurred in great numbers in the Treasury at Persepolis, where both pestles and mortars were found in astonishing numbers. On one of the seals there appear to be pictures of the haomna ceremony, (Persepolis, ii, seal No. 20, plate 7). The mortar (hdvana) was the receptacle in which by means of a pestle the twigs of the haoma plant were pounded and their juice extracted. It is significant that in the Ddtastdn i donfk, a Pahlavi book written by the High Priest of PArs and Kirmin in the ninth century A.D., we read of' The fine-grown Haoma in its pure metal container which is the glorious earthly Haoma blessed by Zoroaster' (R. C. Zaehner, The dawn and twilight of Zoroastrianism, 90). In the type of vessel to which we allude we see an exotic and expressive object of a cult which may have been that of haoma itself and perhaps was the archetype for subsequent forms, as in Moorey, Persian bronzes, 523-6. The corresponding types in decorated painted clay are abundantly illustrated in the Sialk Cemetery B which contained strainers, as was prescribed for the soma offering in India.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 179 There is one finely painted specimen obviously designed for a ritual libation, Sialk, II, plate xviii, 2. Further, Ghirshman remarks, op. cit., 33, that the long spouts were designed to act as barriers against sediments. MAX MALLOWAN</page></plain_text>
