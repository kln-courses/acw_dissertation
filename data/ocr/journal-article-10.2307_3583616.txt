INTRODUCTION The problem of biological energy transformations can be studied from two quite different standpoints-from that of the nature of the biological systems in which these transformations take place, and from that of the molecular and atomic mechanisms of these transformations. Unless the nature of the biological system is known with a sufficient degree of accuracy, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a solution with respect to mechanism. The biological system must be the point of departure for a study of mechanism, and unless the biological co- ordinates are known one may wander far afield. This paper is designed to introduce to biophysicists, physicists, and chemists the biological framework within which the solution of problems of energy trans- formations will have to be found. Although this is a relatively new area of bio- chemical inquiry, a considerable body of information is accumulating which makes it possible at least to sketch the biological setting for energy transformations. The descriptions which follow are relatively unsophisticated and qualitative, but it is intended that they serve as a guide to the biological realities of the problem. 504</page><page sequence="2">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM TABLE I ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS IN LIVING SYSTEMS Transformation Organ Chemical to electrical energy Brain, nerve Sound to electrical energy Ear Light to electrical energy Eye Chemical to osmotic energy Kidney Light to chemical energy Chloroplast Chemical to radiant energy Firefly luminescent organ Chemical to mechanical energy Muscle Hydrostatic to electrical energy Inner ear Chemical to electrical energy Nose, tongue II. CELLULAR MACHINES Living cells contain a variety of devices or machines for converting energy from one form to another. A partial list of the energy transformations accomplished by various cellular machines is assembled in Table I. Nature has experimented widely in this respect and not without success. To many biochemists, the concept of a cellular machine is both strange and unattractive-carrying as it does the connotation of a mechanical contrivance with moving gears and assembled parts. But, it should be born in mind that man has had experience with man-made contrivances only, and so it is natural to think of machines generally in anthropomorphic terms. But if one considers a machine as a structured device for the conversion of energy from one form to another, then one is no longer obliged to invest each such instrument with "mechanical" attributes. There are three characteristics which probably are common to all cellular ma- chines. First, each is made up of many identical subunits operating in parallel and series. The subunits have molecular dimensions; that is, they can be described in terms of a limited number of molecules forming some definite molecular pattern which is repeated hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Secondly, each machine has some specialized molecules which are the instruments of energy transformation. A partial list of these molecules is given in Table II. The nature of the specialized molecules has yet to be determined in most of the known cellular machines. The mitochondrion, the muscle cell, the chloroplast, and the luminescent organ have been partially defined in this respect, but this is not true for any of the other cellular machines. The specialized molecules are the links between cellular machines and enzymology. Cellular-energy transformations take place at the level of a single molecule, and cellular machines integrate the transformations of hundreds and thousands of such molecules. Chlorophyll, for example, is one of the molecular 505</page><page sequence="3">GREEN TABLE II MOLECULAR INSTRUMENTS OF ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS Oxidative Phosphorylation Muscular Contraction Coenzyme Q Myosin Vitamin K Actin Cytochromes Flavoproteins Luminescent Organ Pyridine nucleotides Flavin Photosynthesis Retina Chlorophyll Rhodopsin Cytochrome Visual purple instruments by which radiant energy is converted in the green plant to some as yet undefined form of chemical energy. Actomyosin is the molecular instrument by which chemical energy is transformed to mechanical energy in muscle. These molecular transformations do not take place in homogeneous media. They require an elaborate and precise structural milieu for their consummation. Thus, it is not enough merely to recognize, isolate, and describe chemically the molecules endowed with the property of energy transformation. The understanding of the organization and disposition of parts in the structured elements in which these specialized molecules are localized is essential to the understanding of how cellular machines operate. The study of cellular machines is, in essence, topological enzymology. Function and structure are inextricably intertwined. Before the enzymology can be meaning- ful, there has to be an adequate and precise biochemical description of the structure of a given machine. This has called for new tools, new concepts, and, to some extent, a break with classical thinking. I should like to expand a little on this last theme because therein lies, I believe, a rather fundamental concept. There is all the difference in the world between studying chlorophyll as a molecule in solution and studying chlorophyll as a com- ponent of the chloroplast system. One may never learn the nexus of events which intervene between the absorption of light and the photochemical process as it takes place in the chloroplast from the study of chlorophyll as an isolated substance. The structured milieu in which chlorophyll is operative in the green plant endows this Mg-porphyrin with properties and potentialities which probably would never be suspected or recognized from the study of the isolated substance. If man is not aware of this fundamental distinction, he may end up studying his own brain rather than nature. The contractile properties exhibited by isolated actomyosin became the object of intensive study by theoretical chemists and physicists. But, the recent works of the Huxleys (19) and of Weber (33) suggest that this molecular contractility has no relevance to the problem of contraction in muscle. 506</page><page sequence="4">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM The biochemist is the culprit who is largely responsible for this widespread misapprehension. It should have been his task to define the problem of energy transformation with sufficient precision so that chemists and physicists could take the biological realities as their point of departure. But biochemistry is only be- ginning to come to grips with this problem, and as yet relatively few biochemical machines have been studied in the detail which they deserve. III. MITOCHONDRIAL MACHINE The experience which is being gathered in the study of the mitochondrial ma- chine may well be a guide to the problems and pitfalls which await exploration of other cellular machines. The mitochondrion is, in essence, a cellular machine for converting energy liber- ated by oxidation of citric-cycle substrates into the bond energy of adenosinetri- phosphate (ATP). A distinction must be made, therefore, between the primary attributes which are common to all mitochondria regardless of source and the secondary attributes which are found in some but not all mitochondria. A summary of primary and secondary attributes is given in Table III. In general, citric-cycle oxidations are the reactions which are coupled to phos- phate esterification. But this is not universally true. In skeletal and flight muscle, the coupled oxidation of a-glycerophosphate quantitatively takes precedence by far over citric-cycle oxidations (8). In bacteria, there are indications of yet other oxidative reactions which are coupled to phosphate esterification and which are not part of the citric-cycle sequence. The universal property common to all mitochondria, regardless of source, is apparently that of linking or coupling some oxidative reaction to the synthesis of ATP from inorganic phosphate and adenosinediphosphate (ADP). The structure of the mitochondrion and the disposition of parts are designed to achieve this coupling function. It is remarkable that, whether the mitochondrion (or its TABLE III PRIMARY AND ANCILLARY ENZYMATIC FUNCTIONS OF MITOCHONDRIA Primary Processes Electron transport Oxidative phosphorylation Citric-cycle oxidations Ancillary Oxidations a-Glycerophosphate dehydrogenation Fatty-acid oxidation Choline dehydrogenation Ancillary Processes Biosynthesis of phospholipide Hippuric-acid synthesis 507</page><page sequence="5">GREEN functional equivalent) is prepared from animal tissues, plants, or bacteria, the nature and proportion of the many oxidation-reduction components are almost identical (7). The design of the mitochondrial machine appears to be the same from one end of the evolutionary scale to the other. The mitochondrion of heart muscle has been selected for study in our laboratory because it is relatively stable and can be readily prepared on a large scale. The stability of the heart mitochondrion may be an expression of the fact that it is stripped down to essential activities only. There are virtually no ancillary processes going on, and, thus, the destructive action of auxiliary enzymes, as in the case of the liver mitochondrion, is avoided. IV. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF MITOCHONDRIA ANI) DERIVATIVE PARTICLES The electron microscope has been a powerful tool for elucidating the gross structure and arrangement of the mitochondrial machine. Figure 1 is an electron FIG. 1. Electron micrograph of a section of beef heart muscle showing clusters of mitochon- dria along the muscle fibrils. The structures are magnified about 47,000 diameters.

Note that the interior of the mitochondrion is packed with double-membraned structured ele- ments called cristae. The number of cristae per mitochondrion is inversely pro- portional to the number of secondary enzymatic properties. Liver mitochondria have many secondary activities and relatively few cristae per mitochondrion, whereas heart mitochondria have essentially no secondary activities and many cristae. The interpretation of the gross structural arrangement of parts within the mitochondrion is given in the form of the diagrammatic representation shown in Fig. 2. The internal repeating structure is that of the crista which is arranged in the form of a slightly inflated sealed-off bag. The two walls of the flattened bag are separated by an internal, protected fluid medium in which all but one of the oxi- dative enzymes of the citric-acid cycle as well as other enzymes are localized. Imagine a long row of such bags of cristae one atop the other, though not quite touching, and then imagine that in turn this pile of cristae is wrapped around with an envelope of the same material of which the cristae are constructed; this presents a gross picture of the organization of the mitochondrion. A three-di- mensional representation of the mitochondrion according to this interpretation is shown in Fig. 3. Note that the outer envelope of the mitochondrion has a single- membrane structure in contrast to the double-membrane structure of the cristae. By appropriate treatment, heart mitochondria can be transformed into miniature mitochondria which still retain the coupling properties and the full enzymatic spectrum of the parent particle (38, 39). These miniature mitochondria have the same basic disposition of parts, and probably arise by a process analogous to the ? _ - FIG. 4.

Electron micrograph of an isolated beef heart mitochondrion. [From Filmer and Kaesberg (12).] one shown diagrammatically in Fig. 4. Miniaturization need not necessarily lead to rupture of the cristae and outer envelope if breaks are sealed or capped as quickly as they are formed. It must be presumed that the material which constitutes the cristae and membrane has strong cohesive properties making possible the immediate capping or fusion of torn ends. There is an analogous process to miniaturization of mitochondria at the level of the individual crista. These, in turn, can be twisted and torn into smaller fragments which are still essentially sealed-off bags, though miniaturized by comparison to the parent crista. Figures 5 through 7 are electron micrographs of the transitional 511</page><page sequence="9">GREEN FIG. 6. Electron micrograph of mitochondrion after freezing and thawing. [From Filmer and Kaesberg (12).] steps in the conversion of mitochondria to fragments of cristae which still retain their double-membrane or bag-like configuration. V. STRUCTURE-FUNCTION C(RRELATIONS The functional changes which accompany thest various transformations in size and shape are most instructive. As long as the mitochondria retain the charac- teristic arrangement of cristae, then miniaturization does not affect either the citric-cycle oxidations or the phosphorylations which accompany these oxidations. The citric-cycle oxidations require the integrity of the internal protected medium within the cristae, and this is preserved only as long as mitochondrial form is preserved. Once the cristae are torn out of the mitochondrion, the capacity for citric-cycle oxidations is lost (25). Apparently, some of the internal fluid with key enzymes and coenzymes seeps out during the disintegration of the mitochondrion. Such fragments of cristae, however, still retain the capacity to couple to phos- phorylation the two oxidations which survive the fragmentation of the mitochon- drion-namely, the oxidation of succinate and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleo- tide (DPNH) by oxygen. Now, the fragmentation can be carried one stage further to the point where the double-membrane structure of the fragmented crista is also lost. The single-membrane vesicular particle which is thus formed carries out neither the citric cycle nor the coupled oxidation of succinate or DPNH, even 512</page><page sequence="10">MITOCHONDRIAL ELEC'RON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM FIG. 7. Electron micrograph of a suspensionof ETPa derived from a sonicated mitochondrial fraction. [From Filmer and Kaesberg (12).] though it still oxidizes succinate and DPNH just as readily as does the original double-membrane parent particle (9). These simple structure-function relationships and the designation of the pertinent particles are summarized in Table IV. The electron-transport particle (ETP) is the one with an essentially intact electron-transport chain, but with no coupling properties or capacity for citric-cycle oxidations. ETPH is midway between the intact mitochondrion and ETP, showing coupling properties but no capacity for citric-cycle oxidations. Electron micrographs of ETP are shown in Fig. 8, and how ETP originates from ETPH is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 9. During this transition, the internal contents of the cristae are completely lost, and the ruptured fragments round up to form vesicles with single membranes. ETP is not the smallest common denominator of electron transport, and ETPH is not the smallest common denominator of coupled oxidation. Each of these 513</page><page sequence="11">GREEN FIG. 8. Electron micrograph of a suspension of ETP. [From Ziegler et al. (39).] particles as prepared is still a polymer of a considerable, though as yet indeter- minate, number of repeating subunits ETPH can be isolated in a form which does not couple the oxidation of succinate or DPHN to phosphorylation unless supplemented with both magnesium ions and some thermolabile protein component (24, 27). The rate of oxidation is un- affected by either of the two compnents, but no coupling takes place in ther absence. This simple observation establishes that certain substances control the coupling phenomenon and that the rate of electron transport can be identical whether coupling tas place or not. VI. ELECTRON-TRANSPORT CHAIN ETP contains a complete electron-transport chain from succinate or DPNH to xgen. However, shown in Fig. 10, this is an abbreviated sequence as compared 514</page><page sequence="12">515 MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM DOUBLE-MEMBRANE DISC FRAGMENTATION FIG. 9.

Electrons cannot enter by way of citric-cycle substrates and bound DPN, but only by way of either succinate or external DPNH. To the best of our knowledge, there is no recognizable difference between the electron-transport sequence of ETPH or ETP; that is, the same sequence obtains whether coupling goes on or not. This is an important point. If one is to learn about the electron-transport sequence from uncoupled particles like ETP, then one must be sure that there is no qualitative difference in the sequence between coupled and uncoupled particles.

The basic problem of the electron-transport sequence in ETP or mitochondria can be summarized as follows: In what order are these oxidation-reduction com- ponents arranged? By what forces are these components fixed in position within the particle? How do oxidoreductions between adjacent components take place? and, finally, How are these oxidoreductions coupled to phosphate esterification? VII. SEQUENCE OF COMPONENTS The strategy in our laboratory has been to concentrate first on the problems of sequence and arrangement of components in the electron-transfer chain. It is our hope that, once these are defined, the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation will be readily susceptible to attack. There have been two approaches to the problem of sequence-the classical method of Keilin, Slater, and Chance of direct observation of the cytochromes in the respiratory chain, and the one developed in our laboratory of the stepwise degradation of the electron-transport particle or mitochondrion into daughter particles which represent different segments of the electron-transport sequence. A list of the particles prepared thus far in our laboratory is shown in Table VII. From the structure and composition of these particles, it has been possible to deduce much about the sequence of components in the electron-transport chain. There is much work yet to be done, but even now it is possible to suggest a sequence of components which is probably close to the mark. Consider next the way in which an ETP or mitochondrion is fragmented into daughter particles and how one particle type is separable from another. The only reagents we have found to be effective for fragmenting ETP into smaller units are lipide-soluble or lipid solubilizing substances like the lower alcohols (amyl and isobutyl), detergents like Duponol and Triton X-100, and the bile salts. Lipid must 517</page><page sequence="15">518 GREEN TABLE VII "FORMULAE" OF ETP AND FRAGMENTATION PRODUCTS THEREOF.

The separation of different particle types by variations on the theme of ultracentrifuga- tion in media of varying densities has not proved to be a difficult technical problem. Thus, the details of such separations are not mentioned further here. A plausible formulation for the sequence of components in the succinic and DPNH chains is shown in Fig. 12. The role of cytochrome-b in the succinic chain is still unclarified, but, in the DPNH chain, cytochrome-b is probably the link between fD and coenzyme Q. In the mitochondrion and in ETP, the two chains</page><page sequence="16">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM are in electronic communication in the sense that electrons from either succinate or DPNH can reduce all oxidation-reduction components in the particle. It is difficult at present to decide between the possibility of two separate chains which are functionally linked in some way to one another and the alternative possibility that the two chains are merely spurs of one common chain. According to the first possibility, each chain has its own complement of the four cytochromes and of coenzyme Q. According to the second possibility, certain components in the final segment of the electron-transfer unit are shared by the two chains-which, in effect, means that electrons from both succinate and DPNH eventually pass through the same oxidation-reduction components on their way to molecular oxygen. It should be stressed here that the sequence shown in the figure is still tentative, and it is intended merely as a guide to contemporary thinking about the disposition of components in the chain. Do not make the mistake of interpreting the formulation in Fig. 12 in terms of the successive interaction of the components shown in sequence with one another by thermal collision. If there has been relatively little progress in the field of electron transport since the classical work of Keilin almost 30 years ago (20), the assumption of thermal collision between adjacent cytochromes is probably the most important contributing factor. In a particle, the large protein components are fixed in posi- tion and, thus, interactions by thermal collision between adjacent large molecules is highly improbable. Before one can consider the various devices by which electron flow between the oxidation-reduction components in a semirigid particle might be achieved, it is necessary to first consider the parameter of lipid in the electron-transport system. VIII. LIPID OF MITOCHONDRIAL PARTICLES ETP contains some 35% by weight of lipid (9). This lipid is not uniformly distributed throughout the particle as indicated by the observation that daughter particles can be prepared which contain no lipid, whereas other particles can be prepared which contain a much higher percentage of lipid than the parent particle. The lipid is clearly concentrated in limited segments of the electron-transport chain. Various components of the electron-transport chain can be isolated in the form of lipoproteins, notably cytochrome-c1 (16) and the DPNH dehydrogenase (37). The nature of the associated lipid of these two lipoproteins is markedly different and, thus, it becomes necessary to think of the lipid in ETP or mitochondria not in terms of a mass of uniform composition but rather of qualitatively different segments. The composition of any one of these lipid segments is related in some way to the nature of the associated protein component. Thus, the lipid of the fD lipopro- tein is predominantly neutral lipid (17) whereas the lipid of the cl lipoprotein is predominantly phospholipid (17). 519</page><page sequence="17">GREEN Under appropriate conditions, a water-soluble lipid fraction can be isolated from ETP which contains neither flavin nor heme, but the entire complement of co- enzyme Q (5). This fraction was at first referred to as the interchain lipoprotein or Q-lipoprotein. As first prepared, this lipid extract contained some 5 % protein, but more recently the protein content of the fraction has been reduced to less than 0.5 % (13). It would appear that the unique properties of this Q-lipid extract are not at all dependent upon the presence of protein, which is probably only a minor contaminant. The water solubility of this lipid extract is an expression of an ordered arrangement of lyophilic and lyophobic groups. The catalytic activity of this extract runs parallel with water solubility. Once this is lost, catalytic activity disappears. About 95 % of the lipid in the Q-lipid extract is phospholipid-equally distributed between cephalin phosphatides and lecithin phosphatides (4). The high concentration of phospholipid probably underlies the property of water solubility. When coenzyme Q is extracted from ETP or daughter particles by acetone or other solvents, the succinoxidase or succinic-cytochrome-c reductase activity is lost. It can be restored by addition either of free coenzyme Q or Q in the form of the Q-lipid extract (10, 22). When the conditions for solvent extraction of the particle are more drastic, then only Q in the form of the Q-lipid extract can restore lost succinoxidase activity (14). Cytochrome-c can be isolated from ETP in the form of a lipid complex referred to as lipid cytochrome-c (34). This complex is insoluble in water but soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. All the available evidence points to lipid cytochrome-c as the bound form of cytochrome-c in the particle (1). It has been demonstrated in our laboratory that ferro lipid cytochrome-c is the substrate for cytochrome oxidase, whereas ferri lipid cytochrome-c is the electron acceptor for electrons from cytochrome-cl (2, 18). From these various observations as well as from the data on the composition of daughter particles derived from ETP, it may be concluded that two of the oxida- tion-reduction components of the electron-transport chain-namely, coenzyme Q and cytochrome-c-are localized in lipid. Furthermore, the two flavoproteins -fs and -fD, and two of the cytochromes, -a and -cl, are linked to other com- ponents of the electron-transfer sequence through lipid. For some time, we have been perplexed as to how the various lipid segments are disposed in the particle. The weight of available evidence now favors the following working hypothesis. There is one lipid core in an ETP or mitochondrion around which the various fixed protein oxidation-reduction components are ar- ranged. In one segment of this core, coenzyme Q is localized and, in another, cytochrome-c (cf. Fig. 13). The bridge between the two compartments is cyto- chrome-cl. Each of the protein components is intimately associated or complexed with specific segments of the core, and, when these proteins are detached from the 520</page><page sequence="18">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM FIG. 13. A three-dimensional diagrammatic representation of the structure of the repeating unit of the electron-transport chain. The area with parallel lines represents the lipid core. particle, they carry with them their complement of associated lipid. Thus, the various lipoproteins which are isolated are derivatives of the one giant lipoprotein consisting of the lipid core and the associated protein components. IX. DEVICES FOR ELECTRON FLOW At present, three devices can be recognized by which oxidoreductions can take place between fixed components in a particle. These are: (1) molecular interactions between different functional groups of a polyfunctional protein; (2) the shuttle of small molecules between two fixed-protein components both of which are attached to the lipid core; (3) polymolecular units in which the individual functional groups are positioned in different directions to permit electrons to enter and leave at separate loci. Consider each one of these devices in turn. 1. The succinic dehydrogenase can be isolated as a single protein which contains three functional groups: (a) heme, (b) flavin, and (c) nonheme iron. Depending on the functional group, the succinic dehydrogenase can be described as either a flavoprotein, a cytochrome, or as a metalloprotein. Perhaps the best way is to describe the succinic dehydrogenase as a hemometalloflavoprotein. The discovery that heme is also a part of the succinic dehydrogenase was recently made in our laboratory by Ziegler and Doeg (36). When the succinic dehydrogenase is prepared 521I</page><page sequence="19">TABLE VIII POLYFUNCTIONAL ENZYMES Enzyme Functional Groups Xanthine oxidase flavin, Mo, Fe Pyruvic dehydrogenase thiamine, lipoic, Mg, flavin, CoA, DPN a-Ketoglutaric dehydrogenase thiamine, lipoic, Mg, flavin, CoA, DPN Succinic dehydrogenase flavin, Fe, heme Lactic dehydrogenase (yeast) flavin, Fe, heme DPNH dehydrogenase flavin, Fe Cytochrome oxidase heme, Cu FIG. 14. A diagrammatic representation of the shuttle role for coenzyme Q and cytochrome-c in the lipid core. by the classical method of Singer and Kearney (32), the heme group of the succinic dehydrogenase is split off from the enzyme protein. The interaction between the flavin and heme group of the succinic dehydrogenase is an intramolecular process probably mediated by the nonheme iron atoms associated with the dehydrogenase complex. Thus, one device for interaction of fixed components in a particle is that of a molecular unit in which two or more oxidation-reduction components asso- ciated with the same protein interact within the molecule. The xanthine and pyruvic oxidases are two other well-documented examples of such polyfunctional molecular units (cf. Table VIII). 2. The lipid core provides a second device (cf. Fig. 14). Coenzyme Q and cyto- chrome-c, both of which are relatively small molecules (M.W. 856 and 12,000, respectively), have the possibility of translation within the compartments of the lipid core. Entities of this type can accept electrons from the reduced form of one fixed protein component, attached to the lipid core, and then transfer electrons to the oxidized form of the next fixed component in the sequence, which is also attached to the lipid core. Thus, coenzyme Q can shuttle electrons from reduced flavin to cytochrome-cl while cytochrome-c can shuttle electrons from reduced cyto- chrome-c1 to cyctochrome-a. 3. Consider the problem posed by cytochrome-cl which accepts electrons from coenzyme Q and donates electrons to cytochrome-c. If cytochrome-cl is positioned in the particle, some special device must be operative to account for interaction of one and the same heme group with two different components, each of which is 522 GREEN</page><page sequence="20">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM TABLE IX MONOMERIC AND POLYMERIC FORMS OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SEQUENCE Component Solubility M.W.

The answer to this dilemma has come from some physical studies of cytochrome cl, a, and fD carried out by R. Bock and R. Criddle of the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Wisconsin (11). As summarized in Table IX, cytochrome-cl can be isolated in the form of a poly- molecular complex containing 5 to 6 molecules of the hemoprotein per unit (M.W. about 400,000). This polymolecular complex can be depolymerized by thioglycolate or dodecylsulfate to a unimolecular hemoprotein of M.W. 72,000. This poly- molecular character has been shown to be typical also of the DPNH dehydrogenase and of cytochrome-a, and may well be an attribute of all the fixed components of the electron-transport chain. If there is more than one heme group in a molecular-weight unit of cytochrome-c1, it should be possible for at least one of the heme groups to be positioned in the Q-compartment and one or more in the cytochrome-c compartment (cf. Fig. 15). Then, electrons can flow through internal links in polymeric cytochrome-cl from reduced coenzyme Q to cytochrome-c without any thermal oscillation and transla- tion of cytochrome-cl. The polymolecular structure of the fixed oxidation-reduction components of the electron-transport chain offers the third device for achieving oxido-reductions in a rigid particle. The multiple heme or flavin groups make it possible to have specialization of one of the prosthetic groups either as an entry point or as an exit point for electron flow, and this specialization would depend entirely on the positioning of the individual heme groups. This possibility has yet to be demonstrated experimentally, but it is exciting to think that the structural arrangement of the fixed oxidation-reduction components could permit such an elegant solution to the insuperable kinetic difficulty of having one molecule interact in a given order with each of three or more different molecules. It is recalled that both nonheme iron and copper are present in the electron- transport particle and in mitochondria. Nonheme iron is found to be a component of both highly purified succinic and DPNH dehydrogenases. Copper is a component of cytochrome oxidase, and with cytochrome-a it is one of the two functional groups in the enzyme.

The symbol "Fe" refers to the iron group of each of the 5 hemes in the cl polymeric unit. Dr. Richard Sands of the University of Michigan, obtained direct evidence from EPR studies that nonheme iron is reduced in the DPNH dehydrogenase in presence of substrate, whereas copper is reduced in the cytochrome oxidase by reduced cytochrome-c. Thus some, if not all, of the copper and iron atoms in the mito- chondrion have to be assigned some role in the electron-transport process. X. ELECTRON TRANSPORT AND OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION The discussion hereto has reached the outer frontier of present knowledge about the structure-function interrelationships of the electron-transport chain and of the mitochondrion. What light does the information which has accrued so far throw on the problem of the coupling mechanism? One fact stands out like the colossus of Rhodes, and that is the central position of lipid in the structure of the electron-transport system. Essentially all the key oxido-reductions in the chain take place within a lipid matrix. Even the most unimaginative cannot fail to take the hint of nature that the coupling reactions have to proceed in a nonaqueous medium and that the elaborate arrangement of the electron transfer chain is a device by which oxidoreductions can be conducted in a water-free medium. Pre- sumably, the intermediates of oxidoreduction which react with inorganic phosphate are stable in a lipid medium and, thus, the meaning of the molecular architecture of the mitochondrion has to be sought in terms of the necessity for conduction oxidore- ductions in a non-aqueous medium. In a sense the mitochondrion is an enclosed non-aqueous phase surrounded by water. There is a vast amount of work to be done before the full details of the coupling process are grasped; but I believe it is now clear how step by step this can be ap- proached, if not achieved. When one can specify which oxidoreduction components are involved in the coupling reactions and under what conditions these reactions 524</page><page sequence="22">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM proceed, the stage will be set for the physicist and the chemist to bring their talents to bear on the problem of the molecular and atomic mechanisms. I venture to predict that studies closely paralleling those now in progress on the mitochondrion will soon be extended to other biochemical machines, and each machine will be found to exhibit a molecular architecture uniquely designed for the implementation of a particular energy transformation.

DISCUSSION MCCLURE: At one point in your talk, Dr. Green, you mentioned that when the cristae are fragmented in a controlled fashion "bound" DPNH and some key enzymes essential for citric- 526</page><page sequence="24">MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM 527 cycle oxidations are lost. The resulting particle, however, can still couple the oxidation of succinate or DPNH to phosphorylation. Is it possible to restore to these particles the capacity to carry out the complete citric cycle by adding back the coenzymes and enzymes lost during fragmentation and comminution of the cristae? GREEN: As yet we have been unable to reverse this process. Reversal would in effect require reinserting the appropriate missing components within the interior of the torn bags of cristae and then repairing the rents. We have no idea yet how this could be accomplished. It would appear that the loss of citric-cycle oxidative capacity is a "Humpty-Dumpty" phenomenon. ORDAL: I am curious about the details of the process by which electrons from DPNH are transferred to the next component in the electron transfer sequence. In this transfer are the electrons accompanied by a proton? It has been shown by Vennesland and her colleagues that in the reduction of DPN by various substrates one of the two electrons transferred is invariably accompanied by a proton and this proton transfer is stereospecifically directed. The second electron is transferred without a proton-one hydrogen ion being released concomitant with the reduction. Does an analogous process take place when DPNH reduces the appropriate flavoprotein of which it is the substrate? GREEN: You have raised a very fundamental question. At which point or points in the elec- tron transfer process is electron transfer divorced from proton transfer? The divorce begins already at the stage at which DPN is reduced since only one of the two protons released from the reducing substrates is transferred to DPN. Your question specifically then is whether this marked proton in DPNH is transferred directly to the DPNH flavoprotein. The answer is we don't know. There are two stereochemical positions which the proton in question can occupy in DPNH and only when the proton has the correct stereochemical conformation can reduction of the flavoprotein by DPNH take place. But what happens to this proton is still a mystery. If the one-electron reduction of flavoprotein involved a simultaneous proton and electron transfer the method developed by Vennesland and Westheimer for demonstrating this process would be inapplicable since the proton in the reduced flavoprotein would equilibrate rapidly with water. There are some like Dixon in Cambridge, England who are skeptical whether electron transfer without concomitant proton transfer takes place anywhere in the electron transfer sequence. There is insufficient information at hand to do more than raise the question. ORDAL: Would you expect a proton transferred to a flavoprotein by a reductive process to be randomized with water immediately? GUNSALUS: The hydrogen atom in the flavin nucleus which is involved in oxidoreduction is so readily dissociable that it would equilibrate instantly with water. ORDAL: This may be very naive but I can't help but think in terms of hydrogen transfer along chains of lipids. GREEN: I have no information which would enable me to evaluate this interesting suggestion. FREED: To what extent have any changes been noticed in the particles themselves, in the lipid complexes, after oxidoreduction takes place. Does one notice any diffusion of foreign materials into the particle or of materials out of the particle? GREEN: If the oxidoreduction reactions are carried out in a suitable media in which the particles are stable there is probably very little change in composition of the particles. This is not to say that the concentration of small ions and water molecules in the particle may not change in the transition from reduced to oxidized states of the oxidation-reduction components of the particle. The studies of Lehninger and others suggest that extensive osmotic changes accompany oxidative processes in the mitochondrion.</page></plain_text>
