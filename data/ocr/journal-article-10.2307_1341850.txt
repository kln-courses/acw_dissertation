<plain_text><page sequence="1">FEDERALISM, POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE The American federal system protects against the abuse of govern- mental power by diffusing political power between state and federal governments. 1 This federal system, however, also provides the federal and state governments with incentives and opportunities to obscure which level of government is politically responsible for unpopular policy choices.2 Without clear lines of political accountability, the system cannot function according to its constitutional design, because the inability to identify the responsible level of government renders individuals less able to capitalize on the benefits of a dual system of government.3 The Supreme Court's recognition of this danger has led the Court to extend greater protection to states and the integrity of their decision-making processes in the name of clarifying lines of accountability. 4 Recent cases highlight this concern. For instance, in New York v. United States,5 the Court struck down a provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act on the ground that the Tenth Amend- ment bars Congress from compelling state legislatures to enact legis- lation mandated by the federal government.6 Similarly, in Gregory v. Ashcroft,7 the Court held that Congress may not upset the constitu- tionally presumed balance of state and federal power in the regulation of traditional state functions unless it provides a clear statement of such an intent, and thereby the Court made it more difficult for I By limiting the potential for the abuse of governmental power, federalism protects individ- ual liberty. Ann Althouse has described this proposition as a variant of normative federalism. According to Althouse, the "states are a means; the end is the liberty of their citizens. States are valuable alternative governments which have power because it benefits the people to diffuse power." Ann Althouse, Variations on a Theory of Normative Federalism: A Supreme Court Dialogue, 42 DUKE L.J. 979, 980 (I993). 2 As Althouse has noted, although the federal system was designed to maximize liberty, it can be abused by officials who try to "achieve their desired goals and to insulate themselves from voter wrath by making responsibility difficult to trace." Id. at ioi8 (emphasis added). When "[e]veryone could find someone else to blame" then "[c]ooperation yield[s] insulation," and the federal system has been abused. Id. 3 See id. at 989. 4 H. Jefferson Powell has referred to this development as the "autonomy of process principle." H. Jefferson Powell, The Oldest Question of Constitutional Law, 79 VA. L. REV. 633, 64I (I993). Powell writes that, in its fullest form, this concern with autonomous process "might be that a principled and viable law of federalism should be located not in the preclusion of federal regulation from some given set of problems or concerns, but in judicial oversight of congressional respect for the 'integrity' of the states as the possessors of autonomous governmental processes."

In South Dakota v. Dole,9 the Court allowed Congress great latitude to provide monetary "incentives" to encourage states to follow congressional policy.10 And in New York, despite striking down the "take title" provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act on grounds of federalism, the Court upheld two other provisions under the Spending Clause, even though these pro- visions raised accountability concerns strikingly similar to those of the "take title" provision. When Congress conditions the receipt of federal money on legis- lative action by the states, federal legislators can point to the state's voluntary decision to accept the funds as the decisive act. State legislators, on the other hand, have a persuasive claim that Congress never intended to offer the states a choice because the state could not, in practical terms, decline the much-needed federal funding.1" This potential for evasion of accountability undermines both the govern- ment's responsiveness to voter preferences and federalism's effective- ness as a check on the abuse of political power. The Court should therefore begin to review more carefully Congress's conditional grants of money pursuant to the Spending Clause to ensure that the Consti- tution's procedures and structural design are not being undermined by the evasion of political accountability. I. FEDERALISM AND POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY A. The Accountability Principle i. The Benefits of Federalism. - In Gregory v. Ashcroft,12 Justice O'Connor laid out the various benefits of a robust "federalist structure of joint sovereigns."'13 She noted that a federal system "assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen 8 See id. at 2400-0I. 9 483 U.S. 203 (I987). 10 See id. at 206-I I. 11 See Althouse, supra note I, at IOI7-I8 ("If people cannot locate the source of their distress . . .they will not know whom to vote out of office.

"14 Most importantly, the Court in Gregory noted that the "principal benefit of the federalist system is a check on abuses of government power. "15 In the same way that "separation and independence of the coordinate Branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one Branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front."'16 2. The Importance of Accountability. - In a federal system with varying levels of governmental power, dangerous incentives exist to pass responsibility for difficult political decisions to another decision- making body. The federal government may dictate unpopular policy decisions and then attempt to make the states appear responsible. Congress may also abdicate responsibility and leave to the courts the decision of whether to impose federal policy on the states in the absence of a clear congressional command. As John Hart Ely notes, on "hard issues our representatives quite shrewdly prefer not to have to stand up and be counted but rather" to let somebody else, in this case state legislators or administrators, "take the inevitable political heat. "17 As Lewis Kaden writes, congressional attempts to "'federaliz[e]' or 'commandee[r]' the basic decisionmaking processes of state govern- ments" offer "the appearance of cooperative federalism, a sharing of authority with the states over important areas of national concern. "18 What tends to happen in such instances, however, is that the "'layer cake' of federalism . . . become[s] increasingly 'marbled,"'"9 further obfuscating lines of accountability. Justice O'Connor has dubbed this problem one of "garbled political responsibility. "20 14 Gregory, III S. Ct. at 2399. 15 Id. at 2399-400; see also Kaden, supra note I3, at 855 ("[T]he case for a federal form rests most fundamentally on the capacity of a federal system to enhance and protect individual liberty.

Maintaining clear lines of political accountability at the federal and state levels has emerged as a primary way of ensuring the integrity of the Constitution's structural design.23 Most importantly, this prin- ciple of federalism does not apply only to select constitutional provi- sions, but rather underlies the entire constitutional structure.24 B. Federalism and Accountability in the Commerce Clause The Supreme Court's nearly unbounded approach to Congress's Commerce Clause power has been balanced by its insistence on pre- serving accountability in the federal structure. Since NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.25 and Wickard v. Filburn,26 the Supreme Court has treated congressional action under the Commerce Clause with enormous deference.27 Broadening the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause has resulted in diminished state control over areas that had traditionally been regulated at the state and local level. This transfer of power does not necessarily threaten accountability, because when Congress completely pre-empts tradi- ments to administer unpopular programs, thus transferring political liability for those programs to the States"). 21 Kaden, supra note I3, at 857. 22 ELY, supra note I7, at I32; see also Richard B.

Although the Court has largely abandoned attempts to limit the scope of federal intervention, it has strived to ensure that Congress exercises its broad power in such a way that Congress can readily be held accountable. New York v. United States addresses the first form of evasion and protects state legislative processes from federal intru- sion, and Gregory v. Ashcroft addresses the second to ensure that the political process has worked properly if Congress intervenes in the regulation of traditional state functions. In both cases, the Court has placed a check on Congress's ability to obscure, either purposefully or incidentally, lines of political accountability. 29 i. The Structure and Process of Federalism. - In New York, the Court found the "take title" provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to be objectionable because it essentially directed state legislatures either to enact federally prescribed methods for waste disposal or, in the alternative, to take title to privately generated waste. Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, objected to this scheme because if "the Federal Government compels States to regu- late, the accountability of both state and federal officials is dimin- ished."30 If the citizens of New York, she reasoned, do not place a high priority on regulating the disposal of nuclear waste, they may elect state officials who will focus on other issues. Congress always has the authority, under the Commerce Clause, to pre-empt state regulation and to federalize the disposal of nuclear waste, "but in such a case it is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out to be detrimental or un- popular. "31 However, "where the Federal Government directs the 28 See New York v. United States, II2 S. Ct. 2408, 2424 (I992). 29 As Professor Powell writes, Justice O'Connor's "federalism is one of process, not of substance." Powell, supra note 4, at 658. If this is true, it is difficult to see why procedural concerns would not apply with just as much force to the Spending Clause. New York provides that the means by which Congress achieves its ends are just as important as the ends themselves and lends authority for a constraint on congressional spending power. 30 New York, II2 S. Ct. at 2424. The Constitution forbids this type of legislation, the Court held, because "Congress may not simply 'commandee[r] the legislative process of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program."' Id. at 2420 (quoting Hodel v. Virginia Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264, 288 (I98I)). Thus, "even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts."

Conversely, state officials will likely prefer to have Congress direct the choice of a location, in order to evade direct responsibility.36 New York imposes barriers against such attempts to alter the "'constitutionally mandated balance of power' between the States and the Federal Government"37 by preventing Congress from pushing political responsibility onto the states for unpopular decisions.38 "less intrusive" than "[c]ongressional compulsion of state agencies," because "unlike pre-emption, [compulsion] blurs the lines of political accountability and leaves citizens feeling that their representatives are no longer responsive to local needs." FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 787 (I982) (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). Similarly, Professor Stewart finds federal pre-emption unobjectionable because "[i]ndividuals and firms are subjects of national authority, and the national political arena is their only remedy for the asserted stupidity or inequity of Congress's otherwise valid exercises of the commerce power." Stewart, supra note 22, at I223. On the other hand, he writes, "the matter would be very different were Congress to invoke the commerce power as a justification for compelling state and local governments to implement federal . . . policies."

Kaden, supra note I3, at 857.</page><page sequence="7">I994] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE I425 2. Accountability, Federalism, and Federal Regulation of State Functions. - The Supreme Court has also emphasized political ac- countability when considering the extent of Congress's power to reg- ulate traditional state functions under the Commerce Clause. The concern here is not that Congress is transferring responsibility for unpopular political decisions to the states, as in New York, but that Congress is intruding on core state functions without assuming full responsibility. In these cases, Congress fails to make clear whether it intends to include states within the scope of generally applicable fed- eral regulation and thus leaves the courts responsible for the final decision. Motivated in part by accountability concerns, the Court has established a clear statement rule to ensure that Congress has considered the ramifications of regulating core state functions and that Congress has acknowledged its responsibility for changing the tradi- tional allocation of authority. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,39 the Court held that the "principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action - the built-in re- straints that our system provides through state participation in federal government action."40 The Court declined the role that it had as- sumed in National League of Cities v. Usery,41 of guardian of core sovereign state functions, and held that state sovereignty is "more properly protected by procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal system than by judicially created limitations on federal power."42 The states were thus left with "the political safeguards of federalism" as their primary, if not sole, defense against congressional intrusion into state affairs under the Commerce Clause.43 The Garcia Court premised its opinion, in large part, on account- ability concerns. Justice Blackmun, writing for the Court, noted that "[a]ny rule of state immunity that looks to the 'traditional,' 'integral,' 39 469 U.S. 528 (I985). 40 Id. at 556. 41 426 U.S. 833 (I976). 42 Garcia, 469 U.S. at 552; see also Herbert Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 COLUM.

Garcia, 469 U.S. at 556. Nevertheless, the Court in Garcia did not foreclose the possibility of "affirmative limits [that] the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause." Id. (citing Coyle v. Oklahoma, 22I U.S. 559 (I9iI)). New York v. United States may be considered such an independent affirmative constitutional limit.</page><page sequence="8">I426 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. I07:I4I9 or 'necessary' nature of governmental functions inevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state poli- cies it favors and which ones it dislikes."44 Further, "[a]ny such rule ... disserves principles of democratic self-governance, and . . breeds inconsistency precisely because it is divorced from those principles."45 Garcia thus established that Congress would be the political body with ultimate authority to regulate "traditional" state functions. In Gregory v. Ashcroft,46 the Court endeavored to ensure that voters would readily be able to hold Congress accountable when it exercises this power.47 The Court in Gregory held that, if "Congress intends to upset the 'usual constitutional balance [of power] between the States and the Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so 'unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."'48 Because Con- gress's broad power to regulate the states under the Commerce Clause is "an extraordinary power in a federalist system," the Court "must assume" that it is a "power that . . . Congress does not exercise lightly. "49 Gregory stands for the important proposition that, if the Consti- tution is to rely on the "political safeguards of federalism" as the key protector of state interests, then the Court must ensure that those safeguards have operated properly. As the Court recognized earlier in United States v. Bass,50 "[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance of power, the requirement of [a] clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the ju- dicial decision."'51 Professor Tribe has also argued that "[a] rule like the clear statement requirement is . . . essential: Congress must be prevented from resorting to ambiguity as a cloak for its failure to 44 Garcia, 469 U.S. at 546. 45 Id. at 547. 46 II, S.

See Gregory, iii S. Ct. at 2406. 48 Gregory, iii S. Ct. at 240I (quoting Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 49I U.S. 58, 65 (I989) (quoting Atascadero State Hosp. v.

The Court has applied the clear statement rule in other areas in which federalism principles are at stake. For instance, the Court has held that because of the absence of a clear statement of congressional intent, a state will not be considered a suable "person" under 42 U.S.C. ? I983. See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 49I U.S. 58, 65 (I989) ("The language of ?

(citations omitted)).</page><page sequence="9">I994] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE I427 accommodate the competing interests bearing on the federal-state bal- ance."52 Moreover, notes Professor Tribe, "[t]o give the state-displac- ing weight of federal law to mere congressional ambiguity would evade the very procedure for lawmaking on which Garcia relied to protect states' interests."53 Thus, after Garcia and Gregory, the lines of accountability are clear with respect to Congress's Commerce Clause power over tradi- tional state functions. Congress retains broad power to regulate state functions, limited almost solely by the political process. If Congress wants to exercise that power, however, it must demonstrate that the political process has functioned effectively and indicate that Congress is accountable for disturbing the ordinary, constitutionally presumed balance of power between the federal and state governments. II. FEDERALISM, THE SPENDING POWER, AND CONDITIONAL GRANTS The Supreme Court's heightened interest in federalism as a check on federal power, and its concomitant concern with political account- ability, indicates that congressional power under the Spending Clause needs to be reevaluated. The Court's opinion in South Dakota v. Dole54 and its treatment of the conditional grants (as opposed to the "take title" provision) in New York v. United States55 each failed to consider serious accountability and federalism questions in the Spend- ing Clause context and reaffirmed Congress's expansive power to in- fluence state decisionmaking through conditional grants of aid to the states. The Court premises this deference, argues Lewis Kaden, on the "strength of the familiar recitation" that, because "the states had the option to forego the federal payments rather than meet the federal standards, the statute induced but did not compel the state re- sponse. "56 The current Spending Clause test, as articulated in Dole and New York, tends to overemphasize the conditional grant's content and vir- tually ignores its structural consequences. To ensure clear lines of political accountability, the focus should be shifted away from the substantive scope of what Congress may condition and toward struc- tural concerns. Increased accountability will guarantee that Congress is not merely trying to evade the legislative bar of New York and the 52 TRIBE, supra note 27, ? 5-8, at 3I7. 53 Id. ? 6-25, at 480. 54 483 U.S. 203 (I987). 55 The Court in New York, although holding that Congress may not "commandeer" state legislatures, upheld two other provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act under the Spending Clause.

A. The Origins of Congress's Spending Power Congress's spending power derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause i of the Constitution, which states that "The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."57 Modern Spending Clause analysis originated in United States v. Butler,58 the last case in which the Supreme Court actually struck down a conditional grant because it violated the Spending Clause.59 In Butler, the Court read the Spend- ing Clause expansively, holding that Congress's spending power is not restricted to the affirmative powers listed in Article I, Section 8, but rather is limited only by the requirement that expenditures be made in the "general welfare."60 This concession granted Congress virtually unbounded power to spend, and the breadth of this power has been extended to Congress's capacity to place conditions on states interested in receiving these expenditures. The Court adopted a more deferential approach in Steward Ma- chine Co. v. Davis.61 In Steward, the Court upheld the federal un- employment compensation scheme, whereby Congress laid a federal tax on employers, which was then returned to the states as unem- ployment compensation; to receive such funds, a state had to meet federally mandated conditions.62 Justice Cardozo, writing for the Court, established a presumption, which prevails to this day, that as long as a state has an option not to participate in the federal program, the state legislature has not been compelled or coerced. "Till now," he wrote, "the law has been guided by a robust common sense which assumes the freedom of the will as a working hypothesis in the solution of its problems."63 57 U.S. CONST. art.

Justice Cardozo went even further, however, questioning whether the concept of "undue influence" through a conditional grant could "ever be applied with fitness to the relations between state and nation." Id. Justice Cardozo did provide an escape hatch, which has never been utilized. He noted that although the facts of Steward did not present such a case, there may be a "point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be induce- ment," which would present "a question of degree, - at times, perhaps, of fact." Id.</page><page sequence="11">I994] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE I429 This strong presumption of consent jeopardizes accountability prin- ciples because it affords Congress the ability to create the appearance that states are voluntarily choosing to adopt federal programs. This presumption provides an effective mechanism, as well as a strong incentive, for Congress to shift political responsibility for programs to the states by creating situations in which the state in practice cannot refuse the federal dollar and in which state legislatures receive the blame for controversial federal programs. Justice Cardozo justified this deference in part on the ground that equating inducement with coercion would "plunge the law in endless difficulties."64 He stated that "[t]he outcome of such a doctrine is the acceptance of a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes impossible."65 As Ann Althouse notes, however, the complexity of the task is insufficient to justify deference to arguably unconstitutional congressional action,66 because it is necessary to ensure that "the conditions that warranted judicial restraint [in the first place] continue to exist."67 i. The Current Test. - The Court articulated the current doctrinal framework for Spending Clause analysis in South Dakota v. Dole and New York v. United States. Dole, which held that Congress may condition receipt of federal highway funds upon state enactment of a twenty-one year old age limit for alcohol consumption, reaffirmed Butler's core holding that "objectives not thought to be within Article I's 'enumerated legislative fields,' . . . may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds."68 In Dole, Chief Justice Rehnquist laid down a four-part test for evaluating conditional grants. First, "the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of 'the general welfare."'69 This first prong provides virtually no limitation, because courts generally defer to Congress's determination of whether a program promotes the general welfare, and Rehnquist even noted that "[t]he level of deference to the congressional decision is such that the Court has more recently 64 Id. at 590. 65 Id. 66 See Althouse, supra note i, at I002. 67 Id. at 1002-03 ("[A]long with restraint comes an ongoing obligation to assess the validity of that restraint. . . .

"'71 Dole's clear statement rule, how- ever, fails to clarify lines of political accountability in the way that the clear statement rule of Gregory does. Gregory addressed the prob- lem of direct federal regulation of state functions; a clear statement rule thus requires Congress to proclaim that Congress itself is respon- sible for the action. In the Spending Clause context, however, the clear statement rule serves only to notify the states of the ramifications of accepting federal funds. In this regard, the clear statement rule serves a valuable function by ensuring that Congress will not attempt to impose extra, unexpected requirements on the states through am- biguous conditions. It does not effectively clarify lines of political accountability, however, because it avoids the question whether the federal or state government is ultimately responsible for the policy, and thereby fails to prevent the federal government from co-opting state legislative processes through conditional grants. Third, conditions on federal grants "might be illegitimate if they are unrelated 'to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs."'72 This test has been criticized for being too deferential, and some commentators question whether the inquiry makes sense if the Court is satisfied that the state has voluntarily consented.73 Fur- ther, Chief Justice Rehnquist declined to "define the outer bounds of the 'germaneness' or 'relatedness' limitation."74 Finally, the Dole Court noted that "other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds."75 Chief Justice Rehnquist took much of the bite out of this fourth test by stating that it stands only for the proposition that Congress may not entice the states to violate the Constitution. Con- gress is not forbidden, however, from using the spending power to achieve indirectly objectives that the Constitution forbids Congress to achieve directly.76 Despite its narrow scope, this fourth test might 70 Id. at 207 n.2. 71 Id. at 207 (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v.

United States's ac- countability concerns into the Spending Clause context, because New York itself found an independent constitutional bar to certain methods of congressional action. The Dole framework provides Congress great leeway in achieving its objectives through conditional grants. One reason for this latitude is that the Dole test ignores important questions about federal-state relations and, in particular, does little to address the accountability concerns that motivated New York and Gregory. Even Justice O'Con- nor, in her Dole dissent, focused almost exclusively on the "related- ness" requirement, without addressing whether Congress's conditional grant allowed Congress to avoid accountability for the potentially unpopular or unconstitutional move of tinkering with minimum drink- ing ages. Justice O'Connor rightly argued that a stricter relatedness requirement would provide a check on congressional overreaching, without which Congress may be able to "regulate almost any area of a State's social, political, or economic life on the theory that use of the interstate transportation system is somehow enhanced."77 The relatedness analysis, however, focuses too much on what is being regulated and not enough on how Congress attempts to regulate. Surely Congress could regulate a wide variety of local concerns under the Commerce Clause. The problem is that Congress may purpose- fully avoid accountability by requiring the states, through their leg- islative apparatus, to implement federal policies. Remarkably, the Court in New York ignored these very concerns when it reviewed two provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act promulgated under the Spending Clause - in the same opinion in which it relied upon principles of political accountability in striking down the analogous "take title" provision under the Tenth Amendment. Indeed, the Court found no accountability problems in the conditional grants in New York, primarily because under these grants "the residents of the State retain the ultimate decision as to whether or not the State will comply."78 If the people of a state disagree with federal policy, the Court asserted, they may simply refuse the federal grant.79 The Court also noted that conditional grants represent a legitimate way, "short of outright coercion," in which Congress may "urge" or "influenc[e]" a state to follow federal policy. 80 New York thus not only held true to Justice Cardozo's pre- sumption of free will in Steward, but also further entrenched this 77 Id. at 2I5 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). 78 New York, I I2 S.

The Court's broad assumption that accountability is not sacrificed in the Spending Clause context thus undermined a primary rationale for heightened scrutiny of federal regulation that impinges on state legislative processes. B. The Presumption of Consent Since Steward, the Supreme Court has generally validated condi- tional grants on the theory that such grants leave each state with the option to comply or to chart its own course. This presumption plays a major role in undermining accountability in the Spending Clause context because it assumes away the potential for federalism and accountability problems, even though the Court has applied height- ened scrutiny in other constitutional areas in which principles of fed- eralism were jeopardized. Whether coercion exists in any given case is, as Justice Cardozo indicated, a difficult question of fact and of degree.81 The important point is that the Court's presumption of free will has resulted in deferential and cursory review of conditional grants despite the threat they pose to federalism.82 The Court's strong presumption in favor of true consent by the states is shaky in its own right.83 As the Court recognized in United States v. Butler, conditions can be unduly coercive. Indeed, in Butler, the Court rejected the government's claims of "voluntary cooperation"84 and declared that "[t]he power to confer or withhold unlimited benefits is the power to coerce or destroy."85 The Court refused to rely on the recipient's theoretical ability to decline the government's offer, noting that "[t]he asserted power of choice is il- 81 See Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 30I U.S. 548, 590 (I937). 82 Professor Richard Stewart writes: Debating whether conditions on federal grants in these circumstances 'coerce' the states is an unhelpful anthropomorphism. The structure of the federal system under current social and economic conditions makes it inevitable that states will become subject to the federal spending power . . . The question ... [is] whether [federal requirements] unduly compromise a normative political conception of state autonomy. Stewart, supra note 22, at I254. Kathleen Sullivan agrees that coercion "is not an empirical concept but [rather] a narrative one that necessarily refers to values lying beyond the value of autonomy itself." Kathleen Sullivan, Unconstitutional Conditions, I02 HARV. L. REV. I4I3, I506 (I989). Sullivan, unlike Cardozo, would not simply presume that coercion is absent, but rather would acknowledge the coercion and err on the side of protecting the recipient of the government benefit. See id. at I500-03. 83 Professor Sullivan concludes that South Dakota v. Dole provides an example of "the worst mistake in current unconstitutional conditions analysis," namely that a coercive conditional grant to the states was "immunized on the theory that government has committed no coercive act." Sullivan, supra note 82, at I50I. 84 United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. I, 70 (I936). 85 Id. at 7I.</page><page sequence="15">I994] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE I433 lusory,"86 and that the recipient is in reality "given no choice, except a choice between the rock and the whirlpool."87 In addition, there often exist powerful indicators of congressional intent to set "incentives" at an optimal level, just "short of outright coercion," to ensure that all states comply. In Butler, the Court found the price for not complying with federal conditions to be problematic because "[t]he amount offered is intended to be sufficient to exert pressure . . . to agree to the proposed regulation,"88 As Professor William Van Alstyne writes, Congress sets the incentive "at just the 'right' level . . . and, accordingly, no state tends very long to resist. "89 In FERC v. Mississippi,90 the Court mentioned this concern but did not find it controlling. The Court in FERC upheld a federal regula- tory scheme partially on the basis that the states were not being coerced because Congress put to the states a choice: "abandoning regulation of the field altogether or considering the federal stan- dards."91 The Court recognized that the decision "may be a difficult one," but held that "it cannot be constitutionally determinative that the federal regulation is likely to move the States to act in a given way, or even to 'coerc[e] the States' into assuming a regulatory role by affecting their 'freedom to make decisions in areas of 'integral governmental functions."'92 Justice O'Connor, in a separate opinion, described the Court's "choice" as an "absurdity" and claimed that "there is nothing 'cooperative' about a federal program that compels state agencies either to function as bureaucratic puppets of the Federal Government or to abandon regulation of an entire field traditionally reserved to state authority."93 Finally, the significance that the Court has placed on a state's ability to consent should not immunize conditional grants from judicial review, because there are nonwaivable principles of federalism at issue. In fact, the existence of an opportunity to consent obscures the real issue because "[w]here Congress exceeds its authority relative to the States . . . the departure from the constitutional plan cannot be ratified by the 'consent' of state officials."94 If the congressional ma- 86 Id. 87 Id. at 72. 88 Id. at 70-7I- 89 William Van Alstyne, "Thirty Pieces of Silver" for the Rights of Your People: Irresistible Offers Reconsidered as a Matter of State Constitutional Law, i6 HARV.

Attempts to validate uncon-</page><page sequence="16">I434 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. I07:I4I9 neuver is really an attempt to shift the constitutional balance between state and federal power in a way that obscures responsibility, the attempt should fail, regardless of whether Congress affords the states an opportunity to consent to the scheme. The presumption of consent in the Spending Clause context means that the Court is willing to leave the states with nothing more than the political process to protect state interests.95 In this regard, the status of the Spending Clause resembles that of the Commerce Clause after Garcia. However, in the Commerce Clause context since Garcia, the Court has clarified congressional power through Gregory and New York to foster political accountability and to ensure that the political safeguards of federalism are working properly. No similar heightening of scrutiny has occurred in the spending context after Dole. What the Court has failed to recognize is that "[i]n the kind of case where Congress is buying conduct in excess of its legislative powers rather than overtly regulating in excess of its legislative pow- ers, one cannot count on the political process to serve as an effective restraint."96 Voters are simply less able to identify abuse of federal power in conditional grants than in instances of direct regulation.97 Further, "an overarching problem with relying on the political process in the Dole situation is that the actual workings of the process are not evident to the body politic," and Congress is able to insulate itself from the electorate.98 "It is true that in a perfectly efficient political system this will be understood, and pressure ultimately will be brought to bear on the federal legislature. In practice, however, this is a thin reed on which to stake American federalism."99 stitutional shifts of power to the Congress via presidential consent have similarly been rejected. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 9I9, 944-59 (I983); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. i, II8-37 (I976). 95 See McCoy &amp; Friedman, supra note 67, at I23-25. 96 Id. at I24. 97 See id. 98 Id. at I25. 99 Id. Placing further restrictions on Congress's Spending Clause power will likely limit Congress's ability to implement federal policy because "the cumbersome and intrusive character of direct federal controls" would likely deter congressional implementation. Stewart, supra note 22, at I240. This result, however, should not be used to justify undermining the Constitution's structural design. As Stewart notes, public opposition to "unwieldy and expensive" direct federal control "can be understood as a further 'political safeguard of federalism' which Congress should not be permitted to circumvent by saddling local officials with responsibility for implementing programs for which Congress should be directly responsible, and which Congress would not enact if it bore that responsibility." Id. at I24I. For Stewart, such circumvention is "doubly objectionable," for "not only does it undermine mechanisms of local political accountability by coercing state officials to impose locally unpopular measures, but it also weakens the political accountability of federal officials by deflecting to state and local governments much of the onus for federal initiatives." Id.</page><page sequence="17">I994] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SPENDING CLAUSE I435 C. Changing Focus The Court has reviewed congressional authority in the Commerce and Spending Clause contexts with different levels of deference. In the commerce context, the Court has reasserted the importance of state sovereignty and has emphasized accountability. This emphasis preserves the federal structure as a means of diffusing power and increasing individual liberty; it also prevents federalism from being abused as a multi-layer governmental scheme for shifting political responsibility. Yet, in the spending context, the Court has exercised great deference toward congressional policy determinations and has largely avoided consideration of the extent to which Congress can avoid, or at least diffuse, political accountability by creating the ap- pearance that states are voluntarily adopting federal policy. The focus on whether Congress has afforded states the opportunity to opt out of federal programs and the focus on the relatedness of the conditions to the program obscures more fundamental structural con- siderations. First, the Court's consent analysis really amounts to noth- ing more than a formal inquiry; anything "short of outright coercion"100 is apparently immune from meaningful review. Second, the focus on relatedness misses the point, because it looks to the substance of what Congress is trying to effectuate through a condi- tional grant, much of which Congress can do directly under the Com- merce Clause anyway. Instead, the Court should refocus its consid- eration on structural concerns and ensure that state legislatures are making decisions for which they should be held accountable, or that they are being completely preempted, and thus left free to address other concerns. According to Justice O'Connor, a state's ability to make policy independently is crucial to state sovereignty. "[T]he power to make decisions and to set policy," she writes, "is what gives the State its sovereign nature."101 Although she did not raise this concern in Dole or in the Spending Clause analysis of New York, Justice O'Connor has written that "[t]he power to make decisions and set policy . . . embraces more than the ultimate authority to enact laws; it also includes the power to decide which proposals are most worthy of consideration, the order in which they should be taken up, and the precise form in which they should be debated."'102 She concludes that '0 New York v.

Justice O'Connor has argued against such maneuvers as violative of the constitutionally mandated balance between federal and state governments; this concern should now be extended to the Spend- ing Clause context. III. CONCLUSION The Constitution's federal design protects against the abuse of governmental power by diffusing that power between the federal and state governments. The Supreme Court has established that, in order for this federal system to operate properly, citizens must be able to identify which level of government is responsible for policy choices. Although conditional grants of federal money under the Spending Clause may provide useful opportunities to engage in cooperative federalism, such grants may also serve to obfuscate lines of political accountability and to provide opportunities for federal and state leg- islators to avoid responsibility. Principles of federalism, as expounded in New York and Gregory, call for a reevaluation of Spending Clause analysis as well as for heightened sensitivity to the ways in which conditional grants create impediments to political accountability. 103 Id. at 785. 104 Kaden, supra note I3, at 889. 105 Id.</page></plain_text>
