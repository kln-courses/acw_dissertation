The Biology of Mosses. ix + 220 pages. 72 figures. Halsted Press, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1981. Price: $29.95 (paper). ISBN 0-470-27190-6. There has long been an acute need for small paperbacks that would bring together some of the more interesting and significant aspects of the general biology of bryophytes. Bryology is all too often identified with the mere collection and naming of mosses and liverworts. Textbook information on the subject is generally limited to details of life history, classification, structure, and morphology. There are few, if any, parallel reading sources to which students and others can be directed for information on physiology, ecology, cytology, genetics, and other biological features of these plants. Watson's The Structure and Life of Bryophytes is useful and serviceable, but it contains more struc- ture than life. Parihar's small volume, "Bryophyta," was intended only as a morphological and anatomical reference source, for which it serves admirably, but it is not a book that generates much interest or excitement. Howard Crum has collected the most piquant assemblage of peripheral infor- mation about mosses in his charmingly written Mosses of the Great Lakes Forest, but these eye- catching tidbits are so randomly and unpredictably scattered through an otherwise taxonomic treat- ment that they are virtually unretrievable. The Biology of Mosses, which is the subject of this review, is, therefore, a welcome and altogether refreshing addition to our slim inventory of books of this sort. It is somewhat ironic that the author, Dr. D.H.S. Richardson, Professor of Botany, Trinity College, Dublin, is a lichenologist. Author of a somewhat similar book on lichens, Richardson has brought together an assemblage of attractive and absorbing topics on mosses. The chapter titles disclose the variety and nature of the subjects treated: Structure, History and Illustration; Water Relations; Photosynthesis, Temperature and Nu- trients; Sex and Cytogenetics; Capsules and Spore Dispersal; Spores and Protonemata; Moss-Animal Associations; Mosses and Micro-organisms; Ecology; Air Pollution; Monitoring and Geobotanical Prospecting; and Mosses and Man. Each chapter has a useful listing of references, while an appendix contains a classification of the "true" mosses (Bryopsida) and includes a characterization of each order according to shoots, leaves, leaf cells, seta, capsule, peristome, and calyptra. A short glossary, containing a strange mixture of specialized and ordinary biological terms (it hardly seems necessary to have included words such as chromosome, hybrid, haploid, and the like), and an index conclude the work. The subject matter is carefully chosen, generally according to how interesting or how fascinating the author thinks it might be. The entire book is structured to capture the interest of the reader, and, if in places it seems shallow and the writing forced, one is inclined to forgive. I am less inclined to overlook his frequent lapses into anthropomorphism but this kind of writing is so commonplace nowadays that it almost passes unnoticed, much to the detriment of science. Nevertheless, the book contains a lot of captivating information. The chapter on moss-animal associations deals with pala- tibility of mosses, lists animal consumers, both vertebrate and invertebrate, discusses protection and camouflage (including an account of certain leaf-eating weevils in New Guinea that cultivate algae, lichens, mosses, and liverworts on their backs), and a short mention of the nutritive value of mosses. The chapter on ecology differs from most discussions; it discusses hot springs, lakes, rock-building, sea water, sand, deserts, fire, and forests. Considerable attention is given to the use of mosses in monitoring pollution, including methods, and to the so-called monitoring of metals through copper mosses and other indicators. The chapter on mosses and man goes a bit beyond the usual and much exaggerated use of Sphagnum dressings during World War I, and mercifully omits its use by Eskimos for diapers. Included are some interesting notes on archeological and paleobotanical aspects of mosses, a timely discussion of the exploitation of peat deposits, the use of mosses in house construction, as mattresses, lamp wicks, poultices, decorations for women's hats, among others. Many of the illustrations were taken from early works on mosses and, contrary to the publisher's blurb on the back cover, detract greatly from the book's appeal. The drawings are lifeless, drab and poorly reproduced. These antiquated drawings contrast mightily with the elegant photographs of living mosses by M.C.F. Proctor and the lovely scanning electron micrographs furnished by Exeter Uni- versity's Department of Biological Sciences and by Aune Koponen. There is a gorgeous photograph, provided by J. D. Shorthouse, showing a snow scorpionfly with its proboscis buried in a moss cell.</page><page sequence="2">1982] REVIEWS 275 These and other attractive photographs compensate somewhat for the poor quality of the line draw- ings. Certain areas of the book might have been improved, although personal likes and dislikes influence critical appraisals. Peristome development and movement are, for example, inadequately and perhaps inaccurately presented. The author strains to bring in economic or even cosmic significance to a group of plants that are notoriously banal in their import. Like Boreus, that feeds upon them, it is enough that they are there, a part of the world we live in. In the main, however, the author has succeeded with this book and he deserves high praise for providing us with a most useful contribution to the field of study. It is an excellent book for the general biologist or allied scientist, whether student, professional, or layman. The book should certainly be on the parallel reading list of every course in general biology or general botany as well as morphology and diversity courses. It is useless, anymore, to comment about the high cost of books. Nevertheless, this small paper- back of 220 pages, is outrageously priced.-LEWIs E.
