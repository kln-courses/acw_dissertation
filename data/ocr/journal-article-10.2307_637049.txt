<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL QUARTERLY JANUARY, 1930. PLATO AND ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION (Continued from p. 154.) IT is clear, then, that Plato's strictures on Homer ought not to have given any encouragement to allegorical interpretation. The eulogists of Homer ought to have sought other grounds for the defence which he invited them to make;1 while the allegorizing philosophers, if they persisted in treating inter- pretation of the poets as an instrument of knowledge, ought to have answered Plato not by multiplying allegories but by producing a defence of the allegori- cal method. The question with which we are concerned is, of course, not what ought to have been done, but what actually happened. But the foregoing con- siderations ought to warn us against assuming without evidence that all those who allegorized after Plato did so in order to answer his attack on the poets, and were directly incited by that attack to engage in allegorical interpretation. The fact that the early Stoics were prolific in such interpretations is in itself no proof that they intended in this way to answer Plato's criticism of the myths. Other evidence is required to prove that it was the desire to answer Plato which impelled them to wallow in allegory. It is true that in much later times there were those who wrote against Plato on behalf of Homer, and that for some of them at least (as we learn from Dion Chrysostomus2), the question to be decided was whether Plato was right in his treatment of Homer because the myths are immoral, or wrong because the myths are not immoral but contain physical doctrines. Some of the com- pilers of allegorical collections attacked Plato, others did not.3 Of those who considered allegory an answer to Plato, the first-century rhetorician who goes by the name of Heraclitus may be taken as a fair specimen. To justify the allegorical method, he relies on the following considerations: some passages of Homer-like the description of the growth of Eris-are obviously allegorical, therefore all the myths are allegories. Again, Heraclitus and Empedocles who wrote in mythical style were philosophers, therefore Homer, since he wrote in mythical style, was also a philosopher who veiled his teachings in myth and riddle.4 The nature of these 'arguments' is really an indication that there was no such thing as a philosophic defence of allegory on which Heraclitus could draw. The early Stoics who contributed or transmitted so many allegories to our collections cannot have exercised their minds in the defence of the allegorical method. But what philosophy did Homer teach? According to 1 Rep. 60o7d. 2 Dion LIII. 3.

A</page><page sequence="2">2 J.TATE Heraclitus, he taught not only a great deal of Stoicism, but also the distinctive tenets of any and every school of thought. Plato had no right to condemn Homer, because it was Homer who supplied the dogmas of Platonism. The resulting mass of self-contradictions to be found in Homer appears to Heracli- tus, and others of his stamp, to redound to the honour and glory of the poet. Is such a reply to Plato to be taken as representing the views of great Stoics like Chrysippus? The early Stoics looked in Homer for the right answers to the problems of the universe. It is not likely that they found all the wrong ones too; or, if they did, it is improbable that they would have con- gratulated the poet on his versatility. It would be rash, in any case, to father upon the Stoics the views of Heraclitus, who shows small grasp of Stoicism and smaller powers of reasoning. Further, it is significant that it is the gram- marians, not the philosophers, whom Seneca blamed for teaching that Homer taught every type of philosophy. It is significant, too, that Plutarch regards the etymologies of Cleanthes and Chrysippus as belonging properly, not to philosophy, but to the specialized studies of the grammarians. The most prob- able theory is that the allegories of the Stoics had been, at least from the time of Crates, more and more appropriated by those grammarians who believed in the existence of the deeper meanings, and were not averse from loading the poet with indiscriminate praise. The little work of Cornutus on Greek theology offers some confirmation. This mainly etymological treatise refers us, for a fuller account of the subject, not to any recent work of philosophers or grammarians, but to the 'older philosophers,' that is, to the early Stoics. It looks as if Cornutus were attempting to revive among philosophic circles an interest in a subject which by this time had fallen into unphilosophic hands. At any rate this reference to the wrpeo-t;'rpot uXMa-o oi leaves no doubt that Cornutus drew mainly from Cleanthes and Chrysippus, to the former of whom he elsewhere refers by name.1 Accordingly (though, as I have shown elsewhere, his attitude towards the poets was not exactly that of the early Stoics) he has a better title to speak for Stoicism than grammarians like Heraclitus, whose interpretations are by no means all consistent with Stoicism. In him we find not a word about Plato, not a word about the defensive function of allegory, and not a word in defence of the allegorical method. The myths, or parts of them, lend themselves to allegorical treatment on Stoic lines. This is sufficient proof for Cornutus that the myth-makers had philosophic intentions. Prob- ably it was sufficient also for the early Stoics. So far, then, as the late collec- tions of allegories are concerned, we are entitled to conclude that the early Stoics did not allegorize to answer Plato's attacks on the myths, but rather to support their own position by the testimony of the poets. This conclusion may be confirmed by another argument. There is a measure of agreement between the Stoic and the Platonic view of poetry. The true poet is, for Plato, philosopher as well as poet; he must know the truth. The Stoics agreed: 'the wise man alone is poet.'2 Homer not being 1 35 (P. 76, 7, Lang), 31 (64, 16). Persius is of Chrysippus. said to have bequeathed to him about 700 books 2 Strabo I. 2, 3.</page><page sequence="3">PLATO AND ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION 3 the ideal wise man is not omniscient. Chrysippus himself on occasion dis- sented from the poet's views.1 Hence the Stoics, though no doubt they held that the ancient poets were very wise men,2 are not in the same position as those extreme eulogists of Homer censured by Plato, who assigned to the poet knowledge of all things divine and human. Hence, too, their views must not be confounded with those of the later Homeric partisans, of whom I have taken Heraclitus as a sample. Moreover, though they corroborated their dogmas by interpreting the myths, they would scarcely have admitted, that, as Heraclitus seems to think, they had taken their philosophy bodily from Homer. They did not base their views solely on the authority of the poets; they did not depend on the work of interpretation as an instrument of attain- ing truth. Their allegories were no essential part of their philosophy. Hence it is that they did not attempt a fixed system of allegorical interpretation. More than one explanation of the same myth might be offered even by the same philosopher. Therefore in practice they admitted much of what Plato said about the interpretation of the poets-that it lacks fixed rules and is inconclusive in its results. It is indeed possible that they thought their use of the opinions of the poets in no way different from that in which Plato himself indulged. It differed indeed only because they took the practice much more seriously, and finding that the poets agreed so well with their own pantheistic system they had all the greater esteem both for their system and for the poets themselves. It follows once more that the Stoics did not produce any defence of the allegorical method against Plato's criticisms of it. As the truth of Stoicism did not depend on the correctness of their allegorical interpretations, they probably saw no need for such a defence.3 They were, therefore, logically precluded from using allegories as a refutation of the Platonic view that the poets were ignorant. For, regarded as an answer to Plato's denial of the poet's wisdom, allegorical interpretation is simply a petitio fprincipii, unless indeed one does what the Stoics did not attempt to do, namely, to confirm the hypothesis that the poets were wise men by applying it consistently according to definite rules of interpretation, by proving that a given myth must bear the meaning alleged and no other, by showing that this was the meaning which the poet intended it to bear (for he might, on Platonic principles, have been an inspired fool), and finally by proving independently that the meanings so ob- tained are not only harmonious but true. One may well hesitate to believe that the Stoics were so illogical as to imagine that they were proving Homer's wisdom by pointing to the existence of deeper meanings (which Plato had not denied), or by multiplying at haphazard the fruits of a method which they did not trouble to justify. It is more probable that they ignored Plato, and simply accepted, without attempting to prove, the common view (which Plato had attacked) that all the poets were wise men whose wisdom was proportionate to 1 Arnim II., fr. 925, p. 267. 2 Cf. C.Q., January, 1929, p. 42. 3 In etymology they took up no such position as that of Cratylus. Chrysippus by admitting that there was more than one word for the same thing, and more than one meaning for the same word (Zeller, Stoics, pp. 73-4, n. 4), virtually recognized that his etymologies were merely conjectural. Cf. D.L. VII. 172, where Cleanthes is rallied on his word-play.</page><page sequence="4">4 J. TATE their antiquity. Acting upon this theory they applied their methods of inter- pretation to offensive and inoffensive passages alike, not with the object of vindicating the poets or decrying Plato, but simply to support and illustrate their own philosophy. So far as the Stoics were concerned, we may conclude that Plato was guiltless of having given any impetus to allegorical interpretation. Nor was a defence of allegorical interpretation produced by those Neo- platonists, who, dissenting from Plotinus' view of the matter, placed their trust in mythology. They agreed with Plato that the poets were by no means omniscient.1 They conceded, too, that many of the myths were unfit for the hearing of children.2 But this, according to Proclus, is no reason for their complete expulsion; they are (he says) fitting for those to hear who can from mystic symbols divine the truth about the gods. He rather disingenuously uses Republic 378a to support this view. There Plato says that if such stories are to be told at all, they must be told in secret to as few hearers as possible. Unfortunately for Proclus he adds that they must not be told at all in the ideal state. Beyond this interesting artifice, we find in Proclus simply the blind prejudice that the poetry of Homer is inspired by the gods, which (so little was the Platonic treatment of inspiration understood) is apparently the same thing as saying that Homer was the wisest of the Greeks.3 Such is Proclus' reply to Plato's accusation that Homer was imitative in the sense which involves com- plete ignorance of reality.4 It is clear that those who tried to reconcile Homer with Plato made no real attempt by allegory or otherwise to deal argumentatively with Plato's attack on Homer. They evaded or ignored the question by simply assuming that both Homer and Plato were equally wise and equally inspired. This inquiry would now be nearing a conclusion were it not for the fact that, in the present state of the question, no remarks on allegorical inter- pretation in Platonic and post-Platonic times can be considered adequate unless there is included some treatment of Antisthenes and the principle of interpretation which Zeno is said to have received from him. It is usually stated that 'in Plato's day the Cynics were the chief ex- ponents of this' (the allegorical)' school of criticism, especially Antisthenes.' So says Adam,5 though he rightly rejects the view that Plato is tilting at Antisthenes in Republic 378. He then adds the usual statement that it was from Antisthenes that the Stoics took over the practice of allegorical interpre- tation. These statements regarding Antisthenes are mythical. As the myth has shown many signs of breaking up, I propose to do a little towards hasten- ing its final dissolution. 1 E.g. Julian, orat. IV. I37C; cf. Lucian, Zeus Cross-examined, 2. 2 Proclus, In Plat. Remp. 37I-2; Julian, orat. VII. 206-7. Probably the Stoics also agreed with Plato that certain myths are unsuitable for the young; most of the allegorical interpreta- tions are far too difficult for children to under- stand. 3 In Plat. Remp. 386, 405. 4 The Platonic account of imitation was, apparently, not faced at all by the Stoics, unless (as seems most improbable) Strabo (I. 2, 5) takes from them his rather feeble attempt at an answer: if Homer had not known life well, he could not have imitated it so well. 5 On Rep. 378d, 24. Cf. Gomperz, G.T. II., pp. 139 sqq., who sets forth the ordinary view of Antisthenes' allegorism with brilliant imaginative power. For A.'s frr. see Mullach, F.P.G.

It is clear that Plato was not thinking of any allegorist in particular. Again, it is now admitted that in their physical allegories the Stoics (so far as the evidence goes) derived most help from the Anaxagoreans.1 In their etymologies they were supplied with ample material by the work of sophists like Prodicus and Heracliteans like Cratylus. There is no need to suppose any intermediary between such sources and Zeno. It was indeed discovered long ago by E. Weber that Antisthenes was not one of those who found physical doctrines allegorically expressed in Homer. Weber's conclusion, so curiously ignored by subsequent writers, is worth quoting: 'Antisthenes non ex iis Homeri interpretibus est, qui Homerum rerum naturae peritissimum fuisse et narraticnibus suis multas et praeclaras dvo-Lchl b3rovola9 sive allegorias abdidisse putabant.'2 Further, it is frequently stated or implied that the fragments of Antisthenes which refer to Homer are allegorical. But Decharme, though accepting the ordinary view in all other respects, admits that they are not.3 In fact, not one of them sets aside the literal sense in favour of a deeper meaning, whether physical or ethical. (Among Antisthenes' other fragments there is only one piece of rationalization to be found-the remark that love is a disease deified by its victims. This is a very unoriginal platitude, not to be taken as a proof that he made any contribution to allegorism. He may have got it from the tragedians; or, indeed, from his master in rhetoric, Gorgias,4 who mentions in the same breath both views, that love is a god, and that love is an ?vwpo7rrrvov viado-pa.) Another argument-that which quotes Julian, orat. VII. 215 as proof of Antisthenes' allegorism-was abandoned by Schrader.5 Julian mentions Plato, Xenophon, Antisthenes, and others as writers of myths. It is scarcely necessary to point out that this is no reason for believing that they were allegorists. The fact that Xenophon wrote the Cyropedia does not prove that he discovered deeper meanings in Homer. But it still seems to be generally believed that according to Xenophon Synmp. III. 6 and IV. 6 Antisthenes claimed to know the deeper meanings of Homer. Weinstock0 actually says that Antisthenes censured those rhapsodes who did not know the blrdwoeae. In the former passage Niceratus says that his father made him learn Homer by heart so that he might grow up a good man. Antisthenes objects that the rhapsodes know Homer by heart, and yet are unsurpassed in foolishness. Socrates then says: 'Yes, for it is clear that they do not know the birnvoeae, but Niceratus has paid large sums to Stesimbrotus and Anaximander and many others, so that nothing worth attention has escaped him.' Thus it is true that Antisthenes said the rhapsodes were fools -a remark made in Xenophon (Mem. IV. 2, 1o) also by Euthydemus. But did he say that they were fools because they did not know the brr6votae ? No; 1 As by Weinstock, of. cit., pp. 123 and 138. 2 De Dione Chrysostomo Cynicorum sectatore (Leipziger Studien X., 1887, pp. 77 sqq.), p. 225. 3 La Critique des Traditions Religieuses chez les Grecs, p. 289. 4 Soph., fr. 885: Eur.

There is therefore nothing in the passage to hint that Antisthenes belonged to the same class of interpreters as Stesimbrotus and Anaximander. In Symp. IV. 6 there is no question of allegorical interpretation, so that the passage need not be considered here. E. Weber, after a full consideration of the evidence relating to Antisthenes' treatment of poetry (evidence perhaps unduly amplified by his hypothesis that Antisthenes was imitated and adapted by Dion), contends merely that Antisthenes used certain characters of mythology as examples of virtue and vice.' He holds, for example, that Nestor was treated by Antisthenes as a model of self-control,2 Odysseus as an example of the wise man,3 and Athena as a pattern of wisdom. Two of the ten volumes which Antisthenes produced comprised many works with Homeric titles. It is possible that (as Weber thinks) they drew morals from the tales of Homer. All this one may cheerfully grant,4 without following Weber in his belief that Antisthenes passed on the practice of allegory to the Stoics; and for a very sufficient reason-namely, that to treat Odysseus as a 'viri sapientis exemplum' is not allegorical interpretation at all. It does not require the moralist to substitute an 'undersense' for the literal meaning. The moral of the tale is not to be confused with the wr6voea. Indeed, Heyne long ago clearly stated that to teach by texts and examples is not allegory. His words are very much in point here: 'cum ethica hac' (Stoic allegorization as of Heracles and his labours) 'allegoria non confundenda est ea interpretatio, cum Homericis narratis uti videas veteres ad praecepta moralia et politica declaranda et animis legentium infigenda. Exempla virtutum et vitiorum proponunt, non interpretantur.'5 Antisthenes appears, for example, to have used the tale of Heracles as a text for a sermon on wisdom and strength. But this is not the same thing as identifying Heracles in Stoic fashion with such qualities and deriving his name from (peo and KcXE'"eOat.6 Similarly, if Antisthenes remarked on Iliad XV. 123 that the wise man acts in accordance with the whole of virtue (i.e., knowledge), his remark assumes that Athena gave wise advice, not that she is identifiable with wisdom.' Another example would be Diogenes' treatment of the Prometheus myth; he draws from it the lesson that the gift of fire and of civilization was an evil gift, bringing sloth and luxury in its train; for if the 1 Pp. 226 sqq. (This is how Dion treats Homeric characters.) 2 Though Antisthenes (the name is a more or less probable emendation) merely said that Iliad XI. 637 meant that Nestor (as became his years and steady head) could drink the contents of the cup without becoming drunk. 3 A. decided that -roX6rporor referred to the adaptability of Odysseus' wisdom, and was neither a compliment nor the reverse. 4 I am only granting it for the sake of argu- ment, except in the case of Heracles. (A. wrote a work entitled Heracles or concerning wisdom and strength.) 5 Excursus III. ad II. XXIII., p. 578. 6 Cornutus 31 (p. 63, 4). 7 It is fairly certain that this is not A.'s remark at all but the scholiast's (dK 70o670rov r--from this passage A. derives his statement that the wise man, etc.). Cf. schol. on II. XXIV. 526: ' From this passage Epicurus derives his state- ment that the gods neither have trouble nor give trouble to others.' In spite of this and others like it (e.g. on Od. IX. 28) no one nowadays holds that Epicurus either derived, or pretended to derive, his doctrines from Homer. So far as this 'fragment' is concerned, Antisthenes is similarly guiltless of reading into Homer the Socratic doctrine of the unity of wisdom (pace Zeller, Socrates, p. 330).</page><page sequence="7">PLATO AND ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION 7 gift had been good, it would have had the approval of Zeus, who desires all good things for mankind.1 Such attempts to point the moral are not allegorical interpretations; they temporarily assume the truth of the myth in question ; they do not deny or replace the literal sense. Even when, in order to extract the moral desired, it is found necessary to revise the myth, no allegorical interpretation is involved; for it is to the literal sense of the revised version that appeal is made.2 Finally, we must consider a passage of Dion (LIII. 4-5) which runs as follows: 'Zeno censures nothing in Homer, but shows in detail that he has written some things according to opinion (caTeh 836av) and others according to truth (,cara JrO9eiav), so that he may not be convicted of contradicting himself in certain things which appear to conflict with each other. But this statement -that the poet said some things according to opinion (6~y) and others according to truth (dOalga)-belongs first to Antisthenes. The latter, however, did not work it out thoroughly, whereas the former demonstrated it in detail.' The distinction between opinion (8dfa)-the vague unscientific guesswork of the popular mind-and knowledge (irwcrjrdt, dhX0eLa)-certain truth founded on reason-was a very common one.3 Antisthenes himself wrote four books on the subject. His remark as quoted by Dion apparently means that in some passages Homer expresses the uncritical beliefs of the unphilosophic majority, in others he speaks in accordance with well-grounded knowledge. In the latter passages the philosopher-poet is uttering what he knows to be true; in the former he is expressing the vague opinions either of himself (when his knowledge was incomplete) or of the multitude. As spokesman for the multi- tude he may contradict the truths he knew and expressed elsewhere. But this contradiction is only apparent, for in this case it is not Homer who is wrong but the multitude whose views he is expressing. Such must have been the argument of Zeno when he showed that the poet's self-contradictions were only apparent. Dion himself may be used to prove that this interpretation is correct. In Orat. LV. 9 he says that Homer and Socrates alike studied and discussed orwow Gos~fovo-ev oi wroXXhol caU 'ro9 dEr[o-ravwrae o0 dpbeplot--the opinions of the many and the knowledge of the wise. In Orat. VII. 98 sqq. he uses this argument to explain an apparent inconsistency in Homer. Menelaus' hospitality to Paris cost him dear; yet Homer praises hospitality as a blessed privilege of the rich. The defence is that the poet in such praises of wealth was express- ing not his own views but those of the many. In Homer we find r~v Tevn wroXncwv &amp;dvoeav repi 7'e ?rXo;rov Kal ov gXXcov avE Oayidoveo'. This is a great convenience, for if we wish to discover what opinions the many hold, and from 1 Fr. 287 (Mullach). 2 Plutarch rejects the allegorical interpretation of poetry, but is anxious that the right morals should be derived from the myths. That is to say, he concentrated on the -r'roc and rejected the ,rb6voiac. Since Heyne, writers on the history of allegory are too little aware that interpretation by r6ror and interpretation by inr6votai are not the same thing. See Plutarch, De Aud. Poet. Ige sqq., and the analysis of Rep. 377 sqq. supra. A good example of interpretation by riroi is in Plato, Apol. 28bcd (example of Achilles proves that it is no disgrace to live in danger of death).

Dion held that Homer' said nothing without a purpose.' He thought that the poet when he uttered the opinions of the many did so deliberately, with the full knowledge that they were not true; further, the poet always corrected such opinions by telling the truth elsewhere. It is not clear whether Antis- thenes and Zeno believed that the popular notions found in some passages were invariably corrected by the truth expressed in others. Some of the opinions found in Homer might be due to his own ignorance. If, as I think probable (since the poets were not omniscient), Zeno admitted this, he would still be able to 'censure nothing in Homer'; for he could still hold, like Dion, that the poet had done a service by giving expression to such views as please the multitude so that the philosopher himself might refer to and correct them. Compare the Stoic Strabo who quotes with approval the admission of Polybius that some of Homer's errors might be due to Ayvota.2 Compare, too, Plutarch who says that the falsehoods which the poets tell involuntarily are the work of men 7Tpoeak(otoT&amp;ov vrow (36 d  9 ica2 a7arar-fl.3 In any case it is said to be a sufficient defence of the poet, when he speaks falsely, to explain that the views which he expresses represent the common opinion. To the student of Aristotle's Poetics this will have a familiar ring. The poet's words, if in accord neither with facts nor with the ideal, will be sufficiently justified if they accord with the general opinion (r46ob, 6, old /aocr KCaL 8 o e i; 35, 6Xn' obv haot ; I46Ib 9, rwp09 'rv 8 ( 3av 3ev Jvd yEwL). It is obvious, then, that the principle of Antisthenes and Zeno has, in itself, nothing to do with allegorical interpretation. Dion himself founds no allegory upon it. It is indeed a means of explaining contradictions without having recourse to allegory. Thus Plutarch, who did not care for allegorical interpretations, explains the Homeric quarrels of the gods by pointing out that Homer elsewhere describes the gods as delighting all their days in their peace- ful abode.4 The latter notion is the truth; the former is fictitious opinion. Yet a long series of writers, of whom Weinstock6 is the latest, see in this principle the basis of allegorical interpretation. They take it to mean that Homer, when speaking according to truth, utters words which are, in their literal sense, true, and that, when he speaks according to opinion, he veils the truth in riddle and allegory. But, in the first place, it is obviously false to say that one cannot speak'according to truth'when using allegorical language. To speak 'according to truth' does not necessarily mean to tell the truth in literal form. In the second place, to speak 'according to opinion' does not mean to speak in allegory. If it does, then most of us have been speaking in allegory all our lives without knowing it. But Dion in the passages cited does not ask us to interpret allegorically the 'opinions' expressed by the poet. 1 Orat. LV. 22. 2 I. 2, I7. " De A ud. Poet. i7d. 4 De A ud. Poet. 20oe. Cf.

In Aristotle wrph, 7r'v 8dSav SeZ Jviyev does not mean 'one must interpret allegorically.' The writers whom Weinstock follows have really assumed that there held good for Antisthenes and the Stoics a further principle, of which I can find no trace-namely, that opinion always and everywhere contains a kernel of truth.2 Even if this were true of the Stoics, it would still have to be proved true of Antisthenes. But is it true of the Stoics ? There is, so far as I am aware, no evidence that a significant myth was ever called 8&amp;(a. Opinion, for the Stoics, was much the same thing as ignorance and delusion.3 There is no ground for believing that the Stoics ever held that opinion, as such, contained germs of truth. The myth-makers (whether the poets, or, as Cornutus holds, philosophers older and wiser than the poets) consciously devised the significant myths in order to convey sound doctrine in an impressive form. They were 'philosophizing in symbol and enigma' ; they were 'allegorizing to inculcate knowledge.'5 Allegory, symbol, and enigma surely do not belong to the sphere of delusion. In a significant myth the mythical element is a veiled expression of truth; it is never called 6~a, and the assumption that it was or could be so called appears to be quite unwarranted. The Stoics, however, in varying degrees, recognized that there were myths and portions of myths which were not significant. The vulgar (among them the poets, according to Cornutus but probably not according to the early Stoics) misunderstood the significant myths, took the literal sense as true, added meaningless fictions to them, and composed others like them externally, but in fact unlike them because not symbolizing truth. Thus the Stoic in Cicero's De Natura Deorum regards some of the myths (especially those con- cerning Uranus-Cronus-Zeus) as containing physical doctrines. The vulgar foolishly deriving from these the idea of anthropomorphic gods produced as a result false opinions, superstitions, and myths like the theomachy and the wars of gods with Titans and giants, which are plena futtilitatis sumnmaeque leuitatis, and which, therefore, Balbus does not attempt to interpret allegorically.6 How far his words involve Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus in the same opinion is not clear. But I have elsewhere given reason for believing that the early Stoics did not regard the unmeaning myths and portions of myths as so numerous as they were afterwards considered by Cornutus, or as they were apparently considered by the authorities followed by Cicero. Probably, how- ever, they did recognize that when allegorical interpretation had done its best with the myths, there did remain myths and parts of myths which resisted interpretation, and which were, therefore, not expressions of truth (KcatT aX?6eeav), but expressions of opinion (Kar~h ~6fav). Cornutus simply pushed this idea a little further when he held that the poets had largely corrupted the myths by fictitious and meaningless additions. An allegorist like Zeno might 1 De Aud. Poet.

I. 41, III. 62.</page><page sequence="10">zo PLATO AND ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION very well hold that this unmeaning residue (whether large or small) consisted merely of the opinions of the poet or his audience, to which it would be wrong to apply the allegorical method. Thus, though the principle of Antisthenes and Zeno has nothing to do directly with allegory, it might have been used by Zeno as an excuse for not applying allegory to every detail of the myths. It is clear at any rate that in the significant myths (as also sometimes in plain language1) the poet is expressing truth, speaking ,ad XrajOetav. In plain language he often speaks Kart &amp;6(av. It is probable that in the meaningless myths and portions of myths also he was held to be speaking Kalh ~6~av. The conclusion is that the suggestion which, according to Dion, Antis- thenes made and Zeno developed, and of which we have found distinct traces in Aristotle and elsewhere, in no way involves Antisthenes or Zeno in allegorical interpretation. It might be applied as an alternative to allegory; or it might be used as a reason for restricting the scope of the allegorical method. It certainly does not prove that Antisthenes interpreted Homer allegorically. And the proof that Zeno engaged in allegory does not in fact rest on this passage of Dion, which ought not to be quoted in support of it. Antisthenes ought to have no place whatever in the history of allegorical interpretation, since there is no evidence or probability that he was an allegorist. But more relevant to the present discussion is the conclusion that Plato, so far from giving an impetus to allegorism, actually placed a curb on it, by compelling those who respected the poetic traditions to admit that the poets often expressed mere opinion and not truth. For it is natural to see in this admission a concession (perhaps tacitly made) to Plato who had confined the extant poets entirely to the sphere of opinion. It is natural to see in it also the chief reason why the post-Platonic allegorists never emulated the zeal and thoroughness of Metrodorus of Lampsacus. Accordingly, if Plato had any effect on later allegorizing philosophers, his criticism of the poets, and of the use of allegory and etymology for inter- preting them, acted as a deterrent rather than an incentive. The Stoics made no attempt to defend the poets or to justify the allegorical method in principle. Why, then, did they act as though the method yielded good (if rather uncertain) results in practice? The answer is that all the leading allegorists, after Plato as before him, were impelled by the same motive as led the earlier philosophers to appropriate and improve on the mythology of the ancient poets. Plato's arguments they might ignore; they could not ignore Homer. For neither in themselves nor in others could they wholly suppress the prejudice that the ancient poets were the divinely wise and accomplished teachers of mankind.2 J. TATE. UNITED COLLEGE, ST. ANDREWS. 1 Suppose, per impossibile, that the principle had the meaning ordinarily alleged : that Homer expressed some truths literally and others alle- gorically ; it would indeed be a very curious way for Zeno to state the fact that there is scarcely any of what might be regarded as literal Stoicism in Homer (cf. ps. Plut. Vit. Horn. 119, 134). 2 Virgil's allegorizers were prompted by a similar motive, not by any desire to defend the poet (see Comparetti, Vergil in the Middle Ages, Part I., c. viii.).</page></plain_text>
