International Center for Photography, New York, from 12 December 2003 to 29 February 2004; and Seattle Art Museum, from 25 March 2004 to 13 June 2004. Some recent discussions of photographic images and cultures have emphasised that as well as being imprints of reality, photographs and photographic practices play an important role in the constitution of such realities in the first place (e.g. Pinney 1999, Pinney and Peterson 2003). This perspective has particular import for anthropologists: images have played a vital part in the formalisation of ethnographic imaginaries of the other. Of these imaginaries, perhaps that of race has been most reliant on visual technologies (see Edwards 2001). Previous exhibitions, such as 'The Impossible Science of Being' (Pinney, Poignant and Wright 1996), have focused critically on the role of photography in both the construction and deconstruction of understandings of race and cultural difference. Following these analyses, photographs may be understood to be not only 'shadows of substance' but efficacious technologies and 252 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="2">Exhibition Reviews social objects (see Wright 2004). Here, I discuss how photography was presented in a more recent exhibition, held at the International Centre of Photography, New York: 'Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self. Rather than discuss how race has been, and is, portrayed through the medium of photography - the subject of the show - I focus here on the implicit expectation within the exhibition of what photography is and what can be done with it. The curators, Coco Fusco, Associate Professor in the Visual Arts Division at Columbia University's School of the Arts, and Brian Wallis, ICP's Director of Exhibitions and Chief Curator, ask 'How do photographs make us see race?', and aim to explore how race and, by extension, American identity, can be visualized. I take this description from the exhibition website, http://www.icp.org/osd/preview/index.html, which is an excellent, internationally accessible, substitute for the show, and which includes almost all of the images I mention here. The curators comment on the website that: Some images in the exhibition are classic examples of how photography has been used to show us that race is something fixed and visible on people's bodies. Other works demonstrate how photography has been used in an attempt to improve the social status of different ethnic groups by showing them as more attractive, more patriotic and more industrious. Still other photographs express ideas about race that are not necessarily attached to people, but to spaces, landscapes, and objects. Such commentary promotes an understanding of photographs as exploitable representations, or visions, of an external socially and politically constructed reality. Photography itself is construed as a cipher for race: a colour technology able to fix taxonomies of skin onto its own surface. The exhibition was organised into five thematic sections: 'Looking up/Looking down', 'All for one/One for all', 'Humanized/Fetishized', 'Assimilate/Impersonate' and 'Progress/Regress'. Each of these broadly themed areas contained a montage of different images, produced using a range of technologies and made for very different purposes.. This framing of photography as a generic technology and practice subservient to guiding rhetoric denied many of the images their own historicity, materiality and meaning. However, walking through the exhibition quickly impressed upon the visitor that all photographs are not the same. The boundaries of each discursive section were easily ignored, and the provocative juxtaposition of images enabled some sharper, more visual, connections and disconnections to be drawn. 'Documentary' photographs, in small-format black and white, tended to depict personalities and events, whilst 'contemporary art' photographs, in colour, focused more on the idiosyncratic subjectivities of their creators. The documentary images embodied the grey-toned spectrum of racial prejudice: anthropomorphic images of 'the missing link', 'rehabilitated' and disenfranchised Native Americans, a lynching in the deep South. The art images overwhelmed the viewer with large, occasionally giant, formats and their self-conscious 'deconstructions' of race.

In the same way, the political provocations of Louis Agassiz's collection of photographs of slaves and Gordon Park's documentation of the civil rights movement, were offset by the self- conscious irony of Max Becher and Andrea Robbins' portraits of German Indians, and by the futuristic vision of the human body as a faceless, plastic form by Aziz and Cucher. By focusing on photography as a technology able to communicate and represent views held outside of the frame of the camera, the curators' commentaries undermined the historicism of photography: the resonance of different images at different moments, and the ways in which images can enter into engagements with one another. How do we view Albert Winn's photograph of the bare wooden bunks in Jewish summer camp, southern California, 1997, if we have not viewed the photographs of the concentration camp barracks taken after the liberation of Auschwitz? How does Andreas Serrano's 1990 image of the masked head of an American Klanswoman (Grand Kaliff) resonate with the photograph taken last year by American military of a hooded Iraqi prisoner at Abu Ghraib, standing hooded on a box, attached to electric cables? The security guard at the gallery informed me that the image of a lynched man, chained to a tree, presented as part of an artwork by Pat Ward Williams entitled 'Accused/Blowtorch/Padlock', had caused the most upset and controversy in the exhibition, many people even demanding that it be removed from display. Williams surrounded the gruesome image with a passionate chalked text that asks ' There s something going on here, I don Ì understand it... WHO took this picture? ... did he take his camera home and bring back a blowtorch? ... How can this photo exist?' This image, perhaps more than any other in the exhibition, brought home the complicity of photographic practices within the events that they seem, at first glance, only to record. The most resonant images on display were, for me, like Williams' piece: those that critically examined and historicized the practice of photography. Particularly powerful images were Gordon Parks' 1963 image, 'L.A. Courtroom, Malcom X displaying picture of Muslim Ronald Stokes, killed by police a year earlier' and Glenn Ligon's double self-portrait: two identical full-length images, captioned 'Self Portrait exaggerating my white features' &amp;nà 'Self-portrait exaggerating my black features'. Such images highlight the complicity of photographs in assisting resistance to racial prejudice, as well as in constituting the imaginary of race. Leigh Raiford's essay in the accompanying exhibition catalogue described how many lynching images were circulated by members of the civil-rights movements, as well as by those who witnessed, or participated in, the atrocities. 254 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="4">Exhibition Reviews Whilst the ahistorical display strategy of montage and the somewhat obtuse discursive framework may leave the visitor without a cogent understanding of the historicity of image production and without a structured critical engagement with the true power of images, the forceful natures of many photographs on display were able to transcend these more discursive constraints. The catalogue, edited Coco Fusco and Brian Wallis, contains essays that critically unpick some of the ways in which race has been marked by photography and are packed with excellent reproductions. Again, for me, the most interesting chapters are those that engage with a deeper discussion of the practices and materiality of image-making, such as Stein's discussion of Dorothea Lange's 'Migrant Mother' series, and Higa's chapter about the photographic studio in the Manzanar internment camp for Japanese- Americans during the Second World War. In Manzanar, the ownership or use of a camera by residents was prohibited. The studio of Toy o Miyatake was initially only permitted to function with the proviso that a non- Japanese-American activate the camera's shutter. I wished we could have had some more of these insights into the intricate politics of photographic practice in the exhibition. The violent reaction of visitors to Williams' piece emphasises the power of images to affect the viewer. Within the exhibition, whilst discursively pushed to focus on the content rather than the form of photography, the diversity, provocation and quality of the hundreds of photographs on display were able to provide their own visual exegesis, and to assist visitors in forming their own understandings of what photography might be. Walking down-stairs to the lower gallery floor, one encountered a large piece by Barbara Kruger that screamed it out: 'Your fictions become history.' References Edwards, E. 2001. Raw Histories.
