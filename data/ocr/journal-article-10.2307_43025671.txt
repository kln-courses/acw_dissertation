<plain_text><page sequence="1">AAA - Arbeiten aus Anglistik und Amerikanistik Band 27 (2002) • Heft 2 Gunter Narr Verlag Tübingen Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano ; or, "Would You Ask EPICAC What People Are For?" Peter Freese The article reads Vonnegut's first novel Player Piano (1952) as a remarkable fiction in the tradition of the dystopian novel, in which the apprentice writer employs what he had learnt as a student of anthropology at the University of Chicago and what he had experienced as a publicist for General Electric and their famous Research Laboratory in Schenectady, combines elements borrowed from Huxley and Zamiatin with Wiener's The Human Use of Human Beings as his major reference, and used a unique combination of the survey functions of the picaresque mode, the defamiliarizing effects of the Martian perspective, and a strategically functional type of dark humor to enliven the exhausted genre of dystopia and devise the first, and eerily prophetic, depic- tion of "tyranny by computer" in American literature. The article then investi- gates how Vonnegut creates an intriguing new variation of the Zauberlehrling motif, which shifts the standard dystopian complaint from the level of institu- tional repression to that of individual failure and which insists that it is not the machines that constitute the real enemy, but the built-in flaws of their human inventors, and thus turns the conventional dystopian complaint into a skeptical exploration of the human psyche. And the article also explores how Vonnegut's first novel, despite its still imperfect structural execution and its not yet fully accomplished personal style, already reveals the roots of many of the idiosyncratic techniques which would then develop into the hallmarks of his œuvre. In May 1945, a twenty-two-year old brevet corporal from the American Mid- west came home from the European theater of war, where he had been taken prisoner by the Germans and miraculously survived the Allied firebombing of Dresden as a POW in a subterranean meatlocker in the building No. 5 of the Dresden slaughterhouse. His name was Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and marrying his childhood sweetheart Jane Marie Cox from Indianapolis, he moved to Chicago, where he earned his living as a police reporter for the</page><page sequence="2">1 24 Peter Freese City News Bureau while working on his master's thesis in anthropology at the University of Chicago. But when his thesis was rejected as "unprofessional" ( BSB 6),1 he left the university without a degree and moved to Schenectady, New York, to work there as a publicist for the General Electric Corporation and its famous Research Laboratory for $92 a week. Since he needed extra money to support his wife and his two children, he "started writing short stories at nights and on weekends" ( BSB 6), and in February 1950 his first story, "Report on the Barnhouse Effect," was published in Collier's. When he succeeded in selling several other stories to such 'slick' magazines as Cos- mopolitan and Esquire, Ladies' Home Journal and the Saturday Evening Post, he decided to become a full-time writer. Thus, in 1 951 he quit his job at General Electric, moved with his family to Provincetown, Mass., embarked upon a longer narrative, and a year later published his apprentice novel, Player Piano, with Charles Scribner's Sons. The original hardcover edition was no commercial success, since less than a third of its first printing of 7,600 copies were sold, mostly to curious readers in Schenectady, but the scattered reviews were rather friendly. In the Saturday Review, Lee, who mistook Vonnegut to be "a graduate engineer," found the book "mordantly amusing" and understood it as asking whether the new phase of the Industrial Revolution "will be geared to the spiritual and intellectual growth of the American people or whether it will grind their dream into a kind of abundant discontent."2 And in the Library Journal, Henderson described it as "an Orwellian vision-of-the-future first novel" and as "an important plea for reconsideration of human values, emphasizing that 'men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful.'"3 In the following year, an inexpensive Doubleday Book Club edition sold about 20,000 copies, but the biggest success came in 1 954, when Bantam re-edited the novel as a cheap paper- back with the new title of Utopia-14, and when about a quarter of a million copies found avid readers.4 In 1966, Rinehart &amp; Winston brought out yet 1 Page numbers in brackets refer to Player Piano (New York: Avon Books, 1967); other Vonnegut texts are quoted from the following editions: BSB = Bagombo Snuff Box: Uncol- lected Short Fiction (New York: Putnam's, 1999); BC= Breakfast of Champions; or, Good- bye Blue Monday!

But he also found "a radical flaw in the social criticism" and characterized "much of Player Piano [as] shallow and amateur- ish" because the novel is insufficiently "aware of the tradition of anti-utopia."7 Since Vonnegut has freely commented on his fictions and the complex processes which brought them into existence in many essays and interviews, the genesis of Player Piano can be precisely reconstructed. In his 1973 Playboy interview, Vonnegut stated that at the onset of his career he resorted to science-fiction formulae, although they were generally looked down upon, because "you were able to put an awful lot of keen ideas into circulation fast," and he reminisced: I was working for General Electric at the time, right after World War II, and I saw a milling machine for cutting the rotors on jet engines, gas turbines. This was a very expensive thing for a machinist to do, to cut what is essentially one of those Brancusi forms. So they had a computer-operated milling machine built to cut the blades, and I was fascinated by that. This was in 1 949 and the guys who were working on it were foreseeing all sorts of machines being run by little boxes and punched cards. Player Piano was my response to the implications of having everything run by little boxes. The idea of doing that, you know, made sense, perfect sense. To have a little clicking box make all the decisions wasn't a vicious thing to do. But it was too bad for the human beings who got their dignity from their jobs. And when he was asked whether science fiction had really seemed "the best way" to write about that topic, Vonnegut answered: "There was no avoiding it, since the General Electric Company was science fiction. I cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off 5 Theodore Sturgeon, "A Brace, 3 Singles, and a 10-Strike," National Review, 18 (17 May 1966), 478. 6 Louise Armstrong, "Ruling Robots and Secret Agents," Saturday Review, 49 (1 4 May 1 966), 44. 7 H.

Eight years earlier, however, in an essay about "Science Fiction" in the New York Times Book Review, he had still described his relationship to 'science fiction' in rather different terms by complaining: Years ago I was working in Schenectady for General Electric, completely surrounded by machines and ideas for machines, so I wrote a novel about people and machines, and machines frequently got the best of it, as machines will. (It was called Player Piano, and it was brought out again in both hard cover and paperback.) And I learned from the reviewers that I was a science- fiction writer. I didn't know that. I supposed that I was writing a novel about life, about things I could not avoid seeing and hearing in Schenectady, a very real town, awkwardly set in the gruesome now. I have been a soreheaded occupant of a file drawer labeled "science fiction" ever since, and I would like out, particularly since so many serious critics regularly mistake the drawer for a urinal. ( WFG 1 ) These self-assessments confirm that Player Piano belongs to the formulaic tradition of the anti-utopian or dystopian novel, that it is concerned with the threatening replacement of men by machines, and that, being an apprentice fiction, it owes quite a lot to its famous forerunners. It is not only literary sources, however, that helped to shape the make-up of Vonnegut's first novel, but also the personal experience of its creator. In a 1973 interview conducted by Scholes, Vonnegut ironically remembered that a central epi- sode of his fictional extrapolation, that is, the chapters which take place at The Meadows, a remote island in the North Woods, on which the leading members of the company are assembled to develop the atavistic team spirit thought necessary for a strong corporate identity, had a real-life model, since there actually existed a place called Association Island, on which "a morale- building operation for General Electric" was staged annually and to which "deserving young men were sent [...] for a week and played golf and there were archery contests and baseball contests and swimming contests and plenty of free liquor, and so forth." That his public exhibition of these bizarre events had, in turn, some real-life effect becomes obvious when Vonnegut says: "Player Piano when it came out was not a widely read book except in Schenectady, New York. The island was shut down after the book came out." (CwKV 1 1 3)8 And in his 1 980 conversations with Reilly, Vonnegut mentioned yet another intriguing aspect of his prophetic narrative, when he answered 8 For details about GE's Association Island see Paul Keating, Lamps fora Brighter America (New York, 1954), 83-86. - David Y. Hughes, 'The Ghost in the Machine: The Theme of Player Piano," in America as Utopia, ed. by Kenneth M. Roemer (New York, 1 981 ), 114, note 14, refers to the former GE President Charles Wilson, whose career shows obvious parallels to that of Gelhorne in PP, and the title page of whose collection of speeches as edited by GE shows the Island's Sacred Elm, which obviously provided the model for Vonnegut's Sacred Oak.</page><page sequence="5">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 27 the question of whether it was "the threat of automation that started [him] off" by pointing out that he had begun the book "before the word 'automation' had been coined by the Ford Motor Company" (CwKV 199). But it is not as if Player Piano were Vonneguťs first comment on what he had learned from being close to the famous scientists working at the cutting edge of technology in one of the leading research laboratories in the country. In his well-known story "Epicac," he had already introduced the huge thinking machine which would reappear as EPICAC XIV in the novel, and had thereby created the fictional equivalent of ENIAC, the Sectronic A/umerical integrator and Computer, the world's first electronic digital computer, which was com- pleted in 1946 for military purposes. In his mildly critical "The Package," Vonnegut had dealt with the questionable promises of technological pro- gress, and in "Poor Little Rich Town," he had satirically exposed the inhuman consequences of Taylorism. And in the light of what he said in 1999 about his rejected M.A. thesis, "which proved that similarities between the Cubist painters in Paris in 1907 and the leaders of Native American, or Injun, upris- ings late in the nineteenth century could not be ignored" (BSB 6), it seems highly probable that it was his anthropological research that made him depict the secret Luddite organization in Player Piano as the Ghost Shirt Society and thus relate it to the Paiute Indian Wowoka's messianic religion, which used the Ghost Dance as the central ritual in its failed revolution against white oppression. Player Piano, then, is a first novel that translates a com- plex combination of personal experience, anthropological research, and earlier narratives into a conventionally presented tale which is firmly embed- ded in the venerable dystopian tradition, and whose major claim to fame is neither its still imperfect structural execution nor its not yet fully accomplished personal style, but its thematic depth and the first prophetic depiction of "tyranny by computer"9 in American literature, which in 1952 was a highly speculative anticipation of coming developments but assumes a surprising topicality in our computer-governed times. The action of Player Piano covers about six months in the life of its pro- tagonist, Dr. Paul Proteus and takes place at some unspecified time in the not-too-far future. 'The Last War" (241 ), which was the last of "the three most horrible wars in history" (284) and the one to end all wars, has made the U.S. not only the sole remaining superpower that dominates the rest of the world, but has also resulted in a hierarchically organized and computer-controlled society in which machines have gained dominance over human beings. During that long and terrible war, which America won due to her superior technology, "managers and engineers learned to get along without their men 9 Carolyn Rhodes, Tyranny by Computer: Automated Data Processing and Oppressive Government in Science Fiction," in Many Futures, Many Worlds: Theme and Form in Science Fiction, ed. by Thomas D. Clareson (Kent, 1977), 67.</page><page sequence="6">1 28 Peter Freese and women, who went to fight. It was the miracle that won the war - produc- tion with almost no manpower. [...] it was the know-how that won the war. Democracy owed its life to know-how." (9) But with the "golden age" (1 5; 1 26) of world peace securely established, the tendency to ever greater 'automa- tion' has gone on, and "ten years after the war" (9) all the power lies in the hands of the privileged managers and engineers. "Industry is privately owned and managed, and co-ordinated - to prevent the waste of competition - by a committee of leaders from private industry, not politicians." (28) This "Na- tional Manufacturing Council" (45) with an all-powerful "National Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resources Director" (217) at its head decides about production and consumption, and the giant central computer EPICAC XIV, which fills several chambers of the Carlsbad Caverns and is "wholly free of reason-muddying emotions" and therefore "dead right about everything" (116), delivers all the data necessary for the smooth running of a tightly centralized society. Thus, economics has marginalized politics, and "just as religion and government had been split into disparate entities centuries before, now, thanks to the machines, politics and govern- ment lived side by side, but touched almost nowhere" (119). Consequently, the U.S. President is a powerless ham actor who has "gone directly from a three-hour television program to the White House" (118) and is a mere marionette called upon to deliver ghost-written speeches at official occa- sions. The omnipotent computer, however, decides not only about production and consumption, but also about every citizen's individual life history. "Every- one's I.Q., as measured by the National Standard General Classification Test, [is] on public record -[...] at the police station" (90), and the results of the GCT are the sole criterion for anybody's career. Children with a good score move on to college or university and leave not only with a Ph.D. de- gree but also with a machine-administered "Achievement and Aptitude Profile," which, "when the graduate [is] taken into the economy, [is] translated into perforations on his personnel card" (77), and decides about the engi- neering or management job he or she will be assigned to. But all children with a lower I.Q. are reduced to the roles of Huxley's Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons or Orwell's Proles, since, with very few exceptions, all simpler jobs are done by machines. Thus for the majority of people there are only two options left: "any man who cannot support himself by doing a job better than a machine is employed by the government, either in the Army or in the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps" (27), with the latter conjuring up memories of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conserva- tion Corps from the era of the New Deal. Joining the Army, whose members are not allowed to carry guns except when sent overseas, means twenty-five years of senseless drill before a discharge with a pension; and joining the RRC, popularly known as the "Reeks and Wrecks" (31), means partaking in</page><page sequence="7">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 29 an unending series of meaningless work-providing measures such as road repair. The only cash which both soldiers and RRC-members receive is pocket money, because deductions are made from their pay for rent, furniture and car and for the many insurances which make their lives secure from the cradle to the grave. From the point of view of the managerial oligarchy, the new and rigorously stratified society is a veritable utopia, with the misery of the past victoriously overcome and with every citizen enjoying social security from birth to death, a safe and comfortable home to live in, and state-of-the-art technology ranging from television and central heating to "radar [cooking] range" and "ultrasonic dishwasher and clotheswasher" (158f.). Consequently, the man- agers are inordinately proud of the unheard-of degree of 'progress' which American civilization has made under their benevolent guidance. For the jobless multitudes, however, whom the machines have robbed of a self- determined existence and, even worse, deprived of pride and "the feeling of being needed on earth [...] dignity (94), the world is not a 'golden age' but a golden cage, filled with an insuperable tedium vitae, and thus, under the deceptive surface of a well-ordered and smoothly functioning totalitarian technocracy, unrest, discontent, and despair are dangerously growing. That Dr. Paul Proteus is vaguely aware of this conundrum becomes obvious when he talks to his secretary about a speech in which he defines "the First Industrial Revolution" as having "devalued muscle work" and "the Second Industrial Revolution" as having "devalued routine mental work" (21 ). When his secretary muses that both revolutions must have seemed quite inconceivable to the people concerned, he ruefully admits that this is true with regard "to the people who were going to be replaced by machines, maybe," and when she asks whether there will also be "a Third Industrial Revolution," he concedes that such a revolution, which, in turn, will "devalu- ate human thinking," has already "been going on for some time, if [she] mean[s] thinking machines" (22) like EPICAC XIV, and mentions in passing that "Norbert Wiener, a mathematician, said all that way back in the nineteen- forties" (22). This fleeting reference reveals that Wiener's popular book The Human Use of Human Beings (1950) must have been one of Vonnegut's major references. Wiener's influential treatise contains a chapter entitled "The First and the Second Industrial Revolution," in which the famous M.l.T. cyberneticist argues that what is generally known as the Industrial Revolution "concerned the machine purely as an alternative to human muscle," whereas "what we shall term The Second Industrial Revolution" will apply to "all labor performing judgments of a low level, in much the same way as the displaced labor of the earlier industrial revolution included every aspect of human power." And when he predicts that the automatic machine "will produce an unemployment situation, in comparison with which the present recession and even the depression of the thirties will seem a pleasant joke," and demands</page><page sequence="8">1 30 Peřer Freese from "those responsible for management to see that the new modalities are used for the benefit of man, for increasing his leisure and enriching his spiritual life, rather than merely for profits and the worship of the machine as a new brazen calf,"10 he defines the very problems which lie at the center of Player Piano. Wiener, however, not only offered the socio-critical background for Vonnegut's dystopian scenario, but might also have provided him with his title metaphor. Making a crucial distinction between the "know-how," of which it is said in the novel that "it was the know-how that won the war. Democracy owed its life to know-how" (9), and the "know-what," he defines the first as the ability to accomplish one's purposes and the second as the ability to define what those purposes are. He then ironically states that America has given too much thought to the first and not enough to the second, and "distinguishes] between the two by the following example": Some years ago, a prominent American engineer bought an expensive player- piano. It became clear after a week or two that this purchase did not corre- spond to any particular interest in the music played by the piano but rather to the overwhelming interest in the piano mechanism. For this gentleman, the player-piano was not a means of producing music, but the means of giving some inventor the chance of showing how skillful he was at overcoming certain difficulties in the production of music. This is an estimable attitude in a second-year high-school student. How estimable it is in one of those on whom the whole cultural future of the country depends, I leave to the reader.11 ***** The major place of action in Vonnegut's brave new world is Ilium, New York, and in the opening paragraph he has his narrator subtly foreshadow the future of this city and cleverly establish a wider referential horizon through intertextual allusions: Ilium, New York, is divided into three parts. In the northwest are the managers and engineers and civil servants and a few professional people; in the northeast are the machines: and in the south, across the Iroquois River, is the area known locally as Homestead, where almost all of the people live. (9) The fictional "Ilium" with its fictional "Iroquois River" is Vonnegut's poetic equivalent of the real Schenectady with its real Mohawk River, and this mythically charged city will recur in such later novels as Cat's Cradle (1963), Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) and Galápagos (1985). Since "Ilium," the Latin version of Greek lÀiov, is another name for Troy, it conjures up the city 10 Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society, 2nd enl. ed.

And these conflicts will occur between the three carefully divided parts, with the "managers and engineers" with their "machines" playing the role of the occupying Romans on the one side, and the unemployed and superfluous "people" in their "Home- stead" assuming the role of the conquered natives on the other side of a Rubicon-like river, which is spanned by a bridge "not many people on either side have reasons other than curiosity for crossing" (9). However, it is not only the spatial division of a rigidly zoned Ilium that is charged with a disruptive potential, but the city also looks back upon a long history of warfare, which is evoked when the protagonist looks out of a factory window towards the river and muses: Here, in the basin of the river bend, the Mohawks had overpowered the Algonquins, the Dutch the Mohawks, the British the Dutch, the Americans the British. Now, over bones and rotten palings and cannon balls and arrowheads, there lay a triangle of steel and masonry buildings, a half-mile on each side - the Ilium Works. Where men had once howled and hacked at one another, and fought nip-and-tuck with nature as well, the machines hummed and whirred and clicked, and made parts for baby carriages and bottle caps, motorcycles and refrigerators, television sets and tricycles - the fruits of peace. (PP 11) 1 2 Stanley Schatt, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (Boston, 1 976), 1 7, postulates a connection between the name of the central computer, the city of Ilium, and Homer's Ilias, when he observes that the name EPICAC "suggests that the only epic to which man can look forward in his post- Christian technological age is one found on computer paper." - Thomas P. Hoffman, "The Theme of Mechanization in Player Piano," in Clockwork Worlds: Mechanized Environments in SF, ed. by Richard D. Erlich and Thomas P. Dunn (Westport, 1983), 135, note 6, states: "There is implicit irony in the 'EPIC' portion of the computer's name, an irony which under- scores the machine's lack of response to anything heroic while also suggesting the impos- ing aspect of EPICAC XIV as the ruler of an automated America." And he suggests yet another implication of the computer's name by observing that "EPICAC is Vonneguťs advertent transposition of Ipecac (an emetic), which humorously emphasizes the com- puter's ability to vomit back information, but only that information fed into it by its human operators." With this he follows, without mentioning him, Wayne D. McGinnis, who, in "Names in Vonneguťs Fiction," Notes on Contemporary Literature, 3, 4 (September 1973), 8, pointed out ten years earlier that EPICAC is "a transmutation of ipecac, the name of an emetic that induces vomiting, just as a computer swallows information and regurgitates it." 1 3 The choice of "Ilium" was probably influenced by the fact that in the vicinity of Schenectady there really is a town named "Troy," which is also mentioned in PP when 'lhe clubs in Albany, Troy, or Schenectady" (165; see 180) are referred to.</page><page sequence="10">1 32 Peter Freese This brief historical summary makes it clear that the message about lasting peace having been finally accomplished after centuries of warfare is only true as regards a deceptive surface, whereas the subversive subtext underlying the novel's beginning insinuates the very opposite, namely that the old conflicts will soon erupt again. The man who stands in the center of this conflict and will have to decide which side to take is Doctor Paul Proteus, who is the successful "manager of the Ilium Works, though only thirty-five" (9) years old. Holding the most prestigious job and having 'lhe highest income in Ilium" (29), being happily married to the beautiful Anita, and enjoying the goodwill of his boss, Doctor Kroner, who is considering him for promotion to the much more important Pittsburgh Works, Paul Proteus should be more than satisfied with his bril- liant career. But instead he is haunted by a vague sense of discontent and suffers from "periods of depression" (14). What disturbs him are his diffuse misgivings about the fact that the machines have made most humans obso- lete, and since "his job, the system, and organizational politics" make him "variously annoyed, bored, or queasy" (15), he wonders "if he wouldn't have been more content in another period of history" (1 2). Therefore he repeatedly goes to the oldest part of the factory, namely "the original machine shop set up by Edison in 1886" (1 4),14 where he searches for reassurance in "a vote of confidence from the past [...] where the past admitted how humble and shoddy it had been, where one could look from the old to the new and see that mankind really had come a long way" (14). On one of these trips to the old workshop he lovingly carries a "black cat" (9), which he has picked up near the golf course as "a mouser for the plant" (1 0), and he is deeply upset by having to watch first the fatal confrontation between this cat and a robot cleaning machine and then the death of the mangled cat on an electrically charged fence (20f.). The hapless cat is the lonely embodiment of God-given and freedom- loving animal life in a standardized world of man-made and frighteningly anthropomorphized mechanical gadgets.15 It conjures up the similar fates of 14 The General Electric Company, which came into being through a consolidation of Thomas Alva Edison's various companies, was founded in 1 886 in Schenectady, and this is another confirmation of the fictional Ilium being a barely disguised version of the real Schenectady. 1 5 Whereas Lawrence Broer, Pilgrim s Progress: Is Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Winning His War with Machines?" in Clockwork Worlds : Mechanized Environments in SF, ed. by Richard D. Erlich and Thomas P. Dunn (Westport, 1983), 140, unduly exaggerates when he calls this scene "one of the most revealing symbolic episodes in all of Vonneguťs work," the charged constellation of a wild animal caught in a mechanized plant is certainly of crucial signifi- cance in Player Piano, and Vonnegut would later expand on it in one of his better-known short stories, which was also successfully filmed. In "Deer in the Works" (Esquire, 1955), collected in both Canary in a Cat House and Welcome to the Monkey House , the young copy writer David Potter squanders his newly acquired job at the "Ilium Works of the Federal Apparatus Corporation" by freeing a deer that has strayed onto the factory grounds</page><page sequence="11">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 33 "deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey buzzards," which are electrocuted by the "high-tension wire fence" surrounding the Reservation in Huxley's Brave New World,16 and it is equally reminiscent of the nature-technology dichotomy of the thrush singing in the countryside in spite of the "concealed microphones" of the secret police in Orwell's 1984.u In Player Piano, this symbolically charged scene anticipates not only the novel's central conflict, namely, the eventual rebellion of a group of Luddite insurgents against the omnipresent machines which is as clearly doomed to fail as the cat's futile stand against the robot sweeper, but the poor animal's fate also serves as an ominous foreshadowing of Paul's personal future, since the cat's only means of escape from the electrically guarded world of the managers and engineers is death. When Paul, on some illogical impulse, orders the dead cat to be brought to his office, the readers' suspicion is confirmed that the frustrated manager does not yet know what he really wants to do with his life and that he is torn between conflicting impulses, since he is both a dedicated engineer who "love[s] the machines [as] entertaining and delightful" (16) and a concerned human being who cares for "the people [...] replaced by machines" (22). The fact that he has not yet found himself is also announced by his programmatic name. This name not only implies that he will undergo an existential change from a Saul into a Paul, but it also refers to Proteus, the 'protean' old man of the sea in Greek mythology, who can change himself into any shape he pleases.18 In the combination of these two references Hoffman sees yet another intriguing implication of the name as resulting from "the Latin defini- tion of Paul ('little') and the change aspect implicit in Proteus. Since the plot of the book concludes with a revolution that has failed to alter the system, its messiah Paul Proteus - 'little change' - is symbolic of the results, which seems to be a principal statement Vonnegut is making."19 'Proteus' might also refer to Charles Proteus Steinmetz, a mathematician who worked at General Electric and, like Vonneguťs protagonist, had certain socialist lean- ings. The most important intra-textual aspect, however, is the fact that Paul Proteus shares his initials with the novel's eponymous Player Piano and is and by thus opting for the freedom of the natural order and against the security of man- made organizations. 16 Aldous Huxley, Brave New World (Harmondsworth, 1955), 85 and 88. 17 George Orwell, 1984 (Harmondsworth, 1954), 102. 18 In a 1969 symposium Vonnegut said: "We are our own old men, our own wrestling oppo- nents. We're all Proteus." (in Roger Henkle, "Wrestling [American Style] with Proteus," Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 3 [Spring 1 970], 1 98). - In his interview with Zoltán Abádi-Nagy, "'Serenity,' 'Courage,' 'Wisdom': A Talk with Kurt Vonnegut," Hungarian Studies in English, 22 (1991), 33, he observed: "In order to survive we must be Protean. [...] To respond to this or that damned fool invention or to the hydrogen bomb or to the destruction of the ozone layer we must change, and chances are we can't." 19 Thomas P. Hoffman, "The Theme of Mechanization in Player Piano," 134.</page><page sequence="12">1 34 Peter Freese thus obliquely related to an "old player piano" (32) in a dingy bar in Home- stead, which gradually assumes a key metaphoric significance in the novel. As a piano played by machinery it stands not only for the soulless automation of what is one of the most advanced expressions of human creativity, namely the making of music, but, with its music being controlled by a paper strip with holes cut into it for the notes, it also serves as one of the earliest attempts at duplicating human movements and thus represents the punched card ma- chines that have come to dominate the mechanized world of the novel. When Paul's wife informs him that his fellow student and old friend Ed Finnerty, who is by now "a man of consequence, a member of the National Industrial Planning Board" (24) in Washington, has come to visit and that Paul, before coming home, has "to go to Homestead for some Irish whisky for him" (24), the daily routine of Paul's life is disrupted and the novel's action proper is set in motion by means of the venerable narrative device of 'enter mysterious stranger.' Looking forward to seeing after so many years "one of the few persons he had ever felt close to" (30), Paul embarks with mixed feelings on one of his rare forays into the strange world of Homestead. In his old car, in the glove compartment of which he keeps an illegal "rusty pistol" (39) from the days of the riots, he drives across the bridge, on which he has a brief encounter with a group of Reeks and Wrecks, and having entered the dingy bar that serves the unusual liquor, he tensely waits for the bartender to fetch the bottle, while leaning as inconspicuously as possible "against an old player piano" (32) in the corner and hoping not to be recognized as someone from 'the other side' by the hostile customers, who "had been the rioters, the smashers of machines" and who now "let him know that he had intruded where he was not liked" (35). An old toothless man, however, identifies him as "young Doctor Proteus" (34), and in the ensuing dialogue this pitiable wreck turns out to be Rudy Hertz, whom many years ago Paul and Finnerty had selected as the most competent machinist "to have his motions immortalized on tape" (18). By measuring the movements of this master mechanic and having his "essence distilled" (18) on tape, they had awarded him the questionable honor of providing the endlessly copyable model for the automation process which has since put him and his fellows out of work. The senile old man, who is still childishly proud of having been selected for bringing about his own demise, insists on inviting Paul for a beer and celebrates their reunion by putting a nickel into the player piano. And while the tinny music clangs away, Hertz comments on the workings of "the antique instrument" (37) by observing: "Makes you feel kind of creepy, don't it, Doctor, watching them keys go up and down? You can almost see a ghost sitting there playing his heart out." (38) Together with the violent death of the cat brought about by a soulless robot and an electrically charged fence, Paul's seemingly innocuous encoun- ter with the player piano embodies the novel's central concerns. The pitiful</page><page sequence="13">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 35 "old-timer" (18) Rudy Hertz, who was once a smart and proud machinist, personifies the loss of the 'good old days' in which humans were not yet ousted by machines, and his name not only refers to the German physicist in whose honor the unit of electromagnetic frequency was named, but it also obliquely signals how much the mechanization of his plant 'hurts' Paul.20 And the player piano, whose mechanical movements conjure up "a ghost [...] playing his heart out," not only anticipates the fact that the revolutionaries will later call themselves the Ghost Shirt Society, but also serves as the potent "symbol of the machines that turn men into idle ghosts."21 In this context it is anything but an accident that Finnerty, the revolutionary misfit, is "a top-flight pianist" (41) who will later be metonymically referred to as "the piano player" (256), and that in a revealing scene he sits "at the player piano, savagely improvising on the brassy, dissonant antique" (1 05), thus doing the very thing a programmed machine cannot do and thereby demonstrating that in a world of mechanical player pianos he is a human piano player. Vonnegut makes sure that the meaning of the "ghost" conjured up by the mechanical piano is not overlooked by the reader, because at the beginning of the next chapter Paul, who is still being haunted by Rudy Hertz's unwit- tingly perceptive comment, is greeted by his caring wife with the exclamation "Darling, you look as though you've seen a ghost[ my italics]" (38). And when she then hands Paul his homecoming cocktail and he thinks ruefully of "the image of his father" (38), the famous George Proteus, who had helped America win the war by uniting all manufacturing facilities, who had been "the nation's first National, Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resources Director" (10), and who, like another historical George before him, is still the unanimously revered founding father of the new era, one more 'ghost' is conjured up - one which, on the novel's psychological plane, will turn out to be of central significance for Paul's further development. With Paul's charming wife Anita and his idiosyncratic old friend Finnerty, the representatives of the two opposing forces between which Paul will have to decide are introduced. Anita, who had been Paul's secretary during the war and whom he dutifully married when she told him that she was pregnant, has ironically turned out to be "barren" (1 0). She, whose name might conjure up "a 'man-eater,' besides being 'neater,'"22 and who represents "the corrupt system in female form,"23 is a staunch supporter of the system and the privileges she enjoys as the wife of the influential chief manager, and since 20 Vonnegut uses the same onomatopoeic joke in Breakfast of Champions, where a truck bearing the name of the car-rental firm Hertz "seemed to cry out in pain to Wayne, because he read the message on the side of it phonetically" (BC 205). 21 Peter J.

Being the scheming woman-behind-the-man, she lives her life by proxy and puts all her energy into supporting her husband's career. 'The only grounds on which she met the world were those of her husband's rank. If he were to lose the rank it was frighteningly possible that she would lose touch with the world altogether, or, worse for Paul, leave him." (133) Anita's approach to life is "disturbingly rational, systematic," her feelings are "shallow" (25), and she only "enjoy[s] the ritual attitudes of friendships, of which she ha[s] none" (24). The single proof of her alleged 'creativity' is her interior decoration of her fully electronic kitchen in mock colonial style, and this questionable feat has gained her the community's verdict that she is "artistiď (110). But Paul likes and needs her, because she possesses "a sexual genius that gave Paul his one unqualified enthusiasm in life" (134). When it is said about her that she "has the mechanics [my italics] of marriage down pat, even to the subtlest conventions" (25), the telling phrase reveals that with her the mechanization of the world has spilled over into her private life, and that the Paul-Anita relationship is 'mechanized' is underscored by the ritualized, and totally meaningless, way in which they end all their dia- logues - "I love you, Paul. I love you, Anita." Thus, it is a telling detail that Paul, when after his dismissal he sleeps with a prostitute, answers her mumble half-asleep with the "automatic [my italics] reply, 'And I love you, Anita'" (246). It is the clear-sighted Finnerty who brutally exposes Anita's human limitations when, enraged about her meddling with what he considers men's privacy, he threatens to have her replaced by a machine: "I'll design a machine that's everything you are [...] Stainless steel, covered with sponge rubber, and heated electrically to 98.9 degrees." (46) Later, Anita will turn this very threat against her husband by complaining that "all you need is some- thing stainless steel, shaped like a woman, covered with sponge rubber, and heated to body temperature. [...] I'm sick of being treated like a machine!" (237) This woman, then, will do whatever she can to keep Paul a faithful servant of the system. The "tall gaunt Irishman" (39) Edward Francis Finnerty, on the other hand, who lives up to the ethnic stereotype, is the very opposite of the immaculate but shallow Anita. This hard-drinking bachelor and "unsanitary-looking" man, about whom it is rumored that he is "a mutant, born of poor and stupid par- ents" (40) and who is "shockingly lax about his grooming" (39), leads a seemingly irrational life, which on closer scrutiny turns out to be "a studied and elaborate insult to the managers and engineers of Ilium, and to their immaculate wives" (40). But this maverick, who suffers from "the loneliness,</page><page sequence="15">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 37 the not belonging anywhere" and hates "this damn hierarchy that measures men against machines" (88), has the unbelievably high classification number E-022 (91), is exceptionally gifted and "could be anything he wanted to be, and be brilliant at it" (41). This solitary intellectual iconoclast, who casually informs the surprised Paul that he has quit his prestigious job in Washington and is not afraid to proclaim openly that "[his] sympathy's with any man up against a machine" (63), is a born misfit and outsider, and when Paul sug- gests that he should see a psychiatrist, he explains: "He'd pull me back into the center, and I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center. [...] Big, undreamed-of things - the people on the edge see them first." (86) Whereas Anita tries to make Paul feel at home within the status quo, thereby personifying a future of stability and security for her faltering hus- band, Finnerty defects to the other side of the river - "At last I'm finding myself. Those dumb bastards across the river - they're my kind of people. They're real, Paul, real!" (139) - thereby embodying a future of change and risk for his friend. But these two people are not the only ones who will influ- ence Paul in his search for "some sort of rebirth" (87) and a "fresh, strong identity" (102). There is also the spiteful Doctor Lawson Shepherd, who feels slighted by being only "second-in-command to Paul" (17) and is doing every- thing he can to denounce Paul with the powers that be, so that he might take over his job; and there is the Reverend James J. Lasher, cynical barfly, Protestant minister and anthropologist from across the river, who supplies Paul with the subversive insights and ideas which make him hate the system even more. Doctor Lawson ("Dog-Eat-Dog") Shepherd is "a fine engineer, dull com- pany, and doggedly master of his fate and not his brother's keeper" (54), whose name, together with the Biblical allusion, gives him away as a faithful 'son of the law,' who is not a 'shepherd' in the sense of a caring fellow-hu- man, but a shepherd dog in the sense of jealously registering other people's smallest infringements of the rules. As an other-directed schemer who is "grimly respectful of the mechanics [my italics] of the competitive system" (54), he is a repulsive example of what the ruling system can make a man become, and he serves as a negative role model for Paul, repeatedly con- fronting him with the very mentality which Paul is afraid of developing him- self. That this self-righteous organization man will later begin an affair with Anita, and that after Paul's defection Anita will triumphantly announce that she is "going to marry Doctor Lawson Shepherd as soon as she [can] get a divorce from Paul" (296) is the final confirmation of how perfectly the shallow upper-middle-class housewife from suburbia and the reckless careerist fit together in their mindless pursuit of success and social status.</page><page sequence="16">1 38 Peter Freese It is, however, not Ed Finnerty, the disgruntled loner, but the RRC chap- lain Reverend Lasher from across the river who provides the intellectual center of the novel, and this clear-sighted "anthropologist with a master's degree" (91) is easily recognizable as the spokesman of Vonnegut, the anthropology graduate without a master's degree, since it is through his socio-critical diagnoses as resulting from the mixture of his deep insights into human desires and his resigned awareness of human limitations that Vonnegut 'lashes' out against the follies and aberrations of his fictional world. Paul first meets the "short, heavy, seemingly soft [. . .] middle-aged" man with "extremely thick glasses" (34f.) when he goes to the dingy Homestead saloon to get whisky for Finnerty and when Lasher confronts him with the plight of his eighteen-year-old son who, although "he just about killed himself studying up" (36) for his National General Classification Tests, did not do well enough to make it to college and will now have to face a senseless future in the Reeks and Wrecks. Then Paul meets Lasher again when he and Finnerty drive over to the saloon for some undisturbed hard drinking and when Lasher tells them that his desperate son has just hanged himself, only to confess a little later to the embarrassed Paul that he does not have a son and has made the story up to see "how one of those superbrains worked" (90). They enter into a long conversation with this eloquent "up-state Socrates" (91 ), and he aptly defines the people's predicament by explaining that "For generations they've been built up to worship competition and the market, productivity and economic usefulness, and the envy of their fellow men - and boom! It's all yanked out from under them. They can't participate, can't be useful any more. Their whole culture's been shot to hell." [...] "Things are certainly set up for a class war based on conveniently estab- lished lines of demarcation. And I must say that the basic assumption of the present setup is a grade-A incitement to violence: the smarter you are, the better you are. Used to be that the richer you were, the better you were. Either one is, you'll admit, pretty tough for the have-nots to take. The criterion of brains is better than the one of money, but" - he held his thumb and forefinger about a sixteenth of an inch apart - "about that much better." (92 and 94) With this appropriate diagnosis established, Lasher then speculates upon a therapy and comes up with the following conjecture: "Things, gentlemen, are ripe for a phony Messiah, and when he comes, it's sure to be a bloody business." [...] "Sooner or later someone's going to catch the imagination of these people with some new magic. At the bottom of it will be a promise of regaining the feeling of participation, the feeling of being needed on earth - hell, dignity. The police are bright enough to look for people like that, and lock them up under the antisabotage laws. But sooner or later someone's going to keep out of their sight long enough to organize a following." (93f.)</page><page sequence="17">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 39 And before he leaves, he looks at Finnerty and says: "You know, wash your face, and you might do real well as a Messiah." (97) It is on this eventful evening that Finnerty decides to join the people on the other side of the river, whereas an increasingly drunk Paul, who feels himself teetering "on the verge of a splendid discovery" (101) and then even develops "a feeling of newness - the feeling of fresh, strong identity growing within him." (1 02), cannot yet make up his mind. Finally he gets so drunk that he feels he must deliver a speech in which "to make himself the new Messiah and Ilium the new Eden," but all he can announce before he collapses is "We must meet in the middle of the bridge!" (105). The metaphorical interplay between Paul Proteus dreaming of "some sort of rebirth" (87), Ed Finnerty improvising on the player piano and thereby reclaiming the mechanical instrument as a means of human expression, and Lasher announcing the imminent appearance of a new Messiah who will deliver men from the ma- chines is subtly enriched when, before leaving, Lasher "pick[s] up a hard- boiled egg at the bar [and] crackle[s] its shell by rolling it along the keyboard of the player piano" (97). That he uses the potent symbol of rebirth to elicit some unprogrammed sounds from the mechanical player might signal the hope for a new beginning, but that this egg is hard-boiled and its shell crack- led could imply that the new beginning will be abortive and that in the coming revolt Paul Proteus, instead of being liberated, will be instrumentalized into just another player piano, whose utterances are programmed by others. With his drinking binge in Homestead, with Shepherd's report about Paul's unlawful admission of an unescorted Finnerty to the Ilium Works, and with the police having found Paul's illegal pistol, the erstwhile spotless man- ager "pile[s] up a fairly impressive police dossier" (129) in only a few days, but his chances for being promoted are still excellent. In a heart-to-heart talk with Kroner, the powerful manager of the Eastern division and "the archprophet of efficiency" (122), whose German name is certainly no acci- dent, Paul openly voices his still unspecific doubts about the system, but the fatherly Kroner tries to reassure him and offers him the prestigious Pittsburgh job on condition that he testify against Lasher and Finnerty "that they tried to get [him] into a plot to sabotage the Ilium Works" (130). It is the outrageous suggestion that he "turn informer on his friend, Ed Finnerty" (132) which makes Paul finally ready to quit. But the fact that he will not have to an- nounce his decision before the board meeting at The Meadows, grants him several weeks to make up his mind. He knows that giving up his job and all his privileges will certainly make him lose his wife, and since she is "all he ha[s]" (1 34) and he shockingly recognizes "that he, like Anita, [is] little more than his station in life" (134), he decides to pretend that nothing has hap- pened and keep his decision to quit a secret until he has prepared Anita and himself for their new life.</page><page sequence="18">1 40 Peter Freese The new existence which Paul envisions and clandestinely tries to pre- pare for is a life out in the open and close to nature, and, avidly reading books about "woodsmen, sailors, cattlemen" (135), he begins to devise a future in which he will be able to forget about society and deal "only with Earth as God had given it to man" (135). These immature dreams coalesce into his decision to become a farmer: "Somewhere, outside of society, there was a place for a man - a man and wife - to live heartily and blamelessly, naturally, by hands and wits." (143) Paul dimly remembers that on the mar- gins of his mechanized world there exists, due to some freakish hereditary twist, an old farmhouse, "the Gottwald place" (1 44), and he buys this farm for a small sum. He is enthused about the ancient farmhouse, the very name of which conjures up pastoral delights and which is situated "close to the edge of town" (144) "in a completely isolated backwater, cut off from the rapid boilings of history, society, and the economy. Timeless" (147). In this house Paul plans to begin a new existence, and he naively hopes that Anita will join him: "Here was a place where he could work with his hands, getting life from nature without being disturbed by any human beings other than his wife. Not only that, but Anita, with her love for things colonial, would be enchanted, stunned, even, by this completely authentic microcosm of the past." (149) Paul's attempt to escape from his technocratic reality into a pastoral dream and from the artificial complexity of his present into the natural simplicity of a nostalgically transfigured past is easily recognizable as a variation of a constitutive notion of American literature,24 and it is also easily predictable that such a flight from technological progress to agrarian idealism will not work. Thus it comes as no surprise that Anita, when Paul takes her to the old house and tells her "I've made up my mind to quit my job and live here" (176), enragedly rejects the notion of turning into a farmer's wife as untenable, thereby anticipating an insight which Paul, after his return from The Meadows, will gain himself when he realizes that his training and condi- tioning as an engineer have irrevocably estranged him from Nature: Paul had gone to his farm once, and, in the manner of a man dedicating his life to God, he'd asked Mr. Haycox [the custodian] to put him to work, guiding the hand of Nature. The hand he grasped so fervently, he soon discovered, was coarse and sluggish, hot and wet and smelly. And the charming little cottage he'd taken as a symbol of the good life of a farmer was as irrelevant as a statue of Venus at the gate of a sewage-disposal plant. He hadn't gone back.

Having been awarded the prestigious function of Captain of the Blue Team, Paul travels to the island not only to take part unwillingly in the annual "orgy of morale building - through team athletics, group sings, bonfires and skyrockets, bawdy entertainment, free whisky and cigars" (44), but also to face the decisive "crisis [that is] coming" and, in meeting the main board, finally to decide whether "to quit or turn informer" (1 79) and thus to be either expelled from the system or rewarded with the job at Pittsburgh. In the four chapters which deal with the bizarre events at The Meadows and which are, as unbelievable as it might seem, partly modelled on what really happened on General Electric's Association Island, Vonnegut pulls all the stops in satirically unmasking the organization's ludicrous attempts at creating a corporate identity. Since, in doing so, he enriches the usually serious genre of dystopia with hilarious touches, Hicks was right when he observed in one of the earliest reviews that "nothing could be more amusing than [Vonnegut's] account of the antics of the aspiring engineers when they gather on an island in the St. Lawrence for pep talks, competitive sports, formalized informality, and the careful cultivation of the big shots."25 On the 'sacred' island, the managers are made to live two in a tent in order to "de- velop a sort of common-law brotherhood" (182), to call each other only by their first names in order to develop togetherness, to join in constantly singing inane songs from The Meadows Songbook, which "look[s] like a hymnal" (1 36), in order to get into the desired pious mood, to talk only to people they do not know in order to make new buddies, to exert themselves in all sorts of sports in order to "stir up team rivalry" (182), and to drink hard in order to lose their inhibitions. A blaring loudspeaker voice ruthlessly chases them from one activity to the other, and in their carefully orchestrated "orgy of morale build- ing" (44) they behave like frenzied children. The three highlights of the cease- less island activities are a tearful "memorial service" (190) for the deceased members of the organization, a crudely didactic allegorical play, and a com- munal swearing of "the Oath of the Spirit of the Meadows" (213). The memo- rial service, which takes place around an ancient oak, "the official symbol for the entire national organization" (1 90), is meant to create emotional unity and turn the stirred participants into "a homogenized pudding" (191). The propa- gandists drama is a kind of medieval morality play, in which a Radical and a Young Engineer plead their cases before a God-like Sky Manager, and it is 25 In The New York Times Book Review, 1 7 August 1 952; quoted from the reprint in Granville Hicks and Jack Alan Robbins, Literary Horizons: A Quarter Century of American Fiction (New York, 1970), 176.</page><page sequence="20">1 42 Pefer Freese meant to convey the organization's central message, which is annually repeated with slight variations and signifies "that the common man wasn't nearly as grateful as he should be for what the engineers and managers had given him, and that the radicals were the cause of the ingratitude" (221 ). And the oath, which is significantly administered by an aging "professional actor" (212) dressed up as an Indian chieftain and thus relates the required affilia- tion to the organization to the inseparable bonds of Indian tribal togetherness, makes the impressed "neophytes" (21 3) swear "by the voice in the pines [. . .] by the lapping of the great blue water, by the whir of the eagle wing [...] by the growl of the summer thunder" (21 3f.) that "I will uphold the Spirit of the Meadows. I will obey the wise commands of my chiefs, for the good of the people. I will work and fight fearlessly, tirelessly for a better world. I will never say the job is done. I will uphold the honor of my profession and what I represent at all times. I will seek out enemies of the people, enemies of a better world for all children, relentlessly." (214) Paul, however, who has meanwhile made up his mind to opt for 'a sepa- rate peace,' is hardly touched by the hubbub around him, because by now "he [is] his own man" (201 ). But when he is called to the secret meeting of the directors, he knows that the moment of truth has come, and realizes that his previous "easy, comfortable life, with simple answers for every doubt" (216) is drawing to a close. He learns from his superiors that there is an under- ground movement known as "the Ghost Shirt Society" (217), with its head- quarters in Ilium and with the traitorous Finnerty belonging to it, and that they want to infiltrate this society of saboteurs by pretending to fire Paul and thus making him an irresistible bait for the revolutionaries. His reward for acting as a double agent will be the prestigious Pittsburgh job, but he will not even be allowed to tell his wife about the secret operation. When asked whether he will comply with this plan, Paul defiantly announces "I quit" (221), but his bosses laughingly mistake that as his adoption of the intended role. Publicly disgraced as a vile saboteur, Paul is dishonorably discharged from the organization and shipped back to the mainland, where he discovers that Anita is having an affair with the hateful Shepherd and, after an emotional confrontation, loses her as well. Reduced to being what is ironically termed "merely a man" (235) and shamefully demoted from influential manager to "unclassified human being" (239), painfully separated from his wife, and "with his old life gone, and his new one, whatever it was to be, not yet begun" (236), Paul finds himself in an existential limbo and is thus ready for a new beginning. Having traveled back to Ilium not by managerial plane but on an auto- matic train filled with swearing soldiers and complaining Reeks and Wrecks, thus getting his first glimpse of life from the point of view of 'the people,' Paul is summoned to the police to have all his privileges revoked. At the precinct he meets an acquaintance from the Homestead bar, with whom he goes for</page><page sequence="21">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 43 a beer to be filled in on what happened at The Meadows after his departure and, drinking to "the new life he'd chosen," falls "senseless from the barstool" (259). It turns out that the Ghost Shirt Society have knocked him out and abducted him, and when the ex-manager comes to, Finnerty and Lasher are interrogating him under "sodium pentathol" (280), a truth serum, about his beliefs. Admitting that his being fired was a pretense, but insisting that he has also quit, Paul learns from Lasher and Finnerty that the insurgents plan "that the world should be restored to the people" (272) and that they have taken their name from an Indian movement, thus taking recourse to the very Indian lore which also the organization relies upon for its ceremonial oath. The historically knowledgeable Lasher explains: With the game and land and ability to defend themselves gone, the Indians found out that all the things they used to take pride in doing, all the things that had made them feel important, all the things that used to gain them prestige, all the ways in which they used to justify their existence - they found that all those things were going or gone. [,..]The world had changed radically for the Indians. It had become a white man's world, and Indian ways in a white man's world were irrelevant. It was impossible to hold the old Indian values in the changed world. The only thing they could do in the changed world was to become second-rate white men or wards of the white men. [. . .] And the Ghost Dance religion was the last, desperate defense of the old values. Messiahs appeared, the way they're always ready to appear, to preach magic that would restore the game, the old values, the old reasons for being. There were new rituals and new songs that were supposed to get rid of the white men by magic. And some of the more warlike tribes that still had a little physical fight left in them added a flourish of their own - the Ghost Shirt. [...] They were going to ride into battle one last time in magic shirts that white men's bullets couldn't go through. (273) When Paul finds the freshly manufactured Ghost Shirts presented to him rather silly, Finnerty admits that "we've got to be a little childish, anyway, to get the big following we need" (274), and tells him "It's the symbolism of the thing!" (274). And Lasher explains the parallels: "Don't you see, Doctor? The machines are to practically everybody what the white men were for the Indians. People are finding that, because of the way the machines are chang- ing the world, more and more of their old values don't apply any more." (274) Paul is cursorily co-opted as a new member of the revolution, and Lasher's aside to Finnerty that "he'll do nicely" (272) makes attentive readers suspect that the still drugged ex-manager does not really proceed from being a cog in the machinery of the ruling powers to being a liberated individual, but that he only shuttles from being the pawn of one to becoming the plaything of another organization. Such suspicions are confirmed when Paul is told that he "[w]on't have to do anything" (275) except put his famous family's name under a letter that has already been drafted by Professor Ludwig von</page><page sequence="22">1 44 Peter Freese Neumann.26 In this letter, whose ringing phrases imitate the Declaration of Independence, it is solemnly stated in Paul's name that he and his fellow Luddites "have changed [their] minds about the divine right of machines" (284) and want "to give the world back to the people" (285). And the letter ends by declaring: Men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enter- prises that make them feel useful. They must, therefore, be returned to partici- pation in such enterprises. I hold, and the members of the Ghost Shirt Society hold: That there must be virtue in imperfection, for Man is imperfect, and Man is a creation of God. That there must be virtue in frailty, for Man is frail, and Man is a creation of God. That there must be virtue in inefficiency, for Man is inefficient, and Man is a creation of God. That there must be virtue in brilliance followed by stupidity, for Man is alternately brilliant and stupid, and Man is a creation of God. You perhaps disagree with the antique and vain notion of Man's being a creation of God. But I find it a far more defensible belief than the one implicit in intemperate faith in lawless technological progress - namely, that man is on earth to create more durable and efficient images of himself, and, hence, to eliminate any justification at all for his own continued existence. Faithfully yours, Doctor Paul Proteus (285f.) Paul has hardly digested the meaning of the letter distributed in his name, when the hiding place of the insurgents is raided by the police and Paul, as the only one who does not yet know the escape routes, is arrested and put into prison. There he is visited by Kroner, who still believes that Paul has only fulfilled his duty as informer and will now reveal the plans of the revolutionar- ies, and by Anita who, having belatedly learnt about Paul's double role, now wants him, and his status, back. But when an expectant Kroner asks who is the leader of the Ghost Shirt Society, Paul says: "I am. And I wish to God I were a better one." (293) Thus, the die has been cast, and Paul, now a confirmed traitor and saboteur, is next seen in the Ilium Federal Courtroom 26 This name may allude to John von Neumann (1903-57), the Hungarian-born scientist who was the founder of the mathematical theory of games and whose development of maniac (mathematical analyzer, numerical /integrator, and computer) enabled the U.S. to produce and test the world's first hydrogen bomb. Such a reference is all the more probable because it is later said about the fictional von Neumann that "he had been less interested in achiev- ing a premeditated end than in seeing what would happen with given beginnings" (320), thus experimenting with what Paul calls the "most fascinating game [my italics] there is, keeping things from staying the way they are" (313).</page><page sequence="23">Kurl Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 45 as defendant in a nationwide televised trial. Accused of "conspiracy to advo- cate the commission of sabotage" (294), he is initially "at ease, filled with the euphoria of well-publicized martyrdom for a cause in which he believe[s]" (295). But he gradually loses his composure, because, revealingly enough, even in the courtroom he finds himself at the mercy of a machine, a sophisti- cated lie detector which monitors his reactions and reveals that the real reason for his joining the insurgents is not his professed hatred of the ma- chines but his subconscious revolt against the oppressive image of his all- powerful father. Right in the middle of the trial, however, the uprising begins, the courtroom is invaded by hordes of Ghost Shirters, and Paul is carried out, "marionette-like" (304), on the shoulders of triumphant rebels. The revolution, which is fairly successful in Ilium and a few other cities, nationwide turns out to be a failure, and, what is worse, degenerates into a free-for-all riot in which the frenzied Ghost Shirters indiscriminately destroy everything and engage in senseless "vandalism and looting" (307), giving their chaotic enterprise "all the characteristics of a lynching" (311). Lasher, Finnerty, von Neumann and Paul are unable to prevent their motley troops from burning the museum, blowing up the sewage disposal plant, and playing havoc with everything somehow connected with machinery. Surrounded by massive government forces and faced with an ultimatum that the smoldering ruins of Ilium will be besieged for six months unless the leaders are surren- dered, the four disillusioned "brains of the Ghost Shirt Society" warily tour "the strongpoints on the frontiers of their Utopia" (316) and discover to their disgust that their Luddite forces have not only smashed everything, but that a representative group of them are happily repairing the most senseless machine of all, "an Orange-O machine," which dispenses a drink "no one in the whole country" (317) ever drank. And to his deep disillusionment Paul has to recognize that the very men who have just risked their lives in their revolt against the machines are now lovingly creating new ones - a man from the Reeks and Wrecks whom Paul has met earlier as a "desperately un- happy" person is "proud and smiling because his hands were busy doing what they liked to do best, [...]- replacing men like himself with machines" (318). Thus it is not so much the hopelessness of their situation, but their shocking insight that they have achieved no real change but only inaugurated another turn of the wheel, another cycle of destruction and reconstruction, which convinces the four leaders that they cannot do anything but surrender. It is here that a central motif of Player Piano achieves its final, and fright- ening, impact. At the beginning of the novel, Paul wonders about the soft- spoken Bud Calhoun from Georgia, a gifted engineer bearing the name of South Carolina's champion of slavery and nullification. And he muses about Bud, who will later invent a machine which makes himself superfluous and who, as a consequence, also becomes a member of the Ghost Shirt Society: "Bud's mentality was one that had been remarked upon as being peculiarly</page><page sequence="24">1 46 Peter Freese American since the nation had been born - the restless, erratic insight and imagination of a gadgeteer. This was the climax, or close to it, of generations of Bud Calhouns, with almost all of American industry integrated into one stupendous Rube Goldberg machine." (12) When one of the Reeks and Wrecks cleverly repairs the fuel pump in Paul's car with a piece of leather cut from the sweatband of his cap, he offers another instance of this very mental- ity (73f.), of which Kroner piously insists that it is not "just gadgeteering, blind tinkering," but "more than that" (126) and of which the founder of the Ilium Works, Thomas Alva Edison, is of course the most outstanding example. When Paul travels back from the Meadows and talks to the old train conduc- tor who has lost his job to a machine, he wonders "at what thorough believers in mechanization most Americans were, even when their lives had been badly damaged by mechanization. The conductor's plaint, like the lament of so many, wasn't that it was unjust to take jobs from men and give them to machines, but that the machines didn't do nearly as many human things as good designers could have made them do." (241 ) And when he thinks about the fully mechanized arms which have allowed America to win the final war, he realizes that the men who died in that war "were heirs to another American tradition, as old as that of the rifleman, but once a peaceful tradition - that of the American tinker" (243). Obviously, then, in Player Piano it is not the anonymous power of totalitarian systems which enslaves people, but a built-in human flaw, a faulty genetic design, as it were, which time and again makes human beings devise the very instru- ments of their suffering and lets them become the creators of their own unhappiness. This variation upon the Zauberlehrling motif, which shifts the standard dystopian complaint from the level of institutional repression to that of individual failure, is most cynically expressed by Finnerty, when he says: "If only it weren't for the people, the goddamned people, always getting tangled up in the machinery. If it weren't for them, earth would be an engi- neer's paradise." (313) And it is with this message that Vonnegut significantly deviates from such alleged predecessors of his as Huxley and Orwell. By insisting that it is not the machines which constitute the real enemy, but the built-in flaws of their human inventors, he turns the conventional anti-utopian complaint into a skeptical exploration of the human psyche.27 And he will explore the limitations of fallen man in his further novels with growing insis- tence and give this concern its most concise expression in The Sirens of 27 This reading is shared by most critics.

When the four leaders of the uprising hold their final conversation, Paul must admit to himself that once more he has not really understood what was going on. Asking Lasher belatedly what happened to 'lhe original Ghost Shirt Society," he not only learns that they all died, since their shirts were of course not bullet-proof, but that Lasher and Finnerty have known from the very beginning that they, too, "were sure to lose" (31 4) and have intentionally chosen a model for defeat and not for victory. And he realizes that each of the other three leaders has pursued his own individual goal. Finnerty, the cynical iconoclast, has got what he wanted, namely "a chance to give a savage blow to a close little society that made no comfortable place for him" (320). Von Neumann, the former political scientist, has seen the revolution as "a fascinating experiment," since he "ha[s] been less interested in achieving a premeditated end than in seeing what would happen with given beginnings" (320). And Lasher, the "enemy of the Devil" and "man of God" (31 5) and the "lifelong trafficker in symbols," "ha[s] created the revolution as a symbol, and [is] now welcoming the opportunity to die as one" (320). This is why when the four insurgents have a final drink before surrendering, Lasher's toast is "to the record" (320). Finnerty and von Neumann repeat this toast, joining the calm preacher in his insight that all they have achieved is a footnote in the history books. And when it is Paul's turn to present a toast, the ex-manager of whom Lasher had condescendingly said earlier that "he'll do nicely" (272) as the other-directed figure-head of the revolt and who was revealingly carried "marionette-like" (304) out of the courtroom, has to recognize that he is the only one of the leaders who had no real plan and no precise aim: "To a better world," he started to say, but he cut the toast short, thinking of the people of Ilium, already eager to recreate the same old nightmare. He shrugged. "To the record," he said, and smashed the empty bottle on a rock. Von Neumann considered Paul and then the broken glass. "This isn't the end, you know," he said. "Nothing ever is, nothing ever will be - not even Judgment Day." "Hands up," said Lasher almost gaily. "Forward March." (320) Thus, the novel ends with Paul's insight into the futility of his endeavors, and consequently some critics have found its message to be thoroughly pessi- mistic. Vanderbilt, for example, sees Paul faced with "not linear progress but hopeless cyclic regression,"28 and McGrath finds that according to Vonnegut 'lhe postindustrial individual will not likely reach out to embrace the humanis- 28 Kermit Vanderbilt, "Kurt Vonnegut's American Nightmares and Utopias," in The Utopian Vision: Seven Essays on the Quincentennial of Sir Thomas More , ed. by E.

This is, indeed, the tragic theme that permeates Player Piano."29 But although it is clear that, like the freedom-loving cat which paid with its life for trying to scale the fence, Paul and the others will be severely punished and in all probability even be executed, Hoffman is more convincing when he asserts that "the ending is affirmative because it reassures us that humans will continue to rebel against this prisonhouse of their own creation despite the failure of this rebellion, this man, or this period of history."30 There is indeed some faint note of optimism in both von Neumann's conviction that "nothing ever is the end" and Lasher's concluding words "Forward March." Human beings are not like the Biblical "lilies of the field," to which the epi- graph of the novel refers and which are gloriously beautiful although they neither toil nor spin, but they will always strive for improvement, history will go on, the abortive revolution will not be the last one, and men will not cease in their fight against hateful conditions, even if these conditions are of their own making. ***** The protagonist of Player Piano is certainly not a fully rounded character, and Segal rightly observes that none of the novel's actors, "including Paul, is as fully developed as one might wish, and most are two-dimensional characters if not outright stereotypes."31 Vonnegut would be the first to admit such limitations, since he repeatedly stated that he is not primarily interested in psychological details, and as late as in Timequake (1997) made his fictional alter ego Kilgore Trout observe that "if I'd wasted my time creating charac- ters, I would never have gotten around to calling attention to things that really matter." And when he added: "Trout might have said, and it can be said of me as well, that he created caricatures rather than characters" (T 63), he confirmed that his novels are more concerned with the exploration of general ideas than with the development of individual characters. Nevertheless, Paul Proteus is not only a spokesman for humanity's search for freedom and self- fulfillment in a world of oppressive machinery, but also a unique human being with his particular needs and desires. This is why Player Piano is not only a socio-critical extrapolation of threatening developments concerning a whole society, but why, on a different and perhaps less obvious level, it is also a 29 Michael J. Gargas McGrath, "Kesey and Vonnegut: The Critique of Liberal Democracy in Contemporary Literature," in The Artist and Political Vision, ed. by him (New Brunswick, 1982), 381. 30 Thomas P.

Segal, "Vonneguts Player Piano: An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia, 1 68.</page><page sequence="27">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 49 psychological exploration of the painful inner development of an individual man.32 From the very beginning, Paul Proteus, who "love[s] the machines [as] entertaining and delightful" (16) but also cares for 'lhe people [...] replaced by machines" (22), tries in vain to reconcile his conflicting impulses, and he time and again postpones his decision because he is being torn between his interests as a dedicated engineer and his loyalties as a concerned human being. That such a conflict results in some sort of incipient schizophrenia becomes obvious when, after his dishonorable banishment from The Mead- ows, Paul gives the following piece of advice to young Edmund Harrison, who is the only one to help him and later makes a brief return as an enraged critic of the system: "Don't put one foot in your job and the other in your dreams, Ed. Go ahead and quit, or resign yourself to this life. It's just too much of a temptation for fate to split you right up the middle [my italics] before you've made up your mind which way to go." (226) And when Harrison asks whether that has happened to Paul, he answers in the affirmative. On the novel's psychological level, then, Paul's drunken cry in the Homestead bar - "We must meet in the middle of the bridge!" (105) - not only applies to his desire for a reconciliation between the managers and the Homesteaders, but also expresses his need to find some bridge between his divided loyal- ties. Another important reason for Paul's mix-up is the fact that he cannot establish true human relationships, since most of the people he has to deal with behave like machines. A typical example is his colleague Baer, who is "just, reasonable, and candid," but also "remarkably machine-like [my italics] in that the only problems he interested himself in were those brought to him, and in that he went to work on all problems with equal energy and interest, insensitive to quality and scale" (187). The same is true of Paul's wife Anita, who "has the mechanics [my italics] of marriage down pat" (25), and whose machine-like behavior Finnerty comments on when he threatens to "design a machine that's everything you are" (46). However, not only are human relationships reduced to mechanical exchanges, but the conversion also works the other way round, and the engineers' relationships with their ma- chines and the managers' attitudes towards their organization assume sensual aspects and turn into a sort of love affair. The best example of this is Paul's competitor for the Pittsburgh job, Doctor Fred Garth, of whom it is said: 32 Lawrence R. Broer, Sanity Plea: Schizophrenia in the Novels of Kurt Vonnegut, rev. ed. (Tuscaloosa and London, 1994), 5, argues that, "while Vonnegut's role as a social critic is not to be denied, his reputation as America's most popular prose satirist has obscured the more personal and intensely psychological nature of his art," and he investigates 'lhe bizarre phobias, paranoid delusions, masked aggression, and desperate escapist compul- sions of Vonnegut's psychically maimed heroes."</page><page sequence="28">1 50 Peter Freese Garth was [a fine man], desperate to please, and he seemed to have an anthropomorphic image of the corporate personality. Garth stood in relation to that image as a lover, and Paul wondered if this prevalent type of relationship had ever been given the consideration it deserved by sexologists, [. . .] At any rate, Paul had seen Garth at various stages of his love affair, unable to eat for anxiety, on a manic crest, moved to maudlin near-crying at recollections of the affair's tender beginnings. In short, Garth suffered all the emotional hazards of a perennial game of she-loves-me, she-loves-me-not. To carry out direc- tions from above - an irritating business for Paul - was, for Garth, a favor to please a lady. (127f.) And that Anita has a similar attitude becomes clear, when after the party at Kroner's, where Paul and his wife learn about his forthcoming promotion, "Anita slept - utterly satisfied, not so much by Paul as by the social orgasm of, after years of the system's love play, being offered Pittsburgh" (133) [my italics]. Thus, even in his marriage Paul does not find the true love which might help him to make the right decision, but all he gets from his socially ambitious wife is the short-lived pleasure of sexual fulfillment. Anita pos- sesses "a sexual genius that gave Paul his one unqualified enthusiasm in life" (1 34) and regularly uses this talent for making him comply with her plans, as when after the failure of his farmer's dream she calls him her "little boy" and causes him to give "himself over to the one sequence of events that had never failed to provide a beginning, a middle, and a satisfactory end" and of which he thinks as Poe's "Descent into the Maelstrom" (178). The decisive reason for Paul's depressions and his moral paralysis, however, is his deeply disturbed relationship with his dead father, references to whom punctuate the novel. Not only is Paul regularly confronted with the omnipresent image of his father, who is nationally worshipped as the great hero who made it possible for America to win the war, but whenever he "fancie[s] himself in the image of his father" (38), he must realize to his chagrin that he cannot fill the old man's shoes. As a child and young man Paul hardly saw his busy father, and when Finnerty asks him about details, he angrily states: "How do I know what my father was? The editor of Who's Who knows about as much as I do. The guy was hardly ever home." (85) But he cannot rid himself of the overbearing shadow, and whenever he meets Kroner, that paternalistic archpriest of the organization either admonishes him "to follow in his father's footsteps" (66) or praises him for progressing "in the footsteps of your father" (49), and when he promotes Paul he does so "always in the name of his father" (1 27). Paul's psychological arrest becomes obvious when, in the presence of Kroner, he cannot help but feel "docile" and "childlike," as though he "stood in the enervating, emasculating presence of his father again" (48). Although Paul is angrily aware that he is not up to his father's expectations - "He could handle his assignments all right, but he didn't have what his father had, [...] the ability to be moved emotionally,</page><page sequence="29">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 151 almost like a lover, by the great omnipresent and omniscient spook, the corporate personality." (66f.) - he is never allowed to forget the great man, since Anita has put up a picture of Paul's father on his bureau so that "he could see it the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night" (66). And it is of course the crowning irony that she will later deceive Paul with Shep- herd, a man about whom she tells her cuckolded husband that "he's the spitting image of your father" (67). Even in his dreams Paul is haunted by the old man's shadow, and when after his dishonorable dismissal from The Meadows he sleeps with a prostitute, he awakes "from a dream in which he saw his father glowering at him from the foot of the bed" (246). The long chain of these references climaxes at Paul's trial, which Seed rightly calls "a cross between legal interrogation and psychoanalysis."33 There the prosecutor accuses Paul that he did not fight against the organiza- tion because of his professed humanitarian motives, but for another, and much baser, reason: [...] your red-white-and-blue patriotism is really an expression of hate and resentment - hate and resentment for one of the greatest true patriots in American history, your father! [...] I submit that this man before you is little more than a spiteful boy, to whom this great land of ours, this great economy of ours, this civilization of ours, has become a symbol of his father! A father whom, subconsciously, he would have liked to destroy! (298) And when the unerring lie detector confirms this diagnosis as correct, a chastised Paul confesses that he "can't deny" (299) the prosecutor's argu- ment that his "treason" originates from an "Oedipus complex" (298). Thus, there is sufficient textual evidence that Paul Proteus serves not only as the spokesman of Vonnegut's social criticism but also as the individual object of his psychological exploration. On this level, by the way, certain aspects of Paul's rejection of his father can be read as referring back to Vonnegut's disturbed relationship with his own father,34 and this is one of the reasons why Broer, who finds "Paul's psychodrama" more central to the book than its socio-political message, reads Vonnegut's apprentice novel as the first in a series of narrative attempts at exorcizing the growing threats to his own mental sanity in "a career-long process of cleansing and renewal."35 ***** 33 David Seed, "Mankind vs. Machines: The Technological Dystopia in Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano" in Impossibility Fiction: Alternativity, Extrapolation, Speculation, ed. by Derek Littlewood and Peter Stockwell (Amsterdam, 1996), 19. 34 See PS 59, and Lynn Buck, "Vonnegut's World of Comic Futility," Studies in American Fiction, 3 (Autumn 1975), 185, about the "theme of conflict between father and son."

Broer, Sanity Plea, 28 and 1 52.</page><page sequence="30">1 52 Peter Freese The main plot of Player Piano is restricted to the interaction of a relatively small cast of characters from either the management of the Ilium Works or the people of Homestead, and therefore it offers no possibilities for a scenic presentation of such other important facets of the fictional post-World-War-lll America as the military complex, the educational system or the realm of organized sports, which readers need to learn about in order to make up their minds about the new society. Fortunately, Vonnegut refrains from integrating these necessary aspects into his tale by having an omniscient narrator present the long descriptive passages which make many well-known dystopias come across as almost plotless treatises, but he resorts instead to a clever combination of two venerable fictional strategies. He gives eight of his thirty-five chapters to a wholly independent subplot centering around the Shah of Bratpuhr, the "wizened and wise [...] spiritual leader of 6,000,000 members of the Kolhouri sect" (26), who is on a state visit to the U.S. "to see what he could learn in the most powerful nation on earth for the good of his people" (26). Since he and his hilariously named translator Khashdrahr Miasma are shown around as guests of the government with Doctor Ewing J. Halyard from the State Department as their concerned guide, the Shah's travels through the country allow Vonnegut to combine the survey functions of the picaresque mode with the defamiliarizing effects of the Martian per- spective. The Shah, who is first introduced as driving through Ilium, is then taken to an army camp to speak to some soldiers, to the Carlsbad Caverns to see EPICAC XIV and be introduced to the President, to "Proteus Park, Chicago" to see how an "average man" (156) lives, and to Miami Beach to have his hair cut. On his way to Ithaca he has a revealing encounter with a failed writer's wife, and then he is shown Cornell University, where Vonnegut studied chemistry and biology from 1 940-43. While passing through Ilium on his way to New York, he and his entourage are accidentally caught in the riots, and he and his interpreter are last seen, "huddled together, asleep in a slip trench" (319) on the deserted battlefield of downtown Ilium. The Shah's itinerary allows Vonnegut to use him as a kind of picaresque guide for pre- senting his readers with diverse segments of society, and the fact that he comes from a different cultural and linguistic universe and looks at America with the astonished eyes of a stranger who is both naïve and wise makes him serve the same purpose which foreign visitors served from Montesquieu's Lettres Persanes (1721) through Goldsmith's The Citizen of the World (1762) to Howells' Traveller from Altruria (1894). Critics have complained that the Shah-subplot is unrelated to the main action, but this is simply not true. It is right that Paul and the Shah never meet, but Vonnegut links the different strands of his narrative in an indirect way, which is both ingeniously realized and highly meaningful. When the Shah is first introduced as driving through Ilium, it is said about his car: 'The</page><page sequence="31">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 53 limousine came to a halt by the end of the bridge, where a large work crew was filling a small chuckhole. The crew had opened a lane for an old Plym- outh with a broken headlight, which was coming through from the north side of the river. The limousine waited for the Plymouth to get through, and then proceeded." (27) And when Paul drives over to Homestead in "his cheap and old Plymouth" (29) to buy whiskey for Finnerty, he is stopped at the bridge by a group of Reeks and Wrecks, but then can "ease through the work crew, past a black government limousine, and into Homestead" (31 ). Unbeknownst to each other, then, the Shah in his state limousine and Paul in his old car pass each other by, and it is certainly no accident that they meet on the bridge, which connects the worlds of the haves with that of the have-nots, which is introduced with the narrator's comment that "not many people on either side ha[d] reasons other than curiosity for crossing" (9), and to which Paul refers when in his drunken appeal in the Homestead bar he demands that "we must meet in the middle of the bridge!" (105). At the end of the novel, the State Department limousine "crosse[s] the Iroquois River at Ilium once more" (300), and this repetition is driven home to the readers when Halyard answers the Shah's question about where they are by saying "Ilium. Remember? We crossed here before, going the other way" (301). And once more the car is stopped, "blocked this time, not by a Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps crew, but by a phalanx of Arabs" (302), who are, of course, Reeks and Wrecks disguised for the imminent riots, the first stage of which is then narrated from the perspective of the puzzled Shah. This connecting 'frame' provides by no means the only way in which the Shah-episodes are connected to the main plot. When the Shah visits the army, this episode is presented mostly through the enraged mind of Private First Class Elmo C. Hacketts, Jr., who has "only twenty-three more years to go on his hitch" (68) and dreams about going overseas to escape what will be one of Vonnegut's favorite targets in his later novels as well, namely the dehumanizing effect of senseless military drill. Nineteen chapters later this subsidiary character briefly reappears when Paul overhears a group of soldiers on the train and learns that "Pfc Elmo Hacketts is shipping out" to Tamanrasset in 'lhe Sahara Desert" (244). Later the Shah visits the house of Edgar R.B. Hagstrohm and his family from Chicago, whom, in what is per- haps the most scathingly satirical episode of the novel, the computer has selected as a representative "average man" (156): Edgar R. B. Hagstrohm [...] was statistically average in every respect save for the number of his initials: his age (36), his height (5'7"), his weight (148 lbs.), his years of marriage (11), his I.Q. (83), the number of his children (2: 1 m., 9; 1 f., 6), the number of his bedrooms (2), his car (3 yr. old Chev. 2 dr. sed.), his education (h.s grad, 1 17th in class of 233; maj. in business practice: 2nd string f ball, b'k'th'l; soc. comm., sen'r play; no coll.), his vocation (R&amp;R), his avoca- tions (spec'r sports, TV, softb'l, f'sh'g), and his war record (5 yrs. 3 ov'sea; T-4</page><page sequence="32">1 54 Peter Freese radioman; 157th Inf. Div.; battle stars: Hjoring, Elbesan, Kabul, Kaifen, Ust Kyakhta; wounded 4 times; P'ple H't, 3 cl.; Star Bťze Star, 2 cl.; G'd Cond. Med.) And the machine could have made an educated guess that, since Hagstrohm had gone that far in being average, he had probably been arrested once, had had sexual experience with five girls before marrying Wanda (only moderately satisfying), and had had two extramarital adventures since (one fleeting and foolish, the other rather long and disturbing), and that he would die at the age of 76.2 of a heart attack. (1 56f.) Ten chapters after this 'transparent' man is presented to the Shah as the average American, Paul is waiting at the police station to have his privileges revoked, and he accidentally observes a 'Wanted' report coming out of the "radiophoto machine," which calls for the arrest of Edgar Rice Burroughs Hagstrohm, R&amp;R 131313, and reads: Hagstrohm cut up his M-17 home in Chicago with a blowtorch, went naked to the home of Mrs. Marion Frascati, the widow of an old friend, and demanded that she come to the woods with him. Mrs. Frascati refused, and he disap- peared into the bird sanctuary bordering the housing development. There he eluded police, and is believed to have made his escape dropping from a tree onto a passing freight - (250) This narrative bracket not only contrasts the orderly appearance proudly presented to the visiting Shah with the chaotic reality smoldering underneath it, but it also demonstrates through the pathetic escape of a desperate man, who bears the programmatic name of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, that in the mechanized world of Player Piano the only jungle left to which a Tarzan can try to take his Jane is a "bird sanctuary bordering the housing development." When the Shah meets a desperate woman, whose husband has just lost all his privileges because, as a writer, he has refused to lower the "readability quotient" (233) of his manuscript, Halyard cannot understand such obstinacy and asks "Why doesn't he write about clipper ships, or something like that? This book about the old days on the Erie Canal - the man who wrote that is cleaning up. Big demand for that bare-chested stuff" (233). This passing remark establishes yet another ingenious cross-reference to what happens much earlier in the main plot. There a disgruntled Paul Proteus begins to develop "an appetite for novels wherein the hero lived vigorously and out-of- doors, dealing directly with nature, dependent upon basic cunning and physical strength for survival - woodsmen, sailors, cattlemen" (135), and he shows his secretary the book he is reading and which is "all about bargemen on the old Erie Ship Canal" and sports "the broad, naked chest of the hero on the book jacket" (135). For readers who catch this hidden link it becomes obvious that Paul's desire to escape into a world of romantic nostalgia is</page><page sequence="33">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 55 being anticipated by the ruling powers and that the books which Paul now reads are published for the very purpose of stabilizing the existing order by diverting discontent through the provision of vicarious wish-fulfillment in the imaginative adventures of literature. The main plot and the subplot, then, not only meet when the Shah's government car is accidentally caught up in the Ilium riots, but are skillfully intertwined throughout the novel in an oblique and rather unusual way. Thus Mellard, who is a little rash in arguing that Vonnegut has discarded "all the mechanical aspects of pictorialism associ- ated with Henry James and the mimetic novel" in favor of what Marshall McLuhan defined as a new medium and described as "'non-literate,' 'implicit, simultaneous, and discontinuous,"'36 is right in so far as Player Piano really shows some first, albeit still tentative, indications of what will then become one of the hallmarks of Vonnegut's mature novels, namely the spatialization of narration through the presentation of seemingly disparate episodes that form a polyphonic structure which it is the readers' task to rearrange into a meaningful whole. The Shah functions not only as a kind of picaresque travel guide through diverse segments of America's 'brave new world,' but he also provides a "wise" (26) spiritual counterpart to a soulless technological society. And since he cannot speak English and his interpreter has to translate whatever is being said, his journey becomes a sequence of eye-opening cultural clashes as well as hilarious linguistic misunderstandings, which have a defamiliarizing effect and subversively unmask as questionable achieve- ments what the U.S. technocrats consider impressive proofs of their cultural progress. The most obvious example is the recurring problem with the trans- lation of "average man" and "citizen" (28), the terms with which Halyard refers to the people who are neither managers nor engineers but members of the army or the R&amp;R. When this problem occurs for the first time, Khashdrahr Miasma is lost, as ironically befits his name, in the 'heavy vapors' of linguistic uncertainties and doubtingly says "Please, this average man, there is no equivalent in our language, I'm afraid." When Halyard answers "You know, the ordinary man, like, well, anybody" (28), and Khashdrahr dutifully trans- lates, the following dialogue ensues: "Aha," said the Shah, nodding, "Takaru." "What did he say?" "Takaru," said Khashdrahr, "Slave." "No Takaru," said Halyard, speaking directly to the Shah. "Ci-ti-zen." "Ahhhhh said the Shah. "Ci-ti-zen." He grinned happily. "Takaru- citizen. Citizen - Takaru." 36 James M.

Khashdrahr shrugged. "In the Shah's land are only the Elite and the Takaru." Halyard's ulcer gave him a twinge, the ulcer that had grown in size and authority over the years of his career as an interpreter of America to provincial and ignorant notables from the backwaters of civilization. (28f.) Here, in a very funny and most effective way, the alien's unprejudiced view unmasks the fact that the social structure of a "divided" (9) America, with the managers and the engineers on the one hand and 'the people' on the other, hardly differs from that of the Shah's allegedly backward country with its dichotomy between the elite and the slaves. When the Shah is shown an impressive army drill, he praises the parad- ing soldiers as "a fine bunch of slaves" and, when Halyard rejects his re- newed use of the Takaru concept as inappropriate, he quite innocently asks "if these not slaves, how you get them to do what they do," making an en- raged General produce the rather helpless answer "Patriotism" (69). Since this dialogue is framed by the desperate ruminations of Private Hacketts as one of the performing marionettes, once again the situational context proves the Shah right. And when later an exasperated Halyard complains to the General that the Shah "thinks of everything he sees in terms of his own country, and his own country must be a Goddamn mess" (71 ), the fact that he is sublimely unaware of his own ethnocentrism and the ironic implication that he might as well be speaking about his own country makes this com- ment all the more revealing. A similar disclosure takes place when the Shah's request that "he might see the home of a typical Takaru, freely trans- lated from one culture to another, as 'average man'" (1 56), is granted and he is taken to the Hagstrohms' house. There the guide proudly points out how fast the diverse labor-saving machines complete Mrs. Hagstrohm's house- hold chores, and when the Shah wants to know why she "has to do every- thing so quickly [...] What is it she has to do, that she mustn't waste any time on these things?" all the exasperated guide can come up with is "Live! Live! Get a little fun out of life" (159). But it turns out that Mrs. Hagstrohm is glad that the breakdown of her ultrasonic clotheswasher forces her to do the washing in a tub, because it "gives [her] something to do" (160). Thus, once again, the visiting stranger sees through the surface and reveals that the life of the 'average' citizen is a Takaru-, a slave-existence, since it is devoid of meaning and purpose and filled with nothing but unending boredom. But it is in the key scene of the subplot, namely, the Shah's visit to the Carlsberg Caverns there to see EPICAC XIV and be introduced to the Presi- dent, that the clash between the two cultures becomes most obvious and that the shortcomings of the American technocracy are most drastically revealed. When the President, a "gorgeous dummy" (119) who turns out to be a pro- phetic anticipation of real American presidents to come, has read out a</page><page sequence="35">Kurt Vonneguťs Player Piano 1 57 ghostwritten text improperly praising the supercomputer as "the greatest individual in history" (119), the Shah begs permission to ask EPICAC a question. When his request is granted, the following scene ensues: The Shah dropped to his knees on the platform and raised his hands over his head. The small, brown man suddenly seemed to fill the entire cavern with his mysterious, radiant dignity, alone there on the platform, communing with a presence no one else could sense. "We seem to be witnessing some sort of religious rite," said the an- nouncer. "Can't you keep your big mouth shut for five seconds?" said Halyard. "Quiet!" said Khashdrahr. The Shah turned to a glowing bank of EPICAC's tubes and cried in a piping singsong voice: "Allakahi baku billa, Moumi a fella nam; Serani assu tilla, Touri serin a sam." "The crazy bastard's talking to the machine," whispered Lynn [the Presi- dent]. "Sssh!" said Halyard, strangely moved by the scene. "S/Tc/7' cried the Shah. He cocked his head, listening. "S/'/c/?' The word echoed and died - lonely, lost. " Mmmmmm ," said EPICAC softly. "Dit, dit. Mmmmm. Dit." The Shah sighed and stood, and shook his head sadly, terribly let down. "A/Zòo," he murmured. "A//òo." "What's he say?" said the President. mNibd - 'nothing.' He asked the machine a question, and the machine didn't answer," said Halyard. "A/Zòo." "Nuttiest thing I ever heard of," said the President. (120) In this brilliantly executed scene, in which the shamanistic chant of the Shah is contrasted with the theatrical nonsense of the President, in which the archetypal test of solving a riddle is used for ascertaining the transcendental, that is, the sense-making powers of the testee, and in which even the skepti- cal Halyard is unwillingly impressed by the "mysterious, radiant dignity" of the oriental sovereign, EPICAC is unmasked as nothing but a soullessly hum- ming machine. Khashdrahr explains that his people believe "that a great, all- wise god will come among us one day, and we shall know him, for he shall be able to answer the riddle, which EPICAC could not answer. When he comes, there will be no more suffering on earth" (121). In the Shah's eyes, therefore, the computer has miserably failed, and thus for him the mechanical wonder, of which the technocrats believe that it has already ended all earthly suffering by creating a Utopian society, is revealed as what it really is, namely baku , a "false god" (122).</page><page sequence="36">1 58 Peter Freese In the final talk which the Shah has with Halyard before he is accidentally drawn into the Ilium riots, Halyard offers him the generous developmental aid of America: "At no expense whatsoever to you, America will send engineers and managers, skilled in all fields, to study your resources, blueprint your modernization, get it started, test and classify your people, arrange credit, set up the machinery." (302) But the Shah wants one question answered before embarking on the 'modernization' of his country, and when he has his inter- preter request from Halyard: "would you ask EPICAC what people are for?" (302), he sums up the very problem which stands at the center of Player Piano and which will be varied time and again in Vonnegut's further novels.37 When, in 1981 , Vonnegut "graded [his] separate works from A to D," he gave a straight B to Player Piano (PS 31 1 ) and thus indicated that he still thought well of it. But the critical evaluation of his apprentice novel ranges from its condescending dismissal as yet another variation of an exhausted formulaic genre on the one hand to its enthusiastic praise as an outstanding and original masterpiece on the other. Thus, Giannone sees the book as a mere rehashing of Huxley and Orwell and as "markedly conventional,"38 Ketterer takes it to be just one more dystopia "in somewhat conventional fashion,"39 Tanner sees it as "a fairly orthodox futuristic satire,"40 Samuels dismisses it as "a sort of Man in the Gray Flannel Suit as it might have been revised by George Orwell,"41 and Karl dubs it a "gentle allegory" with "minimal life"42 because of its dealing with a tired theme. At the other end of the critical spectrum, however, Hillegas praises Player Piano as "the best of the science-fiction anti-utopias - and indeed the best of all the recent anti-uto- pias,"43 Vanderbilt enthusiastically calls Vonnegut "the writer who would soon own the best Utopian imagination in American literature since World War Two,"44 Mustazza grants the book "brilliant originality,"45 and the Woods even call it "one of the best science-fiction novels ever written."46 37 In Kilgore Trout's novel 2BR02B, for example, which is retold in God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; or, Pearls Before Swine, this question is taken up almost verbatim when a character asks "What in hell are people fort" (GBY 25) 38 Richard Giannone, Vonnegut: A Preface to His Novels , 1 3. 39 David Ketterer, New Worlds for Old : The Apocalyptic Imagination, Science Fiction, and American Literature (Garden City, 1974), 296. 40 Tony Tanner, City of Words: American Fiction 1950-1970 (London, 1 971 ), 1 81 . 41 Charles Thomas Samuels, "Age of Vonnegut," The New Republic , 12 June 1971 , 30. 42 Frederick Karl, American Fictions: 1940-1980: A Comprehensive History and Critical Evaluation (New York, 1983), 246. 43 Mark Hillegas, The Future as Nightmare: H. G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians (Carbondale and Edwardsville, 1974), 159. 44 Kermit Vanderbilt, "Kurt Vonnegut's American Nightmares and Utopias," 140. 45 Leonard Mustazza, "The Machine Within: Mechanization, Human Discontent, and the Genre of Vonnegut's Player Piano," 1 1 3. 46 Karen and Charles Wood, "The Vonnegut Effect: Science Fiction and Beyond," in The Vonnegut Statement, 1 42.</page><page sequence="37">Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano 1 59 Of course, in the final analysis all these judgments reveal as much about the standpoint and taste of each critic as about the literary achievement of Vonnegut's first novel. But even the detractors of Player Piano must admit that this is an admirable accomplishment for an apprentice novel, since with regard to its central topic it not only turns out to be eerily prophetic, but with regard to its narrative properties it manages to add new and thought-provok- ing aspects to the exhausted genre of dystopia, to enliven the usually deadly serious form with strategically functional humor, to change the actors from mere carriers of ideas into at least partially individualized and psychologically believable characters, to make ingenious usage of both the picaresque mode and the Martian perspective, and to connect the main plot and the subplot into a polyphonic structure that unfolds a broad panorama of the world depicted. Moreover, if read in the context of Vonnegut's later novels, it re- veals the roots of many of the idiosyncratic techniques which would then develop into the hallmarks of his œuvre.
