STEINBERG As John Dryden observed in 1700, "Spencer more than once insinuates, that the Soul of Chaucer was transfus'd into his Body; and that he was begotten by him Two hundred years af? ter his Decease."1 Following Spenser's lead, recent scholarship has increasingly focused attention on Spenser's continuity with Geoffrey Chaucer, whether in terms of Spenser's "[a]dversative [c]onstructions," his persona and sources of authority, his concep? tion of eros, or his respect for female choice.2 Despite this grow? ing emphasis on Spenser's continuity with Chaucer, I would like to focus attention here on an important discontinuity between Spenser's Mutabilitie Cantos (1609) and Chaucer's Parliament ofFowls (ca. 1382) as a corrective to any potential exaggeration of Spenser's resemblance to Chaucer.3 The world of Spenser's Mutabilitie Cantos is very different from that of Chaucer's Parlia? ment of Fowls despite Spenser's own praise for Chaucer in his poem. The specific differences between Spenser's and Chaucer's poems, moreover, draw attention to the significant ways in which Spenser is removed from Chaucer in time and thought, especially in terms ofthe way in which each poet understands and portrays the sources of disharmony and suffering in the world. Writers in the second half ofthe sixteenth century repeatedly comment on the temporal gap that separates Tudor England from Chaucer's "mistie time," particularly in terms of language and style.4 Although Gerard Legh in 1562 extols "that famous syr Gefferey Chauser, whose workes do yet remayn as greene, Glenn A. Steinberg, who teaches in the English department and the Clas? sical Studies program atThe College of New Jersey, researches the reception of classical and medieval texts in England during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, with a particular emphasis on the evolving reputations of Virgil, Dante, and Chaucer from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="2">28 Chaucer and Spenser as the Lawrell tree," Peter Ashton, in the dedicatory epistle to his translation of A Shorte Treatise Upon the Turkes Chronicles (1546), makes much ofthe fact that he has chosen not to imitate "Chaucers wordes (which by reason of antiquitie be almost out of vse)."5 While praising Chaucer in 1586 as "a true picture or per? fect shape ofa right Poet," William Webbe admits that Chaucer's poetry is "blunte and course to many fine English eares at these dayes," such that it can only be fully appreciated "if it be equally pondered, and with good judgment aduised, and confirmed with the time wherein he wrote."6 Thomas Greene in 1576 allows that Chaucer's "auncient phrase . . . may bee permitted for a monu- mente of antiquitie" but that such language, if written in the sixteenth century, "might not be red without great misliking or lothsomnes to the eares ofthe learned or vnlerned, who had any capacitie or naturall iudgement."7 Spenser, however, painstakingly qualifies his contemporaries' sense ofthe remoteness of Chaucer's poetry and language. Indeed, continuity with the literary past?especially with "Dan Chaucer, well of English vndefyled"?seems to have been an important value for Spenser throughout his career.8 From The Shepheardes Calen- der (1579), in which Colin "of Tityrus his songs did lere," to The Mutabilitie Cantos, in which the narrator pauses ceremoniously to salute "old Dan Geffrey (in whose gentle spright / The pure well head of Poesie did dwell)," Spenser repeatedly underscores his close connection to Chaucer, revisiting Chaucer's name and work with remarkable constancy over the course of two decades as a poet.9 Accordingly, Spenser seems to challenge Elizabethan assumptions about Chaucer's remoteness in time and language, suggesting, by situating himself so conspicuously and so con- sistently within a Chaucerian tradition, that Chaucer still pos- sesses currency as a poet and literary model even in the face of the ravages of time. This currency as a poet and literary model necessarily depends for its existence on the fundamental stability of ideas, images, and tradition despite inconsequential changes in language, style, and custom?that is, on the stability of substance in spite of change in incidentals. Fittingly, Spenser explores the possibility of precisely that kind of stability in The Mutabilitie Cantos, adopting what John Guillory has called an "authoritative rhetoric of continuity."10 Na? ture, the final arbiter of Mutability's claim to primacy in Spenser's poem, frankly admits that "all things stedfastnes doe hate / And changed be" but nonetheless concludes that "ouer them Change doth not rule and raigne; / But they raigne ouer change, and doe their states maintaine" [MC 7.58.2-3, 8-9). The figure of Nature</page><page sequence="3">Glenn A. Steinberg 29 herself, moreover, appears to be evidence for this kind of endur? ing continuity within the literary realm. When describing Nature, Spenser suggests that she has not changed at all over the course of centuries of literature, such that, despite her appearance as a character in the works of a long line of writers, the process of describing her has remained fundamentally unchanged: So heard it is for any liuing wight, All her array and vestiments to tell, That old Dan Gejfrey (in whose gentle spright The pure well head of Poesie did dwell) In his Foules parley durst not with it mel, But it transferd to Alane, who he thought Had in his Plaint ofkindes describ'd it well: Which who will read set forth so as it ought, Go seek he out that Alane where he may be sought. {MC 7.9) If readers want to know more about Spenser's Nature, as with Chaucer's Nature, they need only "[g]o seek . . . out that Alane where he may be sought." Spenser's Nature, as well as the poet's act of describing her, is portrayed as timeless?the same today, 200 years ago, or 400 years ago. In fact, however, Spenser's Nature is not the same as that of Alan of Lille in his De Planctu Naturae (ca. 1165) (as any reader ofthe De Planctu Naturae is abundantly aware). Spenser's Nature is not even the same as Chaucer's. As Helen Cooney points out, Chaucer's two named sources in The Parliament ofFowls (Alan's De Planctu Naturae and Macrobius's commentary on the Somnium Scipionis [ca. 400]) are both concerned with "questions such as the operation of natural law and the cause of evil and suffering," questions that are central, as Cooney argues, to Chaucer's poem.11 Those questions are very much at the heart of The Mutabilitie Cantos as well. But in exploring such questions, Chaucer and Spenser seem to come to very different conclusions. For Spenser, disorder in the cosmos seems to be an inherent and pervasive characteristic ofthe cosmos itself, beyond the capacity or under? standing of human beings, but for Chaucer, disorder seems to be primarily a product of human influence, arising out of human pettiness and passion. Chaucer's poem seems carefully designed to explore, in Cooney's words, "the operation of natural law and the cause of evil and suffering." In particular, the assembly of fowls at the poem's</page><page sequence="4">30 Chaucer and Spenser end seems calculated to illustrate the way in which anarchy and conflict enter the world (albeit with the injection of a healthy dose of Chaucerian humor). The parliament of birds begins in harmony and order with "every foul" in "his owne place."12 But this initial tidiness is soon disrupted by the absurd courtly love posturing of Chaucer's aristocratic eagles. The entire social hierarchy is threatened by dissension and jealousy as a result. Human affecta- tion and pettiness, made all the more farcical by being projected onto eagles, ducks, and cuckoos, threaten to bring about chaos, much to the consternation of Nature (e.g., PFlines 617-9).13 Like the "brekers ofthe lawe . . . / And likerous folk" of Scipio's dream (PF lines 78-9), the all-too-human birds at the end of Chaucer's poem nearly descend into anarchy and violence, endangering, because of their petty desires and self-absorbed posturing, their potential to enter into "that place deere / That ful of blysse is and of soules cleere" (PF lines 76-7: cf. lines 666-72). Chaucer's Nature, who presides over the parliament of birds, belongs to a long tradition that conceives of "the goddess Natura as the mater generationis, the intermediary, subordinate, or vicar of God in the universe."14 As an allegorical figure within this tradi? tion, Nature is usually associated with Venus, who functions as Nature's rebellious handmaiden and antagonist. This traditional association of Nature with a rebellious Venus implies a fundamen? tal conflict between the order of the cosmos, as represented by Nature, and human agency, as represented by Venus, a symbol of human desire and, as a staple image in European love poetry, of human art and convention. In Alan's De Planctu Naturae, for example, the conflict between cosmic order and human agency is simple and explicit: humanity, misled by a corrupt and self- indulgent Venus, has upset the natural order ofthe cosmos with unnatural acts of sexual perversion, causing such great suffering and chaos that a doleful Nature laments, "Ecce, super hominibus acuta Veneris febre languentibus, aerumnosae lamentationis car- men cecini querulosum" ("Behold, I sang a complaining song of wretched lamentation about humanity, which is languid with the sharp fever of Venus").15 In Chaucer's poem, however, Nature is not at all Alan's un- ambiguous image of cosmic order and moral good.16 Chaucer's Nature is decidedly less successful at maintaining order among her followers than Chaucer's Venus is, for example, and she seems more dependent on the whim of Venus than the other way around. Both goddesses inhabit the selfsame garden in Chaucer's poem, suggesting a fundamental identity in the purpose and function</page><page sequence="5">Glenn A. Steinberg 31 of their two characters. As Judith H. Anderson notes, "[wjhen the goddess Nature herself explains that the birds mate as she 'pricks' them 'with pleasaunce,' it becomes still more difficult to distinguish her inspiration from that of Venus."17 In the end, the result of Nature's rule?the formel eagle's refusal to choose a mate and, consequently, the tercel eagles' continued suffering for love?seems to differ little from the conditions in Chaucer's Temple of Venus.18 In essence, Chaucer's Nature, unlike her counterparts in Alan and elsewhere, seems more a collaborator and equal of Venus than her superior and adversary. But Chaucer's Venus is nevertheless a figure associated with human behavior and with the destructive potential of that behav? ior. The temple of Chaucer's goddess of love is a hotbed of human lust, excess, and disorder?from the dancing women outside its walls, "[i]n kertels, al dishevele" (PFlines 232-5, 235), to the wali paintings that remind us of "many a mayde . . . / And al here love, and in what plyt they dyde" (PF lines 284-94, 287-94). In the feathered assembly later in the poem, the tercel eagles recall the courtly imagery of this temple, characterizing their love in affected, human terms expressing concepts of "trouthe" (PFlines 426, 428, 456-8, 479, 483), "servyse" (PF lines 419, 440, 453, 459, 470-6), "payne" (PFline 424), "sorwe" (PFline 469; cf. 251), "wo" (PFlines 427, 472), and death (PFlines 420, 423, 462, 469, 471; cf. 217, 294). Their incongruous posturing brings to mind the temple's allegorical figure of Craft that can and hath the myght To don by force a wyght to don folye? Disfigurat was she, I nyi nat Iye, (PF lines 220-2) as well as the figures of "Foolhardynesse, Flaterye, and Desyr, / Messagerye, and Meede" (PF lines 227-8). The human comportment of the eagles results in "cursede pletynge" without apparent hope of resolution (PFline 495). Hu? man yearnings and conventions of love yield only frustration [PF lines 491-3), argument (PF lines 494-7), reductive accusations (PF lines 589-93), classism (PF lines 596-602), and the threat of violence (PF lines 538-40). In the end, Nature laments, "I have herd al youre opynyoun, / And in effect yit be we nevere the neer" (PF lines 618-9). The birds' fruitless debate implies that disor? der in the human realm arises from humanity's own disruptive inclinations and from humanity's tendency toward obstinacy,</page><page sequence="6">32 Chaucer and Spenser irrationality, selfishness, and scorn, especially in matters of love. Significantly, Nature's harmonious, procreative order can only be restored, tentatively and temporarily, by a renunciation of Venus when the formel eagle vows that "I wol nat serve Venus ne Cupide, / Forsothe as yit, by no manere weye" [PF lines 652-3). Only by putting off her entrance into the realm of Venus?that is, into the culture of human love and conventionalized desire?can the formel eagle keep the parliament from turning truly ugly. For this reason, the most striking difference between Spens? er's Nature and Chaucer's is, arguably, the company she keeps. Indeed, Spenser radically transforms the Nature tradition by eliminating Venus from the scene entirely and adding Mutabil? ity in Venus's place.19 From the very beginning of The Mutabilitie Cantos, Spenser maintains that the world's disharmony and af? fliction are a product not of human influence or human desire but rather of Mutability: For, she the face of earthly things so changed, That all which Nature had establisht first In good estate, and in meet order ranged, She did pervert, and all their statutes burst. [MC 6.5.1-4) But the rift between Nature and Mutability, implied here in Mu- tability's perversion of Nature's "meet order," is only illusory and not a true rift at all. Nature and Mutability are reconciled at the end of The Mutabilitie Cantos when Nature offers Mutability her hand after her ruling on Mutability's suit against the gods [MC 7.59). Unlike Venus, who, though traditionally Nature's hand- maid, is a product and symbol of human affectation and desire, Mutability is purely a characteristic ofthe cosmos itself?Nature's own "daughter" [MC 7.59.1). By eliminating Venus and replacing her with Mutability, Spenser profoundly revises the cosmology of the medieval Nature tradition, shifting the blame for the world's disorder and affliction from humanity's disruptive inclinations to a broader category?the world's own inherent instability, which encompasses and surpasses human pettiness and vice. Such a conclusion is supported by Spenser's use of the fig? ure of Venus elsewhere in The Faerie Queene. Spenser generally portrays Venus as a primal, erotic force of natural fertility or as a beautiful, aloof queen of necessary, probationary convention and artifice. While Spenser's Garden of Adonis and Temple of Venus are not without their negative images and associations, they are,</page><page sequence="7">Glenn A. Steinberg 33 as Anderson observes of the Temple, "more positively weighted than sinister sites like the Bower of Bliss, the House of Busir- ane, or even Chaucer's Temple alone, without the surrounding garden."20 More importantly, in the Garden of Adonis, Spenser's Venus has become the mater generationis ofthe medieval Nature tradition, the female counterpart and consort of Adonis, "Father of all formes" [FQ 3.6.47). In the Temple of Venus, moreover, she is characterized in very much the same terms as Spenser's Nature in The Mutabilitie Cantos?veiled and hermaphroditic [FQ 4.10.41; cf. MC 7.5.6-9), the one by whom "all the world . . . at first was made" and who "dayly yet . . . doest the same repayre" [FQ 4.10.47.1-2; cf. MC 6.5.2-3). Chaucer's Nature in The Parlia? ment o/Fowls resides in the same garden as Venus and resembles the goddess of love in significant ways, but Spenser in The Faerie Queene utterly transforms Venus into Nature, completely revers- ing the direction of the similarity between the two goddesses in Chaucer and, in essence, restoring Venus as Nature's dutiful handmaid after her prolonged medieval rebelliousness. In Venus's place, Spenser's Mutability becomes a power? ful?though, in Spenser's treatment, often humorous?force of disruption and rebellion. In the figure of Mutability, Spenser conspicuously shifts the blame for decay and suffering from hu? man self-indulgence and pettiness to the world's instability and imperfection. Even the original sin of Adam and Eve is not the ultimate cause of our expulsion from the prelapsarian state of innocent happiness, but rather, Mutability is the true root cause, because all the worlds faire frame (which none yet durst OfGods or men to alter or misguide) She alter'd quite, and made them all accurst That God had blest; and did at first prouide In that still happy state for euer to abide. {MC 6.5.5-9; emphasis mine) Saint Paul writes, "by one man sinne entred into the worlde, and death by sinne, and so death wet ouer all men,"21 but in Spenser's poem, Mutability, not Adam, "death for life exchanged foolishlie: / Since which, all liuing wights haue learn'd to die" (MC 6.6.4-5). In more concrete terms, the tale of Arlo-hill, like Chaucer's parliament of birds, seems designed specifically to illustrate the way in which disorder and suffering enter the world,</page><page sequence="8">34 Chaucer and Spenser tell[ing] how Arlo through Dianaes spights (Beeing of old the best and fairest Hill That was in all this holy-Islands hights) Was made the most vnpleasant, and most ill. (MC 6.37.5-8) In the tale of Arlo-hill, an unseen, capricious agent and other - worldly events mysteriously conspire to generate destruction and chaos with tragic results for innocent bystanders such as Arlo-hill's unlucky "in-dwellers" [MC 6.55.9). In this respect, the contrast between Spenser's Ovidian nymphs and fauns on the one hand and Chaucer's anthropomorphic birds on the other is instructive. The harmony of Chaucer's feathered parliament is threatened?albeit humorously?by the courtly love posturing and fourteenth-century social tensions projected by Chaucer onto his assembled fowls. But the harmony of Spenser's Arlo-hill is threatened?more consequentially, though still humorously?by a divine prima donna and an unpredictable chain of unlikely and mysterious events. Arlo-hill's human "in-dwellers," the principal victims ofthe disharmony engendered in Spenser's poem, are not betrayed by their own actions or by the consequences of their own human pride and pettiness, as is the case with Chaucer's birds, but rather by an unpredictable, unseen goddess who brings about indiscriminate disaster and gross injustice over which the humans have little or no control. Because of the actions of Diana, which take place in a removed, mythical otherworld, very real and very tangible "Wolues and Thieues" are loosed upon the unsuspecting human population of Arlo-hill [MC 6.55.8). Diana, the chief culprit in this transformation, is not a native of Arlo-hill, nor do any ofthe mountain's native human inhabit? ants break in upon the fairy tale world of Spenser's story as hap- pens in Spenser's Ovidian source. In Ovid's tale of Actaeon, the victim of Diana's anger is a human interloper who accidentally enters Diana's secret grotto, "per nemus ignotum non certis pas- sibus errans / . . . sic illum fata ferebant" ("through unknown grove, wandering with uncertain steps . . . so fate bore him").22 Actaeon is an outsider, unaided by any of Diana's nymphs and wholly alien to the blissful, feminine world ofthe grotto, in which "simulaverat artem / ingenio natura suo" ("Nature had imitated art with her cleverness" [M 3.158-9]). For the crime of violating Diana's sacred space, the interloper Actaeon alone suffers, "nec nisi finita per plurima vulnera vita / ira pharetratae fertur satiata Dianae" ("and if his life had not been ended by many wounds, the</page><page sequence="9">Glenn A. Steinberg 35 anger of quiver-wearing Diana, it is said, would not have been sated" [M 3.251-2]). In contrast, the characters in Spenser's tale come solely from within the mythical otherworld of nymphs and fauns and goddesses?no outside human interloper here. Yet the punish? ment in Spenser's story is more general, affecting all the inhab? itants?mythical as well as human?of Arlo-hill. In Ovid, Diana curses a single man who has invaded and sullied her woodland refuge with his foreign presence (M 3.186-93); in Spenser, Diana curses an entire mountain for the actions of two figures who are, like her, mythical and superhuman (MC 6.55). In Ovid, Diana's anger is not satisfied until the human interloper dies (M3.251-2); in Spenser, Diana's anger is never satisfied (MC 6.51, 54-5). The point of Ovid's story seems to be that the world is a place where idle wandering and cruel fate can lead one into trouble (M 3.174-6); the point of Spenser's story seems to be that the world is a place where the invisible actions of nymphs and fauns have unforeseen and random consequences that adversely affect those who played no role in the original course of events. But if such is Spenser's point, that point seems at odds with the world portrayed in Chaucer's Parliament ofFowls where actions have immediate consequences and predictable social outcomes. Spenser's tale begins with the comical plotting of Faunus (re? peatedly characterized as foolish with a hint of tongue-in-cheek impertinence) and the improbable lovesickness of the river Mo- lanna (a lovesickness introduced to the reader suddenly, almost as an afterthought, without prologue or emotional investment). Faunus is a satyr figure who evokes classical personifications of human lust and sexual perversion, and Molanna is a nymph whose all-too-human love for the river Fanchin is "out of measure" (MC 6.44.3), but unlike Chaucer's birds, for whom resolution of conflict is (endlessly?) deferred, Faunus and Molanna recover quickly and easily from the consequences of their wayward sexual desire and willful social deviation. Faunus is punished for his ir- reverent cravings only "in sport" (MC 6.51-2, 51.2), and Molanna is in the end rewarded rather than punished for having "betraid" Diana (MC 6.51.6), since Faunus (for her paine) Of her beloued Fanchin did obtaine, That her he would receiue vnto his bed. (MC 6.53.4-6)</page><page sequence="10">36 Chaucer and Spenser Rather than serving, like Chaucer's birds, as warnings against? and satires of?human pettiness and vice, Faunus and Molanna seem to be emblems ofthe impossibility of completely suppressing human desire (MC 6.50.3-4, 53.4-9) and, more importantly for the plot of the story, a pretext for Diana's implacable anger. They inadvertently unleash disorder and suffering on Arlo-hill in the form of "Wolues and Thieues," but being merely literary tropes in a mythical otherworld, they themselves do not suffer from the presence of those "Wolues and Thieues," suffering instead other- worldly punishments "in sport." Diana, in her capacity as ruler of "the Circle ofthe Moone" "that neuer still did stand" (MC 6.8.1, 9), is an apt symbol and agent of mutability. Although provoked by the foolish, perverse voyeurism of Faunus, Diana abandons and curses Arlo-hill essentially on a whim, "full of indignation" (MC 6.54.1).23 Her departure is not part ofthe punishment of Faunus and Molanna, which all Diana's nymphs agree upon as just and carry out "according as they had decreed" (MC 6.52.1), and unlike that punishment, which is more merciful and entertaining than harsh and vindictive, Diana's choice to leave "her delicious brooke" seems a senseless overreac- tion, especially since she extends her ban to "those faire forrests about Arlo hid" and "all that Mountaine" as well (MC 6.54.2, 6, 7). Her resolve to leave, moreover, is followed, as an afterthought, by her decision to curse the area as she departs (MC 6.55). Her "heauy haplesse curse" seems, as a result, fortuitous and random, causing unearned and disproportionate harm to "that lands in- dwellers," whose lives are ever after afflicted by the presence of the "Wolues and Thieues" of Diana's spite (MC 6.55.3, 9). To the human inhabitants of Arlo-hill, their misery is the "too-too true" result of a mysterious, unseen goddess and poetic injustice (MC 6.55.9). The goddess herself, unlike Chaucer's birds, is not even inconvenienced by her ruinous, irrational actions.24 Significantly, Venus, who is often portrayed as Diana's adver- sary in Renaissance literature (e.g., FQ 3.6.16-24), is conspicu- ously absent from the story of Arlo-hill, just as she is absent from Spenser's court of Nature in canto 7. But Nature is implicitly present in the tale of Arlo-hill's decline in the figure of Diana, the "soueraine Queene profest / Of woods and forrests" (MC 6.38.7-8), and she is explicitly present on Arlo-hill itself in the next canto of Spenser's poem. Although Spenser's apparently benevolent and conciliatory Dame Nature hardly seems, at first glance, a dire, threatening figure of instability and affliction on the same order as Arlo-hill's spiteful goddess Diana, she is nonetheless the locus</page><page sequence="11">Glenn A. Steinberg 37 of "much confusion and disorder" lurking just below the surface in Spenser's poem (MC 7.4.9). From the moment of Nature's ar? rival in the fourth stanza of canto 7, "Natures Sergeant (that is Order)"(line 6) has his hands full accommodating the boisterous crowd that gathers to wait upon the goddess. In the following two stanzas, Nature's physiognomy is described as disturbingly indeterminate and confusing: whether she is male or female, terrible or beauteous, "[t]hat could not any creature well descry" (MC 7.5-6, 7.5.7). Within a few stanzas of comparing Nature's clothing to that of Christ at the Transfiguration (MC 7.7.3-9), Spenser likens the celebration of Nature's attending crowd to the "great ioyaunce" witnessed at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, which was infamous in epic literature as the event that ultimately set in motion the terrible destruction and suffering ofthe Trojan War (MC 7.12.1-5, 1). Like Diana, moreover, Nature disappears from Arlo-hill with disorienting abruptness after offering her final verdict in Mutability's trial. In the wake of this abrupt disappearance, the narrator's confusion, dissatisfaction, and doubt in the "vnper- fite" canto 8 draw attention to the instability and unreliability of Nature's resolution of Mutability's suit. As Arnold E. Davidson notes, "[ajlthough the 'whole assembly' is apparently satisfied with [Nature's] presentation and shows approval by silent as- sent, the final poet of Canto 8 . . . sees things quite differently. His response is human. He rejects all Dame Nature's fallacious premises and sophistical arguments . . . For him, Mutabilitie still reigns."25 Significantly, absent here from Spenser's poem is any consideration for human "eleccioun," to which Chaucer's Nature submits, for good or ill, throughout Chaucer's parliament (e.g., PF lines 386-413, 620-2). Spenser's Nature, unlike Chaucer's, requests no human input and receives none, ruling the wide cosmos solely by the dictates of her own inscrutable wisdom with the result that Spenser's human poet is left doubtful and unre- assured, a man, at the mercy of "this state of life so tickle," who must rely on faith for consolation rather than on his own agency or on cosmic stability (MC 8.1.6). But "this state of life" is "so tickle" precisely because Spenser's cosmos does not depend?or wait?upon human "eleccioun," as Chaucer's cosmos in The Parliament oJFowls clearly does. Venus, as well as the human inclinations and agency that she represents, plays little role in Spenser's mythology of disorder and suffering.26 Appropriately, Spenser alludes to Troilus and Criseyde (ca. 1380s)?rather than to The Parliament oJFowls?in the final stan-</page><page sequence="12">38 Chaucer and Spenser zas of his meditation on mutability, recalling, in his description of the world's "flowring pride, so fading and so fickle" (MC 8.1.8-9), Chaucer's own "world that passeth soone as floures faire."27 Of all Chaucer's works, Troilus and Criseyde is perhaps the most fatalistic, recounting, as it does, the tale of ill-starred lovers who are subject to the whims of Fortune (TC 4.1-14). But the evidence of Chaucer's meditation on disorder and love in The Parliament ofFowls, as well as his portrayal of social order and anarchy in his masterwork (e.g., in the Miller's Prologue), seems to indicate a considerably less fatalistic view of the world?a view, in fact, that respects the power of human agency and desire to influence the course of worldly events (both positively and negatively). For this reason, Spenser's claims of continuity with Chaucer must be regarded with caution. As Spenser's own narrator remarks of Mutability, "though she all vnworthy were / Ofthe Heav'ns Rule: yet very sooth to say, / In all things else she beares the greatest sway"(MC 8.1.3-5), including, presumably, in poetry.

In fact, James Dean sees in the concluding roundel ofthe poem an affirmation of mutability as a positive force for good: "The lyric seeks to convince us that all is well?perhaps that all is well that ends well?because things change for the better as surely as summer follows winter" ("Artistic Conclusiveness in Chaucer's Parliament ofFowls," ChauR 21,1 [Summer 1986]: 16-25, 21). Such a view of mutability is not at all un- common in the late Middle Ages. Gloria Cigman, for example, concludes that</page><page sequence="14">40 Chaucer and Spenser late medieval writers generally emphasize "the stability and ordered purpose of mutability in Nature" as opposed to "the capriciousness, inconstancy and fallibility of much human endeavour" ('The Seasons in Late Medieval Lit? erature: Mutability and Metaphors of Good and Evil," EA 51, 2 [April-June 1998]: 131-42, 141). 14 George D. Economou, The Goddess Natura in Medieval Literature (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1972), p. 2. More recently, Hugh White has revisited this characterization of the medieval figure of Nature in his Nature, Sex, and Goodness in a Medieval Literary Tradition (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2000). In particular, for example, White argues that Chaucer is skeptical of any portrayal of Nature as a wholly benign figure (chap. 7, pp. 220-55). 15 Alan of Lille [Alanus de Insulis], De Planctu Naturae, in Patrologiae Latinae Cursus Completus, ed.

Translations of this text are my own. 16 Many scholars situate Chaucer's Venus and Nature in moral contrast to one another and see that contrast as a cornerstone of the poem's organiza? tion and plot. See Russell A. Peck, "Love, Politics, and Plot in the Parlement ofFoules," ChauR 24, 4 (Spring 1990): 290-305: and Paul Piehler, "Myth, Allegory, and Vision in the Parlement ofFoules: A Study in Chaucerian Prob? lem Solving," in Allegoresis: The Craft of Allegory in Medieval Literature, ed. J. Stephen Russell (New York and London: Garland, 1988), pp. 187-214. On the other hand, however, David Aers ('The Parliament ofFowls: Authority, the Knower, and the Known," ChauR 16, 1 [Summer 1981]: 1-17, 8-9) and Elizabeth Salter (Fourteenth-Century English Poetry: Contexts and Readings [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983], pp. 134-9) see Chaucer's Venus as morally neutral rather than as a negative contrast to Chaucer's Nature 17Anderson, "'Couert,'" p. 651. 18 White, pp. 240-2. 19 This elimination of Venus is particularly noteworthy and suggestive, because, as E. B. Fowler notes, various literary courts of love served as sources and analogues for Spenser's "Court of Nature." See Edwin Greenlaw et al., eds., The Works of Edmund Spenser: A Variorum Edition, 10 vols. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1932-49), 6:292-3. 20Anderson, "'Couert,'" p. 654. On the negative images and associations of Spenser's Garden of Adonis and Temple of Venus, see Susanne Lindgren Wofford, The Choice of Achilles: The Ideology of Figure in the Epic (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1992), pp. 347-51, 350-1: Linda Gregerson, The Reformation of the Subject: Spenser, Milton, and the English Protestant Epic (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

Steinberg 41 23 John Maynard notes, "in such a timeless world, even motivation, nor? mally a fickle human force in cooperation with mutability, appears simple and pre-determined." Maynard points specifically to Diana's mysterious modesty, which "Spenser explains . . . with almost a childlike contentment with simple 'that's why' fact" rather than with a more comprehensive and comprehensible motive ("Perspectives on Change: Narrative Technique in Spenser's Cantos of Mutabilitie," JNT 4, 2 [May 1974]: 100-18, 108). 24 In this respect, Spenser is perhaps following Ovid, his chief source for the tale of Diana and Arlo-hill. As Michael Holahan notes, "the result hardly varies for the majority of Ovid's artless, powerless mortals who are continu? ally isolated in landscapes, bodies, and emotions beyond their control . . . [Ovid's gods] represent power over and in the world, natural forces with no logic or moral code beyond their own desires" ("Iamque Opus Exegi: Ovid's Changes and Spenser's Brief Epic of Mutability," ELR 6, 2 [Spring 1976]: 244-70, 250). The randomness and irrationality ofthe world ofThe Mutabilitie Cantos are certainly not confined to Arlo-hill. As Harry Berger Jr. observes of canto 6, for example, "the tussle with Cynthia, the interchange with Mercury, the military council of the gods, the assault on heaven, and the interview with Jove are all broken off. . . for apparently arbitrary reasons before they produce any serious consequences. Plot and narrative therefore seem ruled by contingency and whim, by unforeseen occurrences and unexpected reac? tions" (Revisionary Play: Studies in the Spenserian Dynamics [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1988], p. 254). 25 Arnold E. Davidson, "Dame Nature's Shifting Logic in Spenser's Cantos of Mutabilitie," NM 83, 4 (1982): 451-6, 455. 26 This shift in perspective seems to me to hint at a fundamental change in allegorical paradigm, what Stephen L. Collins has characterized as a "transition in the idea of order" from medieval thinking about the cosmos to Calvinist, Renaissance thinking as crystallized and propagated most notably in Thomas Hobbes (Collins, From Divine Cosmos to Sovereign State: An Intel? lectual History of Consciousness and the Idea of Order in Renaissance England [New York and Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989], p. 7). As Collins writes, 'Tudor theorists maintained the late medieval view that order was natural and that change was a threat to natural order," but on the other hand, "Hobbes understood that a world in flux was natural and that order must be created to restrain what was natural" (p. 6). The sense in The Mutabilitie Cantos that disorder is a part of the cosmos itself seems to me to suggest that Spenser, perhaps influenced by such pre-Hobbesian figures as Michel de Montaigne and Fulke Greville, may have shared and anticipated Hobbes's understand? ing of the inherent instability and unreliability of the natural order. Despite the common perception?encouraged by Spenser's own self-promotion?that Spenser is a conservative, quasi-medieval figure, continually harking back to his father Chaucer, Spenser's transformation ofthe medieval Nature tradition in The Mutabilitie Cantos seems to me to suggest that he was perhaps more a man ahead of his time than a man lagging behind it. Such an anticipation of Hobbesian thinking on Spenser's part is not as surprising as it might at first appear, given the troubling discoveries in astronomy during Spenser's lifetime. The discovery ofa new star in 1572, for example, threw into question the long-held Aristotelian theory of the immutability of the sphere of fixed</page><page sequence="16">42 Chaucer and Spenser stars.
