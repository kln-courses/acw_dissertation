<plain_text><page sequence="1">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA Part II By JAK YAKAR III. The Period of Emerging Dynasties EB III: 2450/2400-2100/2000 B.C. This is one of the most eventful periods in the early history of preliterate Anatolia. Urban and rural settlements in western Anatolia, in the central Anatolian plateau including the Pontus region and in the eastern highlands show signs of conflagration. Archaeological surveys carried out in north-central Anatolia and in the Konya plain suggest that in some cases permanent settlements were abandoned at different phases of the EB III. These destructions were no doubt caused by unrecorded events such as inter-regional rivalry between city-states, intruding pastoralists, incursions by foreign armies (e.g. from Mesopotamia/N. Syria), invasions by nomadic hordes and natural catastrophes (Yakar 1981a: 106- 7). On the basis of field surveys and a few excavations of limited scope alone one cannot establish a pattern of destructions which could be attributed to one particular factor described above.32 I prefer to refer to this period as "emerging dynasties" because monumental architecture in some of the major sites points to centrally located administrative complexes (palaces?) which, taken together with unprecedented mortuary practices (e.g. Alacah6yiik Royal Tombs), may confirm the existence of ruling aristocracies in Anatolia. The mythical(?) accounts of Akkadian kings warring in N. Syria and Anatolia against confederations made up of local kings are the only literary evidence which, in my opinion, could justify the use of this term for the EB III period in Anatolia. The regional schools of metalwork in western and north-central Anatolia seem to have increased their production capacities as a result of growing demands for their products. The advanced technologies introduced in this period and the highly developed artistic standards one witnesses in the metalwork and jewellery could not have been achieved so quickly without some external stimulus. The urban settlements in Anatolia were, as in the rest of the Ancient Near East, the nucleus of economic and demographic concentration, in other words the direct expression of a productive economy. Their political strength was related to their territorial and economic growth. The increase in population in most urban settlements was also brought about by the absorption of craftsmen and other skilled elements from rural settlements. One can only postulate that, as a result of this urban development, demographic changes in densely settled areas of Anatolia brought about not only inter-communal friction but an intensification of trade and craft specialization. Competition for trade rights and mining operations must have been very fierce, leading to occasional warfare. Consequently life in rural settle- ments could have become less desirable due to the growing disparity in economic growth between the relatively isolated settlements and the towns situated along trade routes or with access to maritime trade. In addition to city-states emerging in many parts of Anatolia during this 32For slightly diverging views on the subject compare Mellaart 1981, Burney and Lang 1971:62-73, Yakar 1976 and Mellink 1956:54-8.</page><page sequence="2">26 ANATOLIAN STUDIES period, large zones in the Pontus and in the highlands of eastern Anatolia must have been inhabited by nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes. These pastoralists no doubt included large segments of proto-Indo-Europeans which were arriving from southern Russia via the Caucasus and Transcaucasia (Yakar 1981 a). They were, as indicated by metal artifacts found with their burials, highly skilled metallurgists whose alloying techniques, casting methods and characteristic "animal style" in decorative art had left their imprint in central Anatolian schools of metalwork. Since some nomadic groups lived on the fringes of the cultivated lands of city- states, it is logical to assume that the excess man-power found employment in the administrative centres as skilled workers and maybe as mercenaries as well. A certain uniformity in metal technologies and forms encountered throughout Anatolia and to some extent in the Aegean could be partly attributed to the nomadic craftsmen and itinerant smiths who had joined the ranks of the "palatial" workers in major cities. Another factor which could have accelerated the diffusion of metal forms and technologies would be the exchange of gifts between royal houses such as Troy and Poliochni. Such exchanges could have resulted in the adoption of new conceptions and methods. A. WESTERN ANATOLIA The advent of the EB III period in the west is preceded by widespread destruction of settlements along the coast and in the hinterland. However, despite this destruction pattern which can be observed both in the southwest and northwest, this region as a whole underwent a major cultural transformation rather than a complete break with the past. We are still not certain as to what prompted these changes, and to what extent, if at all, they could be related to developments in southeastern Europe. What seems to be certain is that these changes started to take place after the last Kurgan invasion of Europe (Yakar 1981a). Since there is no noticeable departure from the traditional burial practices one may assume that the transmitters of the EB III culture in the west were mostly of the same ethnic affiliation as the autochthonus population. The material evidence for the EB III metallurgy is mainly derived from Karata?-Semayiik, Troy and the extra-mural cemeteries in the Bahkesir area. It must be stressed, however, that with the exception of Troy most of the evidence from the other sites is chronologically problematical and rather inconclusive.33 And, according to Traill (1983:181-6), even the so-called "Priam's Treasure" discovered by Schliemann should be treated with much caution. The serious discrepancies concerning the find-spot of this "treasure" between the preliminary and final reports submitted by Schliemann make the chronological value of some of the finds rather questionable. Karatay-Semayiik: The majority of the artifacts are derived from sheet-metal (Bordaz 1982:19). Since none of the KarataS sheet-metal objects were fashioned in the round, the sheet, once prepared on open moulds or by hammering, would have been cut in outline in the shape of the projected artifacts (Bordaz 1982:15-16, 19). The technologically more advanced process of casting in bivalve moulds was, nevertheless, known to the smiths of Karatag. Daggers with pronounced mid-rib reinforcing and a carinated macehead found among the metal assemblage could "3The Yerten (Korkuteli) material from southwest Turkey is made of ternary alloy with high tin content (Moorey and Schweizer 1974:113). The tin-bronze tanged flat dagger could be a good indication that some of the Yortan finds or others from cemeteries in the Balikesir and Afyon regions could well be of EB III date.</page><page sequence="3">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 27 only have been produced in bivalve moulds. Open moulds must have been used in the production of sheet-metal and bar-ingots which were subsequently hammered into wire. Razors, flat-blades and chisels too were probably cast in such moulds. Ear-studs found at Karata? were manufactured with a layer of incised gold sheet masking a core of some black crystalline material, perhaps a mixture of sand and pitch (Bordaz 1982:85). Other pieces of jewellery and decorative objects include perforated silver and gold discs (probably metal applique sewn on cloth or leather headbands or garments), belts, torques, bracelets, multiple coils, rings and pins. A few of these objects were made of silver. The great variety of metal artifacts and their close resemblance to similar classes of objects found in the Caspian region, led Bordaz to conclude that the EBA Lycians too participated in the trade of luxury items, especially in the EB III period (295). The Karatag material in general could be regarded as the product of a regional school of metallurgy in Lycia. Troy IIc-IV-V: The violent destruction of Troy II brought about a certain decline in the material culture which can also be observed in the metal industry. I suggest therefore that the metalwork of Troy II should be evaluated separately from that of the following period. Troy II, like its neighbour Poliochni V (Yellow) across the Aegean was becoming an important trading partner in the complex maritime trade. Its "palatial" metal industries produced artifacts in far greater numbers when compared to the preceding or the following periods. This can only indicate an increasing demand for the metal products of Troy which must have supplied not only the markets in the hinterland but the eastern Aegean islands as well. The new types of tools and weapons include a great variety of spearheads, daggers, knives, chisels and some toilet implements (Branigan 1974:153-203; Esin 1969 and Bittel 1959). The technical improvements from the previous period are seen mainly in jewellery making, and in the greatly increased production of large and small vessels. It is a fact that certain metal technologies (e.g. sheet-metal) or the potter's wheel reached western and central Anatolia from Syria/Mesopotamia rather late in the Early Bronze Age. Therefore, the Troad or even Cilicia could not have been major sources of inspiration for the more developed cultures of the Near East, at least not before the last quarter of the third millennium B.C. The absence of smelting equipment at Troy II (as in Troy I), such as smelting furnaces or pot bellows, and waste material (slag heaps), is construed as an indication that the craftsmen here were involved in smithing and not smelting (de Jesus 1980:136). Already by middle Troy II commercial contacts with the eastern Aegean and regions across the Taurus increased considerably (Yakar 1979:55-6). The "palatial" workshops, if the great number of moulds from this period (Branigan 1974:77-83, 201-2) is any indication, must have increased their production of tools and weapons. Artifacts made of precious metals too ranged among the exported goods. The gold vessels from the Cyclades, for instance, are not regarded as local products (Branigan 1974:110). If this was indeed the case, then Troy II workshops were among the likely suppliers of these and other luxury items. But this should not be interpreted as Troy IIc-g having close commercial links with ports in the Argolid or other coastal regions of Greece. The so-called Troadic types in metal found at a number of sites in the Argolid and Attica may have been imported from the Cyclades (Branigan 1974:113). In this period of standardization of metal weapons and tools, which was brought about because of continuing competition for new markets, it is very difficult to trace many of the new forms in metal artifacts back to a particular school, local or regional. Even in western Anatolia some of the dagger, spearhead and axehead forms are regarded as variants of central Anatolian</page><page sequence="4">28 ANATOLIAN STUDIES types which had spread to other parts of the Near East (Stronach 1957:94-125). Of paramount interest in alloying techniques is the nearly unprecedented popularity of tin-bronzes in the manufacture of flat axeheads, arrowheads, spearheads, long and short daggers, pins, needles, razors, tweezers, chisels, nails, saws, knives, spikes, borers, fish-hooks, punches and sickles (Esin 1969, Branigan 1974). Copper-arsenic alloys were not as popular at Troy as they were in the Cyclades, in central Anatolia or in the Pontus region at this time. High and middle-grade tin- bronzes at Troy II account for more than 64% of all the pieces analysed (de Jesus 1980:368, Graph:10). If we added to this the analyses of metal artifacts from the Troad (Bittel 1959:1-34) where 75% of the objects were made of high-grade tin- bronzes, then the ratio goes up considerably. These metal objects from the Troad, which were purchased by the Berlin Museum, are said to be from a tomb in the Troad. They are mainly fragments of metal vessels with voluted or basket handles, and pans (Branigan 1974:148). The abundance of high-quality tin-bronzes at Troy and from the Troad suggests that the former had either access to sources of tin in the northwest, probably in the Bursa province (see AS 34, 1984, 80), or this alloying tradition and supplies of tin came by way of central Anatolia. In the later phases of Troy II closer contacts with regions in north-central Anatolia, the southern plateau, Cilicia and across the Amanus may account for some of the innovations in the field of metallurgy and new forms of artifacts. It must be these contacts that helped the smiths of Troy II become familiar with the metalworks of their Mesopotamian counterparts. The cire-perdue and a jour casting processes were introduced at this time. New forms include the double-spiral pin, the toggle pin, probably introduced from the southeast, the barbed arrowhead, the knife with a pronounced curved tip, the shaft-hole axe-adze and the shaft-hole axe-hammer (de Jesus 1980:136). Troy III-IV/ V: With the destruction of Troy IIg we see a decline not only in the quality of the metal artifacts from this site, but also less variety of forms. As de Jesus pointed out (1980:135, 368) there is a sharp decline in the production of tin- bronze objects. Unalloyed and low arsenical coppers are a majority, although it has to be pointed out that the number of analyses made is small. To judge from a ternary alloy and a few high to medium grade tin-bronzes, it may be assumed that some of the alloying practices of Troy II continued in this period. But, at the same time, it is clear that the events which caused the destruction of Troy IIg had led to changes in the socio-economic sphere as well. Maybe the "palatial" workshops ceased to function and their craftsmen partly dispersed. This could explain the reason for far fewer jewellery and other artifacts made of precious metals in this period. Since trade may have also been affected, it must have caused the decline in tin supplies. Among the numerous copper deposits which could have been exploited by the metal industries in the Troad are the Korudere deposits 30 km. west of Qanakkale (MTA 1972:61). The small quantity of silver in the ore is an indication that the tin- bronzes from the Troad which contain traces of Ag. (Branigan 1974:148) may have been made of Korudere's copper. Other deposits located in the Canakkale province include Balcilar, Camyurt, Dogancilar and Giimiigati (MTA 1972:61, 76-7; de Jesus 1980:236-7). As for silver, the Bergaz and Balya deposits in the northwest are among the likely sources (de Jesus 1980:138). Balya Maden could also have supplied the Trojan workshops with gold (in fact between 1880-1935 it yielded 3000 kg. of this metal; see MTA 1972:81-3). Muhly, on the other hand, views the question of local gold supplies with scepticism (1977). While he claims that "there is no geological evidence for gold in the Troad," he proposes the Black Sea coast of</page><page sequence="5">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 29 Bulgaria as a possible source of Trojan gold. Troy's gold repertory represented in some fourteen different treasures, mainly from IIg, includes basket-earrings, diadems, necklaces, bracelets, beads and a variety of household objects (de Jesus 1980:88). Most interesting, as far as techniques are concerned, is the introduction of applique, cloisonne decoration and gold to gold soldering in the local work- shops. B. CENTRAL AND NORTH-CENTRAL ANATOLIA Any assessment of the regional schools of metalwork in the central plateau and in the Pontus should be accompanied by a summary of the cultural changes taking place in the second half of the third millennium B.C., and not only in the regions in question but also in Transcaucasia, in the Caucasus and southern Russia. The cultural homogeneity of the EB II period in the area extending from the Caucasus to the upper Euphrates vanished in the following period. The regional cultures are now characterized not only by changes in the pottery forms or in metalwork, but by the introduction of new burial habits in the Kura-Arax region and north of the Caucasus. Most of these changes are usually attributed to the arrival of "Kurgan" groups from the north. In Transcaucasia these pastoralists seem to have coexisted with the local sedentary population. However, the impact of the population movements now spreading from Georgia and Armenia to the west and south brought about changes in the demographic structures and cultures. These changes are best observed in north-central Anatolia where they are reflected by new burial customs such as communal burial grounds not far from the settlements, sometimes within their perimeter. The cemeteries at Kavak, Tekekdy, Ikiztepe in the Pontus region, Alacah6yiik and Kiiltepe in the central plateau provide some of the best examples of these new developments in the burial practices. In Corum, Amasya and Tokat, on the other hand, cemeteries were kept at quite a distance from the domestic areas. Two such extra-mural cemeteries some 50 km. north of ?orum, G611er and Oymaagaq, revealed jar burials with rich deposits of metal artifacts. These include pins, metal vessels, weapons such as shaft-hole axes, spearheads, maceheads, and religious imagery consisting of bull figurines, deity representations and sun-discs (Ozgiiq 1978:89). Although these graves are unlike the shaft-graves of Alacahoyiik or Horoztepe, their contents are similar but not as elaborate. One should not get the impression that the intra-mural burial custom was replaced by extra-mural burial practice in central Anatolia. In fact the two traditions seem to have co-existed at least in the Corum district as suggested by the Kahnkaya burials discovered both within the EB III settlement and well outside of it (Yakar 1981:105, n. 8). Another important development in this period is the emergence of tombs of unprecedented shapes and dimensions. The Alacahoyiik shaft-graves, the Kiiltepe circular stone-cists, the Alacahan cist-graves in the southeast, the Gedikli chamber tombs with dromoi are some of the examples so far discovered. The only thing some of these contemporary tombs have in common is their monumental aspect and their rich metal finds stressing the high social status of persons of ruling families buried in them. The different cultural and ethnic affiliations of the inhabitants of these regions are not inferred from the intra-mural versus extra-mural distinction only. At ikiztepe, for instance, the majority of inhumations were male and buried only with their personal weapons, whereas contemporary tombs in the Corum district produced more varied burial deposits including pottery. Alacahoyiik "Royal Tombs": It has been suggested that "Alaca was not a place</page><page sequence="6">30 ANATOLIAN STUDIES of rule, rather a sacred burial ground where Pontic princes were laid to rest" (de Jesus 1980:127). Since the EB II-III architecture is not dense, and the little known to us can hardly be called "royal residences", it is possible to postulate that the Pontic rulers were mainly nomads of proto-Indo-European origin ruling over not only their pastoral tribes who entered Anatolia from secondary staging areas in the east, but eventually over the natives (farmers) of the land. It should be further stressed that the majority of EB sites in the Pontus and parts of central Anatolia show signs of desertion and uncontinuous occupation in the second half of the third millenium B.C. (Yakar and Dinqol 1974). At Ikiztepe, Diindartepe and Kavak the EBA architecture of this period is rather flimsy and not indicative of administrative centres. The shallow shaft-graves of Alaca are absolutely different from what we know about tomb architecture in Anatolia and in the ancient Near East in general. These large tombs lined with low stone walls and provided with wooden corner posts which supported a wooden ceiling (remains of wooden logs were found above the tomb deposits) recall somehow the two princely tombs of a much earlier period found at Korucutepe. Mellink looking for parallels for this type of tombs in near- by regions concluded that, apart from the Maikop region where similarities are found in the form and contents of the princely tombs, the shaft-graves of M.H. III- L.H. I Mycenae follow the same principles of construction (Mellink 1956:55-6). Assuming that the people buried in the Alaca and Maikop tombs derived from the same ethnic centre of diffusion as the Mycenaeans, Scythians and Phrygians, in other words Indo-European speaking tribes (Mellink 1956:56), the similarities in their burial customs should not be surprising. But, what is more important and relevant to our evaluation of the EB III metallurgy is the strong impression that the regional schools in the central plateau owed some of their outstanding achieve- ments to the superior technological know-how and craftsmanship of the Pontic smiths. The Alaca material from the tombs may be divided into a number of categories; objects of religious significance, weapons, jewellery and household objects made of gold (Mellink 1956; Orthmann 1966; Maxwell-Hyslop 1971:42-6). While the cult-objects such as sun-discs, figurines and sistra were produced for local markets (cult centres), a great variety of daggers, long-swords and bent- tanged spearheads manufactured by the regional industries may have been exported, according to surplus and demand, to settlements in western and southeastern regions. Mould or cire-perdue casting was practised in the Pontus (de Jesus 1980:126). The "inverse segregation" process in coating some of the metalwork, and in particular the bull figurines, with a thin layer of arsenical-copper was a technique brought to Anatolia probably from the Caucasus.34 The high quality tin-bronzes from Alacahoyiik, Horoztepe and Kayapnar are another indication of highly developed alloying techniques in the Pontus. Close to half of the analysed artifacts from Alacahoyiik were made of tin-bronzes (Esin 1969; de Jesus 1980:125-6). It seems that the smiths of the Pontus region preferred to work with tin-bronze rather than arsenical copper. The latter was also used as a base-metal but to a much lesser extent. Tin could have been preferred for a variety of reasons; in ingots it was obviously not very cumbersome to transport, and being less brittle than arsenical copper it must have been easier to work with. But the main reason for its popularity no doubt should be related to the steady supplies of 34For a distribution of arsenic coated copper objects see Eaton and McKerrell 1976:176-7.</page><page sequence="7">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 31 this metal, either from a still unknown local source (e.g. Amasya?) or via Transcaucasia. The relative abundance of tin objects in Armenia and Georgia (dating from the later second and early first millennia B.C.) may suggest that this metal was either mined in these regions or obtained from Iran or western Afghanistan.35 As for the supplies of copper, the Pontus region has rich deposits, such as the Kozlu mines (de Jesus 1980:251) and others in the region of Tokat, Amasya, Merzifon and Corum (MTA 1972). The silver deposits of Giimii* in Amasya and other argentiferous galena-bearing sites in near-by regions might have also been exploited by north-central Anatolian metal smiths (de Jesus 1980:78). The vast repertory of gold objects from Alaca suggests that an important gold working industry existed in the Pontus. This is further confirmed by impressive finds from Horoztepe and Mahmatlar. But a comparison of the Alacajewellery, for instance, with that of Troy IIg gives one the impression that the former was less sophisticated from the artistic view-point. In fact some of the more refined pieces of jewellery may have been either imported or inspired from the west (Mellink 1956:51). It is not very surprising to find some western influence reaching central Anatolia at this time. Increasing trade contacts which must have also included some supplies of west Anatolian gold to the central plateau may partly account for the emergence of certain western techniques and styles in the EB III Pontic metallurgy. Horoztepe (Graves): The cemetery, which belongs to an EBA III settlement adjacent to it, has revealed important grave goods of metal, believed to be slightly later than those of Alaca. Although silver and gold objects were found at Horoztepe, they were not as abundant as at Alaca. But copper-based objects include furniture which was unknown at other Pontic sites and a rich collection of cult-objects (Ozgiiq 1958). Sheet-metal technology seems to be widely practised here as at other Pontic sites. It is not unlikely that this method of manufacturing metal vessels, head bands and furniture reached this part of Anatolia, as well as western Anatolia, from metalworking centres in southeastern Anatolia or from Mesopotamia. At Horoztepe high- and medium-grade tin-bronzes make for more than half of all the objects analysed (Esin 1969); de Jesus 1980:130). Middle and low arsenical coppers account for one quarter of the metal artifacts. This indicates that the smiths who produced the Horoztepe metal objects belonged to the same regional school of metalwork as those of Alaca, Mahmatlar and Kayapinar who had a preference for good-quality tin-bronzes. The Mahmatlar material is com- posed of 9 axeheads made of high grade tin-bronzes. Only two of the axeheads were made of other material; an unalloyed copper and a medium grade arsenical bronze respectively (Esin 1969:141, 168). The Kayapinar objects, which I date to the EB III, suggest that arsenical bronzes and ternary alloys were still popular in parts of central Anatolia. But the influence of the Pontic smithies may be seen in the presence of high-grade tin-bronze artifacts in the small repertory from Kayapmar (9 analyses: Esin 1969:135). Ikiztepe (Necropolis): Mound I, or a large part of the EB II settlement, seems to have been deserted in the second half of the third millennium B.C. and used as a burial ground by newcomers during the EB III period. The ikiztepe excavations so far did not produce much architectural evidence concerning the EB III settlement. However, the presence of a red-burnished ware with black interior suggests that this site was inhabited to some extent in the third and fourth quarters of the third 35The polymetallic copper deposits in these countries make them a likely source of tin. See also notes 20-1.</page><page sequence="8">32 ANATOLIAN STUDIES millennium B.C. It is very significant, however, that while architectural evidence for a major EB III settlement at ikiztepe is still lacking, the EB III cemetery is producing hundreds of burials. Was this cemetery then one of several common burial places for a semi-nomadic people who invaded northern Anatolia in the EB III? Only further excavations can answer this question. In the meantime inhuma- tions seem to be the rule, and the position of the bodies, which lack a common orientation, lying flat on their backs with the arms on each side of the body, the legs stretched out together and the skull facing the sky, certainly indicates a custom hardly known in central or western Anatolia at this time. The simple graves produced so far more than 500 metal weapons, jewellery and objects of cultic significance (Bilgi 1982:49-54); Alkim, U. B. 1983). Quite a large number of graves with single occupants (that seemed to be the custom at ikiztepe) revealed more than one personal weapon deposited with the dead. In fact the large variety and number of weapons suggest that most of those buried here were "fighting men" of a "warrior" tribe. The female burials, on the other hand, were mostly accompanied by jewellery and other small artifacts such as pins. Not every grave produced the same variety and quantity of metal finds. A few burials, mostly female, were found with only a bowl between their legs (Bilgi 1982:49-54). These differences in the content of the graves may suggest that social stratification was an accepted norm of tribal or communal life at Ikiztepe. The most common type of weapon found at Ikiztepe is the spearhead. Some 60 types of this weapon have been recently recorded by Bilgi.36 Other weapons include 8 types of axes, daggers and arrow- heads. A mould (shaft-hole axe) discovered at Ikiztepe suggests that at least some of the metal production was done locally. Among the burial gifts are a number of quadruple spiral plaques (Bilgi 1981) which are the exact replicas of the one such example published by Palmieri from Arslantepe EB I (discussed in Part I). Unlike the spiral beads of similar shape made of gold and silver, these are much larger, measuring 9 x 6 cm. on the average (Bilgi 1981:189). In this period in the Near East this motif was usually used in necklace beads as in the Royal Tombs of Alaca, Troy II, Eskiyapar, Tell Brak, a child burial of level II of Karum Kane', Mari, Crete and Mycenae. Bilgi suggested that they may be cult signs rather than mere pieces of ornamentation (1981:189). If so, then it is possible that this symbol was initially introduced by proto-Indo-Europeans. Most of the spearheads are shaped like willow-leaves. They are trapezoidal in section with a flat ridge and a long bent tang. The blades are not slotted and at least one of them is unusually large (Bilgi 1981:190). Some of these blades were placed in a sheath before being deposited in the grave. Some of the spearheads were probably ceremonial. Two of these found recently depict human figures in relief, a male on one side and a female on the other (Alkim, U. B. 1983). A sun-disc consisting of two concentric circles placed on top of the human figures leaves no doubt that divine couples are represented on these ceremonial spearheads. They resemble the abstract figurines found in Alacahoyiik and Ahlathlbel though they are different in technique and shape. The sun-disc on the spearheads also resembles the "standards" or "sun-discs" from Alacahoyiik. As for the human figures represen- ted in relief, they are depicted with their arms spread, round faces, pointed noses and their eyes are marked with little holes. In one of the male figures the penis is distinguishable. While there is no absolute similarity between the cult objects of the Early Bronze Age III in north-central Anatolia and those known to us from Hittite 36Personal communication.</page><page sequence="9">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 33 art, one feels that somewhere there is a connection, maybe not in style but certainly in the concept and symbolism of these cult objects. Most of the metal objects produced by the smiths of ikiztepe are copper- based. Even the jewellery, with the exception of a few pieces, is made of copper. Strangely enough, tin-bronzes were not manufactured at Ikiztepe. The preferred alloy was a high arsenical copper (Ozbal 1981; Kunq 1981). Such alloys were not known at ikiztepe in the EB I-II metallurgy, at least not high contents of arsenic in the copper. According to still unpublished reports some of the metal artifacts contain as much as 12% arsenic in the copper (see footnote 36). The metalwork of ikiztepe, it seems, did not develop locally, but was introduced by newcomers in the second half of the third millennium B.C. This does not mean that the EB I-II settlers of ikiztepe did not possess a metal industry; they did indeed, but the finds from the EB III cemetery reflect a technological tradition and metal repertory that was previously unknown. Some of the finds may be compared to similar objects found at Horoztepe, Eskiyapar and Alacahdyiik. This may suggest that while the Bafra plain, including the Samsun region (e.g. Tekekdy), had developed its own regional school of metallurgy in the EB III period, the inhabitants of this region were ethnically affiliated to the semi-nomadic tribes of north-central Anatolia. In discussing the ethnic origins of the EB III inhabitants of ikiztepe and other Samsun region settlements, one should consider the following material culture remains from this site: a gold ring-shaped figurine made of sheet metal is similar to the Varna gold figurines of the Gumelnita period. However, the one from Ikiztepe, those from Trabzon (the Trabzon "hoard"), and another from Kahnkaya show more developed forms than those from Varna. Furthermore, some of the clay statuettes found with female burials (Bilgi 1982) have close parallels in east European cultures. These anthropomorphic figurines representing richly adorned female figures, of deities, are of a style previously not encountered in central or north-central Anatolia. Some of them are decorated with copper earrings and other jewellery. While some of the artistic traits observed in the figurines resemble the style of some east European statuettes, the technical aspects of the metal industry of ikiztepe suggest Caucasian and Transcaucasian expertise in the development of the local metallurgy. What happened at Ikiztepe towards the end of the EB III period is still unclear. The transitional period (ca. 2100-1900 B.C.) pottery is found in Mound I. But, there is no evidence that the cemetery continued to be used at that time. Did the inhabitants (semi-nomads) disperse to other regions in Anatolia, or even further south? Were they forced to leave the Pontus region by groups arriving from central Anatolia? To these questions we do not have concrete answers. In the meantime the evidence from Ikiztepe suggests that many of the metal forms from northern Syria/Mesopotamia (spearheads) and even from Ur III (shaft-hole axe) can be traced to northern Anatolia (see footnote 36). Was this the result of long- distance trade? Until more archaeological evidence is made available one cannot rule out the possibility that similarities in the metallurgy of these distant regions were also due to the ethno-cultural factor. Ahlathlbel: This settlement which was obviously the seat of a local prince produced a culture material, including rich metal artifacts, which should be dated to the EB III period. The settlement may have been founded at the closing stages of the EB II and I doubt very much if the bulk of the pottery and metal finds can be dated entirely to the EB II. The analyses of some 22 copper-based metals suggest that high tin-bronzes and low to medium grade arsenical coppers were equally</page><page sequence="10">34 ANATOLIAN STUDIES popular at this site. Unalloyed copper, on the other hand was mainly used for the production of jewellery and maybe some tools (Esin 1969:121; de Jesus 1980:125). The fact that, as in Alaca and Alishar, here too no ternary alloys of copper-arsenic- tin were used has been interpreted as the co-existence of two distinct metallurgies (de Jesus 1980:125). This may be so, but in the light of the published metal objects (Bittel 1936:38-47; Esin 1969:76; Stronach 1956) it is difficult either on typological grounds or chemical analyses to suggest that an important metal-working industry existed at Ahlatlibel. The copper ore groups of some of the objects (5 groups) may indicate more than one provenance (Esin 1969:76). This is further confirmed by some of the metal types present here; a sword (Stronach 1957:94), a shaft-hole axe hammer and a macehead (de Jesus 1980:125) which are among the repertory of the regional schools of metalwork in the Pontus. The double-spiral and the hammer- headed pins are further indications that the site of Ahlatlibel derived its metallurgy from north-central Anatolia. If it possessed a local metal industry of its own, then its supplies of copper-based metals would have been imported from the Corum or Tokat provinces (de Jesus 1980:125) Alishar 6-7 M, 12 T: The metalwork of this period is not as impressive as that of north-central Anatolia. The EB II traditions in alloying continued almost unchanged. Unfortunately the small number of analyses (4) do not provide for a clear picture. But, it seems that unalloyed copper objects are in the majority (Esin 1969). Despite the increased contacts with the cultures to the north, west and Syria- Cilicia, the local school of metalwork at Alishar remained rather provincial. It is also possible that imports from Cilician workshops provided for some of the local demand for tools and weapons. Kiiltepe Level 13-11 (EB IlIa-b-c): Probably the seat of a local dynasty this site promises to reveal a good deal more about the Cappadocian EBA; the socio- political development and cultural evolution as a result of expanding trade with Mesopotamian/Syrian kingdoms (e.g. Ebla, Akkad). A tomb in level c (13) contained some gold jewellery utterly foreign to central Anatolia (Ozgi9? 1964:18- 21). The basket-shaped earring and a gold disc with elaborate decoration (Ozgilu 1964:Pl. VII, 1-2) have their counterparts in the finds from Tell Brak and the royal tombs of Ur. These finds in fact confirm the evidence for occasional exchanges of finished metal goods between Anatolia and Mesopotamia as suggested by the similarities between the daggers from Alaca and Ur (Bittel 1945:28). C. CILICIA The eastward expansion of the west Anatolian EB III culture in its early stages to Cilicia brought in its wake fundamental changes in the local architecture and pottery repertory of the settlements. The stratigraphy of Mersin is still confusing regarding this period, therefore the metalwork is derived from Tarsus and the Soli hoard. Tarsus EB III: The adoption of the western architectural and pottery forms is a clear indication that this important city submitted to the western immigrants. After the initial impact and the gradual fusion of the southwestern and Cilician cultures, a process which may have lasted a generation or more, Tarsus regained its traditional place in the maritime and overland trade in eastern Mediterranean. It dominated one of the most important trade routes between north Syria and central Anatolia and via the G6ksu valley maintained overland trade with southwestern Anatolia. Thus it was in a position to benefit not only from international trade, but also from the transfer of metal technologies and the diffusion of new forms via Cilicia.</page><page sequence="11">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 35 The metalwork from Tarsus and the Soli treasure (Bittel 1940) include forms which were new to Cilicia. These are the bent-tanged spearhead with slotted blade, daggers and swords (Soli) (Stronach 1957); de Jesus 1980:134). Even if these new forms were produced by the regional schools in Cilicia, the central Anatolian influence is very obvious. Despite changes in the material culture in the field of metallurgy, it is possible to observe the preservation of the EB II traditions especially in the alloying techniques. Of the 29 analyses from Tarsus EB III, close to 66% of the artifacts are unalloyed copper and the remaining are divided between copper-arsenic and ternary alloys (de Jesus 1980:134; Esin 1969). No pure tin- bronzes are known. This is very strange because in northwest, north-central and central Anatolia tin-bronzes became very abundant in this period, and in the Amuq they constituted an important percentage of the copper-based metal. It seems the problem was not really related to supplies of tin. If Tarsus (EB III settlement) was founded by immigrant groups from the northwest after the destruction of Troy IIg, as is still maintained by de Jesus (1980:357), then there must be an explanation as to why the very advanced metal industries of the Troad left no traces (e.g. in jewellery, weapons and household objects) in this settlement37 unless the migratory move- ments from the west, and particularly from the southwest, took place earlier during the period of Troy IIc (Yakar 1979). D. AMUQ In phase J the Transcaucasian affiliated elements either left the Amuq or were completely integrated into the north Syrian oriented socio-economic and cultural environment. There is very little change in the local repertory of metalwork from the previous phase I. Reamers are no longer present and the 10 metal artifacts discovered include a shaft-hole axe and a dagger. There is no change in the alloying techniques; tin-bronze accounts for half the objects analysed (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960:453-5; Buchholz 1967: Tabelle 11). The other half is composed of copper-arsenic alloys. Unalloyed copper which was the main metal used in Tarsus was apparently not appreciated by the smiths in the Amuq. CONCLUSION The Anatolian EB III metallurgy may be described as one of unprecedented technologies, abundance of metalwork and the emergence of at least two regional schools specializing in the production of household items, jewellery and weapons. The workshops in the Pontus must have been reputed for their quality weapons, which included long swords, and luxury objects made of precious metals. As for Troy II(c-g), its "palatial" workshops manufactured fine jewellery, in addition to a wide range of tools, weapons and vessels which they also exported to the eastern Aegean islands, central Anatolia and maybe even to Cilicia. The highly developed metallurgy of the Pontus region could not be attributed to the local industries in the Halys basin. The technological skills and artistic imagination of the former suggest no affiliations with the latter. The ikiztepe burials now confirm what was suspected since the discovery of the Alacahoyiik Royal Tombs; that new ethnic groups had invaded Anatolia in the 37The EB III metalwork from Tarsus consists of a gold nail-headed pin and four earrings (Goldman 1958:300, fig. 434:1, 3-6). The workmanship of the latter shows a certain expertise in gold casting and hammering techniques, but as no jewellery moulds were found at Tarsus one may infer that this jewellery was imported either from the northwest or north-central Anatolia (de Jesus 1980:89). Despite the close proximity of the silver-rich deposits in Akdag and Bulgar madeni (Yakar 1976:121; de Jesus 1980: Map 16) no silver objects were recovered from Tarsus.</page><page sequence="12">36 ANATOLIAN STUDIES second half of the third millennium B.c. The distribution of certain types of weapons and cult objects in the cemeteries of north-central Anatolia indicate that these new population groups, probably Indo-European or affiliated tribes, were concentrated in the Samsun (Bafra) Amasya, Corum, Tokat and Kastamonu provinces. They were skilled metallurgists with a taste for precious metals including a preference for high tin-bronzes. Their art, "animal style", betrays their nomadic past and some of their technologies indicate an awareness of advanced techniques practised already in the Syro-Mesopotamian world. They exploited the copper, silver and arsenic-rich deposits in the Pontus, but had to import gold, probably from the west. Contacts with the west brought them closer to the urban civiliza- tions providing them with new markets for their finished products, and maybe a new life style for some of their skilled workers and warriors. The preference for high tin-bronzes is not restricted to the Pontus region only. In the Troad, and at Troy II this alloy was the main base metal in the second half of the third millennium. However, one has to observe that the Trojan examples are not earlier than those from the Alaca graves, and that the regular use of this metal in Anatolia coincides with the arrival of the Indo-European pastoralists from the east. The supplies of this metal, from still hypothetical sources, did not require a maritime route in the Aegean or in the eastern Mediterranean in this period. Otherwise tin-bronzes would have appeared in significant quantities in eastern Mediterranean and in the Aegean basin in the EB II period. Maritime trade may account for some of the metal supplies reaching the Aegean islands from Anatolia or even Cyprus. But it would be highly misleading to suggest that "the material from western Anatolia has nothing to do with any Anatolian source of copper" (Muhly 1973:202). West Anatolian copper deposits could have more than met the local demands. In Anatolia copper was used since Neolithic times. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that the copper deposits in the west went unnoticed by metal prospectors long familiar with the properties of the ore. But, since recent mining activities usually destroy any traces of old workings in most cases it is hard to substantiate or date the early exploitations. The appearance of certain types of weapons such as the slotted spearhead, wide-flanged dagger, swords and shaft-hole axes in the Balikesir-Afyon region and in the Troad and a preference for high tin-bronzes lead one to believe that the influence of the Pontic metallurgy on the west was considerable. Troy II and other coastal settlements were responsible to some degree for the transfer of certain metal forms and technologies to the Aegean world, including the Cyclades, but not to Greece or Crete. According to de Jesus (1980:155), the metallurgical innovations from north- central Anatolia reached Troy II only after the destruction of Alacahoyiik 5, at which time central Anatolia and the Pontic industries possibly looked westward to an expanding market. This conclusion in my view is not based on solid chronologi- cal grounds. The early tombs of Alaca and Troy II were more or less contemporary (Yakar 1979:57). After the destruction of Alaca 5 by the bearers of the Alishar III pottery (c. 2100 B.c.), the Pontic workshops continued to thrive (e.g. Horoztepe), whereas in the Troad (after Troy II) there is an obvious decline in the quality of the metalwork and changes in the alloying traditions. I think it is a mistake to refer to the Dorak finds in order to construe a "Dorak-type kingdom" (de Jesus 1980:155). The attempt by de Jesus to reconstruct the early history of northwest Anatolia without the necessary archaeological data or historical documentation in order to prove that metallurgical supremacy of the Troad continued even after the destruction of Troy IIg, cannot be seriously considered.</page><page sequence="13">METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA 37 The hoard of jewellery from Eskiyapar (Mellink 1970:161) and the finds from the circular tombs of Kiiltepe clearly demonstrate that Mesopotamian influence in central Anatolian metalwork is more evident in luxurious items than in other types of metal artifacts. Regarding the Mesopotamian influence on Anatolian metallurgy which is sometimes seen as the direct consequence of Akkadian expansion into north Syria and probably Cilicia (Muhly 1973:322-3), objects such as slotted spearheads, daggers and crescentic axes found in various EB III contexts as far as Horoztepe have been described as foreign to Anatolia, having a Mesopotamian ancestry going back into the ED period (Ozgiiu 1958). Such views concerning the impact of Sumero-Akkadian culture on areas well outside Mesopotamia ought to be reconsidered in the light of new discoveries and studies on ancient metallurgy in the Near East. Archaeological evidence from ED sites in Mesopotamia indicates that unalloyed copper, arsenical copper or tin-bronzes were in rather restricted supply until at least the Akkadian period (Moorey 1982:32). Moorey even questions the view that there was a major tin-bronze industry in Sumer before the Ur III period. As far as typologies are concerned, Moorey is right in pointing out that there is no clear evidence of a regular trade in finished base-metal objects outside the immediate area of Sumer (1982:36). In fact considering that metals travelled into Mesopotamia from areas where basic techniques smelting, alloying and casting were already developed by local smiths, it is difficult to see how the Sumerian workshops could have influenced the Syrian and Anatolian production centres, except for certain techniques and forms of jewellery and sheet-metal technology for larger artifacts. Regarding specific forms of weapons thought to be of Mesopotamian invention, such as the crescentic axeheads found also in Anatolia, Syria and Israel, it has been recently suggested that a redating of the anchor axe from Ur to the middle-late Akkad period, makes this form contempor- ary with the socketed fenestrated axes from Syro-Palestine.38 Commenting on the likely Syrian origin of the anchor axe Tubb argues that "considering the very close conceptual and visual similarity between the anchor axe and the Syro-Palestinian fenestrated "eye" and "duckbill" axes, it seems improbable that it was developed outside that area (see footnote 38). In a region where trade was quite extensive and organized by city-states, it is only logical to assume that new types of weapons and other artifacts often exchanged hands and served as models for the creation of roughly similar objects produced according to local needs and taste. In fact, the so- called Mesopotamian type crescentic axeheads from Horoztepe, Soli or even Polath could have developed from a simpler single riveted axe form known in western Anatolia.39 Regarding the diffusion of metal artifacts, in particular weapons and jewellery, one should also mention the semi-legendary military campaigns of Sargon and Naram-Sin to northwest Syria and Cilicia. In one of the "victory" stelae of Naram-Sin of Akkad found in the Hai district of southern Iraq, enemy soldiers are depicted stripped of all their clothes and weapons.40 According to Mellink these captured enemy soldiers have hair styles and facial details which indicate that they are from regions in Syria and Anatolia. Most important, 38For a thorough examination of the crescentic axeheads from the Near East see J. N. Tubb in Iraq XLIV, 1982, 1-12. 39Therefore the elegant, narrow flanged-back crescentic axe from Ur could well be an "import" from Anatolia or, more likely, Syria, or at least produced from a non- Mesopotamian type in local assemblage. See Tubb 1982. 40Two fragments of this alabaster stela were the subject of an interesting article by M. Mellink: "An Akkadian Illustration of a Campaign in Cilicia", Anatolia VII, 1963, 101-15.</page><page sequence="14">38 ANATOLIAN STUDIES however, is a dagger type and pottery vessels carried away by Akkadian soldiers. Mellink identified the dagger form as being of Anatolian or Syrian origin. As for the two-handled goblets and cup she remarks their close similarity to forms known in Cilician EB III pottery assemblage of west Anatolian origin (see footnote 40). This Akkadian illustration of a military venture outside Mesopotamia could help us further in understanding the different ways in which metal forms and technolo- gies were transferred from one region to another. Generally speaking, the EB III metallurgy of Anatolia cannot be described as being homogeneous. It was rather a series of regional developments where the fusion of different traditions combining with changing socio-economic factors resulted in the emergence of semi-independent metal industries. In western Anatolia and in the Aegean islands there is a certain standardiza- tion in the forms of tools and weapons. This is explained as the result of competition among the production centres (e.g. Troy and Poliochni) to capture new markets for the same type of products. The industries in Cappadocia and Cilicia continued to function along the traditional lines. Their products were mainly for the local markets. Strangely enough they lacked the sophistication of the Mesopotamian, Pontic or west Anatolian products despite the fact they were exposed to their influences, as demonstrated by the Soli hoard. Their metalwork was of functional character. As for eastern Anatolia, the metallurgy of the proto- urban period did not develop into an impressive regional industry in the EB III. The rescue excavations in southeastern Anatolia may soon provide us with more material relevant to the question of metallurgy. The multiple moulds from Arslantepe in Malatya do suggest that at least local industries existed in this region. Whether these local workshops could have produced sophisticated artifacts such as those found in north Syrian sites like Til Barsip, Karahasan or Tilmen remains a question worthy of further investigation.</page></plain_text>
