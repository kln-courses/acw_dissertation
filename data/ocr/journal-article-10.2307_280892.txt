<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MULTIVARIATE STUDY OF ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS AT WRITING-ON-STONE, SOUTHERN ALBERTA Martin P. R. Magne and Michael A. Klassen The rock art of Writing-On-Stone has been the focus of detailed interpretation relying on concepts of group migration. Indeed, results of previous research at Writing-On-Stone have been pivotal in reconstructions of northwestern Plains group distributions. It is apparent that many anthropomorphic petroglyphs and pictographs contain elements and co-associations that allow chronological orderingfrom prehistoric through protohistoric and historic times. Cluster analyses described in this paper offer a more objective means of assessing changes in anthropomorph depictions through time, leading to a critical evaluation of prior concepts concerning stylistic changes and Native group distributions. In particular, the analyses demonstrate that rock-art anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone are more strongly interrelated than previously thought. We believe there is no need to invoke a Shoshonean presence in this area to account for differences in late prehistoric and historical-period rock-art anthropomorph styles. El arte rupestre de Writing-On-Stone ha sido el centro de una detallada interpretaci6n basada en conceptos de migraci6n de grupos. Sin duda, los resultados de anteriores investigaciones en Writing-On-Stone han sido fundamentales para las reconstrucciones de las distribuciones de grupos en los llanos del noroeste de Norteamerica. Es evidente que muchos petroglifos y pictografias antropomorfos poseen elementos y asociaciones comunes que permiten un ordenamiento cronol6gico que va desde los tiempos prehist6ricos a los hist6ricos, pasando por los protohist6ricos. Los andlisis de agrupamiento que se describen en elpresente articulo ofrecen un medio mds objetivo para evaluar los cambios de las representaciones antropomorfas a traves del tiempo, lo que conduce a una reconsideracion critica de conceptos previos relacionados con los cambios estilisticos y las distribuciones de grupos aborigenes. En especial, los andlisis demuestran que lasfiguras antropomorfas del arte rupestre de Writing-On- Stone estdn mds intimamente relacionadas entre si de los que se habia pensado. Creemos que no es necesario invocar la presencia de los indios Shosone en esta regi6n para dar cuenta de las diferencias de los estilos antro- pomorfos del arte rupestre prehist6rico. Most rock-art research, apart from conservation studies, has taken the form of subjective analysis of styles, motifs, and their distributions. Even though rock art offers insight into the less concrete and material aspects of prehistoric cultures, our appreciation of its meaning stands to benefit from a more objective and systematic approach. An ideal testing ground for new analytic methods is the rock art of Writing-On-Stone, since it is abundant, spatially restricted, and has been subject to previous analysis. The rock art is found on approximately 10 km of sandstone cliffs along the Milk River and several major t and several or tributary coulees in and around Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park (Figure 1). Over 60 separate sites are known from this area, including one, DgOv-2, with 26 panels. The rock art of this area of southern Alberta, both in content and extent, is one of the most important archaeological records on Plains. Petroglyphs and pictographs along these cliffs record the prehistoric/historical-period cultural transition of southern Alberta and provide an ex- cellent source for Plains Native Indian cultural reconstruction. The rock-art figures found at Writing- On-Stone include anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, and material object motifs, as well as abstract and geometric designs. By examining patterns of association among depictions of anthropomorphs, historical objects, and horses at Writing-On-Stone relative chronologies of some of the motifs have been established (Dempsey 1973; Dewdney 1964; Habgood 1967; Keyser 1977a).

Copyright ? 1991 by the Society for American Archaeology 389</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Of particular interest are the anthropomorphs, being the most common motif depicted at Writing- On-Stone (Keyser 1977a). A number of anthropomorph categories have been identified previously and their possible stylistic and historical associations, including identification with specific Plains Native Indian groups, have been discussed (Dempsey 1973; Habgood 1967; Keyser 1977a). Ac- cording to the prevalent view, displacement of cultural groups introduced new anthropomorph categories at Writing-On-Stone. Classic examples of most categories are distinguishable readily, yet examination of all anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone reveals a great deal of variation. A dem- onstration of overlapping variation between categories would suggest an evolution of anthropomorph depictions within a single cultural tradition, without need to invoke displacement of one group by another. Confirming Native group distributions on the northwestern Plains during the late prehistoric and protohistoric is still a major challenge for archaeology, and rock-art research is a valuable tool with which to address this challenge. We describe here an objective analysis of anthropomorphs performed by assigning a presence or absence value to the attributes of each, then using cluster analyses to test how anthropomorphs group according to the attributes, evaluating at the same time the validity of categories defined previously. The results of this analysis will be useful for comparisons of rock-art motifs and rela- tionships at Writing-On-Stone and other sites throughout the northwestern Plains. ANTHROPOMORPH CATEGORIES, AGES, AND FUNCTION At least 46 of the 60 Writing-On-Stone area sites have anthropomorphs depicted, often with several categories occurring on the same panel. Most anthropomorphs at Writing-on-Stone are not executed randomly, but are composed of highly conventionalized design elements. The presence of these elements has allowed some insightful inferences to be made concerning their origins and interrelations. In the most comprehensive study of Writing-On-Stone to date, Keyser (1977a, 1977b) described seven anthropomorph categories (see Figure 2): (1) shield-bearing (or warriors), (2) "clas- sic" V-neck (or pointed shoulder, V-shoulder), (3) "other" V-necks, (4) rectangular (or square shoulder), (5) hourglass (or X-shaped), (6) stick, and (7) "unique" representations. This classification scheme is based partially on earlier work at Writing-On-Stone (Dempsey 1973; Dewdney 1964; Habgood 1967) and classifications used at other sites throughout western North America. The last two categories rarely are depicted and are not considered further in this paper. Shield-bearing, V-neck, rectangular, and hourglass anthropomorphs generally are easy to distin- guish, but all the motifs share certain characteristics. Most are petroglyphs and are executed as outlines via incisions or "scratches" in the sandstone. Occasionally further detail has been added to the shields with designs and to the torsos by way of "heartlines" or "lifelines" (Habgood 1967; Keyser 1977a), genitals, or other decorations. A few pictograph examples have the shields or torsos partially or entirely filled in with paint. Shield-bearing anthropomorphs (holding large body shields, as opposed to smaller equestrian shields) are known to occur at several other Alberta sites (Habgood 1967; Leechman et al. 1955:40; Wormington and Forbis 1965:133) and throughout the northwestern Plains (Conner and Conner 1971; Gebhard 1966; Keyser 1975, 1977a, 1984; Keyser and Knight 1976; Schuster 1987; Sundstrom 1984; Wedel 1969; Wellman 1979) and the Great Basin (Castleton 1978; Gebhard 1966; Keyser 1975; Schaafsma 1971; Schuster 1987). V-neck anthropomorphs also have been found throughout the northwestern Plains (Conner 1980; Conner and Conner 1971; Keyser 1977a, 1984; Over 1941; Schuster 1987; Sundstrom 1984), including several other Alberta sites (Habgood 1967; Leechman et al. 1955:40; Wormington and Forbis 1965:133). The distributions of rectangular and hourglass anthropomorphs are not as well documented. Keyser (1977a) states that rectangulars are found throughout North America, but simple outline figures similar to those at Writing-On-Stone do not appear to be common. In addition to Writing- On-Stone, some rectangular examples are known from Wyoming (Schuster 1987), Montana (Conner and Conner 1971), Saskatchewan (Jones and Jones 1982), South Dakota (Keyser 1984; Sundstrom 1984), and the Canadian Shield (Habgood 1967). Hourglass figures are common in Canadian Shield rock art (Dewdney 1964) and rare overall on the northwestern Plains, occurring at Writing-On- Stone, at a few sites in South Dakota (Over 1941:56; Sundstrom 1984:71, 114), Montana (Conner 390 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="3">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA * 81 Rock art site and number \ Park road -- Edge of sandstone cliff --- Park boundary (1988) Edmonton 0 .5 1 KM \Calgary STUDY AREA Figure 1.

Rectangular and hourglass anthropomorphs also appear as designs on cultural artifacts associated with the Blackfoot Nation (Conner and Conner 1971:41; Dempsey 1973). A relative chronology has been proposed for the various anthropomorph categories at Writing- On-Stone. Most researchers consider shield-bearing anthropomorphs to be the oldest, followed roughly by V-necks, then rectangulars, and finally hourglass anthropomorphs (Dempsey 1973; Dewdney 1964; Habgood 1967; Keyser 1977a). Several of the different categories at Writing-On- Stone also have been used to infer cultural affiliations. Keyser (1975, 1977a) has identified shield bearers as late prehistoric in age, citing as evidence their general lack of historical associations (i.e., guns and horses). Keyser (1977a:55) also has concluded that the shield-bearer motif is Shoshonean in origin, based "on the almost exact coincidence of its distribution with the known range of the Plains Shoshone during the late prehistoric period and early historic period." Other evidence cited is the presence of Intermontane pottery at three shield-bearing anthropomorph sites in Montana (Homed Owl Cave, Pictograph Cave, Empty Gulch [Keyser 1975:210-211]) and the apparent depiction of Shoshonean horse armor on a panel at Writing-On-Stone (Keyser 1977a:43-44).

Furthermore, a number of shield-bearing anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone and elsewhere also have V-neck bodies (Keyser 1977a). 392 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="5">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA Keyser (1977a:26) considers it unlikely that "other" V-neck anthropomorphs "are derived from the 'classic' V-neck anthropomorphs, since the only attribute they share in common is the V-neck." According to Keyser (1977a), most "other" V-neck anthropomorphs are found in association with historical indicators and thus they are historic in age. Other writers discussing Writing-On-Stone have not made such clear distinctions between groups of V-necks, but acknowledge that these figures seem to span from late prehistoric to historic periods (Dempsey 1973; Dewdney 1964; Habgood 1967). Rectangular anthropomorphs, which seem to appear in both late prehistoric and historic contexts, are not clearly identified with a specific age or cultural group by Keyser (1977a) or Habgood (1967). On the other hand, Keyser (1977a) dates all hourglass anthropomorphs to the historic period. Keyser (1977a:56) believes much of the historic rock art at Writing-On-Stone "is probably the work of Blackfoot, Cree, Gros Ventre and Assiniboine artists," as suggested by Native group distribution during the historic period. In addition to these categories, rock art at Writing-On-Stone has been classified into two functional categories: ceremonial art and biographic art (Keyser 1977a). The characteristic motifs of ceremonial art are considered to be mainly shield-bearing anthropomorphs, "classic" V-necks, naturalistic and "boat-form" zoomorphs, as well as large rectangular anthropomorphs, abstracts, rakes, and bow spears (Keyser 1977a). Apparently, these motifs rarely are depicted with historical associations, suggesting they are for the most part prehistoric. Keyser (1977a) believes ceremonial art was personal in nature, representing spiritual events such as vision quests. Biographic art consists of small rect- angular and hourglass anthropomorphs, "mature-style" horses, guns, and tipis. Less frequently, "simple" V-necks, riders, decorated halters, spears, bows, and travois are found. The large number of guns, horses, and other historical associations indicate this art was created in historic times. The realistic action scenes of biographic art, with "stylistic conventions" to represent various actions, has been likened to a crude form of picture writing with defined story lines depicting actual events in a biographical manner (Keyser 1987). Indeed, the relations between ledger art, hide painting, and rock art in this part of the Plains could use more attention of the sort given to Kiowa art by Young (1986). Although Keyser believes they coexisted for some time in the early historic period, he maintains that biographic art did not evolve from ceremonial art, as evidenced by "morpho- logical" and stylistic differences between the two forms (Keyser 1977a:54). However, the two terms cannot be considered mutually exclusive, since certain "ceremonial" panels depict scenes such as battles between two individual shield bearers, which must be "biographic" in the common sense. This is clearly another issue in need of further thought. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES Anthropomorph Categories and Variables "Classic" V-necks, "other" V-necks, and rectangular anthropomorphs from Writing-On-Stone, as defined by Keyser (1977a), have been selected for detailed analysis. These were chosen because they closely resemble one another morphologically and may help reveal chronological and stylistic trends. All three categories are simple in design and occur as incised or painted, outlined parallel- sided torsos. The torsos extend into straight legs, and thin lines represent arms, necks, and other elaborations. In all three types, dots or circles represent heads. In examining the attributes used by Keyser (1977a) to classify the three types (Table 1), it is apparent that distinctions between each category are ambiguous-there are no attributes or combinations of attributes that clearly define and distinguish "classic" V-necks, "other" V-necks, and rectangulars, and no specific rules exist for classifying them. Instead, most differences between categories have been defined on the basis of somewhat vague qualitative judgements of attribute frequencies (see Keyser 1977a:25-27). All anthropomorph cases that Keyser (1977a) specifically identified as belonging to a certain category were located on copies of the original tracings he prepared in 1976. Fortunately, the single attributes used to distinguish V-neck anthropomorphs (i.e., V-shaped shoulders) from rectangular ones (i.e., straight shoulders) were identifiable easily in most cases. However, distinguishing "clas- sics" from "other" V-necks was not straightforward, and when the type of shoulder was indeterminate it was difficult to classify many figures. In the end, only panels identified by Keyser (1977a:24-25) 393 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Table 1. Attributes Employed by Keyser (1977b) to Distinguish Classic V-Neck, Other V-Neck, and Rectangular Anthropomorphs.

In other words, whenever Keyser (1977a) indicated that both types of V-neck anthropomorphs occurred on a single panel, all V-necks on that panel were excluded from the testing. In this way, the V-necks were not placed in the wrong groups for testing the validity of their grouping. A further difficulty arose when it was noted that Keyser (1977a:26) classified "other" V-necks into two subcategories in his description (i.e., "sophisticated" and "crude"), with important descriptive and cultural distinctions between the two. However, Keyser (1977a:24) only listed one category (i.e., "other") in his panel-by-panel table. For the purposes of this study, both subcategories were assumed to be listed under the single heading in the table, and were treated as one group. Rectangular anthropomorphs were relatively easy to identify in all the tracings, but all questionable figures also were omitted. Despite these precautions, it was at times difficult to find the same number of anthropomorphs on panels as Keyser (1977a) indicated to be present. In some cases, fewer anthro- pomorphs of certain types were found, while in other cases more were located. When too many were found, those that most poorly fit Keyser's (1977a) description were eliminated until the correct number was reached. When it was clear that no other figures could have been the ones to which Keyser (1977a) was referring, these cases were included. For all three categories, whenever classi- fications were in doubt, they were excluded. In total 28 "classic" V-necks, 56 "other" V-necks, and 101 rectangular body anthropomorphs were identified and located on the rock-art panel tracings of Writing-On-Stone. Forty-three of the rectangular anthropomorphs are found on a single integrated panel at DgOv-81, the Battle-Scene panel in Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park. Since all of the figures within this panel probably were created at the same time, they are especially useful in assessing variability within the rectangular body group. Note that in this initial study the hourglass figures at DgOv-81 and elsewhere were not analyzed. However, future studies are planned to include these, shield-bearing anthropomorphs, and a greater range of variation in general. The 84 V-necks and 101 rectangular anthropomorphs derived by the above criteria represent approximately 39 and 75 percent respectively, of all those within these types that were found at Writing-On-Stone by Keyser (1977a). Combining these groups, 185 anthropomorph cases were available for analysis. All cases were then cataloged and coded for the presence or absence of 19 attributes, hereafter called variables. Table 2 lists these as well as short descriptions of how they were identified. The variables were based for the most part on the original description of the categories (Keyser 1977a) except for those described below. For the sake of consistency previous terminology is retained even if this terminology may be inaccurate or imprecise. Most of the individual variables are executed with remarkable consistency among all three types of anthropomorphs and thus their presence or 394 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="7">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA Table 2.

There were cases, however, where it was difficult to assess the presence of a variable. In these instances, a decision was made to consider that variable absent for that case, rather than treating it as a missing value which would result in that case becoming ineligible for analysis. The option of creating "indeterminate" categories for "possible" variables was rejected since cluster analysis using these categories would only result in cases with indeterminate variables grouping with other cases with the same indeterminate variables, rather than with cases with positive variables. Several variables also were created that were not identified specifically by Keyser (1977a) and that did not fit into his own categories, but seemed to be of relevance (compare Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, method of creation (i.e., "petroglyph" or "pictograph") was not used as a variable since we did not test the differences between media. In any case, there are a number of examples of combination petroglyph and pictograph figures, indicating that these were not exclusive tech- niques. Keyser (1977a:26-27, 50-52) did place some importance on the distinction between scratched and incised petroglyphs, but erosion rates, application tools, and the abilities of various artists are highly variable, casting doubt on the validity of this distinction. Historical associations were assumed to be present only when the anthropomorph was in direct contact with a historical object, such as holding a gun or riding a horse, or when the association was unambiguous, such as involvement in a historical-period battle scene. The presence of an anthropomorph on the same panel as historical objects was not considered to necessarily indicate a historical association, as it is possible that rock art of various ages can be found together. Finally, only a single "legs" category was used, as we could determine no satisfactory method for defining several. Generally, legs are simply extensions of the torso, but in cases where waist lines or feet are not represented it was not possible to determine if the torso did in fact extend into legs. The coding yielded a data matrix of 18 5 cases by 19 variables for cluster analysis. For the remainder of this paper, the abbreviations found in Table 2 will be used to signify each of the variables. A summary of the frequencies of each of the 19 variables and the corresponding percentage of oc- currence for all three types of anthropomorphs as classified by Keyser (1977a) can be found in Table 3.

Cluster Analyses Cluster analysis is a method of numerical classification which aims "to discover the pattern of groupings in a set of data, with as few assumptions as possible about the nature of the groupings" (Shennan 1988:194). It is based on the premise that the members of each group or cluster "should be more similar to one another than they are to non-members [and that] with-in group similarity should be in some sense greater than between-group similarity" (Shennan 1988:193). It should be obvious that cluster analysis alone cannot be used to classify anthropomorphs. The reduction of rock art into binary numbers involves an inherent loss of stylistic and creative nuances, and cannot be expected to account for all variation. Rather, cluster analysis is used here as a tool to assist in validating and refining qualitative classification. Cluster analysis can be used with continuous, interval, or binary data. Binary data, used in this analysis, simply codes the presence/absence dichotomy of variables with mutually exclusive integers, such as 0 and 1. Cluster analysis then compares each case with all other cases and records the number of matches for each comparison as a coefficient of similarity in a distance matrix. This matrix is then used to determine the placement of the cases in a hierarchical dendrogram. Jaccard's coefficient, which ignores all negative matches when matching cases, was used in this analysis since it is the best method if large numbers of variables occur rarely (Shennan 1988:203). A number of algorithms are available for grouping cases into clusters based on their coefficients of similarity, and it is important that the algorithm used is one which most closely reflects the actual distance matrix (Shennan 1988:212-232). The degree of accuracy of the clustering pattern created by different algorithms can be tested with the cophenetic correlation coefficient (Shennan 1988:230). Using the clustering program available from MIDAS (Fox and Guire 1976), the cophenetic correlation showed that the average linkage algorithm produced the best results for analyzing the anthropomorph data. Cluster Analysis #1: All Variables. Cluster analysis of all 185 cases, using all 19 variables, resulted in a complex dendrogram of small clusters that generally were related poorly to one another (Figure 3). This weak grouping is likely a result of the large number of absent variables and the high degree 396 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="9">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA .92 _ I- ' A_ ' ' I - I I ' 7_ L.50 _ -! _ - - 1 CLUSTER 1 CLUSTER 2 CLUSTER 3 4I5 IIII I of variation possible between cases.

Clusters 2a and 2c contain V-neck cases, ranging from quite detailed to very simple, which correspond to historical versions of Keyser's (1977a) "other" V-necks. Cluster 2b is composed of mostly historical, active rectangular anthropomorphs, many of them from the Battle-Scene panel at DgOv-81. The distribution of battle-scene figures is a most interesting result. When a number of anthro- pomorphs occur on a single integrated panel, it stands to reason that these figures are closely related and should group together if cluster analysis reflects actual similarities. This assumption is validated by 29 figures from the Battle-Scene panel (Figure 5) which grouped together in Cluster 2 and the remaining which grouped together in Cluster 3 (Table 4). Anthropomorphs from several smaller integrated battle scenes also grouped together. Six out of 12 battle participants at DgOv-57 (Figure 6) grouped side-by-side in Cluster 2a, while the other 6 grouped in the rest of Cluster 2. Two combatants (one V-neck, one rectangular) from DgOv-60 grouped side-by-side in Cluster 2a (Figure 7). Four out of five of those joined together with a line at DgOv-60 also grouped together in Cluster 1 c. The major patterns observed in this analysis are as follows: Cluster la-mainly nonhistorical, inactive detailed V-necks; Clusters lb and lc-nonhistorical, inactive simple V-necks; Cluster 2a- historical, active V-necks; Cluster 2b-historical, active rectangular anthropomorphs; Cluster 3a- nonhistorical, inactive rectangular anthropomorphs; Cluster 3b-historical, inactive rectangular anthropomorphs; Cluster 4-nonhistorical, inactive, extremely simple X-necks; and Cluster 5- nonhistorical, inactive, extremely simple V-necks. Major divisions between anthropomorphs were based on only a few variables with VNCK, HNCK, ACTN, and HIST responsible for most of this grouping. This could be interpreted in several ways: either all the anthropomorphs are very similar to one another in all other respects, except for these four variables; or these four variables are masking more-subtle distinctions between V-necks and rectangular anthropomorphs, and between historical and nonhistorical anthropomorphs, which is suggested by traditional classification. Tra- ditional grouping however, would suggest that even with the removal of these variables from the clustering, V-necks and rectangulars would still group separately, as would historical and nonhis- torical cases. To test how much similarity or dissimilarity is being masked by VNCK, HNCK, ACTN, and HIST, it is necessary to test the cases without using these variables. Two additional cluster analyses were therefore performed on the 185 cases to substantiate the results of the first cluster analysis. The first of these additional analyses did not use the VNCK, XNCK, and HNCK shoulder variables, while the second did not use the ACTN and HIST variables. It seems valid to remove both ACTN and HIST in the same test mainly because Keyser (1977a) 398 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="11">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA It K!

Indeed, there is a high degree of correlation between the ACTN and HIST attributes: of 80 cases with HIST, and 71 with ACTN, 63 cases had both. Cluster Analysis #2: No Shoulder Variables. Exclusion of the variables VNCK, XNCK, and HNCK (the cases with these variables remained in the analysis) did not produce a simpler cluster pattern, but it did cause some significant changes in how the cases grouped together (Table 5). Figure 8 illustrates the distribution of cases with VNCK, XNCK, HNCK, ACTN, HIST as well as Battle- Scene (DgOv-81) cases within the derived clusters. With the exclusion of the variables VNCK, XNCK, and HNCK, clustering divided most of the cases into two large and significant groups: those without ACTN and HIST into Cluster 1, and those with ACTN and HIST into Cluster 2. V-necks and rectangulars are no longer distinguished strongly. Within the divisions marked by ACTN and HIST, the cases sorted mainly on the basis of their levels of detail. Of particular interest is that most V-neck and rectangular cases, no longer discriminated by the VNCK and HNCK variables, alternated throughout the dendrogram. This indicates that the VNCK and HNCK variables are not closely associated with a complex of variables that also distinguish Table 4.

In an interesting exception to this observation a core group of "classic" V-necks, very similar to Cluster 1 a in the all-variables analysis, remained together in this test. Furthermore, most of the battle-scene cases stayed together in two groups as well, which would be expected as these were almost certainly all created at the same time by the same artist. Thus, the ACTN and HIST variables were as important here as VNCK and HNCK were in producing the patterns observed in the all-variables analysis. The result of excluding VNCK and HNCK seems to indicate that V-necks and rectangulars are often quite similar. Cluster Analysis #3: No Historical Associations. Using all the variables except ACTN and HIST, the cases divided into two large clusters and several smaller ones (Figure 9). Two major clusters were formed based mainly on the type of shoulder variable present: mostly V-necks into Cluster 1 and mostly rectangulars into Cluster 2. While nearly 84 percent of Cluster 1 cases had VNCK, all cases of Cluster 2 had HNCK. On the other hand, historically associated cases were distributed throughout all of the clusters (Table 6). Within clusters, the cases also sorted themselves according Table 5. Major Variables Frequency, No Shoulder Variables Analysis.

This produced the following general groups: Cluster la-detailed anthro- pomorphs, nonhistorical "classic" V-necks; Cluster lb, Ic, Id-fairly detailed anthropomorphs (mostly XNCK, HNCK, or indeterminate), many with ACTN and HIST; Cluster 1 e-entirely simple, mostly nonhistorical V-necks; Cluster 2a-fairly detailed and nonhistorical rectangulars; Cluster 2b-simple, historical, rectangulars; and Cluster 2c-simple, historical, rectangular anthropo- morphs. No group of variables, other than the shoulder variables, seems to be more important than others in sorting the cases. However, as in the previous tests a core group of "classic" V-necks grouped together in Cluster la, as did most of the battle-scene cases in Clusters 2a and 2b, further sub- stantiating the uniqueness of these two groups. The large number of cases from the Battle-Scene panel at DgOv-81 gives the misleading impression that simple rectangulars are more highly asso- ciated with ACTN and HIST than are V-necks. If these cases are excluded, the association between ACTN and HIST to both V-necks and rectangulars is nearly equal. This indicates that historical and nonhistorical cases are often quite similar and will group together if they have the same shoulder No Shoulders Analysis Clusters 1I EbbE U Others a .NCK _V * N "7$i HNCK f \\\\ BATTLE t ^ACTN r B\ I ~ HIST L _ i\\ \ . .J ,s~ Number of Cases 0 10 20 30 I t I I !

Summary of Cluster-Analysis Findings The key findings of the cluster analyses are: 1. The major dimensions of variability are shoulder types and historical associations. 2. Within these two general dimensions the cases sort into subclusters of overall complexity; cases with few variables fall at the cluster margins. 3. The most detailed anthropomorphs, many of the "classic" V-necks, generally do not have any historical associations. Table 6. Major Variable Frequency, No-Action or Historical- Variables Analysis.

Representative classic anthropomorphs (variable scales). 4. Removal of VNCK, HNCK, ACTN, and HIST showed that other differences are often very minor. 5. When the VNCK and HNCK variables were excluded from the clustering, many V-necks and rectangulars grouped together, suggesting they are quite similar except for the single shoulder variable. 6. In the absence of historical-period material culture, a historical-period/prehistoric dichotomy in anthropomorph form does not appear to exist. 7. More historical-period anthropomorphs are depicted in combat and battle, even discounting those from the DgOv-81 Battle Scene. A REVISED CLASSIFICATION If the classification system used in the past is valid, we would have seen the "classic" V-necks, "other" V-necks, and rectangulars cluster separately. We would also expect that historical and nonhistorical anthropomorphs consistently would cluster separately if they were indeed the products of different cultural groups. This consistent separation does not occur and as such, the differences between these forms appear to have been overemphasized and misinterpreted. Classifying anthro- pomorphs into distinct groups, based solely on historical, nonhistorical, V-neck, and horizontal- neck criteria is unsatisfactory, as it does not explain the variation possible within, and the similarities 403 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY i DgOv 60 DgOv 60 DgOv 63 Figure 11. Simple cases resembling classics (variable scales). between, these divisions. Enough similarities exist to suggest that all of the anthropomorphic rock art we studied is related, showing a continuous development of representation, and a classification scheme with historical meaning should reflect this relation. The following classification recognizes that anthropomorph representation changed over time in a continuous fashion. Retaining some of the terminology of previous classifications, the new classes can be labeled classic and historic, with each of these groups containing V-neck and rectangular anthropomorphs. Another class, called simple anthropomorphs, contains all those anthropomorphs too simple to be placed temporally with confidence, though they share many characteristics of both previous classes. Note that we employ the term "class" rather than "category" to differentiate these from Keyser's classification. Because of the relation between all anthropomorphs, this classification is not intended to be inflexible. As with any classification system, there are exceptions and misfits. The revised classes are based primarily on the clusters of the all-variables analysis (Figures 3 and 4, Table 4). The distribution of anthropomorphs by cluster according to the revised classes is shown in Table 7. The frequency of variables for each of the new classes can be found in Table 8. Classic anthropomorphs include the 23 detailed, nonhistorical cases found in Cluster l a of the all- variables cluster analysis. Significantly, 16 of the 23 cases also clustered together in both of the additional analyses, while four more were closely related. This indicates that most of these cases are very similar beyond the VNCK, HNCK, ACTN, and HIST variables, and can be considered a distinct group (Figure 10). Perhaps several of these on separate panels could be the products of a single artisan, a possibility requiring additional investigation. Twenty of the 23 classic cases have VNCK, two have HNCK, and one is missing the shoulder category. None have HIST and only one has ACTN. Most have HWST, NECK, and FEET, and all but one of the cases share the BARM variable, which is poorly represented in other clusters (see Table 7). HEAD, GNTL, and FNGR are represented frequently. Nearly all of the heads, when present, are circles rather than just dots, and more than half of all cases with HRTL are in this group. Most cases of Cluster 1 a lack only one or two of the variables listed above. Table 7. Revised Class Frequency by Cluster, All-Variables Analysis.

Based on this definition, a few cases in Cluster la are marginal, but a number of other cases from several other clusters are very similar to classic anthropomorphs. In particular, the three nonhistorical cases from Cluster 2a share many variables (see Figures 7 and 11). This points out that the variation is continuous and forcing all of the cases into discrete classes is not always possible. Eighteen of the V-necks in Cluster la also were considered to be "classic" V-necks in Keyser's (1977a) study. It is important to note that a number of Keyser's (1977a) original "classic" V-necks seem to fit better in other V-neck groups described later. However, unlike Keyser's (1 9 7 7a) classification, our definition of classic anthropomorphs does not exclude rectangulars, two of which are found in Cluster 1 a. Visual examination of these shows that one is related obviously to the V-necks of this group. Not surprisingly, this figure most closely resembles a classic V-neck from the same panel (Figure 10, top ^/ \ l 40cm Figure 12. Unusual rectangular classic from DgOv-88 (Thunderbird Cave). Magne and Klassen] 405</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY two glyphs). The second is an odd anthropomorph from Thunderbird Cave that quantitatively fits with this group, but qualitatively seems out of place, since it has many "rib" lines and eyes, both not commonly found at Writing-On-Stone (Figure 12). Other rectangulars that look very similar to the classics probably clustered separately because of the presence of SARM (see Figure 11). Although some classic anthropomorphs appear on the same panel as historical objects, they are never in contact or obviously involved with them. This does not indicate necessarily that all classic anthro- pomorphs were created before the introduction of historic items, but the high degree of correspon- dence between detailed anthropomorphs and nonhistorical contexts in all three tests is strong evidence that these represent the predominant prehistoric tradition. Keyser (1977a) observed that "classic" V-necks were executed with greater skill and care than other V-necks. Classic anthropomorphs are more detailed in composition than other anthropo- morphs, and from a purely visual stance the use of the various elements appears to be precise and highly conventionalized. Interestingly, all classics are petroglyphic in execution and many are incised deeply. In summary, classic anthropomorphs are nonhistorical anthropomorphs usually, but not exclusively, with a V-neck, executed as petroglyphs with considerable detail and precision. Historic anthropomorphs include all 80 anthropomorphs that have a historical association of any type. This class is valid because nearly all historical cases grouped together in several discrete clusters in the all-variables analysis. Also, the presence of historical associations for these cases is very significant in itself; anthropomorphs with historical associations can be identified with a specific time period, and many cases are undoubtedly contemporaneous or peri-contemporaneous. They can only have been created within a relatively short period of 100 to 150 years, mostly during documented historic times, which increases the likelihood that all of these anthropomorphs are related culturally. Finally, although most historic anthropomorphs show strong intragroup similar- ities, they also share many characteristics with nonhistoric anthropomorphs, suggesting they rep- resent a continuation of the prehistoric tradition. Historic anthropomorphs range from simple to elaborate and include both V-necks and rectan- gulars (Figure 13; also see Figures 5, 6, and 14). The cases of Cluster 2 are almost entirely historic, grouping according to their shoulder variable. Thirteen historical cases of Cluster 2a are elaborate historical versions of Keyser's (1977a) "other" V-necks; five cases are mounted. Significantly, all but four of the historical cases of Cluster 2b are found at sites DgOv-57 and DgOv-60. Since these are both battle scenes, we again raise the possibility that a single individual may have been responsible for them. All but four of the 51 very simple cases of Cluster 2b have HNCK, while the rest have XNCK. Cluster 2b contains the largest collection of historics, due to the inclusion of 29 from DgOv- 81. Their consistent grouping points out the overall similarity of these particular simple historic cases. Many of the non-DgOv-81 battle-scene anthropomorphs are on horseback, while one X-neck is mounted on a "boat-form" horse. By Keyser's (I 977a) definition, X-necks are a historical-period addition to rock art, yet this case is mounted on a boat-form horse very similar to boat-form horses associated with shield bearers, a predominantly prehistoric motif. A further 14 historic anthropo- morphs are found in Clusters 3a and 3b. All of the anthropomorphs with shoulders are rectangular and all but one of the cases are from the Battle-Scene panel. The relation between historic V-necks and historic rectangulars is strong, and both historic types are depicted mounted on horses of the same style (Figure 13). Furthermore, in the no shoulder variables analysis, a number of historic V-necks grouped with historic rectangulars, indicating a basic similarity beyond the shoulder variable. Overall, most variables found in classic anthropo- morphs also are found in historic anthropomorphs, but in lower frequencies. In general historic anthropomorphs can be divided into two groups. The first is a group of fairly detailed V-necks, some of which are similar to classic V-necks. The second group consists of relatively simple an- thropomorphs, including most DgOv-81 Battle-Scene anthropomorphs, simple X-necks, and mount- ed rectangulars. The simple anthropomorph class contains all very simple, nonhistorical anthropomorphs that could not be confidently placed into the classic or historic classes. This class includes all the V- necks that grouped into Cluster 1 b and 1 c and all of the nonhistorical rectangulars of Cluster 3a. It also includes the simple anthropomorphs with XNCK in Cluster 4 and the extremely simple V- 406 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="19">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA DgOv 55 DgOv 60 DgOw 27 DgOv 9 Figure 13. Representative historic anthropomorphs (variable scales). necks of Cluster 5, plus a few cases from Clusters 2a, 2b, and 3, for a total of 82 cases (Table 7; Figure 15; see also Figures 7 and 1 1). Nearly all simple anthropomorphs grouped together (in various combinations and orders) in all three cluster analyses, thereby justifying this group. With VNCK, XNCK, and HNCK excluded, all but seven of the 81 cases in Clusters lb and Ic, 3a, 4, and 5 (including some historical cases) again grouped together in three clusters. Each of the new clusters contained cases from several of the previous clusters, and their distinctions were no longer main- tained completely. This indicates that most of these cases are very similar, and only the shoulder shape sets them apart. With a difference of only one variable, all of these cases can be considered to be a related group. Simple historical and simple nonhistorical anthropomorphs are very similar. While there is no indication of purely historical associations for simple anthropomorphs, this does not necessarily mean all these cases are nonhistoric. Several cases in Cluster 2a without historical associations and several more cases from Cluster 3a are candidates for inclusion in the classic anthropomorph category and did not group into Cluster l a because of minor differences (e.g., Figures 7 and 11). Turning to the frequency data (Table 8), it is clear that all of the variables represented in classic anthropomorphs are represented in much lower frequencies in the simple anthropomorphs. Simple 407 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY //^ ^/ / / 15cm /// // Figure 14. DgOv-43 battle scene. anthropomorphs can potentially have any of the variables, but never more than a few at one time. Overall, a definition of these simple anthropomorph with little more depicted than a V-neck, X-neck, or straight shoulder set on parallel sides, together with a neck and horizontal waist in many cases. With few exceptions, they either have straight arms or no arms at all and there is no pattern to the presence of additional variables. For the most part, simple V-necks resemble nonhistorical versions of those called "other" V-necks by Keyser (1977a). Any very simple, nonhistorical anthropomorph with few details beyond a shoulder, neck, and waist is considered to be a simple anthropomorph, regardless of the shoulder shape. Simple anthropo- morphs may date from both historic and prehistoric contexts. Anthropomorph Class Commonalities Keyser's (1977a) categorization of anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone proposed that "classic" V-necks, "other" V-necks, and rectangular anthropomorphs were essentially discrete categories with [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991 408</page><page sequence="21">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA Ay A ' - DgOv 9 DgOv 9 DgOv 55 Figure 15. Representative simple anthropomorphs (variable scales). significantly different cultural and temporal origins. However, our analysis indicates that all of these anthropomorph types are closely related. Primarily, V-neck and rectangular anthropomorphs are essentially the same style, with only a single variable distinguishing them (a point also noted by Sundstrom [1984:114]). Furthermore, a major distinction between "classic" and "other" V-necks is not at all apparent. Finally, V-necks and rectangulars have occurred together in rock art from late prehistoric through historic times. Keyser (1977a) believes that "other" V-necks, historical and nonhistorical (classified as historic and simple anthropomorphs in this paper), bear no relation to "classic" V-necks (essentially classic anthropomorphs), as they only have the V-neck in common. That this is not true has been demonstrated by this analysis; there is wide variation and sharing of attributes in the composition of all V-neck anthropomorphs. One interesting exception is that classic V-necks have no straight arms, while simple and historic V-necks have low frequencies of bent arms. The large number of shared variables means that a stylistic relation is highly probable, and the assertion that none are related to classic V-necks, or that some are only crude copies (Keyser 1977a:26), has little actual basis. The argument that some simple and historic V-necks were not executed with the same skill or care used to depict classic V-necks (Keyser 1977a:26) may have some validity, but this has not been demonstrated adequately. This difference may have a historical explanation, as discussed later. Rectangular anthropomorphs are not discussed at length by Keyser (1977a), so classification comparisons are difficult to make. He does consider all rectangulars to be a heterogeneous group, even though he admits they show a great deal of variation, including similarities to "classic" V- necks, and he also points out that they are associated with all types of anthropomorphs (Keyser 1977a:27). He does not make an association between the variation in the rectangular anthropo- morphs and the corresponding variation in the V-necks at Writing-On-Stone. This covariation, although not always present, is visually apparent in many of the anthropomorphs (Figures 11-13, 15). It is also apparent from the clustering that saw both rectangulars and V-necks grouping together, particularly in the simple- and historic-anthropomorph clusters. In the end, the only difference between most rectangulars and V-necks is the difference in the shoulder shape. A graphic example of this similarity is seen in two anthropomorphs at DgOw-32, both of which have a straight shoulder, and beneath it, a V-shaped line (Figure 16). Despite the overall similarities between classic, historic, and simple anthropomorphs, a number of differences do exist. Classic anthropomorphs seem to be typically more elaborate and precisely executed than other anthropomorphs. Historic anthropomorphs, on the other hand, seem to be more involved with action and battle scenes. While current theories hold that differences in the depiction of historic and nonhistoric anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone are the result of the displacement of one cultural group by another (Bamforth 1988; Brink 1986; Dempsey 1973; Keyser 1977a, 1977b,1979), we believe that variation in anthropomorphs is better explained in terms of temporal developments within a single artistic tradition. 409 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="22">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 0 10 CM ! I Figure 16. Anthropomorph panel combining V-neck and rectangular glyphs. DEVELOPMENT OF ANTHROPOMORPH DEPICTIONS ON THE NORTHERN PLAINS The Late Prehistoric Period Classic anthropomorphs without historical associations probably represent the oldest V-neck and rectangular anthropomorphs found at Writing-On-Stone. This class is probably the result of hundreds of years of artistic tradition, indicated by the strongly conventionalized depiction of the entire anthropomorph and in particular, anatomical details such as genitals and heartlines. These anthro- pomorphs are precisely executed symbols, perhaps reflecting a "ceremonial" function of the art, or simply a greater amount of time available for this pursuit. Keyser (1977a) considered the original "classic" V-necks to be late prehistoric in age, both because of their lack of historic association and because of their apparent association with large shield-bearing anthropomorphs. The distribution of V-neck and shield-bearing anthropomorphs is similar (Conner and Conner 1971; Keyser 1977a; Schuster 1987; Wellman 1979); both motifs appear together on at least 16 panels at Writing-On- Stone and on many of the same panels elsewhere on the northwestern Plains (see Conner and Conner 1971:17; Keyser 1977a:80, 1984:7; Over 1941:32; Schuster 1987:34; Sundstrom 1984:70-73; Wor- mington and Forbis 1965:133). Shield-bearing figures in northwestern Plains rock art probably date from the late prehistoric and early protohistoric periods. This is known with more certainty now that Loendorf (1990) has dated a panel of shield-bearing warriors in Montana at A.D. 1104. Large body shields, as depicted on shield-bearing anthropomorphs, offered protection for pedestrian warriors, but were impractical for mounted warriors and offered little protection against bullets. Native groups of the northwestern Plains, including member tribes of the Blackfoot Nation, were known to use large body shields (Dempsey 1973; Glover 1962), which were abandoned at some point after the horse became common on the northwestern Plains during the protohistoric period; shield bearers are rarely depicted with historical objects. That at least some shield-bearing figures at Writing-On-Stone are contempora- neous with some V-necks has been discussed by several authors (Dempsey 1973; Dewdney 1964; Habgood 1967). At one site, DgOw-32, three shield bearers, two of them mounted, have V-neck bodies showing through shields (Figure 17), one attacking a pedestrian V-neck figure. At DgOv-2 (Panel 2), one classic V-neck has a circle drawn in front of the torso which is probably a shield, while one simple V-neck at DgOv-3 is similarly drawn. Another V-neck at DgOw-30 (not classified in this study but fitting the classic V-neck description) also has a possible shield, as do two unclassified V-necks at DgOw-29. Similar V-neck figures with shields are known from Wyoming (Schuster 1987: 33) and South Dakota (Keyser 1984:32), while V-neck figures appear as designs on shields in both Wyoming (Schuster 1987:33) and Montana (Conner 1980; Mulloy 1958:122, 127). Many simple anthropomorphs also may have been created at the same time as classic anthro- pomorphs and the basic differences between these two classes are minor, generally consisting of a variation in detail. They may represent nothing more than variation in artistic abilities, personal [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991 410</page><page sequence="23">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA 0 10 CM JJ ^ Figure 17. Mounted shield-bearing anthropomorphs from DgOw-32. Redrawn from Keyser (1977a:Figure 14a). styles, or even initial sketches. The simplicity of many "other" V-necks (simple anthropomorphs) prompted Keyser (1977a:26) to call them "crude copies of classic V-neck figures," as this fitted well with his view of separate cultural origins for these figures. However, when he encountered both crude and detailed shield-bearing anthropomorphs at a site in South Dakota, Keyser (1984:20) concluded that the crude figures were preliminary sketches for the detailed figures. Presumably, separate cultural origins were not considered to be plausible. Yet, the reasons given for the prelim- inary sketch conclusion, regarding shield-bearing anthropomorphs, are equally valid for many V- neck anthropomorph cases. This leads to the conclusion that crude V-necks are not necessarily the work of different artists nor later in age, but that they are related stylistically and temporally to detailed V-necks. From the evidence, most shield-bearing figures and classic anthropomorphs were created in a late prehistoric context. The possibility that many simple anthropomorphs also are the same age means that the generalization "all late prehistoric anthropomorphs are precisely and carefully executed" cannot be made, but classic anthropomorphs certainly exhibit these characteristics. Although the "ceremonial" or "spiritual" significance of late prehistoric art may be high, a strong "biographical" component is also possible considering the involvement of a number of shield-bearing warriors (a component of Keyser's Ceremonial Art) in action scenes and the difficulty of assigning action to pedestrian figures (discussed below). Furthermore, many shield-bearing anthropomorphs may be autobiographical, since designs on shields probably represent an individual's "medicine sign" (Con- ner and Conner 1971:17). Even so, classic anthropomorphs were a distinct core of precise figures within the late prehistoric that influenced the depiction of later anthropomorphs. The beginning of the protohistoric period, however, did not see an abrupt end to the depiction of this rock art. Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric Transition The beginning of the protohistoric period on the northwestern Plains is marked by the first appearance of European trade items, especially guns and horses. The persistence of shield-bearing figures into at least early protohistoric rock art is evident at a number of sites at Writing-On-Stone. For example, one shield bearer is closely associated with a rifle at DgOw-29, while another at DgOv- 3 may also be holding a rifle. Rifles also are associated with shield bearers at two sites in Montana (Keyser 1977a), while mounted shield bearers occur in Montana (Conner and Conner 1971; Conner 1980) and in northwestern South Dakota (Keyser 1984:34, 49), as well as at Writing-On-Stone. For example, three shield-bearing figures at DgOw-32 are mounted on "crudely-drawn boat-shaped horses" (Keyser 1977a:23), with two of them attacking pedestrian shield bearers (Figure 17). Ac- cording to Keyser (1977a:23), the "awkwardness of these depictions suggests that the artists had 411 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="24">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY not mastered the style of drawing mounted men, and the crude boat-shaped horses suggest that these animals were still a novelty in Plains Indian culture." Two of the horses at DgOw-32 also appear to be wearing horse armor, which apparently was abandoned soon after the introduction of horses (Dempsey 1973; Keyser 1977a). Considering that shield bearers continued to be depicted into the protohistoric period, it is not surprising that a continuation of classic motifs can be seen in the historic period. In particular, five cases from Cluster 2a of the all-variables analysis grouped with the classics in the no ACTN and HIST analysis. For example, one case with bent arms, a circular head and a heartline resembles a classic V-neck in many ways (Figure 13). This case is crudely mounted on a "boat-form" horse, perhaps again representing an early attempt at depicting a mounted rider, similar to the mounted shield bearers discussed above. Close examination of this case reveals that this horse is far too incomplete to be conclusively considered a boat-form version, and the form of the thighs is actually reminiscent of probable late historic horses. Even so, this mounted V-neck seems to represent a historic continuation of the classic tradition. A historic X-neck from DgOv-43 is mounted on a horse that is more boat-form in appearance (Figure 14). This is an incongruous combination according to Keyser's (1977a) classification, as he considers X-necks to be a historical-period category created by a different cultural group than that which created protohistoric boat-form horses. This X-neck, however, is involved in a battle with two historic V-necks that clustered in Cluster 2a. Indeed, many of the detailed historic cases of Cluster 2a resemble classic anthropomorphs, which may indicate they are all protohistoric. Another unclassified X-neck from DgOw-30 also appears to be mounted on a crude boat-form horse. If the boat-form horse is indeed a transitional horse style, this means that at least two X-necks, and possibly others, were created in an early protohistoric context, at the same time as mounted shield bearers and detailed V-necks. Thus quite probably all of these figures were created by the same cultural group. Protohistoric and Historic Periods Most historic anthropomorphs are simpler in design than classic ones and exhibit differences in their form of depiction that we believe are due to major changes within a single culture. The argument here is that historic anthropomorphs evolved from classic anthropomorphs during the protohistoric period, and continued to be depicted into the historic period. Many historic anthropomorphs are simple and are involved in obvious action situations such as battles and riding horses. They depict few anatomical details such as fingers, heartlines, and genitals, and many do not even have heads. Elaborations, if they exist, are often headdresses, and many weapons are guns. Overall, the precision and care with which historic anthropomorphs were created seems to have declined from that of classic anthropomorphs, though this is a generalization. Again, many simple anthropomorphs show great similarity to historic anthropomorphs, and it seems probable that many simple anthropo- morphs were created in a historical context. More historic anthropomorphs are depicted with action than nonhistorical anthropomorphs, and some of this difference may be the result of a cataloging bias in our analyses, but it is also clear that the horse brought a great deal more mobility to the people of the Plains. It could be argued that an anthropomorph depicted on horseback (a historical context) does not inherently show more "action" than one holding a bow or a spear (nonhistorical context), but we assumed it does; both may not necessarily represent activity. Indeed, many mounted anthropomorphs could be considered quite static in form. At least eight anthropomorphs in battle situations have no obvious historical associations, demonstrating that action is not restricted to historical contexts. However, associations between anthropomorphs and action appear to have increased in frequency as the culture evolved in the protohistoric and historic periods, with much of this action involving horses. Any increase in rock-art action can thus be explained as the result of depicting increased mobility afforded by horses, and a corresponding increase in horse-related events, such as horse stealing, coup counting, and combat. Many authors recognize that great changes in Native culture resulted from the introduction of the horse and the gun to the northwestern Plains. Within a few generations patterns of movement, hunting, and warfare were vastly altered. Ranges expanded and contact (and conflict) with other 412 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="25">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA Native groups undoubtedly increased in frequency. The horse became central to the Plains Native Indian way of life, while warfare and the status system were modified substantially. Keyser (1979: 46) suggests that "prior to the historical period, status rested primarily on power acquired through the vision quest rather than by a system of graded war honors" and goes to some length to point out evidence of these changes at Writing-On-Stone. Yet he still maintains that differences in the rock art are the result of two different cultural groups. By not linking these two arguments, Keyser (1979) fails to make explicit the full implications of his research; that is, that the changes observed in the historical rock art probably resulted from changes within a single culture, brought on following the introduction of the horse and the gun, rather than the appearance of a new culture. From our reading of Wissler (1911), we suggest that the vision quest was just one, albeit essential, way of achieving status and power in prehistoric times. Indeed, it was a crucial step in being able to acquire status in yet other ways, including hunting or raiding success. Furthermore, the number of individuals achieving higher (male) status was probably lower in prehistoric times, and once the horse and gun accelerated aggressiveness, more individuals, perhaps with less experience with a rock-art tradition, were achieving status and could have been "leaving their marks" at Writing-On-Stone. This alone could account for the high number of simple anthropomorphs and their apparent strong similarity to historic anthropomorphs. The rock art of Writing-On-Stone, as a form of historical record keeping, reflected the changes occurring within the culture. Traditional "spiritual" depictions of heartlines and genitals apparently declined as the importance of coup and horses increased. Perhaps the rock art no longer had spiritually oriented, introspective connotations and instead represented more prosaic biographical events, as suggested by Keyser's (1 977a, 1979) Biographical Art category, which he argues eventually developed a strictly storytelling function (Keyser 1987). This complete lack of ceremonial function is not probable, considering the spiritual nature of Plains Native culture to this day. Regardless of the motivation behind the rock art, the changes observed do not establish a priori that a cultural displacement occurred. An alteration in meaning or motivation in the rock art could just as easily be the result of a within-group response to changing cultural conditions; the recurrent depiction of horses, guns and battles was a response to a modified cultural value system. As the emphasis shifted to a horse culture, certain material items were lost, new items were added, and this was reflected in the rock art. For example, body shields became cumbersome and were aban- doned, while trailing headdresses, depicted in historical-period rock art, may have been adopted due to their spectacular effect during a high-speed attack. The greatly increased pace of Plains life may have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the time spent on creating rock art. While some historic anthropomorphs are deeply incised and carefully rendered, a large component is more lightly scratched. Perhaps the emphasis changed from detailed representations to simple recordings as the culture altered ceremonial and status values. Consequently the rock art was quickly executed by greater numbers of less-skilled artists and became proletarianized. Even so, the presence of precise and detailed historical-period anthropomorphs means that a universal change in precision did not occur. Furthermore, continuation of many conventions such as the V-neck displays a considerable continuity in style if not technique. In general then, we view all anthropomorph motifs as very strongly related. In a chronological context, these relations are illustrated schematically in Figure 18. One subject not yet addressed in detail is the presence of hourglass figures at Writing-On-Stone. Hourglass anthropomorphs have been considered a historic addition to Writing-On-Stone rock art (Keyser 1977a) and form part of Keyser's argument for the replacement of cultural groups in that area. Reexamination of the evidence suggests that this may not be the case; in fact, hourglass anthropomorphs may have had a minor but continuous presence in the rock art from the late prehistoric period onwards. As many as 100 hourglass anthropomorphs are found at over 21 separate sites at Writing-On-Stone. About 65 of these are found on the Battle-Scene panel (Figure 5). Hourglass figures are generally simple, although a few have arms and feet, and some have additional elaborations such as headdresses, fringes, and t-shaped heads. Of the approximately 35 hourglass anthropomorphs outside of the Battle-Scene panel, only about 13, or less than 38 percent, have any historical association or show any action, suggesting many are not necessarily historical-period in age. One fringed hourglass anthropomorph at DgOw-29 appears to be closely associated with several classic 413 Magne and Klassen]</page><page sequence="26">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY c Shield-bearing I Classic OL 0 Historic 0 a.

Although not redefined in this study, shield- bearer and hourglass classes are shown to provide a more inclusive context. anthropomorphs and boat-form zoomorphs. Another hourglass figure not recorded by Keyser is closely associated with a shield bearer, and both figures on this panel are isolated from other rock art. Although inconclusive, these associations and the number of nonhistorical hourglass anthro- pomorphs are suggestive of a long-term presence at Writing-On-Stone. Thus the presence of nu- merous hourglass figures at DgOv-81 is unusual but not in itself evidence of the intrusion of a new cultural group. Indeed, one observation that could be pursued is that the hourglass figures at DgOv- 81 are mostly located to the rear of each opposing force, while the rectangular figures appear in the central battle area. Is differential status being depicted? Or perhaps different genders are represented, with women at the rear guarding horses and travois of the right (offensive) force, and those of the defensive force in tipis with children. The absence of V-neck anthropomorphs at this panel may only indicate the personal preference of the artist, since the scene probably was executed by a single individual. However, most differences between the historic anthropomorphs of this panel and earlier classic anthropomorphs can be explained in terms of a rapid and far-reaching alteration of Plains Native culture during the historic period. The entire complex of historical changes to Writing-On- Stone rock-art anthropomorphs culminated in the Battle-Scene panel. It is probably one of the last petroglyph panels created at Writing-On-Stone. Implications for Cultural Affiliation The anthropomorph motifs examined in this paper represent continuous rock-art traditions. The majority of the variation depicted is the result of chronological change and development of motifs, reflecting ongoing changes in Plains culture. In themselves, V-necks and rectangular bodies are not indicative of age or cultural association. Classic, simple, and historic anthropomorphs all show basic similarities, and are undoubtedly related stylistically. Although they do show some differences, at no point is it necessary to explain these differences in terms of a break in cultural affiliation. Rather, the differences are a case of continuous variation through time. The overall relation of these an- thropomorphs contradicts the traditional view that all late prehistoric rock art at Writing-On-Stone is only affiliated with the Shoshone, while protohistoric/historical-period rock art is affiliated with one or several different groups, such as the Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Cree, or Assiniboine (Dempsey 1973:19-22; Habgood 1967; Keyser 1977a, 1977b, 1979). This view is critical to debates regarding 414 [Vol. 56, No. 3, 1991</page><page sequence="27">ROCK ART ANTHROPOMORPHS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA late prehistoric Native group distributions authored by Brink (1986) and Bamforth (1988), among others. The presence of related V-neck and rectangular anthropomorphs from the late prehistoric through the historical-period suggests that the artists responsible for at least these types of anthro- pomorphs were present in the Writing-On-Stone area during this entire time period. This does not rule out the possibility that several different groups, including the Shoshone, may have created various rock-art motifs at Writing-On-Stone at various times. It does, however, reduce the likelihood that the Shoshone were responsible for all, or even any, late prehistoric rock art, particularly anthropomorphs. This inference is even more likely given the A.D. 1100 date assignable to shield bearers in south-central Montana, well before Shoshonean presence in that area (Loendorf 1990). With respect to this latter recent evidence, we must point out that Loendorf s (1990:52) alternative (and tentative) ascription of these A.D. 1100 figures to possible Athapaskan migrants is even more dubious than a Shoshone one, although he considers it "quite" possible that shield bearers in Montana dating between A.D. 1450 and 1750 were created by "more than one cultural group" (Loendorf 1990:52). Northern Athapaskan culture areas have very little in the way of a rock-art tradition and certainly no shield-bearing warrior antecedents. Leaving this major issue aside for now, there is no question in our minds that the assignment of Athapaskans to the Avonlea "culture" of the northern plains (Kehoe 1973; Wilcox 1988) is highly debatable, and the archaeological evidence, including rock art, needs to be extensively reconsidered (see also Ives 1990:49-52; Magne 1987). The ethnohistoric evidence for a Shoshonean presence in southern Alberta is based largely on various references to the "Snake" Indians in historical accounts (Brink 1986). As Brink (1986:45) notes, many authors "implicitly" accept that the Snake are actually the Shoshone, and this notion has become entrenched in northwestern Plains archaeological thought (e.g., see Bamforth 1988:88- 89). The archaeological evidence for the presence of the Shoshone in southern Alberta rests almost exclusively on Keyser's (1975, 1977a) contention that the shield-bearing anthropomorph motif is derived from the Great Basin (Bamforth 1988:89), the original home of the Shoshone. Any other convincing archaeological evidence for a Shoshone presence in southern Alberta is lacking (Byrne 1973:519-521; Greiser 1988; Vickers 1988) and the archival record, Brink's (1986) principal source, is quite ambiguous as well. Indeed, there is now considerable archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence accumulating for a Siouan identification for the Snake in southern Alberta (Byrne 1973: 520-521; Vickers 1988:25). Even without this lack of evidence, the Shoshone are unlikely candidates for the artists responsible for historical-period anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone due to their very limited use of the Alberta plains during the protohistoric and historic periods (Bamforth 1988:91-93; Brink 1986; Magne et al. 1987). This point is acknowledged explicitly by Keyser (1977a; 1979); hence, the need for a cultural schism between late prehistoric and historic rock art in his classification. But if the Shoshone were not responsible for the historical-period rock art at Writing-On-Stone and if all of the temporal ranges of the art are closely related, then the Shoshone are responsible for none or very little. For all of this rock art, we must look elsewhere for its creators. Directly related to this issue are rejections of Shoshonean origin for incised shield-bearing and V-neck anthropomorphs for sites in eastern Wyoming (Schuster 1987), southwestern South Dakota (Sundstrom 1984:108), and Montana (Conner and Conner 1971). We agree with Schuster (1987) and Sundstrom (1984) that the shield-bearing motif may have diffused from the Great Basin in one form or another, but this does not lead to the conclusion that Shoshone artists must have created them all. Curiously, the complete lack of V-necks west of the Continental Divide (Gebhard 1966; Schuster 1987) implies that this motif could not have originated with the Shoshone in the Great Basin, but must have originated on the northwestern Plains. V-neck and shield-bearing anthropomorphs on historical-period hide paintings (Gebhard 1966; Schuster 1987:35-36) prove without a doubt that tribes other than the Shoshone were creating these motifs. If, as seems certain from historical evidence, tribes other than the Shoshone created rock art and other forms of depictional art, and since we know that other tribes, including the Blackfoot, were using body shields in the late prehistoric, then there is no valid reason why these tribes could not have been depicting shield bearers in their rock art. Given this, it is not implausible that the Magne and Klassen] 415</page><page sequence="28">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY incised shield-bearing anthropomorph rock-art motif also originated on the Plains, or could at least have been depicted by tribes other than the Shoshone. For example, although Gebhard (1966) believes the shield motif originated in the Great Basin, he also believes that this motif diffused to other areas and was incorporated into the depictional art of various Plains tribes. The Shoshone did not have a monopoly on the design. CONCLUSIONS Cluster analysis cannot be expected to account for all variation encountered in rock art, but the presence of repeated conventionalized design elements in Writing-On-Stone anthropomorphs has allowed use of this method for determining general patterns of association. At the very least, cluster analysis introduces a systematic approach to classifying rock art at Writing-On-Stone and dem- onstrates that three principal misconceptions regarding classification of the anthropomorphs there have been applied previously. These misconceptions are: (1) Not all V-necks are related; (2) V-neck and rectangular anthropomorphs are unrelated; and (3) nonhistoric and historic anthropomorphs are unrelated. In fact, all V-necks share a number of characteristics and show a continuous degree of variation. The difference between V-neck and rectangular bodies rests primarily on a single variable-shoulder shape-which does not justify their separation. Finally, the differences between nonhistoric and historic anthropomorphs can be explained in terms of a temporal development in depiction, rather than as two separate traditions. With these misconceptions in mind, the traditional classification of "classic" V-necks, "other" V-necks, and rectangulars lacks validity. A new classification that recognizes stylistic relations and the historical evolution of anthropomorphs is necessary. In this system, classic anthropomorphs are late prehistoric V-necks and rectangular figures that are detailed and carefully executed and represent a highly conventionalized stylistic tradition. This tradition evolved further in the proto- historic and historic periods to reflect changes in the Plains Native Indian culture resulting from the introduction of the horse, as seen in historic anthropomorphs. More emphasis was placed on action and event depiction, while attention paid to detail and precision declined. Yet historic anthropomorphs, bothropomorphs, both V-neck an gular bodied, retained many variables in common with classic anthropomorphs and represent a continuation of many design elements. Simple anthropo- morphs are cases that share characteristics with both classic and historic anthropomorphs and are probably stylistically and temporally related to both of these groups. There is much yet to be done before a reasonably complete understanding of the Writing-On- Stone rock art can be achieved. Finding analytically appropriate classifications and applying them to cultural, historical, and geographic problems is only one issue. The hints of individuality perceived in these analyses are one obvious area in need of examination, particularly in light of recent studies of Plains ledger art and hide paintings (Feder 1980; Young 1986). Implementation of some of these concepts in an analysis of intersite variations, similarities, and correspondences could be highly informative. We still do not know much about what this rock art meant to the Native creators, and we believe that terms such as "ceremonial" or "biographic" should be employed carefully until it is clear that such distinctions actually existed in the past. The overall relation of the Writing-On-Stone anthropomorphs studied in this paper suggests a single culture was responsible for all of the rock art, or that several groups continuously depicted rock art from the late prehistoric until the historic periods. Previously, it was thought that all late prehistoric rock art in the area was created by Shoshonean artists, while historic rock art was left by the Blackfoot or other groups. As the Shoshone did not have a major historical presence in southern Alberta, it is unlikely this group was responsible for Writing-On-Stone rock art. This suggestion must be confirmed with further archaeological, ethnographic, historical, and rock-art investigations. Acknowledgments.
