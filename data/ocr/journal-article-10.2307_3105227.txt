LAYTON, JR., "American Ideologies of Science and Engineer- ing"]' 1. Introduction Some commentators have argued that, after a "revolutionary" shift or a "transformation," there was generated, probably in the lat- ter 19th century, a distinctly "modern technology," different from its predecessors. This notion is broadly understood from the follow- ing claims: there was "a radical transformation in the entire human environment, largely as a result of the impact of the mathematical and physical sciences upon technology" (Mumford); "Having come MR.

(Singer); "the modern developments in the sciences of chemistry, physics, and genetics are a quantum jump in man's ability to transform matter into useable materials and en- ergy" (North on a Second Economic Revolution).2 And subse- quently a theme has been articulated, whose proponents accept that there was a historical discontinuity but model it differently, espe- cially regarding the "science(s)" central to the changes. At the heart of this revision of the record there are claims such as Layton's that there was a "transformation of a traditional mechani- cal technology" with the buildup of a "new scientific era" for techni- cal working.3 The present article focuses on several of Layton's contributions in Technology and Culture and another by Layton's for- mer student David Channell, although various other T&amp;C authors have followed the same broad line.4 Layton has suggested that an item identified as "technology as knowledge" played a major part in creating an expressly "scientific technology."5 (Here, technology is an activity.) And W. J. M. Rankine's proposition of shifts in the "basis" of technical activity from "tradition or rule of thumb" and in "the basic philosophy of the engineering profession" that Ran- kine helped to achieve in the mid-19th century, resulted, accord- ing to Rankine and Channell, in "the harmony of theory and prac- 2L.

There came about "a new body of knowledge-engineering science," whose link with "science" is shown by the alleged necessity to "transform the concepts and discov- eries" of each before they might appear legitimately as part of the other.6 Layton and Channell were critical of the idea that "engineering sim- ply applies the results and discoveries of [natural] science without making any fundamental changes [in them]," that is, that "modern technology is simply applied science."' They were both broadly in ac- cord with Rankine's isolation of two separable modes of technical working, the first being "empirical... purely and simply practical" and the second being "scientific." Their case was informed by such ob- servations about an "after" condition as these: "The function of tech- nological rules is to provide a rational basis for design..." and "technologists ... must rely on a set of practical rules which can gov- ern each specific situation."8 Most important, perhaps, "technology is based on its own conceptual framework, which is parallel to yet in- dependent of the scientific framework."' (Here, again, technology is an activity.) The case to be examined in this article, about alleged shifts in the "relationship between science and technology" and in condi- tions where the identities of the "related" items seem to shift about themselves, is set out in the context of an agreement with White- head, that an unfortunate legacy of "modern science," one associ- ated with its incipient "mechanism," has been a reluctance to deal with issues linked with science in a "philosophical" way. "Thought is abstract; and the intolerant use of abstractions is the major vice of the intellect.. . not wholly corrected by the recurrence to concrete experience."' Part 2 below addresses the sloppy use of "science" in 20th-century discussion and the lack of an identifiably "scientific" mode of acting, and part 3 questions the reality of a distinct "engi- neering science." The conclusion of the article is that the revisionist thesis summarized above is illusory, a creature only of an overdrama- tized record, part of "the idols of the theatre" in Bacon's phrase."

Myth, as in the sacred tales of the origins of human groups, is, like the theory composed by scientists, an ordering device used to help mold what is new to any culture "in the light of [its] tradition." Thus "the mythic process is a learning device in which the unintelligible-randomness-is reduced to the intelligible-a pat- tern: 'Myth may be more uniform than history.' ""2 Using myth in this sense, the reductions of the revisionist historians cited above can be seen to have involved ordering the record in an unruly way.'" Perhaps, as with the Malinowski quotation in the epigraph, magic is characteristically ruly, being "governed" by discernible "laws." But humans must often operate without any written "rules" or "theories," without any "science" to tell them what to do next. Technical activity is, in this manner, more random and less pat- terned than many historians of "technology" make it out to be. Hence Layton's statement quoted at the outset about what is "obvi- ous" needs reappraisal. Partly because a cluster of things called "sci- ence" has been imbued by the Western moderns with a special, totemic awe and regard,'4 there has been too ready an acceptance by such people of certain sacred tales told about a "modern technol- ogy" and its origins. 2. Transformations, Science, and Discovery Various types of transformation can be identified, but for present purposes three are discernible. Type 1 transformations take the form of constructs historians produce in trying to model directly ob- servable changes. Thus the sociologists' Great Transformation can be equated with shifts such as those when "the face of England changed" in an Industrial Revolution not so named at the time.'" 12P.

This "transforma- tion of science" (Hall) came at about the time of a Transformation of Europe and so too in the early stages of England's Apprenticeship (Wil- son) for a later, 18th-century Transformation of England (Mathias). Ac- cording to the Cambridge Modern History, there were also "social and intellectual transformations" associated with changes in "sci- ence" in the 19th century, linked too with the advent of "new science- based industries.""7 Since Marx has probably been the most influential proponent of a type 1 transformation in the West, it is worth stressing that his idea of change was linked to type 2 transformations as well. Like the transformations of mathematics (rotation, translation, reflection, shearing of shapes), these are directly observable shifts which are gen- erally thought to be "reasonable" in the sense that they are taken to be explicable using the evidence of observation. And, indeed, the journalists' cliche, "the situation has been transformed," has become a commonplace for shifts such as the coming of Marx's "modern in- dustry." What should have been directly observed about this new con- dition was that it "is continually transforming not only the technical basis of production but also the functions of the worker and the so- cial combinations of the labour process."'" Other examples include those in Levi-Strauss's scheme for modeling totemism, an important topic here, given what was said above. Changes in form, changes of the type that turn the raw into the cooked, the natural into the artifi- cial, being acts of cultural construction, play a major part in "to- '6A. E. Musson and E.

Cooked food is "fresh raw food which has been transformed (e'labore) by cultural means... ."19 And ours is the only species that has produced massive type 2 shifts in its surroundings. As for type 3 transformations, Westerners do not normally class these as "reasonable" in the sense of explicability noted above. Wiz- ards continually transform things in children's tales. Toads become princes and mice become horses. Equally outside the West's domain of the profane, that of science in Malinowski's scheme, are the follow- ing shifts: "Both alchemists and the medieval philosophers were pre- pared to believe," wrote Singer about a mode we might call "mysticism" today, "that matter of one type, by a mere rearrange- ment of its four elements, could be transformed into matter of an- other type." In the classical Greek culture, wrote Dickinson, "every phenomenon of nature, night and 'rosy-fingered' dawn, earth and sun, winds, rivers, and seas, sleep and death-all have been trans- formed into Divine and conscious agents, to be propitiated by prayer, interpreted by divination, and comprehended by passions and desires identical with those which stir and control mankind." So, these Greeks by their religion were made "to feel at home in the world," a place made to seem orderly in a particular way2- though some would say the sense of order was only proclaimed. Also, Malinowski has written of the Melanesian culture that he stud- ied: "All important economic activities are fringed with magic, espe- cially such as imply pronounced elements of chance, venture, or danger."21 Hence type 2 transformations have been linked closely with type 3 shifts. Passing back to Malinowski's other domain, that of the profane, the use of words as labels is crucial for acts of discrimination identi- fied as key issues here. How can anyone recognize a "scientific" form of technical work? When queries are posed about a "science- technology relationship," why should "technologists" be thought to be expressly "practical" actors, as in Rankine's claims about "the har- mony of theory and practice," but not "scientists"? How can "engi- neering science" be "a new body of knowledge" and a "techno- logical activity" concurrently? Within science and everyday speech alike, labels imply that a secure identification has been made: blue flower is more specific than flower, small blue flower more specific 19E.

Item L, known to be of class M, can- not be of class N as well, if a boundary of discrimination has been drawn to separate Ms from Ns. Gold/Au is rendered less mysteri- ous to Westerners when it is placed securely in the periodic table of the elements than it appeared to our forebears who believed it could be grown from base metals.22 We feel familiar with gold, classed in this way, rather as the classical Greeks must have felt with their powerful, capricious anthropomorphic winds and rivers. Each has seemed to form a proper part of the local culture. Now consider a certain lack of discrimination in calling different types of change by the same word, transformation. Consider this statement: "All over Southern England, the earthmovers and bulldoz- ers are at work, transforming green fields into housing estates and factories," in an orgy of ruined villages.23 Though these words in- voke Ashton's images of Industrial Revolution, this is as good an example of type 2 transformation as Ashton's changing "face of England" was a metaphoric type 1 transformation considering when the first railways were built. Then there is the "problem of illusion in art": With great artistry of using materials in new configura- tions, Galveston, Texas, produces annually "Dickens on the Strand," whereby "a sub-tropical island in the Gulf of Mexico is... trans- formed into as much a bit of Victorian London as local lifestyle... will allow."24 England is reproduced skillfully in the United States, rather as Kansas was re-created in England for Return to Oz. But even the greatest fan of "the magic of art," discussed further in part 4 below, will realize that here the "suspension of disbelief" has only been temporary. The one whom Westerners call the artist may appear as a conjuror at times, fusing the identities of object and sub- ject.25 Nevertheless, few Westerners will disagree that such theatri- cal illusions constitute type 2 (observable) transformations, not type 3 (magical) ones. In these circumstances, then, how should we class Layton's claim about a "transformation" in technical activity (from "traditional" to "scientific technology") and Channell's "transformation" of "bodies of knowledge" (from "science" to "engineering science" and vice versa)? Are these to be classed with the "myths of transformation" dis- cussed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica?26 Or with one of the shifts in the "face of England" discussed here? The idea of science informs. 22Cf. R. S. Westfall, Never at Rest (Cambridge, 1980), p. 20. "3Daily Mail, July 23, 1985. 24E.

Science, then, is taken as one thing here, and one alone, in the normal manner of using words as labels. It is an arti- fact, a particular type of written knowledge, being the formulated and tested knowledge that human beings have recorded about their surroundings and something not initially subject to acts of "scien- tific discovery." Further specification follows to help set up a secure boundary around science and also to underscore a totemic status awarded to things associated with the name, as revealed in state- ments such as "20th-century science has transformed the world."27 Science in the sense adopted here is not science-as-an-activity as it re- lates, for instance, to Merton's "norms of science" and to Layton's "tel- eological" form of "engineering science," serving "social ends exterior to itself, which are manifested in design."28 Science, in the present sense, cannot have a human-like "purpose" such as "to trans- form the concepts and discoveries in one area so that they can be in- corporated into the other area."29 Nor can it have an "aim" as in this statement: "Basic science aims at knowing: it seeks generality and exactitude, even at the price of a good deal of idealization."30 Al- ways inert, and normally stationary, science tends just to sit there un- moving until some outside agency decides to act on it, or to act with it. Alone it has never even changed the form, or the position, of a pin. Calling both a body of knowledge and a human activity by the same name, "science," implies that a boundary of discrimination has been thrown around the two things together. Now do that for two other objects. Experts on propaganda will realize that, if you call cats and courage by the same name, "courage," before long those who have adopted the usage will have become convinced, even if no evidence has been provided, that cats are particularly cou- rageous animals. In the same manner, when science-as-knowledge and science-as-an-activity are given the same name, characteristics of one become associated with the other in an unruly and rather mys- tical way. In particular, the human qualities of caprice, passion, and meddlesome behavior, an observable part of science-as-an-activity be- cause of the human involvement, seem to have become attributes of science-as-knowledge. And "science," in this way, has become a sa- 27B. Magee in "Thinking Aloud" program, entitled "The New Science: Order out of Chaos?" BBC Television, February 2, 1986. 28R. K.

Science has been identified here as being linked with identifica- tion, profanation, and objectivity-the last, in the sense that gold/ Au was the same material to 16th-century people as it is to everyone today. Science's universality has been raised, given the com- mon assumption made about the globality of the identification of such things as gold and cats. So science (which includes what hu- mans know of these two named things) is identifiable as a "public good" and thus not a "scarce good" concurrently-also as a type of publicly available knowledge. Scientists "publish" their results so that others may use or test them. If someone learns anything from what has been "published," perhaps in those circumstances of manu- facturing that may be called "practical," there will be those people who will call this "applied science." But it is apparent that no change of form has occurred in the knowledge used. Accordingly, the use of past participle that is appropriate to signify a change in the stock or condition of "scarce goods" (cooked cabbages and spent pennies) is not appropriate in the phrase "applied science." For "applied" is not discriminating for parts of science in the nor- mal manner of the use of words as labels. Science does not only consist, or even primarily consist, in the types of statement called "reductions" by Channell in the context of "engineering science.""3 On the contrary, if scientists discern no pat- terns in their observations, that is what they should report. It is judged as unruly conduct for them to impose a sense of order onto their results that is not discernible in observations that are available. In these circumstances only a very few generalizations are valid for science. One is that parts of it have their status, as such, indepen- dent of two things: the means of derivation of the knowledge and any speculations made about its future utility. Accordingly, and given all the efforts made to prevent the detail of science-as-an- activity from influencing the detail of science-as-knowledge, it would be a miracle of there were an identifiable, stereotypical, "scien- tific" mode of human working. And indeed, for all the discussion of the "rationality of science,"32 "induction," "scientific method," and so on set up to provide some type of "law" or "governing princi- ple" for successful scientists to use, there has no more been a known, articulated "method for doing science" than there has been 31Channell, "Harmony," p. 46. 32E.g., L. Laudan, Progress and Its Problems: Toward a Theory of Scientific Growth (Berke- ley, 1977), pp. 1-8.</page><page sequence="10">Transformations and the Myth of "Engineering Science" 71 an identifiable "cooking method" or a "woodworking method."" Methods (plural) there may have been; but, in the absence of any sin- gle statement for human specialist activity of any type, it makes no more sense to ask an engineer to "be scientific" than to ask a lawyer to "be seamanly" or a sailor to act like a good cook. Suitable yard- sticks do not exist to indicate how to do so. As a result, Layton's claims about the aftermath of 19th-century "revolutions" in "sci- ence" and "technology," including a "scientific revolution in technol- ogy," need reappraisal. Layton has written that "Scientific technology, for good or ill, became the prime source of economic growth.... Craftsmen were gradually displaced by engineers and scientists as the chief agents of technical change," as "hydraulic engineers" replaced "mill- wrights." But "the scientific approach," "scientific engineering," and "scientific technology4"" are not identifiable. So this finding is the stuff of illusion and also the stuff of the type of status-seeking propa- ganda that Layton has recognized elsewhere.5 As Wilensky has shown in a classic article on the Anglo-Saxon "professions," the asser- tion of special prerogatives has been linked to the assertion of close ties to special parts of science, along with the propagation of new names for old-established occupational groups, as when "laboratory technicians" reemerge as "medical technologists" overnight.36 Such changes in job title do not imply that there has necessarily been any change at all in duties or modes of working. 3. "Engineering Science" and Its Origins in the United Kingdom In part 2, a meaning of science has been developed whereby the name is used for one thing only. Now, according to Channell, some- thing(s) called "engineering science" was (or were) invented in the conditions of the mid-19th-century United Kingdom-then of 33See, e.g., the special edition of History of Science 19 (January 1981): 1-70, on "inno- vation and continuity in science." "Layton, "Scientific Technology," pp. 64, 65, 68. Kranakis (n. 4 above, p. 38) has dis- cussed the same broad effect as "the transformation of one important branch of engi- neering from a craft to a scientific profession." 35Much of his 1976 article on "Ideologies" was about status claims. For instance, p. 690: "It is not surprising... to find [Joseph] Henry defending the legitimacy and im- portance of basic science. Henry's magnification of the importance of pure science is precisely the sort of thing we find in all professional ideologies." 36H. L. Wilensky, "The Professionalization of Everyone?" American Journal of Sociol- ogy 70 (September 1964): 137-58, esp. 138, 149. In the terms cited in pt. 1 above, such claiming can be said to be part of the myths, or the sacred tales, of the origins of human groups.</page><page sequence="11">72 Michael Fores Great Britain and Ireland-that was, as is shown below, the only Eu- ropean state of its day to have professions. What form, or forms, does "engineering science" take in the articles discussed here? Channell's "engineering science" is concurrently a body of knowl- edge (albeit one awarded a human-like "purpose") and a "form of en- gineering" (an activity).37 It has been argued already that this combination of forms indicates a totemic regard for "science." Layton's article about "ideologies" in the United States is expressly about one called "engineering science," though he has found an- other linked with "design" more informative about engineering." In that article, "engineering science" has been used to designate four different things within twelve pages. It has been used for a body of knowledge, concerned with "a broad movement.., .to re- cast engineering knowledge into a form analogous to [natural] sci- ence." It has been used for the distinguishing component of an eponymous "ideology"-"Design, engineering science, and basic sci- ence represent a hierarchy of progressive abstraction." It has been used for a distinct "discipline" and an activity too, the last named seen as "a distinctive science for engineering" that could not be "re- duced to the application of the laws of basic science to engineer- ing."99 Here it is proposed to examine two claims about "engineering sci- ence." The first one may be paraphrased: "There is something well named as 'engineering science,' which is linked to a wider 'science' rather as a Manx cat is a subspecies of cat. It can be defined as an iden- tifiable body of science tailored to the needs of technology.'"40 The sec- ond is Rankine's as reported by Channell: "If engineering science was to bring about an integration between science and technology," he wrote of Rankine's efforts, "it had to establish a framework in which scientific laws could be modified so that they could accommo- date material bodies."41 Now, it may be that engineering professors describe courses by names such as "engineering thermodynamics" in order to stress that there are differences between these subjects and those such as plain "thermodynamics" as taught to students of "physics." But the key issue here is the separation of types and examples of types. For science is our species' collected and tested knowledge of all aspects 37Channell, "Harmony," pp. 39, 40. "Layton, "Ideologies," pp. 688, 696. 39Ibid., pp. 695, 698-99, 693, 691. OThe second part of this statement is similar to Layton's conception of a separa- ble body of knowledge, as indicated at "Scientific Technology," p. 88. 41Channell, "Harmony," p. 52.</page><page sequence="12">Transformations and the Myth of "Engineering Science" 73 of what is taken to be a single universe. So artificial things such as cur- rent electricity and synthetic chemicals are described within "phys- ics" and "chemistry" respectively, although each of these is often classed as a part of "natural science." Some of what human beings know of gold/Au is recorded in the periodic table of the elements but is no more uniquely part of a special preserve of "chemistry" than it is of "physics." Similarly, the second law of thermodynamics may be thought to be "basic" for an "engineering thermodynam- ics," but it is just a part of science. If some body of knowledge called "engineering science" is taken to be identifiably separate (as Manx cats are from Persian cats), then it must be possible to throw a secure boundary of discrimination around it. But the use of "engi- neering science," like that of "applied science," is not discriminat- ing; there is no boundary that can be drawn. Diligent professors of engineering are found on the ground teaching anything they judge will be useful to their students, not just things that someone may say are "tailored to the needs of technology"-who can plumb the real motives of those who set down knowledge anyway? So, given that the Manx cat of an "engineering science" shares certain vital or- gans with the Persian cat of "physics," they are not even separate animals-let alone separate subspecies. For his account of the origins of an "engineering science," Channell has invited his readers to accept that the new construct played a part in these several things: the achievement or "the har- mony of theory and practice" for technical specialists; the genera- tion of "a second mode of technological progress.. . labeled scientific... the result of a union between theory and practice"; the "reduction to a science" of certain "essentials" of machines; and the solution of a 19th-century "cutoff controversy" about steam-engine design that "struck at the basic philosophy of the engineering profes- sion.'"42 But the propagandist tinge to this synthesis is hinted at in two statements from Layton. Toward the end of the 19th century, Robert Thurston, an American engineer who helped set up "scien- tific institutions for technology analogous to those of science" in that country, was found claiming that Rankine's work was "disap- pointing and misleading" (Thurston) and prone to "excessive abstrac- tion." Furthermore, "to date [1979], the complexities of [engineer- ing] practice continue to transcend theory" (Layton).43 About the conflicting claims in the cutoff controversy, Channell has suggested that, whereas "the expansionists argued that laws of na- 42Ibid., pp. 46, 40. 43Layton, "Ideologies," pp. 693, 694; "Scientific Technology," p. 89.</page><page sequence="13">74 Michael Fores ture could be applied to machines if only the machines were prop- erly constructed so as to fit the laws, the antiexpansionists ... [given the machines did not function as predicted] thought the failure of ex- pansion lay not in the machines but in the scientific laws. .. 44 What is germane here is not the detail of these rival claims but a conclu- sion drawn about the relationship between "theory" (usually linked with "science") and "practice" (usually what engineers and not scien- tists are assumed to do) in the context of Rankine's alleged need to overturn an "old distinction between theory and practice" through a shift in what technical work might be said to be "based" on. Both parties were "essentially right," Channell has judged. "Scientific laws could not be directly applied to the steam engine, and engine de- sign could not be based on tradition or rule of thumb." Hence the al- leged need for "a new approach to engineering" with a new "basis" in the form of new articulations and abstractions.45 What we have here is a fascinating story of propaganda, office poli- tics, and the search for something special to "profess." "Engineer- ing science grew out of the university environment.. . in Britain [the U.K]," Channell has claimed, "at a time of active interest in the professionalization of engineering and in the general reorganiza- tion of higher education along more utilitarian lines." Despite its new chair at Glasgow of 1840, engineering's development "within the university was impeded by the old distinction between theory and practice," as the first professor faced "immediate problems" such as finding a classroom. "The existing faculties regarded the theo- retical principles of technology as part of [natural] science." Rankine's predecessor had been "met with much jealousy by the Pro- fessors of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics," forcing him "to em- phasize the practical aspects of technology." But Channell has written that "practice, as taught in the university, did not appeal to most engineers since they received such training through the appren- ticeship system." Here, then, are the sources of Rankine's particu- lar solution to "harmonizing" a particular problem: "The creation of an engineering science would have to transcend the traditional categories of theory and practice," but it could not "threaten the [natural] scientists," already in post, and it had also to avoid "com- petition with the offices of civil engineers, or the workshops of mechanical engineers, or any interference with the usual practice of pupilage and apprenticeship" within what is called "the profes- "Channell, "Harmony," p. 41. 45Ibid., pp. 44, 42.

"46 Called that in Anglo-Saxony anyway. Hence the cultural specificity of the scheme.47 An important cultural difference between Anglo-Saxon and "Euro- pean" ways is specified in Hutton and Lawrence's study of German engineers: "On the mainland of Europe a new graduate with an engi- neering degree from a state university is entitled to immediate profes- sional recognition."48 Continental European bodies which are the nearest to be found to London's Institution of Civil Engineers, such as the VDI in Diisseldorf, are not qualifying associations on the Anglo-Saxon pattern.49 They do not get involved in Rankine's "pupil- age and apprenticeship" nor heavily in Anglo-Saxony's "training" contrasted with "education."50 So it can be seen that something like "the professionalization of engineering" did not happen in "Eu- rope," if only because there are no "professions" there-or even words to transmit the idea. For specialties such as engineering, university-level bodies take care of both the "education/theory" and the "training/practice." As Glover has found, "professionalism" is unique to the English-speaking parts of Europe. A survey by Sorge has shown how the different sets of institutional arrangement, be- tween "Europe" and Anglo-Saxony, have existed for at least 150 years.5' Moreover, as W. H. G. Armytage has pointed out, in Germany a string of "Technical High Schools, based on trade schools, became true engineering colleges.

Thus Bildung/formation, as the preparation of people for work, for a Beruflmitier, is expected to include aspects of what Rankine distinguished as "theory" and "practice." 51Glover (n. 47 above), p. 116; A.

"On the Continent higher technological edu- cation is not a primary responsibility of universities," Ashby found in 1966. Rather, "it is conducted in institutions sui generis, called poly- technics or Technische Hochschulen."53 This has been the French pat- tern too, from the time the Corps des Ingenieurs des Ponts et Chausdes (1-716) set up its own school (1747).54 In "Europe," then, there has been no special inducement to "pro- fess" a separate "engineering science," or a "new approach to engi- neering," or the end of an "old distinction of theory and practice," as part of a professorial attempt to grasp part of the Bildung of engi- neers. Here, then, are components of cultural specificity that make Layton's comment about a movement to "recast engineering knowl- edge into a form analogous to [natural] science" appear paro- chial. Benjamin Isherwood and Thurston, of that movement, "saw themselves, quite properly, as scientists."55 Likewise parochial is Ferguson's judgment that, because of "the temper of our age [in the United States in 1978].. . most technologists would rather be called scientists than artists."56 The nearest equivalent "European" words do not allow engineers to be classed as either, or even as "-ologists" of any sort.57 4. Empiricism and the "Magic of Art" According to Channell, the "old distinction between theory and practice" disappeared along with the demise of design "based on tra- dition or rule of thumb" and with the generation of a new "concep- tual framework" for technical work and a set of "rules which can govern each specific situation."58 There is no good evidence to indi- 53E.

Thus Musson has contrasted the use of "empirical trial-and-error" in an era that many have called "traditional" with ways of working "where science was applied." With Robinson, the same author has contrasted a "native empiricism" on one hand, a type of skill not strongly influenced by formal education, with activity having "some scientific basis," as in the case of the well-read, well-educated Scot, John Rennie, whose mode of working was not "based on a mere rule of thumb and tradition" and thus showed "a happy blend of the- ory and practice." Usher contrasted the conditions of "complete em- piricism" with those when "engineering techniques [were] fully grounded in mathematics and applied science." Schmookler con- trasted "scientific invention" with "the purely empirical." Parker has written in the Cambridge Modern History about mechanical engineer- ing that the "development of such a profession requires that both the science and the technology in a field be at a certain point of devel- opment, each having arrived there separately to a degree and by em- pirical methods, a point which makes it possible to relate theory and practice in a stream of systematic improvements."60 "In theory," at least, Musson's thesis about the decline of "tradi- tion" and the establishment of a close link between "theory" and "practice" might be equated with one about a general well-being re- sulting from the creation of Parker's "system." But is this theory about the use of theory, for which the idea of a separate "empiri- cal" mode is essential, confirmed by observation?6' If, as has been ar- 59Channell has acknowledged "helpful assistance" from Layton at the beginning of his article. 6A.

When humans have trouble in accounting for the actions of other humans, they often call these actions "magical." "Absolute poetry in motion, this young man," one commentator said of Jimmy White's play in snooker. "He has a little magic it is hard to put your finger on."62 Ac- cordingly, it is suitable here to discuss human activity in general in terms of "the magic of art," given too the multiplicity of specialist human activities in which artifacts constitute the main product from work. It was said at the outset of this article that the revised notion of a transformation of technical activity in the 19th century is illusory. In terms of the typology set out in part 2, this is a type 3 transforma- tion, being the creature of overdramatized record making, not se- curely linked with observed change. The image building for a "profession," along with propaganda for the "new" and the miscon- ceptions about "empiricism," have all contributed to the construc- tion of this illusion. Among those who go to the playhouse where these particular dramas are put on the stage, the theatricality of the record has not led to just a temporary suspension of disbelief.63 Scientists have long used metaphor to help produce their results. Take Newton's laws of motion. The last thing that inert bodies in motion need, to help them decide how to act, is the panoply of ar- ticulated "law," with its parliaments, law schools, and juries. Ac- cordingly, a metaphor is used here, being the device of an anachro- nistic, metaphoric Isaac Newton, chosen to help deal with certain "Newtonian" troubles already touched on. The historian Dampier is giving a tea party in his house in Grange Road, Cambridge, the purpose being to provide an oppor- tunity to meet Galileo for Dampier's fellow believers in totemic "science"-Galileo, with whose writings "we instinctively feel at home" and who "discovered... the true method of physical sci- ence."" Dampier is sure his invitees will, stretching hands across the oceans of time, come to Cambridge to ask Galileo where he found such a thing.

Cassirer, who has classed science as "the last step in man's mental develop- ment" and celebrates it as "the highest and most characteristic attain- ment of human culture," wants to locate "the discovery of the periodic system of the elements." In Germany perhaps? Westfall, who wants to ask Newton where he discovered his law of universal gravitation and the calculus, is upset because, having arrived late from the United States, he has missed his genius-hero who, "never at rest," has rushed off elsewhere.65 Others are meeting at the Boar's Head in nearby Newmarket. All are welcome at the meetings of the Common Society of New- market, where the discussion is always by the public about public knowledge. (Lester Piggott will talk next time on "The Art of Horseriding: Or Is It a Science?") Newton has just rushed in mutter- ing to himself about some lunatic at a meeting in Cambridge. The main CSN speaker today is Jack Tinker, a London theater critic, on "The Magic of the Theatre." An articulate person, he says that he can never find the right words to express what lies at the heart of good theatricality. And that sets Newton off again, mutter- ing more loudly now, about the human "conceit" of which Lord Bacon had written so well." God, says Newton, is the Creator, whose ways are mysterious to Man. So it is not surprising, since God has granted some limited powers of creativity to mankind, that human beings will not be able to express this ability in profane words. Tinker had been saying that the ice dancers, Torvill and Dean, had put on a very special show with their "shimmering stardom which is almost impossible to define" and the "indefinable magic" of their artistry.67 And Newton said he understood this effect entirely-his modesty sometimes disappears very quickly. So we heard his standard speech about the iniquity of the false and fool- ish would-be "Newtonians" who had rendered science sacred and tried to make Newton a demigod. Newton is sure that he did not de- velop any "scientific method" for all time. Nor did he use "the me- chanical philosophy," which implies the construction of a particular type of record, except for a particular purpose-trying to make sense of observations about the motion of bodies now called inert 65A.

So his argument in Cambridge, with Galileo and Dam- pier, was germane. Not only would any "true method of physical sci- ence" for all time not be "discoverable" for it would be an invention; but no such thing had been devised by anyone. Anyone who tries to appear "scientific" by following Newton, by copying his mode of working, had missed the point-other matters would need a different approach from that of the so-called Newtonian physics. "Take the example," Newton went on, "of the thing 20th-century English speakers like to call 'technology.' " He had read about two dif- ferent technical modes of working, called empirical and scientific, re- spectively, which suggested they must be identifiably distinct. But the manner of this naming, together with attempts made to specify these modes, had convinced Newton (who had been an inventor himself) that the whole affair was a fiction. The second mode, as described on paper to have certain articulated "bases," was un- attainable and confusing about human competence and unique- ness. The proposition of some type of "scientific" mode of acting for post-"Newtonian" humans seemed to Newton to be part of what 20th-century people call "image making," fact fused with fantasy. A "new approach to engineering based on both science and technol- ogy"68 is a myth linked with a misconception of all the named things. Only those who have learned about technical working from writings, as opposed to observing it or performing it, could accept such a claim. Malinowski then raised the subject of "the magic of art" as prac- ticed by human beings in another context. When the first Western- ers had gone to such unfamiliar places as the islands of Melanesia, they had noticed that people like the garden magicians were also the supervisors of everyday work. From this observation, many of these outsiders had assumed wrongly that individual gardeners could not distinguish between the magical and the profane parts of working. Magic is indeed invoked whenever there is thought to be a good deal of risk involved, as with the weather's influence on the germination of planted seeds. But no conflation of the magical and the profane parts of their work was ever made by the gardeners them- selves. A few of the Melanesians who had come with Malinowski laughed at this; for, even though they have heard it often, they still find this Western misconception very amusing. If there had been such a confusion, Malinowski went on, if the Mel- anesian gardeners had compounded in their minds aspects of the do- 68Channell, "Harmony," p. 42.</page><page sequence="20">Transformations and the Myth of "Engineering Science" 81 mains of the sacred and the profane, they would perhaps have invoked the baloma, their ancestors changed in form to become sa- cred spirits, to do the planting and the raking for them. But they do not expect magic to do their work for them in that manner. They are not idlers, dreaming that seeds might plant themselves in some type of mystical transformation.69 Newton had the last word as usual. He said he believed that Mela- nesian gardeners must understand human activity better than his own would-be followers, the 20th-century Western professors. If these last-named people had thought as much about God as they had about Newton, they would have realized that human activity is constrained to be continuingly empirical. Man specializes in what is inherently risky. The machines, and the organizational arrange- ments mankind has invented, do what is more ruly, describable, and predictable. In seeking to make technical activity appear "law"- ful in some way, its discussants have been found effectively robbing man of his special competence. Occult magic may be "governed" by articulable "laws," as Malinowski has said; but it is incorrect to try to model human activity in the same way. Such is the folly of a leg- acy that has turned science into a sacred thing and Newton into a prophet. 69Malinowski (n. 1 above), pp. 28-31, 149-54.</page></plain_text>
