Oral folklore So as not to expose such minds to indecent sub- jects, we will say about the chicken's reproduc- tion what we fear to say about man's. Horenz Heister, Compendium Anatomicum (Pinto-Correia 229) I. Among the stories devoted to the riddle of the chicken and the egg' is a long-forgotten tale by the Russian narodnik writer Gleb Uspensky (1843- 1902) which deserves to be read and appreciated.2 When "Parovoi tsyple- nok" [An incubator chicken, 1888] first appeared, it received high praise from Leo Tolstoy, who liked it so much that he read it aloud to family and guests.3 It was the masterful structure of the story that Tolstoy purportedly enjoyed most. Its subtitle was "A Story to be Published Only During Christmas," and part of its charm for Tolstoy was the story's seductive quaintness and lighthearted humor.4 In view of the story's reception by the great master of Russian literature, I would like to give it a reading here which will expose not only the humorous side of the narrative, but also the seriousness of its subject matter.5 In my reading the (incubator) chicken problematics are viewed as Uspensky's, albeit ironic, attempt to contribute to the subject of the "accursed questions" of Russian literature, stated by Dostoevsky's most metaphysical hero Ivan as: "Is there God, is there immortality?" (14: 213). The pastiche-like subtitle of Uspensky's quasi- Christmas tale is not only a marker of the mischievousness of a story in which uneducated peasants grapple with philosophical paradoxes; it is also an attempt by the populist writer to conceal his modest attempt at theoriz- ing on the existence of the soul and the afterlife, notions challenged by the biological sciences and the technologies of his day. The story that emerges in my reading is seen to be worthy of Tolstoy's attention not just for the SEEJ, Vol. 47, No. 2 (2003): p. 211-p. 226 211</page><page sequence="2">212 Slavic and East European Journal mastery of its form, but also for the elegant subtlety with which it expresses philosophical problematics. The core problematic concerns one of the ma- jor philosophical dualisms- the body and the soul -and is linked to ques- tions of human/animal sexuality and procreation. The chicken problem forms a thematic link with a quasi-scientific array of questions on the origins of life, generation, and the bond between a mother and an embryo. In what follows I demonstrate how Uspensky's story attempts to solve the cluster of riddles surrounding creation and generation by building a parallel between a mother and her child and a chicken and her egg. My reading is underpinned by work in the emerging field of animal studies where scholars from various disciplines look at the representation of animals in diverse cultures (Ham and Senior; Rothfels). Within western Christian tradition animals have been treated as inferior others (Deleuze). These ideas were shaped by Church Fathers (Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, John Chry- sostom) who, among other topics, considered the relationship between humans and animals and decided that the two had nothing in common (Salisbury). Animals had no souls; could not have an afterlife; they existed to serve humans. With the advent of the Scientific Revolution the borders between animals and humans narrowed, but at the same time the triumph of Darwinism deprived both animals and humans of souls, and further established a taxonomy in which animals were inferior to humans. On the hierarchical scale men-women-children-animals, animals occupy the most subaltern place. As the boundaries between humans and animals became blurred, marginalized groups slipped below the human boundary. Uspen- sky's story challenges all these assumptions and is structured on the parallel- ism between humans and animals. As in many of Uspensky's stories that take the form of ocherki, describing the events of peasant life as witnessed by him during his travels through rural Russia, the plot of the "Parovoi tsyplenok" centers around an episode at a railway station. However, this story is identified by Uspensky as somewhat exceptional; he states at the outset that, while it ought to be published during "sviatki [Christmas holidays]," it is nevertheless more a "stateika [short article]" than a "rasskaz [story]" (597). This serves as a strategy for smug- gling in scientific problematics under the concealment of the unreal and fantastic, and the presentation of serious matters in the guise of the humor- ous and uncanny. This concealment betrays Uspensky's shyness in writing about the scientific and philosophical matters of generation and procreation. By insisting that the story be read on Christmas Eve, Uspensky's tactic is to create a shifting dynamic between the real and unreal aspects of the story - to treat its subject matter both with belief and with disbelief.6 The story then relates how Uspensky-the-narrator overhears a conversa- tion between peasants about a tragic occurrence which had taken place earlier that day. The owner of the road house, whom all of the group knew</page><page sequence="3">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 213 personally, had thrown himself under a train and been killed on the spot. Significantly for the awkwardness of the subject matter, the conversation takes place in the total darkness of night, and neither the faces nor the figures of the storytellers can be made out; they are merely "dark shadows" and silhouettes (598). In discussing the dead man's act of despair, the peasants try to reach an understanding, not so much of his motives, but rather of the consequences and implications of the sacrilegious and sinful act of suicide itself. While they all know that the unfortunate kabatchik was driven to drink by his unhappy marriage, they express equal concern about the lost soul of the poor sinner. With the staunch logic of simple reasoning they come to the sensible conclusion that there are many women in the world but only one soul for each of us, and it is for this soul that one will be held responsible before God at the Last Judgement. As they are grieving over the lost soul of the unfortunate suicide victim, the young and cheerful station master scoffs at the very idea of an afterlife. At this moment an- other peasant enters the conversation, and in a lengthy monologue tells the tale of his conversion from a careless "wooden block [dubovaia koloda]" (600) to an enlightened human being. His state of divine revelation was achieved, paradoxically, through his involvement in the new technologies of fish and chicken farming. In a reversal of atheist logic, science is not the means by which God is shown not to exist, rather God reveals himself to the peasant via science. What initially seems to be a nonsensical collection of unrelated terms and concepts, "God, soul, fish job, chicken job" (600), acquires meaning as the peasant-philosopher reflects further on the topic of the soul. The peasant-philosopher astounds his interlocutors by sharing his discov- ery of the "chicken soul [kurinaia dusha]" (601). His clever hearers object to his conclusion, saying that there can only be a Christian soul, and in the sound scholastic tradition of argumentation they refer to the Scriptures where there is no mention of the "chicken soul." To convince his sceptical opponents and make his point, the chicken-defender employs the methods of parallelism and analogy. As a master orator he asks his audience a set of rhetorical questions: "Answer me, why did the kabatchik throw himself under the train?" and having received the expected answer - "because of the woman" -he asks the tricky question: "And now, would you care to explain this: Which part of his body was cut by the wheel?" (602). On being told that the victim was cut through his stomach to his back, the philoso- pher develops his point about the locus of the "sorrow [ogorchenie]" (602), the condition which had led the victim to suicide. Impatiently, he rejects the explanation that it was the stomach which was cut by the train because it was the seat of the "sorrow." The folk are obviously influenced by the linguistic association of "zhivot" with "zhizn'"7 in their identification of the latter (the seat of life) with zhivot (the locus of the emotions). Instead, the</page><page sequence="4">214 Slavic and East European Journal philosopher proposes an interpretation according to which the place of sorrow was situated between the stomach and the back. This place he then identifies as the seat of the soul: "It is the soul that ached and the soul that perished under the train" (603). Having identified the seat of the soul, the peasant proves its existence with reference to its ability to ache. Soul and conscience (sovest', 605) in this interpretation are, at the same time, both transcendental and physical entities, which are not situated in the "stomach," the "bones," or the "ribs" (603), but are, however, somewhere in the area of the chest. The paradox of this metaphysical physiology consists in the soul's being physical and yet capable of emanation, capable of being physically destroyed and yet also able to survive destruction. But this paradox does not perturb the peasant- philosopher, who clearly does not even see it as a paradox, and having proven the existence of the soul per se, he turns to demonstrating the existence of an animal soul -the "chicken soul" (604). If the seat of the human soul is the part of the body in which ancient Greek philosophers located the pneuma, then, in the peasant-philosopher's microcosm, the seat of the chicken soul is linked to the chicken's capacity to procreate. The peasant first came to believe in the existence of the chicken soul when he observed that peasant women did not buy incubator chickens. These highly practical women had noticed that incubator chick- ens did not reproduce. The clever kuriatnik then noticed that farm fish also do not reproduce, and he came to the conclusion that "artificially" bred animals do not have souls. They function by activation of hot vapor ("parom deistvuiut," 604) but do not have descendants: "A potomstva netu!" (604). These "machine chickens" (604) are depicted as not unlike Cartesian creatures with an embedded dualism between the body and the soul: the body is animated by the spirit, and without this force which activates the body, the body remains simply a machine, an automaton. As recent commentators on body politics have observed, Rene Descartes (1596-1650) not only deprived the body of the soul (as had been done already by Greek philosophy going back to Plato), but he accomplished the separation of the soul from nature. Descartes distinguished two kinds of substances: a thinking substance, the soul, and an extended substance, the body.8 While the body functions by the laws of nature, the mind and soul have no place in the natural world. In the peasant's philosophical/physiolog- ical investigation, real and artificial creatures differ from each other in that, though both are born of a female bird, they receive warmth from two quite different sources: one from the warm feathers of its mother, the other from electricity. While the first type of chickens are real and have souls because they can procreate, the second group are soul-less, brought to life by electricity and artificially maintained temperatures. Being without a soul, these birds cannot give further life.</page><page sequence="5">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 215 Our Russian peasant-philosopher has many predecessors in this matter of chicken procreation. In the seminal work on the history of generation, The Ovary of Eve (1997), Clara Pinto-Correia shows that Aristotle (384- 322 B.C.) had systematically cracked open chicken eggs and registered their development during a three-week period. In his Generation of Ani- mals he speculated as to what extent the hen's egg is alive if it is infertile. As to the practice of artificially incubating eggs, the ancient Egyptians knew how to do this by burying them in manure. The Egyptians could perform artificial incubation with precision around 1400 B.C., and this was not matched in the West until the nineteenth century. The Egyptians also believed that ruh, or "life," entered the egg on the eleventh day of incuba- tion. During the time of the Scientific Revolution, experiments with hen eggs as a means of studying the development of the chicken were widely performed. On the basis of these studies conclusions were drawn on the nature of generation. The idea of encasement of life in an egg, known as preformation, did not contradict the Christian notion of the divine will. Preformationists did not challenge the biblical Creation, and believed that all human history had been originally encased inside the ovary of Eve and/ or Adam's seed. In Gulliver's Travels (1726) Jonathan Swift uses eggs as a means to parody the absurdity of dogmatism. The novel contains a well-known account of the fierce disagreements between two factions arguing over which end of an egg is the correct one to break before eating the egg - a story which at the same time functions within the broader context of a parody on extremes of dogma- tism and scientific experiments. In his polemical treatment of the scientific excesses of his time, Swift held that God's intervention was necessary for any act of the animal world. Likewise, Uspensky's peasant philosopher argues that in order to procreate, chickens have to have a soul, since procre- ation is a sacred and blessed activity. While Swift's hero, in an encounter with Descartes (brought to life through an act of necromancy, the very possibility of which the philosopher of reason would deny), is given the opportunity to expose the limitations of Cartesian natural philosophy, our peasant-philosopher operates in the evolutionist post-Darwinian realia.9 And he is in polemics with the prevailing beliefs of his time which saw the notion of evolution triumph over that of divine creation. He draws his knowledge not from scientific sources, but from an acute understanding of the Scriptures, the authoritative source to which his fellow peasant conversa- tionalists also refer. In addition, this wordly-wise philosopher calls on an array of folk beliefs which, in Dostoevsky's characterization of the period, formed a peculiar combination with learned and complex ideas that had found their way "onto the streets."10 The peasant believes that the hen influences her offspring not only at the time of conception but also during the incubation period: "And all her</page><page sequence="6">216 Slavic and East European Journal thoughts travel from her soul into the young chicken's soul, and the chick absorbs her thoughts and concerns [...]" (606). He draws a parallel be- tween this and the mystical physiological link which exists between a hu- man mother and her child. The genetically inherited features are supple- mented by characteristics acquired during gestation which in turn become biologically transferable. The peasant repeats a common superstition about the origin of birthmarks, which are said to result when a pregnant woman is shocked at the sight of a fire and then touches her skin: Birthmarks appear in the same place on the child's body where the woman touched herself. The link between the mother and her child is both biological and mystical. To parallel this link between a human fetus and mother, the peasant tells how hens' fantasies imprint on the chicken embryo. That there are more cocks born than hens is explained by the fact that hen mothers dream a lot about their male counterparts. Uspensky's peasant is here espousing a preformationist view. As has been shown by Pinto-Correia, the egg, and also the ovary, have been considered since antiquity to be the seat of encasement wherein the organism fully develops into the shape as it was planned by the Creator.11 Parallel to this view, and somewhat paradoxi- cally, there existed among scientists a view which survived well into the nineteenth century (and to the present day in popular culture) that the mother's sensations during pregnancy make a physical imprint on the fetus. Uspensky's example of birthmarks is especially telling, as this belief was used by scientists and philosophers alike to illustrate the power of maternal impressions over the formation of the embryo. Known in the history of science as telegony, the theory of "maternal impression" was called on to explain aberrations and deformities, including the formation of monsters. It placed a taxing burden on women, whose impressionable nature was held responsible for the process of generation going wrong. In the nineteenth century, scientific experiments on the modification of embryo development were conducted on chicken eggs, including highly unethical teratogenic work on the production of monsters. Some respected scientists of the Academie Fran9aise had hoped to work on human embryos that develop inside the placenta, but were forced to limit their experiments to chicken embryos. It is documented that such work by naturalists earned the high praise of Charles Darwin.12 Uspensky's peasant considers the influence which the mother has over her embryo to be good. Such a positive treatment of mothers is linked to the peasant's religious beliefs, which recognize the ovary/egg as the seat of a God-created organism with a soul. Hence the anti-Darwinian elements of the peasant's thinking manifest themselves not only in his polemics against experimentation with new life, but also in his insistence that supernatural forces exist. It is these forces that are responsible for providing animals and humans with souls, where the mother functions as the agent of soul trans-</page><page sequence="7">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 217 fer. Uspensky's peasant thus establishes a strict analogy between the hu- man and animal organisms, and both stand as physical bodies that have undeniable links with the Creator. And in the same way that the Creator of Genesis and Leviticus is concerned with the procreationary functions of human and animal bodies which are in a protective covenant with Him, so Uspensky's philosopher treats sexuality and procreation with the utmost seriousness. After all, it was the Creator's domain to make sure that all his creatures, both the humans and the animals who came out of Noah's Ark, are guaranteed fecundity: "Be fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it" (Gen 9:7).13 II. In a number of his stories, Uspensky expresses his interest in human sexuality-and specifically women's-in his theme concerning the fate of unwanted children. In his most well known story, "Vypriamila" [She straightened out, 1885], he describes his visit to the Paris catacombs where he saw many aborted fetuses passing through the city's sewerage system. In the story "'Pinzhak' i chort" ['Jacket' and the devil, 1885] he depicts a situation of sexual incompatibility which is the result of a young peasant man (who wears a city "pinzhak") having strayed from the peasant way of life, with its partriarchal codes of sexual behavior, and having had premari- tal sexual experiences. He and his young bride are both affected by a shrieking fit on their wedding night. In Uspensky's view, peasant sexuality was appropriately channeled only through religious codes and practices; sex was not for pleasure but only for procreation. While the villagers in his story suspect that the devil himself was involved in the possession of the newlyweds, there is also a witch-like female character, Afimia, who is suspected of casting an evil spell over the couple. She herself is implicated in devious and sinister deeds connected with infanticide: reporting a young servant woman for drowning newborn infants and, at the same time, regu- larly drowning and strangling her own illegitimate children. Every spring corpses of murdered infants are washed ashore in this fictional village, some of which are the (aborted) children of the evil Afimia herself. Uspensky supports the view of the God-given nature of human life. In his story, Afimia goes through an experience of clinical death during which she visits God's celestial domain, where a bearded old man shows Afimia little angels whom she recognizes as the very same infants who were both borne and murdered by her. In a truly Dantean excursion through hell, the old man also reveals to the highly sinful woman scenes of the punishment and torture inflicted by God upon women who have killed their infants. The old man warns Afimia that she has to stop her crimes if she wants to save her soul. Uspensky's reputation as a narodnik who exposed society's social ills has</page><page sequence="8">218 Slavic and East European Journal hampered the interpretation of the themes of abortion and infanticide in his texts. These topics were viewed as themes of pressing legal, social and political value; missed was the religious and mystical underpinning of his humanitarian concern with the ills of the society. Abortion and infanticide were of interest to Uspensky not only as unfortunate practices among the lower classes-the peasants, prostitutes and destitute young women se- duced in the big cities- but of equal importance to him were the mystical aspects of this crime against the human soul. Thus, what a generic philoso- pher from the chicken farm says in his "referat [treatise]" (597, 607) on the nature of fish, chicken and children as "tvar' Bozhiia [God's creatures]" (605) is of utmost importance to Uspensky himself. His own innermost thoughts are concealed in the speech of a simple but reflective peasant, thoughts which he should be quite critical of as an enlightened narodnik. The so-called superstitions of simple folk are the target of mild ridicule but at the same time constitute the very essence of the author's unspoken beliefs. Uspensky came from a seminarian background; on both sides of his family men were priests, and his father received an education in a seminary. While it was an accepted view among the populists that Uspensky showed no interest in religious matters during his writing career (Mikhailovsky), he was gripped by a religious mania during the period of his mental illness - from 1891 until his death. Significant for my argument here is his psychia- trist Dr. Boris Sinani's report that Uspensky "understands God pantheis- tically and links him with love and infinity, which he understands either as attributes or synonyms [of God]" (Mikhailovsky, cv). While in the clinic, Uspensky became a vegetarian and a special diet had to be devised for him. He maintained that all living matter had soul, and refused to eat flesh or eggs. He even refused to eat apples that had been picked, believing that only those that have fallen to the ground, and are thus no longer connected to the soul of the tree, should be eaten. The extent to which the peasant-philosopher is Uspensky's secret alter- ego becomes more apparent when the kuriatnik elaborates on the God- given nature of the chicken's maternal instincts. He relates a somewhat anthropomorphic story about hen mothers: that once they are seated upon their egg(s), they stay there in an act of self-sacrifice and suffering until they have physical pain in their bellies. They lose their feathers, lose their beauty, they dream of their roosters and of the entertainment of which they are deprived, but they nevertheless do not break the mystical link that is established between themselves and their chick(s). Exactly the same story occurs in Uspensky's first-person narration in "'Pinzhak' i chort," where the behavior of hens toward their egg(s) illustrates the special character of motherhood. Uspensky's choice of words here is the same as that of his kuriatnik in "Parovoi tsyplenok": due to extended sitting on the eggs, the hens lose their beautiful feathers on their sore stomachs; they dream of</page><page sequence="9">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 219 their roosters and missed entertainment, but their determination is unshak- able. Uspensky dismisses the usual ironic and derogative treatment of instinct, wherein the power of the human mind is privileged over the instinc- tual impulses of animals -for Uspensky there is no differentiation in the animal world, and a human and an animal for him fall into the sphere which he courageously and affirmatively nominates as "zoological" (295). In the zoological connections between hen and chick and between husbands and wives in a peasant family he sees the very center of a great mystery: while our peasant philosopher in "Parovoi tsyplenok" does not know the fancy words to denote the notion of instinct, he nevertheless expresses in a differ- ent form the very same ideas which Uspensky-the-narrator expresses in the learned language of high culture in the chicken and egg(s) topos: Begb TO, qTO Ha3bIBaeTCS ,,KpeCTbJHCTBOM", TO eCTb Becb CTpOf TpylOBOf KpeCTbHHCKOH &gt;KH3HH, BegJb OH BeCb HaXOgJHTCS B IIOJIHOf 3aBHCHMOCTH OT TaRHbI, OT 3TOrO HeBegOMorO, oTO jlaxe KyPHUIy npHrBOxaaeT K aiXuy.

(295) What is called "the peasant way," that is, the whole structure of peasant working life, is in fact entirely dependent on something unknown, on this mysterious factor that even keeps a chicken pinned to its egg. No matter how clever the chicken may be, it will continue to sit on the egg even until it dies of hunger, and the motive and reason for this is unknown. And this unknown factor penetrates the whole structure of peasant life, starting with the land, the seed and the rain, and the wind, expressing itself in success, in failure, in animal and human sickness. At the heart of all this there lies not an idea worked out deliberately, but a mystery unknown to anyone, by which one can live only if one's instinctive feeling for it is pure and untainted. Uspensky speaks of the special link between a peasant man and his wife as "zoologicheskaia bezukoriznennost'," a zoological perfection that is God- given in humans, animals, plants and all the elements of nature. This pantheistic universe appears to be monistic, the creation of one God who is present in all the manifestations of nature. This anti-Cartesian, Spinozan monistic view of the world does not build hierarchies; it does not privilege the human substance over that of an animal, nor a grain over a stone.14 Neither does it problematize whether the chicken or the egg comes first. Uspensky's insistence on the commonality in both humans and animals of the substance called by our peasant-philosopher "kurinaia dusha [chicken soul]" echoes the views of Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), the Spinozan psy- chologist and physiologist. A contemporary of Uspensky's, his work on animal and human souls, translated into Russian as Dushi cheloveka i zhivotnykh, was well known in Russia particularly in the 1880s in connec- tion with his experiments in psychology.15 Uspensky wrote his story of the</page><page sequence="10">220 Slavic and East European Journal chicken soul at the time of the polemics surrounding Nikolai Danilevsky's (1822-1885) anti-evolutionist book, Darwinism [1885, 1887], which chal- lenged the understanding that organic matter is created by mechanical forces alone.16 As to parallels between animals and humans, The Expres- sion of the Emotions in Man and Animals [1872] by Darwin himself, which was a bestseller in Europe and Russia when it appeared, scrupulously enumerates examples of the similarities between humans and other ani- mals.17 On the subject of the role of hen-mothers in the life of their young chicks, Darwin notes that incubator chickens have to be taught by people to pick up small particles of food by means of the sound of a hen pecking, which they imitate. A proponent of the view that instincts are purely bio- logical and congenital in nature, he nevertheless reveals in this example that chicks nurtured artifically are at least initially somewhat impaired in the development of their instincts compared to their more fortunate "moth- ered" counterparts.18 A further case in point is that Uspensky's image of a mysterious current which flows between a hen and her eggs is remarkably compatible with the language of the monist Spinozan philosopher most contemporary to us - Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995), who uses literature both as his reference and his source.19 For Deleuze, the connections of desire transcend borders and barriers and can be established not only between persons, but also between a person and organic or even inorganic objects. In these connections the "dispersion of the subject" (Scherer 175) takes place, the unselfish act that Uspensky and his peasant philosopher see as soul-transmitting currents. Such states of contact Deleuze calls states of becoming: becoming-animal and becoming-plant are among them. The relationship between a chicken and her egg(s), which is achieved through a contact in surfaces, transforms life from a subject into an object, and can be viewed as a life-affirming act of becoming: becoming-mother, becoming-a-child.20 In both of his stories discussed here, Uspensky refers to a practice used by villagers to deal with a hen that has wandered away from her egg. In such instances, peasant women gave a piece of bread soaked in vodka to the strayed hen in order to sedate her, and then put her back on her egg. Once the hen's body touches the egg a mysterious force or current was said to create an inseparable bond between them: "I v iaitso idet teplo i iz iaitsa idet v nee [and into the egg goes warmth and from the egg it goes into her]" (606). It is this force which is identified by the peasant-philosopher in "Parovoi tsyplenok" as a soul, and by Uspensky-the-narrator in "'Pinzhak' i chort" as a more opaque "nevedomaia taina [unknown mystery]" (295). In Deleuzean terms this current can be identified as a molecular flow between surfaces which creates "assemblages." For both Uspensky and the kuriatnik, zoologi- cal links between organisms are not simply a matter of the blind impulse of perishable flesh towards flesh; the flesh is one with the spirit, and the relation-</page><page sequence="11">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 221 ship between mother and offspring among humans and animals (fish and birds), and between husband and wife among people, is driven by a soul not separated from the zoological, but part of its essence. Both animals and people are, in the words of the kuriatnik, "tvari Bozhii" (605). The peasant- philosopher and Uspensky clearly know the very essence of what is ex- pressed by the eloquent author of Genesis: "So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth"' (Gen 1:20-23). Both Uspensky and the peasant-philosopher use the logic of analogy and parallel to argue for a monolithic continuum between the Cre- ator and his creation - God's love for his creatures expressed in the gift of proliferation and propagation. Uspensky's peasants argue by parallel and analogy, a method identified recently by Mary Douglas (1999) in her discus- sion of the model of Leviticus, as a successful way of reasoning juxtaposed to the discursive argumentation of European culture. The analogical method is capable of building explanatory models which are equally effective for both scientific and literary analysis. Such models based on analogy are useful in mythopoetic and scientific discourses and should not be discriminated against as "un-scientific" (Douglas 17). The anxiety around the threat of scientific interference in matters of procreation is apparent in the peasant's story and reflects Uspensky's own uneasiness about the effects of technological advances on the beginnings of new life.21 On the one hand, while his texts are concerned with the problems of abortion and infanticide, with the fate of unwanted and illegitimately born children, and with the statistics regarding orphanages, on the other hand they do not address the issues of contraception and the prevention of pregnancy. His moral concerns for the fate of unwanted children are ex- pressed in his own voice as narrator in many of his ocherki, but his mystical views on sexuality and procreation are often disguised by being attributed to uneducated speakers from among the simple folk. Thus in his piece "Tru- dami ruk svoikh" [By the labor of one's own hands, 1884] Uspensky makes use of the work of the sectarian peasant Timofei Bondarev (1820-1898), who was exiled for life to Siberia for joining a sect of judaizers (subbotniki). Uspensky came across Bondarev's manuscript "Trudoliubie ili torzhestvo zemledel'tsa" [Love of work or the triumph of a farmer] in the archives of the Minusinsk Museum, where it had been sent by the peasant himself. Uspensky explains that Bondarev considered his manuscript to be a rarity because it exposes one of the most carefully hidden secrets of all: how to live an honest and religious life. Speaking apparently as a disseminator of Bonda- rev's views, Uspensky relates that ethical and godly conduct is to be found mainly in two ways of living: giving birth to children and working the land to</page><page sequence="12">222 Slavic and East European Journal maintain the family through hard work. In this ocherk Uspensky quotes extensively from parts of Bondarev's manuscript where the peasant cites the book of Genesis on procreation as a God-given command. Bondarev claims that these key secrets to a godly life have been thoroughly hidden not only from the Russian people but also from the rest of the world - part of a "conspiracy" by the clerics to divert people from original Hebrew sources. Uspensky's ocherk made a deep impression on Leo Tolstoy, who corre- sponded with Bondarev on this subject.22 Uspensky's anti-scientific stance in matters of sexuality/procreation is manifested in the jocular mode in which the story "Parovoi tsyplenok" ends. Once the kuriatnik-philosopher has finished his "referat" (597) on the chicken soul, another peasant relates an incident which he intends as a dialogic continuation of the theme under discussion -the interference of science in the matter of animal bodies. The event is presented as something hard to believe yet true. He claims to have seen with his own eyes a coachman in St. Petersburg who had a clock installed into his rear, the reason given for this remarkable innovation being the busy lifestyle of the coachman's employer, who measured time in seconds. This living body sculpture epitomizes the modern city lifestyle and the encroachment of technologies into the most intimate parts of the body. Such a truly inge- nious installation - a mechanical device activating the body - can be inter- preted as symbolizing not only the new life and the new body but also a Cartesian creature whose body is spiritless matter requiring activation by means of a separate entity. The male driver sits on the round object with the ticking heart-like mechanism in it in the way a hen sits on her egg(s). The peasant's parable of the chicken and egg parallels the dynamics of the body-spirit remarkably well: the coachman's body, after all, also produces and releases energy which, in turn, can activate the mechanism of the clock. The relationship between the chicken and egg and between the coachman and the clock is reciprocal, as is the phenomenological relation- ship between the body and the soul/mind (Damasio). The parable also establishes a certain, albeit ironic, gender balance: if a female can activate an egg, a male can activate an inorganic object. The irony of course is that the object that the man activates has a self-functioning mechanism embod- ied in it and does not need activation by heat, or par. Pondering the admiration that Leo Tolstoy felt for Uspensky's story, we should perhaps consider, quite apart from the apparent courageous at- tempt by a Russian muzhik to tackle the problem related to the "great chicken and egg debate," the fine balance of humor and seriousness with which the story treats problems at the heart of the Russian classical canon23; a peasant, tormented by love, who commits suicide in the mode of Anna Karenina; talk of theological sin, perished souls, and the afterlife</page><page sequence="13">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 223 of the suicide victim; the monism which unites animals and humans; Tolstoy's personal vegetarianism as a result of his identification with ani- mals and his own monist quest; an anti-positivist mistrust in mechanistic scientific investigation; and the peasant conversationalists who pose and solve the "accursed questions" of life in a way typical of gatherings of Dostoevsky's eschatologically-thinking elite Russian boys. Core issues of Russian high culture are placed here in the peasant microcosm. Matters are ironically treated and yet seriously considered by the narodnik narra- tor whose peasant-philosophers engage in theorizing and employ oratori- cal devices and rhetorical analogies as successfully as is done in the logo- centric modes of professional philosophical discourse (Douglas). While Swift parodied Descartes and the Western dualist philosophical tradition, and made horses philosophize in a more reasoned way than people, Uspensky's short Christmas tale shows that the very object of Russian serious thought - the peasant - can also think, feel and philosophize. Per- haps Tolstoy liked the story's moral that one does not have to be a learned barin to be preoccupied with the riddle of body and soul, creation and generation. Uspensky's mastery of depicting peasant speech was much admired by his readers and fellow populists alike, who treasured his abil- ity to capture the essence of the humor as well as the lexical and syntactic features of peasant language. The authenticity of the language in this story no doubt also had a special appeal to Tolstoy, who had a firsthand knowledge of peasant speech. Remembering the light-hearted tone of the story, I would like to con- clude this essay on a more humorous note. There is one important culture- specific matter where Uspensky's position on the problematics of the chicken as it relates to body politics remains to be clarified. If, as we have learned, a peasant and a serf are human and have a soul, and if a chicken has a soul too, then how do we decipher the paradox inherent in one Russian proverb which embodies another product of hierarchical dualist thinking: that of the man-woman taxonomy? Here I have in mind the proverb which puts women and chicken into the subaltern category of something which lacks, and does not fit either the genera of animals or the human species: "Kuritsa ne ptitsa, zhenshchina ne chelovek [A chicken is not a bird, a woman is not a human]." Uspensky's thoughts on this matter are found in his personal correspondence. In his letters to his future wife [1869] he affectionately addresses her as "tsypa moia" (204), "tsyplenok," "tsypin'ka" (211) and "tsyplenochek khoroshii moi" (212) [my chick, chickie, chickadee, my beautiful little chicken].24 In the spirit of peace and conciliation evoked by the reading of this Christmas tale, it comes as a relief to find out that, for Uspensky, a woman was not only a "chelovek,"25 but also a chicken.</page><page sequence="14">224 Slavic and East European Journal NOTES 1 In his Postmodernist work "Nosy," Anatoly Korolev maintains that the famous debate about which came first, the chicken or the egg, was resolved only with the advent of x-ray technology, when zoologist John Bradfield and roentgenologist John Fairfax produced an x-ray of a chicken embryo inside an egg in 1946. See Korolev (265-315, esp. 291). Jonathan Swift's well-known parody in Gulliver's Travels of the preoccupation of mem- bers of the Royal Society with certain absurd experiments is a major example of the egg problematics in literature. In Russian folk tradition the tales "Kurochka riaba" and "Chudesnaia kuritsa" illustrate folk aspirations for possession of a chicken that would lay golden eggs or eggs made of precious stones. See Afanas'ev 1: 83-85, 2: 55-59. 2 Scholarship on Gleb Uspensky remains extremely scant. Sokolov (1968), Prutskov (1972), and Bel'chikov (1979) all interpret Uspensky in the tradition of critical realism, and the story "Parovoi tsyplenok" is not given a separate reading in any of these works. The most recent work is Mondry 1997. 3 Uspenskii 7: 597-607. All quotations in this paper are from this edition. Translations are mine. 4 See P. I. Biriukov's letter (Uspenskii 7: 659). 5 Among the stories that take the chicken theme as a serious subject is a famous nineteenth-century political allegory about the Decembrists and Masons in the Russia of Nicholas I, Anton Pogorelsky's "Chernaia kuritsa" [1829]; see Hellman. 6 On the Christmas story in the Russian literary tradition, see Fridlender, also Dushech- kina and Baran. 7 Additionally, the litany phrase "i ves' zhivot nash Khristu Bogu predadim," from the Russian Orthodox liturgy, puts the old Russian word for "life" before churchgoers on a regular basis. 8 For a discussion of Descartes's dualism and Western somatophobia, see Grosz. 9 Uspensky wrote this story in 1888 when controversy over Darwin's evolutionist views was at its height in the Russian journals, with Professor K. Timiriazev, N. Strakhov, and V. Rozanov responding to N. Danilevsky's anti-Darwinist book Darwinism (1885, and post- humously 1887). Timiriazev attacked Danilevsky's allegation that Darwin had failed to explain the creation of organic matter and also his views on embryology. See "Pis'ma N. N. Strakhova k V. V. Rozanovu" (esp. 29). 10 Dostoevsky's famous view about ideas which have fallen onto the streets is found in his Diary of a Writer and refers to the inevitable process whereby an intellectual thought is appropriated by the masses in a simplified, distorted, and dangerous form (1980, 21: 125- 36). 11 On the history of discourse on the egg, see Pinto-Correia. 12 On Camille Dareste's ambitions in the 1860s to found laboratories which would create monsters by tampering with embryos, see Huet. 13 On God's covenant with Israel and animals, see Douglas 134-75. 14 On the relevance of Spinozan monism to issues of body politics, see Grosz. 15 Uspensky uses the terms "kurinaia dusha" and "kurinaia psikhologiia" (7: 597). Russian psychiatrist V. F. Chizh popularized Wundt's teachings in Russian journals in the 1880s. On Wundt in turn-of-the-century Russia, see Sirotkina. 16 The debate was conducted by Nikolai Strakhov and Professor Kliment Timiriazev, among others, in the Russkii vestnik and Russkaia mysl'. See endnote 9. 17 Darwin's book has not been popular among anthropologists in the twentieth century due to its universalist claim that biology, rather than culture, determines the expression of emotions. See Ekman.</page><page sequence="15">What's in an "(Incubator) Chicken"? 225 18 Darwin describes the hen-mother's protective instinct and its manifestation as "she spreads out her wings, raises her tail, and ruffles all her feathers" (101). 19 See Deleuze (225-30). On the main concepts in Deleuze's philosophy see Scherer (173- 78). 20 The Deleuzean monist approach can be found in Pelevin's Postmodernist text, "Zat- vornik i shestipalyi" (1998), which treats the topic of chicken souls. In this story, factory chickens are endowed with souls and escape the factory in a quest to meet the real God. 21 Here Mikhail Bulgakov's "Rokovye iaitsa" [The Fateful Eggs, 1925] must be mentioned. It addresses the issue of science interfering with the God-given world order and violating ethical and moral imperatives. In it the chicken and eggs become an emblem of old- ordered Russia, while the imported eggs which involve the use of scientific methods of development hatch into reptiles which threaten to destory Russia itself. 22 See "Primechaniia" to "Trudami ruk svoikh" in Uspenskii, 6: 166-67, 399-403. 23 It is interesting to note that the master of Postmodernist parody, Anatoly Korolev, in his collage "Nosy" (2000) connects the hidden metaphysical undertones of Gogol's trope of the missing nose with the phenomenon of the egg turning in a hen's body before it emerges. An egg comes out of a bird's body broad end first, and Korolev reads this as a marker of the creature's resentment at being delivered into the world and its preference for remaining in a state of closeness to the almighty Creator. 24 Uspenskii, "A. V. Baraevoi," 9: 204-12. 25 Uspensky refers to the statue of Venus of Milo in "Vypriamilia" as a "chelovek" to describe her human, rather than feminine, qualities (Mondry 415-30).
