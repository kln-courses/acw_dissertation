SHANKER, and TALBOT J. TAYLOR. New York &amp; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Pp. x, 244. Reviewed by ROBBINS BURLING, University of Michigan Several decades of disappointing attempts to teach human language to apes have taught lin- guists to be skeptical, but we should put our doubts on hold long enough to take a serious look at the famous Kanzi and the other bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees) that have been studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues at the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Georgia. This book is an always forthright and sometimes eloquent defense of the language and communicative ability of these remarkable apes. The first and longest chapter (3-74), by Savage-Rumbaugh, the primatologist of the group, is a sensitive narrative of Kanzi's behavior and linguistic achievements. S-R describes Kanzi's infancy during his mother's training, the sudden revelation of his communicative skills when he was left without his mother, his subsequent childhood, and finally, the series of careful tests in which nine-year-old Kanzi and a two-and-a-half-year-old human child were found to perform in remarkably similar ways to spoken English instructions. I do not see how we can any longer deny that a bonobo can learn to understand not only a large number of words of spoken English but also to use syntactic clues to interpret the meaning of sentences. Kanzi also uses a keyboard to punch out meaningful signs, and he puts the signs together in communicatively innovative ways. Kanzi cannot use his voice to speak, but S-R fills this chapter with striking examples of his ability to communicate easily with human beings in other linguistic ways. Here and there, I longed for more detail. How, exactly, did Kanzi's mother 'invite' someone to sit with her (19)? What did Kanzi do to let himself be described as having 'smiled and laughed' when tickled (31)? What sort of gesture did he use when he gestured 'come' (39)? When Jeannine (Kanzi's human caretaker) 'commented' (36), did she do so in English or with the keyboard? S-R describes Kanzi as having been, at one time or another, 'frightened', 'confused', or 'suspi- cious', as showing 'curiosity', 'fascination', or 'boredom', as 'wanting', 'wishing', 'trying', or 'objecting'. Some readers may be disturbed at this degree of 'anthropomorphism', but we do not hesitate to attribute such emotions and intentions to prelinguistic children, and I am untroubled about attributing them to Kanzi. The chapter is slightly marred by a rather garbled account of vowels, consonants, and vocal anatomy (12-13). S-R repeats a claim that I have heard from other primatologists, that vowels are more difficult to distinguish than consonants. This seems to rest on a misinterpretation of identification tests in which listeners judge intermediate phones. It is true that the transition in identification between, for example, voiced and voiceless homorganic consonants is more abrupt than between neighboring vowels, but since the vowels and consonants of running speech are rarely intermediate, these tests say nothing about identification during ordinary conversation. We also find the assertion that velar closure allows us 'to produce nasal sounds such as "m" and "n" ' as well as 'plosive consonants such as "k" and "g" '. These confusions do not 591</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 75, NUMBER 3 (1999) seriously undermine the argument of the chapter, and I hope they will not undermine the willing- ness of linguists to take the central message of the chapter seriously: Kanzi uses forms of language previously thought limited to human beings. The second chapter, by Stuart Shanker. a philosopher, (77-138) is an elegant philosophical review of Cartesian dualism, in which language, rationality, and free will are attributed to human beings but denied to animals. In the space at my disposal, I cannot possibly convey the subtlety with which Shanker traces the force of Cartesianism in western thought or the power it still has to lead people to draw opposite conclusions from similar behavior of apes and human beings. Cartesians conclude that animals cannot have minds like ours because they cannot use language. Then, with fine circularity, they explain the failure of animals to speak by the deficiencies of their minds. This is a valuable discussion, but it leaves out the continuing popularity, among ordinary people, if not among philosophers, of the opposing doctrine of the 'chain of being', by which human mental life is seen to lie on a continuum with that of animals. S does not take his task to be an exposition of the role of the chain of being so we are left with a brilliant exposition of one side of a long argument. The third chapter, by Taylor, a linguist (139-80), starts promisingly. If we are to compare human and ape linguistic abilities, we ought to accept the same kinds of evidence and give the same meanings to our words, whether we are talking about apes or human beings. I find these points unarguable, but T asserts, correctly I believe, that we have, instead, made such different assumptions about apes and humans that even when faced with similar behavior we have talked about them in different ways and drawn very different conclusions. He goes on to discuss, in considerable detail, the rhetorical differences in the way ape and human communication have been described, and the resulting difficulty in comparing them. Unfortunately. T's own rhetoric grows increasingly involuted as the chapter progresses until, by the end, I can no longer follow his argument. The basic point remains valid and important. We should judge ape performance by the same criteria that we use for humans. The final chapter, like the first, is attributed primarily to S-R, but I would judge it to represent a more cooperative endeavor than the three earlier chapters. It is the part of the book that is least likely to be persuasive to linguists. Its tone is uncompromising, and discussion of the ways in which apes and humans still differ is limited. The authors suggest that, since apes do not use language in the wild, they must learn language with aptitudes not specialized for language; thus it is implausible to credit them with any sort of a language acquisition device (LAD). They then argue that if Kanzi could learn so much without a LAD, then humans do not need one either. In effect, they dismiss all claims for a LAD, and they imagine they have thereby toppled linguistic dogma (206). I see no reason why some sort of LAD could not have been built into our own ancestors after the time when they had reached a level of competence more or less equivalent to that of Kanzi. Indeed, selection in favor of a specialized LAD could hardly even have begun before some language was in existence for selection to work on. Kanzi understands and uses some language, but not as much as human beings do. Perhaps a LAD is needed for our level of language even if not for his. Referring to scholars who have failed to accept the ape language research, they say 'it remains possible to impugn the validity of the data and the honesty of the experimenters, and such continues to be frequently done' (206). Accusing others of impugning one's data and honesty is a serious charge, and it deserves documentation, but their only reference is to Pinker (1994), with no page number. The single reference in Pinker's index to S-R's work is to page 341. Here, Pinker cavalierly, and quite unfairly I believe, dismisses Kanzi's achievements, but I see no sign that he impugns either the data or the honesty of the ape researchers. He certainly suggests that they have overinterpreted their data, but that is hardly the same as charging them with dishonesty. The authors will be no more successful at winning the respect of linguists by such loose accusa- tions than Pinker will be at gaining the respect of primatologists by dismissing their findings so curtly. This final chapter ends with a brief but wonderful description of an episode in the life of bonobos in the wild. Do not let the earlier sections of the chapter prevent you from reading the last ten pages. 592</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS The book is a brief on behalf of the linguistic ability of these apes rather than a balanced assessment of the extent to which they are like us and the extent to which they are different, and I wish the book had a less embattled tone. I1 can well understand how difficult it must be for S-R to face repeated, but thoughtless, dismissals of Kanzi's achievements, but there have been more than enough hyped up claims about ape language to encourage skepticism. I believe the book would have been more convincing to linguists had the authors more often considered the differences that still divide us from apes. Both linguists and primatologists have too often posed the question of animal language too simply: 'Do they have language or don't they?' Surely, the better question is 'How much language do they have?' Linguists only exhibit their ignorance when they still insist that chimps and bonobos have no linguistic capacity whatsoever, but primatologists contribute every bit as much to the misunderstanding by sweeping the remaining differences aside. S-R et al. 1993 presents the clinching evidence for Kanzi's language ability more convincingly than this book does, and S-R and Lewin (1994) is a more relaxing read, but with all my caveats, I still recommend this book to linguists. I am a former skeptic of ape language research. Having had my mind changed by S-R et al. 1993, I wish this book presented the case in a way that would be more consistently convincing to linguists. Even so, from now on, it will be, quite simply, irresponsible for linguists to dismiss the achievements of chimpanzees and bonobos without taking what the authors of this book have to tell us very seriously.

Reviewed by JAMES STANLAW, Illinois State University At first blush (and no pun is intended here) it might not be readily obvious what Kenneth Starr's report on American presidential peccadilloes has in common with the speech acts of Native Americans in the jungles of South America. However, after reading the articles in this excellent new collection-in truth, all written BEFORE Clinton's 1996 reelection-such connec- tions not only begin to make sense but seem to be almost commonplace. The intent of this volume is to explore the implications of looking at culture as a text, i.e. extracted pieces of discourse or social interaction that can be 'read' in various formal and informal ways. The authors are not speaking metaphorically here but see texts (in the literal sense) and artifacts (their nonlinguistic counterparts) as being the 'building blocks of culture' (1). The most exciting thing about viewing culture this way is that this is 'precisely what "the natives" (includ- ing us) see as well' (2). But there are now two critical issues: first, how do things become 'entextualized' taking on acknowledged and isolated lives of their own, which are independent of context? Second, how do texts become recontextualized-placed back into old or new places after achieving this independent status? The eleven articles in this collection are basically linguis- tic ethnographies of just such situations, which the editors call the 'natural history' of discourse. 593</page></plain_text>
