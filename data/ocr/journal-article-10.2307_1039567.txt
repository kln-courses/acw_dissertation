<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Causes of Peace and Conditions of War By WILLIAM T. R. Fox ABSTRACT: What makes wars end ("the causes of peace") and what keeps wars from ending ("the conditions of war") has been much less studied than what makes wars start ("the causes of war") and what keeps wars from starting ("the con- ditions of peace"). Past inattention to war termination prob- lems is variously explained by political scientists' concern with war avoidance, strategists' concern with victory and deter- rence, and pervasive doubts that thermonuclear war can be kept from running its full course. Protracted, large-scale, non- atomic asymmetrical war-limited for the major power par- ticipant but unlimited for the local, post-colonial minor power -and apocalyptic thermonuclear exchange are the two types of war which mainly concern students of war termination. Although there is brief reference to forces making the par- ticipants in thermonuclear war strenuously seek early termina- tion, if only to save their cities, the main emphasis is on war termination in large-scale, limited war. The problem is dis- cussed chiefly from the point of view of a major power seeking to take a "turn toward peace," eschewing victory but unwilling to accept defeat. Factors favoring termination are discussed in terms of the world political pressures for peace, constraints keeping the two sides from using fully the coercive force avail- able, competing high-priority domestic policy objectives, the translation of battlefield results into more realistic expecta- tions and moderated war objectives, the continuous calculus of sacrifices still to be made and gains still to be realized, and the problem of making peace proposals which are both understood and acceptable.

How can wars be made to end? Astonish- ingly little has been written in direct answer to these questions.1 In this in- troductory article to a symposium on how wars end, the special case of thermonuclear central war is not sepa- rately treated. For many and perhaps most purposes, however, the general problem of war termination and the special problem of ending a two-way thermonuclear war may require separate analysis, if only because history has to be invented and alternative scenarios written to breathe life into and to test speculations about a class of events for which there are no historical examples. The protracted, large-scale, limited wars of the post-colonial second half of the twentieth century are wars which have stayed limited, but they have also stayed wars. They, too, are without exact historical parallel; for the escala- tion of limited war did not, prior to the Korean and Vietnam wars, raise the spectre of thermonuclear Armageddon. Nevertheless, these wars are in impor- tant respects like those of pre-atomic times. Understanding how these earlier wars ended (or dragged on) is essential to a study of how the Korea or Vietnam type of war can be made to end. In- evitably in the 1970's, where thermo- nuclear war is not specified, statements about war termination will be read in terms of their relevance to understand- ing and controlling the course of events in protracted conflicts such as those in 1. See, however, Journal of Peace Research 4 (1969), Special Issue on Peace Research in History, guest editor, Berenice A. Carroll (Oslo, Norway: Universitetsforlaget, 1969); and Herman Kahn, William Pfaff, and Ed- mund Stillman, "War Termination Issues and Concepts" (Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Hud- son Institute, 1968). The Hudson Institute study, done under United States Air Force contract HI-921/3-RR, deals almost exclusively with the termination of nuclear war. Korea and Vietnam. Only limited wars are likely to be protracted wars, and only in protracted war is "termination" identified as an urgent problem. Military and diplomatic historians have described in the most meticulous detail how particular wars have run their course and particular peace settle- ments have been reached, and President Nixon has been getting all kinds of public and private advice on how to end the particular war from which the United States has been seeking in 1970 to extricate itself. The general analyses of international relations scholars are far oftener concerned, however, with explaining how peace is lost than in explaining how it can be won back again.2 They are also far richer, except in the field of international law, in their prescriptions for preventing and deter- ring war than in their prescriptions for limiting, de-escalating, and terminating war once started-except insofar as winning incidentally involves termi- nating. Clausewitz emphasized the po- litical control of violence, but not every strategist who came after him reflected his emphasis. Had writers on strategy done so, war termination in protracted limited war would have been a less neglected topic. Unlike Clausewitz, the idolaters of war as an ennobling human activity, the ad- vocates of war a l'outrance, and the ex- emplars of a strategy of "victory"-the code word for the full achievement of announced war aims by fighting, rather than by some combination of fighting and diplomacy, no matter what the cost and however extreme (or moderate) the war aims-have been supremely unin- terested in how to wind down and 2.

To all of them, po- litical limitations on the use of violence to contain, de-escalate, and end fighting are likely to appear meddlesome. The disciples of Jomini, Foch, and Mac- Arthur expect peace to be imposed, not negotiated. In the United States, at least, "no political meddling" with the military commander in the completion of his appointed military task is a shib- boleth almost as powerful as "civilian control." In the dawn of the thermonuclear era of world politics, the students of apoca- lyptic war were not concerned with how apocalyptic wars end and very little concerned with any other kind of war at all. As Thomas C. Schelling has pointed out, the common view was that thermonuclear war could not be "brought" to an end; it was like a string of firecrackers which must go off in turn, once one is ignited.3 The absolute weapon seemed to make abso- lute war obsolete; and the interesting problem seemed at first to be only how to make sure that possessors of thermo- nuclear weapons were all equally de- terred. By 1970, fortunately, strategic theorists had spelled out the inadequacies of the "string of firecrackers" approach to thermonuclear war.4 Slowing down, limiting, and halting the thermonuclear exchange has become a major intel- lectual concern of writers on strategy. The "hot line," the doctrine of flexible response, and the development of "no cities" strategies are evidence of a will on all sides to assert as effective political 3. Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1966), pp. 20-21. 4. Most notably, Herman Kahn, beginning with On Thermonuclear War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1960). The most explicit rejection of the "string of firecrackers" view of nuclear war has been by the advocates of a "flexible response" strategy. See William W. Kaufmann, The McNamara Strategy (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964). control over thermonuclear violence as over lesser forms of violence. Nuclear weapons have not been fired in anger since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The same "missing rungs in the ladder of escalation" which have kept a quarter-century of sub-nuclear violence stabilized at sub-nuclear levels seem also to have been missing rungs in the ladder of conflict resolution. As the major actor in two of the longest, bloodiest, and most cruelly frustrating of these limited wars, the United States stands in greatest need of a doctrine for asserting effective political control over large-scale sub-nuclear war and its termination. WINDING DOWN LIMITED WARS Viewing war as a disease to be stamped out, a "public health" way of viewing war, is an essential research orientation but one which seems to divert attention away from viewing large-scale limited war as a kind of in- fection which the infected patients need to have controlled and cleared up promptly. To change the metaphor, viewing war as an interval between periods of diplomacy, or as an inter- ruption in the normal and continuous procedures of conflict resolution among sovereign states, seems to discourage work in any systematic and theoretical way on how force and diplomacy may be used together to achieve early war termination on a basis that rationally balances costs and benefits at each step as the war is wound down. Students of international conflict resolution often find it uncongenial to think of war as a "normal" procedure in any systematic classification of con- flict resolution procedures.5 War does 5. War is not one of the procedures discussed by Julius Stone in International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, s.v. "International Con- flict Resolution." 3</page><page sequence="4">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY indeed reflect a failure of diplomacy and third-party settlement, but in this era of limited war it is not a statistically rare phenomenon. Even in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, which has done much to bring the analytical skills of economists and social psychologists to bear on the unsolved problems of po- litical scientists and historians, attention to the specific problems of making wars end is slight. This is not to say that any less effort ought to be devoted to the Kantian quest for lasting peace, but only that more effort should be applied to the Clausewitzian quest for political control of violence after, as well as before, a war has started. Academic interna- tional relations scholarship has in some previous periods of national crisis fol- lowed rather than led events; only after the country had been almost split apart by the protraction of the Vietnam war and the apparent failure of coercive diplomacy, was war termination identi- fied as a subject of great theoretical interest and urgent practical concern.6 Some scholars may have felt that work on how to make large-scale limited war end on an "acceptable" basis (however "acceptable" may be defined) some- how would confer legitimacy on and involve collaboration with the system that produced large-scale limited wars. The goal of "no more Koreas and no more Vietnams" would, if this reason- ing were carried on to its logical con- clusion, be compromised should research on war termination point the way to mitigating the anguish of a war-weary United States. 6. The author specifically includes himself in the academic group whose theoretical interest in how wars end emerged only after the Viet- nam war had come to dwarf the Korean war in terms of American experience with pro- tracted large-scale limited war. THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN APPROACH Old-fashioned aspirations for "vic- tory" and new-fashioned visions of curing the world of the war disease are not the only causes for the neglect of war termination studies. A third in- hibitor to studying "the causes of peace" is the traditional American approach to war. The country, it is commonly be- lieved, does not deliberately embark on large-scale war; it only enters "foreign" wars when some great aggressor attacks it or seems on the point of so over- reaching himself that he must be stopped before he upsets the whole in- ternational political order in a major theater of world political conflict. While this major theater before 1945 could only be Europe and this tradi- tional approach is today recognized on all sides as inapplicable to thermonu- clear war, and indeed to any kind of war in Europe, it seems to be enjoying a second incarnation in Asia in large- scale limited war.7 The United States has not prepared for the present era's large-scale, limited, protracted Asian wars, any more than it prepared to fight in Europe's large- scale, unlimited, protracted wars earlier in the twentieth century. But then and now, however, the applicable tradition, in Henry Stimson's words, is to apply "one's whole, undiluted strength" to winning back the peace that the enemy has broken. Large-scale mobilization 7. With its central role in the military ar- rangements of NATO and large forces in Europe a quarter-century after the end of World War II, the United States approach to European and North Atlantic security prob- lems is far from what is here described as the traditional American approach. In the Korean and Vietnam wars the United States departed from another long-standing tradition, to avoid involvement in large-scale ground fighting on the Asian mainland. 4</page><page sequence="5">CAUSES OF PEACE AND CONDITIONS OF WAR after a war has begun, rather than large- scale preparedness in anticipation of fighting that war, means that war pro- traction rather than early war termina- tion is the first military objective. Only then can time be gained to avoid early defeat and bring the nation's whole, undiluted strength to bear so as to assure ultimate victory. Each large-scale protracted war is, in this view, seen as a unique event. One does not negotiate with the enemy as an equal, but undertakes a crusade to clear away every obstacle to a fresh start for a new and improved international sys- tem. "The strategy of inundation," to use Eisenhower's phrase in his Crusade for Europe, and the goal of "uncondi- tional surrender," Franklin Roosevelt's Casablanca Conference formula, may have been appropriate for Ulysses S. Grant in the American Civil War, for Roosevelt in the war against Hitler as the embodiment of absolute evil, and for other true crusades. It offers little guidance in the conduct of large-scale, sub-nuclear, protracted "post-colonial" war. The Boer War may in fact provide an historical experience more relevant to the American problems in Korea and Vietnam than the American Civil War or the two World Wars of this century. A major power could find no way to prevent hostilities against a tiny op- ponent from dragging on.8 From the Peace of Vereeniging, which in 1902 ended the fighting in South Africa but brought no immediate reconciliation, the defeated General Smuts thought he learned that in a peace of reconciliation the terms ought to be established be- fore the enemy is finally defeated and perforce compelled to accept whatever amalgam of magnanimity, vindictive- 8. See James Eayrs' essay on "Force and Im- potence" in his Fate and Will in Foreign Pol- icy (Toronto: CBC Publications, 1967), es- pecially pp. 70-75. ness, and wisdom the victor chooses to impose. Sir Keith Hancock's judgment is that Smuts believed that the Boer War lasted a year longer than any Brit- ish interest required. Fifteen years later, as Britain's most trusted Empire soldier- statesman, he almost refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles because of his strong views as to the futility of a vindictive, dictated peace.9 A "Wilson peace," as opposed to a "Lloyd George- Clemenceau peace," would, in his view, have been more likely to emerge from pre-armistice negotiations than from dic- tation to the prostrate vanquished en- emy. It might also have emerged earlier. The United States has, of course, proclaimed in the Korean and Vietnam wars no goals so sweeping as "uncondi- tional surrender." 10 On the other hand, United States tactics for enticing the enemy to the bargaining table have been notably unsuccessful in both wars. Even after seventeen years there is only an uneasy armistice along the Thirty- eighth Parallel; and unsuccessful as was the effort to bomb Hanoi to the con- ference table, efforts to lure Hanoi into meaningful negotiations in Paris have hardly been more successful since Amer- ican bombing of the North was curtailed in 1968. THE POWER OF THE SMALL BELLIGERENT Unless one side chooses simply to abandon the field or unconditionally surrenders, it takes two to end a war. 9. For a brief account of Smuts' views as to the outcome of the Boer War and World War I, see W. K. Hancock's essay "From War to Peace" in his Four Studies of War and Peace in This Century (Cambridge: At the Univer- sity Press, 1961), pp. 33-58. 10. General MacArthur's disastrous march to the Yalu in late October, 1950, suggested that he, for one, never quite got the word. See Dean Acheson, Present at the Creation (New York: Norton, 1969), chs. 47 and 48. 5</page><page sequence="6">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It is not, however, in the limiting cases of unilateral withdrawal and uncondi- tional surrender that the problem of war termination poses an intellectual chal- lenge. As Finland's Winter War with the Soviet Union in 1939-40 showed, the side whose war aims in a local war require only that the enemy not finally defeat it, is a formidable opponent even to a major power. It is especially for- midable, as the Vietnam war shows, if that major power's government is for domestic or world political reasons anx- ious to limit, wind down, and stop the fighting. The small-power belligerent, determined to outwait its major-power opponent questing for de-escalation and peace, may make a peace of reconcilia- tion almost as hard to achieve as any other kind of peace. In such asym- metrical, protracted colonial and post- colonial wars, the local belligerent must take care only not to make such "out- rageous" demands or adopt such horri- fying tactics as to rebuild the major power's home front support for carrying on the war. He can charge a high price just for letting the major power disen- gage. The case of "pure withdrawal" may indeed be as hard to envision as Paul Kecskemeti found "pure surrender" to be when he studied war termination in World War II.11 Just as the obviously vanquished still has some spoiling capa- bility, and therefore bargaining capac- ity, until the shooting has stopped, the 11. Paul Kecskemeti, Strategic Surrender (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1958). A furore was stirred up by Senator Styles Bridges' ludicrous charge that this book, a research study by the government- supported RAND Corporation, was a pre- scription for United States surrender. Evi- dently, for men of the Bridges persuasion, even the contemplation of a war outcome in which there is deviation by the victorious United States from the single acceptable goal of un- conditional surrender violates some deeply embedded taboos. surrender formalities are completed, the weapons of the defeated gathered up, so the local enemy in asymmetrical war can charge a high and negotiable price to a major power bent on withdrawal. Troops have to be protected while other troops are being withdrawn, and at least minimum provision made for the future of the local allies. There may in fact be no such thing as unilateral termination by a simple act of with- drawal. The most rigorous critics of continued American military involve- ment in Southeast Asia may indeed find as great a challenge in research on how wars end as those who would demand more of Hanoi as the price of termina- tion. In any case, one must negotiate with an enemy who is still fighting. We have attributed the theoretical and doctrinal vacuum as to how wars end to three quite separate causes: (1) the dominant "public health" view of the war disease by most peace research- ers, (2) insufficient attention by mili- tary strategists to the problem of the rational political control of violence dur- ing war, and (3) a specific American war tradition, such that the makers of American military policy seem almost to have a trained incapacity for avoiding stalemate in protracted, large-scale, lim- ited war. In discussing this last subject we have already embarked on a consid- eration of what keeps one kind of war from ending. Let us turn to consider the more general problem. What keeps a war going? If the two sides have incompatible, unrealized, minimum war objectives and additional human and material resources which they are willing to allocate to the war, the answer is obvious. Until there is some change in the goals, expectations, and calculations of at least one of the belligerents, the fighting goes on; and not all changes lead toward peace. A large tactical success may open the way to inflating war objectives, and thus 6</page><page sequence="7">CAUSES OF PEACE AND CONDITIONS OF WAR postpone rather than hasten the day when terms of settlement will be offered which the enemy might reasonably be expected to accept.l2 I have argued elsewhere that the United States has in fact after such tactical successes "snatched unlimited stalemate from the jaws of limited victory" in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, i.e., discov- ered a negative solution to the problem of war termination.l3 Let us posit a situation which might "rationally" call for one side to make a "turn toward peace." The United States, for example, found itself in a far different situation in Southeast Asia in early 1967 than in the dark days of early 1965. Sukarno was gone, Com- munist China was caught in the throes 12. Morton H. Halperin, Limited War in the Nuclear Age (New York: John Wiley, 1963), p. 32, makes this point and the additional point that there is also "pressure on the losing side to expand the war in order to reverse the battlefield decision...." The brilliantly successful Inchon landing in September, 1950, which led to the almost total destruction of the 400,000-man North Korean army operating south of the Thirty- eighth Parallel, would be a classic example of a government's decision to inflate its war ob- jective in the aftermath of a battlefield success if General MacArthur's decision to march to the Yalu had in fact reflected Truman Ad- ministration policy. As Dean Acheson's mem- oirs (loc. cit.) show, however, even Mac- Arthur's Washington critics, the men responsi- ble for maintaining political controls over American fighting in Korea, were actively canvassing the prospects for expanding the war aims to include a united, independent, and democratic Korea. 13. William T. R. Fox, "Next Steps in Viet- nam Policy," privately circulated in 1967; published in Social Progress (March-April, 1968) pp. 34-42. On the other hand, Secre- tary of State Dean Rusk seemed to belong to the "no compromise of declared war objec- tives" school when he testified in 1966 that "I would be misleading you if I told you that I thought that I know where, when, and how this matter will be resolved" (quoted in Eayrs, op. cit., p. 22). From his vantage point it appeared to be the other side's deci- sions that stalemated the Vietnam conflict. of "cultural revolution," and American arms had stabilized the military situa- tion in South Vietnam. Yet it was an- other whole year before the great Ameri- can peace overture of March, 1968-a year in which the loss of American lives reached a level which could not be sus- tained in limited war, in which urban riots convulsed the nation, and in which inflation raced out of control. FACTORS OF POLICY PARALYSIS What are some of the factors that predispose toward policy paralysis, even when "total victory" as a war aim is vigorously eschewed? Mobilization pat- terns and war strategies take time to achieve results, and the war-makers may judge that the military policies selected have not yet been fully translated into bargaining capacity at a peace table. The statesman-politician may be led by his senior military advisers to conclude the time is not ripe for terminating the war on terms that realize fully on the military investment already made. Even when there has been ample time to demonstrate the final ineffectiveness or unacceptable cost of a given strategy, a kind of technological hubris may par- ticularly bedevil the American policy maker. In large-scale limited war, there are, by definition, as yet unmo- bilized resources (otherwise the war would be unlimited); but it is the hope of better rather than simply more products of American defense industry that may delay reconsideration of an ineffective strategy or scaling down un- attainable or unacceptably costly goals. There are always better weapons in the pipeline than on the battlefield, and better ones on the drawing boards than in production. What an irony it will be if the brilliant American advances in helicopter technology demonstrated in ground fighting in Vietnam seem in retrospect to have delayed by two or three years the discovery of policies 7</page><page sequence="8">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY which would terminate an unwinnable war! Policy paralysis may result from what Lewin and Miller have described in intrapersonal conflict terms as the "approach-avoidance" conflict.14 Here the jackass is not immobilized by being pulled in opposite directions by two equally sweet-smelling bales of hay. His problem is more difficult: a skunk sits on his hay and the closer the jackass moves to both, the greater his anguish. It is perhaps not too far-fetched to de- velop by analogy a model of intrana- tional conflict. The sweet smell of dis- engagement and peace and the evil smell of unrealized war aims (in which tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars may have been invested) work at cross purposes. Unless one smell definitely prevails over the other, capacity to make clear policy is para- lyzed. In our American governmental system, with its separation of powers, the turn in policy in 1967-68 was de- layed because one part of the govern- ment smelled the new-mown hay of de- escalation and peace while another smelled mainly the malodorous musk of military failure. One need not summon up the image of an anthropomorphic, monster superpower on the edge of a nervous breakdown for the analogy of approach-avoidance to have relevance. In an atmosphere of polarized immod- eration-with one group calling for early termination by victory, whatever the escalation necessary, however great the cost, and however evil the by- product in domestic and world political consequences; and a second group call- ing for early termination, whatever the sacrifice of war aims necessary, however humiliating the frustration and failure, 14. See Kenneth Boulding, Conflict and De- fense (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1962), ch. 5, for a discussion of "approach-avoid- ance" in terms relevant to interpersonal con- flict. and however disastrous the events which follow abandonment of the struggle- resolute pursuit of some middle way may command wholly insufficient do- mestic political support; it matters not how rational the in-between, moderate policy may appear in cost-benefit terms. Paradoxically, the more urgent the de- mands for termination by groups with diametrically opposed programs for termination, the less may be the chance of a policy commanding sufficient do- mestic support which would in fact end the war. Let us now assume, however, that, one way or another, one belligerent does take a great turn toward peace-as, for example, the United States did in Presi- dent Johnson's speech of March 31, 1968. On that day the President an- nounced the sharp curtailment of bomb- ing of North Vietnam and his own ab- dication from the seat of power as an earnest of the seriousness of his peace move.15 In the typical case, one side decides before the other does to search for ways of limiting, winding down, and stopping the war, even at some cost to its original war aims. When we ask, "Why does a war go on when one side wants to quit?" we are really asking why the first side to decide to seek peace, on what it considers to be very moderate terms, may have very great difficulty in bringing the other side to a similar point of view. We have already described what hap- pened in one difficult case, that of 15. It is intriguing, though fruitless, to speculate how much of the effectiveness of this bold move toward early war termination was lost by the successive assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. These two tragedies left the United States portrayed before the world as incapable of managing violence at home and therefore unfit to wield it abroad. It is at least arguable that without the two assassinations, Hanoi would have felt the pressure of world opinion to make a reciprocating gesture of de-escalation. 8</page><page sequence="9">CAUSES OF PEACE AND CONDITIONS OF WAR a major power's faraway small-power opponent, which in Raymond Aron's terms was content simply "not to lose" and in no particular hurry to accommo- date a peace-seeking major-power op- ponent. A more general answer to the question of why war goes on when one side wants to make peace is that its "moderate" conditions are not mod- erate enough to satisfy the minimum war objectives of an opponent with re- sources to carry on the struggle. "No peace just yet" is a typical response to peace overtures by an opponent who believes it can get better terms later on. HITLER'S SPECTACULAR FAILURE The most spectacular failure of a war termination effort in the history of modern war, that of Hitler's Germany in the summer of 1940, is instructive as to another aspect of the problem of why wars go on when one side is ready to stop. With the occupation of Denmark, Norway, Holland, and Belgium, and the collapse of the entire French military effort, Hitler's force stood astride the whole of Western Europe facing a be- leaguered Britain. Hitler could not, however, translate an unimaginably vast military success into any kind of po- litical settlement with Britain, because he had a totally insoluble credibility problem. Too many times, in too few years, too recently, he had made light- ning moves of his military forces-into the Rhineland, into Austria, and into Czechoslovakia-and won reluctant ac- quiescence to successive faits accomplis by asserting in each case that he had no further demands in Europe. Given the circumstances, the British government could see little point, no matter how bleak its military prospects, in accom- modating to the self-designated victor's demand for peace. The pitcher had gone to the well one too many times, and it failed Hitler on its most crucial trip. To say what makes war go on is also to say a good deal about what makes it stop, for one has specified conditions whose absence presumably would make for peace. Not all these conditions whose absence makes for peace are equally manipulable in what we have called the typical war-termination situ- ation, in which one side has embarked on an earnest search for a way out of war and the other has not yet recipro- cated. The causes of peace are multi- ple,16 and some of them are largely be- yond the control of the combatants on either side. There are, for example, inherent limi- tations on the uses to which a major power can put its enormous apparatus of coercion; and ultimate recognition of these limits may lead to moderate war aims and peace. In a struggle with a lesser power, the major power has the material possibility of "out-escalating" its enemy; but, as we have already noted, there are missing rungs in the ladder of escalation (and particularly in war with an enemy who is perceived as a surrogate for another major power). Wholly apart from this, escalation works both ways. As Michael Howard has reminded us, Clausewitz favored requir- ing the smallest possible sacrifices of the enemy, so that the enemy would not fight harder by virtue of feeling that with escalated destruction in prospect, there is more to lose.17 At a different 16. See Halperin, op. cit., p. 32n., who em- phasizes that action to end (or not to end) a local, limited war may be based on a calcu- lation of interests in other theaters of world political competition far removed from the particular local war in question. 17.

In a thermonuclear war there is the mutual interest of belligerents in pre- serving each other's cities, in not de- stroying the enemy government (which alone has the means to bring unspent armed forces under control), and in hav- ing assured, instantaneous, two-way communication in the war crisis as well as in peace.19 All are indications of the poverty of a military capability dispro- portionate to any known political goal but deterrence, and thus all are con- straints making for early war termina- tion. "SLEDGEHAMMER AND WALNUT" In limited war, "the duel between sledgehammer and walnut," to use James Eayrs' felicitous phrase, more and more favors the walnut.20 Local intel- ligence is likely to be superior to major- power intelligence, and the major pow- er's limited war is likely to be a minor power's unlimited war, especially in the control of violence, and the least possible use of it, with General MacArthur's views as set forth in the Senate Hearings in 1951 after MacArthur's recall. 18. In this, the United Kingdom may be leading the way. See the suggestive review article by Harold and Margaret Sprout, "The Dilemma of Rising Demands and Insufficient Resources," World Politics 22, no. 4 (July, 1968). 19. Halperin, op. cit., p. 101. 20. Eayrs, op. cit., p. 72. post-imperial age. Furthermore, in pro- tracted limited war there are many by- standers-in the world at large and among skeptics on the major power's home front-ready to judge and dis- posed to judge critically. To make matters worse for the major power, the bystanders will hold the sledgehammer to a higher standard of accountability than the walnut. Finally, one pressure for early termi- nation should operate in every kind of war except, perhaps, one such as that in Nigeria, in which the prospective losers can look forward only to annihi- lation or total conquest. This is a bel- ligerent's need to commence bargaining while he still controls significant mili- tary assets. A threat to break off nego- tiations as a way of insuring better terms for agreeing to stop fighting can then be made credible. In the First and Second World Wars, protracted military stalemate led to ever higher levels of military mobilization. After three years of fighting an appar- ently interminable war on the Flanders front in World War I, a young British officer in one of R. H. Mottram's stories observed: "This war depends on turning a crank. The side that goes on turning it efficiently the longer will win."21 Until one side stopped cranking, how- ever, the wars went on. In asymmetri- cal, protracted, sub-nuclear post-colonial war-limited for the major power but unlimited for its opponent-the case appears to be different. Stability in the local military balance-stalemate is an- other name for stability-may in large- scale limited war be the situation most conducive to war termination, whether by negotiation or by letting the war fade away. Such stability may give the smaller power confidence that it can ne- gotiate with an enemy it still mistrusts 21.

It may bring down casualties for the major power to levels that ease the domestic pressures for "instant" peace, and so, by demonstrating that it too can wait, weaken the small-power opponent's incentives for delaying tactics. It thus appears in the case of limited war that for the turn toward negotiated peace to lead to peace, enough force must still be applied to keep the mili- tary situation stable. Political control over the use of that force must be care- fully exercised, however, to insure that the force not be used in ways which destroy the credibility of the peace overture. Least-cost, highest-return, earliest- termination strategies call for a continu- ing calculus. On any reasonable esti- mate, sacrifices still to be endured must not appear disproportionate to gains still to be realized. This triple objec- tive also calls for an open negotiating stance. Only the least possible may be required of the opponent if one is de- termined to attract him to the bargain- ing table. We have posited "early war termina- tion" as only one of the three goals to be sought by the active peace-seeker. Significant trade-offs therefore may exist between earlier termination, fuller reali- zation of other military policy objectives, and lower levels of sacrifice. Suppose, however, that the enemy's readiness to negotiate peace is closely related to his estimate as to how urgent is the need for an early peace on the part of the side making the peace overture. The low- ered level of sacrifice which relieves do- mestic pressures for peace at any price, or victory at any cost, may then be op- timum for making the enemy believe that the peace-seeking power can afford to wait and that there is accordingly no point to making it wait. Both early termination and achievement of other policy objectives associated with the war thus may possibly follow from a low- cost strategy. The peace-seeker may have a problem of communication. He will have no trouble making sure that a message is transmitted, even though war involves suspension of diplomatic relations. There are always third parties through which messages can be sent. The prob- lem is partly one of having a peace overture message understood correctly and partly one of framing the message so that it generates a series of back-and- forth messages that cumulatively move toward the desired war termination. As for the misunderstanding, attitudes of mistrust may harden in a struggle which lasts many years. Hanoi, for example, seems to have felt cheated by the after- math of the 1954 Geneva settlement and may suspect trickery in the Paris negotiations.22 As for generating ef- fective interchange, the side not yet ready for peace may also be anxious not to legitimate any moderation of its war aims by bargaining in public. "Bench mark" proposals based on some alleged status quo ante or other23 have the double advantage of apparent precision and apparent legitimacy. They may be marginally easier to accept than other- wise equally rational proposals. The open negotiating stance and the constant economizing policy calculus thus require a full cataloguing of every element in the prewar status. The bar- gain finally struck can then, so far as possible, be made up of elements which are both "understood" and "legitimate." Peace, when it finally comes, can then both revive trust and save face. 22. Robert F.

The six- year negotiation to end the Thirty Years' War is a classic illustration. The re- cipient of a peace overture, we have said, is likely to view it as a trick, to win world opinion or relax the oppo- nent's vigilance and will to fight; or he will see it as evidence of weakness, in which case the probability of getting better terms later may seem very good. Willingness to persist in the face of re- buffs must therefore be an element of an open negotiating stance. Another element is a great deal of awareness of the "Oriental bazaar" quality of the early stages of public bar- gaining over the terms of peace. Scorn and accusations of bad faith are par for the course of the peace-seeker. This must indeed be so, for bargaining capa- bility is enhanced if the public response is sufficiently hostile in tone to keep open an option to return to the battle- field for additional evidence as to which side may realistically insist on what. A minor power engaged in an unlimited war against a major power fighting a limited war may be especially reluctant to allow its people's hopes for an early peace to be aroused and to risk a let- down in morale if the peace hopes are dashed. Let us assume, however, that behind the barrage of unfriendly public dis- course and in spite of persistent mis- trust, the two sides have moved closer to each other in terms of scaled-down minimum peace terms and realistic shared estimates of the two sides' mili- tary prospects in the future fighting, if it occurs. This would mean that they have digested the "election returns" from the fighting fronts and come to understand the extent to which the other side has moderated its war objec- tives. Early termination has become a shared goal, and some de-escalation has occurred on both sides. The incompati- bility of the two sides' minimum war objectives is less pronounced. The door to peace is at least slightly ajar and may at any moment be opened swiftly. The international community, if only because its members fear the spread of the infection of the war disease, may encourage the two sides to get on with the peacemaking. It still takes two to make peace, and the central question in the typical prob- lem of war termination remains how one side can maximize the chance that its peace overtures will elicit a favorable response from the other side. In the spasm of a thermonuclear exchange there is no reason to doubt that both sides will be eager for prompt termina- tion. Failure in prewar strategic plan- ning to develop absolutely fool-proof and destruction-proof command and con- trol systems (to assure continuous po- litical control even over nuclear vio- lence) and to explore a range of alterna- tives to a fully automatic string-of-fire- crackers program of nuclear destruction would, however, cripple political and diplomatic efforts to stop the war. The same may indeed be said of NATO planning for a contingency in Europe in which the possibility of resort to nuclear sanctions is inherent.24 24. On the need for war-ending and war- delaying strategies in Europe to assure time "to unravel misunderstanding" and further to narrow the range of circumstances in which the North Atlantic allies might feel compelled to invoke nuclear sanctions, see the forth- coming volume reporting on ACDA-sponsored research on arms control and European secu- rity systems by Warner R. Schilling and his colleagues in the Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, to be pub- lished by the University Press at the end of 1970. Existing strategies seem to depend for 12</page><page sequence="13">CAUSES OF PEACE AND CONDITIONS OF WAR For the rest, which means for large- scale limited war, assuming that the peace-seeking side is doing well all the little things that will help bring the other to the peace table (or help let the war fade away), the main choice seems to be that posed by Jan Christian Smuts in the Boer War and again as the bat- tlefields fell silent in 1918. Is the peace of reconciliation best assured by being their deterrent effectiveness on the presumed automaticity of a nuclear response to a non- nuclear attack which cannot be effectively countered by non-nuclear military means. The problem does not arise in the case of the large-scale unambiguous nuclear first strike, unlikely in any event but extremely unlikely in the European theater alone; here one must presume an automatic Western nuclear re- sponse. It arises in the ambiguous situations in which inadequate conventional military power denies time for thorough explorations of misunderstanding and miscalculation and hence of alternatives to the use of tactical nuclear weapons. magnanimous only after one or both sides have fought to utter military ex- haustion, or is a healing peace more promptly and effectively achieved by making it before either side's efforts are fully spent? Lord Milner in 1902 and Lloyd George in 1918 do not seem to have been much interested in a peace of reconciliation, either before or after vic- tory. Woodrow Wilson, like General Smuts, was very much interested in such a peace. His Fourteen Points sug- gest that, like Smuts, Wilson believed that magnanimity and moderation be- fore the fighting had completely ended made for both an earlier and a better ending of war. There is nothing in 1970 to suggest that Smuts and Wilson were wrong then, or would be wrong today, if they held similar views about the large-scale limited wars of the pres- ent post-colonial era. 13</page></plain_text>
