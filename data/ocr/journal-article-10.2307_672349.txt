<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mucuchies Phase: An Extension of the Andean Cultural Pattern into Western Venezuela' ERIKA WAGNER Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas A homogeneous cultural history for the Venezuelan Andes had been postulated using unilateral approaches and neglecting environmental variations within the region. Our archaeological and ethnohistorical data allow us to establish the tierra fria Mucuchies phase of the Andean pattern. Typical features are the cultivation of cold climate tubers, stone constructions, simple pottery, and burials associated with votive material. This contrasts with the features of the Sub-Andean pattern established for the tierra templada. The Mucuchies phase's resemblance to the Chibcha and Tairona material from Colombia reflects in a simplified form the way of life of the protohistoric people of the Andes as a whole. IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED by many authors that the prehistory of Venezuela is most closely related to cultural develop- ments in the Caribbean area. In this paper other cultural influences are shown to be important, at least in certain areas of the country. I emphasize the relevance of the High Venezuelan Andes-an area so far neglected in general works dealing with New World prehistory-which is pertinent for the study of Andean culture history as a whole. The evidence I offer is based not only on archaeological data, but also on ethnohis- torical, ecological, and botanical informa- tion. Betweeen November, 1967, and March, 1968, I did archaeological field work in a section of the high-altitude tierra fria zone (above 2000 m.) of the central Venezuelan Andes. The survey was centered on the upper Rfo Chama drainage area surrounding the town of Mucuchies (altitude 3000 m.), which is located in the northern portion of the state of Mdrida (Fig. 1). Holocene glacia- tion has been active in the region, and typical features of mountain glaciation such as cirques, aretes, chain lakes, and moraines are prominent topographic features of the upper limits of the tierra fria and paramo (high altitude, treeless flatland, above 3000 m.) zones in the Mucuchfes area, as de- scribed in an adjacent region by Schubert (1970). Modern settlements are located along the terrace of the Chama River and the prehispanic population seems to have favored the same areas as indicated by the abundance of archaeological material. Prior to Kidder II's (1944) and Osgood and Howard's (1943) pioneer work of sys- tematic archaeology in the Venezuelan Andes, our knowledge of the prehistory of the area was based on the specimens found in museums and private collections which came from caves and rock shelters of the tierra fria and paramo zones. These localities have produced the most artistic specimens: clay and stone figurines, stone, bone, and shell pendants, and complete pottery vessels such as incensarios. However, these speci- mens lack true archaeological value because of their uncertain spatial and temporal posi- tion. In 1948 Cruxent visited the Mucuchies region and located in Chipepe the first habi- tation site of the tierra fria zone. He made a surface collection of 224 potsherds which enabled him and Rouse to establish the Chipepe ceramic complex or style (Cruxent and Rouse 1958:141-142, 1959:108, Pl. 50), which I shall call the Mucuchfes style. More recently, Vargas (1969) excavated the 195</page><page sequence="2">LANO EL go RtAFAE L 4r 0 13MTEQU a g AvEN E.zU ELA EL MOA ALTO I 0 ELA ERA MUEVA41 I ROL Figure 1.

There she found 1859 sherds of the Mucuchies style, lithic artifacts and empty mintoyes or stone-lined shafts. In my own survey of the Mucuchi'es region, I obtained surface collections (729 sherds) from El Royal, Misteque, La Toma, Llano El Hato, and Los Micuyes, and ex- cavated the sites of El Mocao Alto (9019' N Lat, 7108' W Long) and La Era Nueva (9018' N Lat, 710 10' W Long) (Fig. 1). The latter yielded 18,795 and 3944 potsherds respec- tively. Both sites also produced stone arti- facts, shells, animal bones, corn cobs, and miscellaneous artifacts. At El Mocao Alto, eighteen human skeletons were found in association with pottery and a large quantity of serpentinite and steatite plaques in vari- ous stages of completion. La Era Nueva was exclusively a habitation site. The localities surveyed in the Mucuchfes area also yielded several types of stone constructions such as mintoyes, walls, and fences made of boul- ders, agricultural terraces, and stone plat- forms. THE MUCUCHIES STYLE AND ASSOCIATED FINDS All sites located so far in the Mucuchies area constitute single components that have yielded similar pottery assemblages which constitute the Mucuchies style, synonymous of Cruxent and Rouse's (1958) Chipepe style. I will use the term Mucuchies style instead of the previously defined Chipepe style, because the latter refers to a very small amount of sherds with fewer diagnostic traits. Figure 2.

Of the total assemblage, ninety percent (21,017 sherds) belong to the Chipepe Plain type. These sherds are plain, coarse, and thick, with few diagnostic modes, obviously utili- tarian ware. No complete vessels were found, but Figure 2 illustrates the main shapes that could be reconstructed. The temper is crush- ed stone of the following minerals: quartz, plagioclase, micaceous schists, orthoclase, biotite, and epidote. All these are found in rocks that occur in the Mucuchies region (C. Schubert, personal communication). The El Mocao Alto Plastic type is represented by 434 sherds. This type is distinguished from Chipepe Plain in that it has several plastic modes of decoration. The shapes and temper are similar to those of the Chipepe Plain type. Modes of decoration are applique, incision, punctation, and modeling (Figs. 3c, 3d, 3f, 4). The most diagnostic motifs of decoration are applique fillets or notched ridges of clay, which are triangular in cross section (Figs. 3f, 4c). Of the total pottery assemblage, 504 sherds belong to the Mirin- day Painted and El Chao Painted-Plastic types. They (Figs. 5b, 5c, 5d and Wagner ii h de i~illib Figure 4.

Some atypical sherds which have not been included in any type were found in Mucuchies. Figure 5a illustrates a sherd painted with geometric motifs in dark brown on a white slip. It resembles most closely some of the Dabajuro style sherds (Cruxent and Rouse 1959, P1. 21) and shows simi- larities with some wares of the Chibcha area (Broadbent, personal communication). The excavations also yielded thirty-five frag- ments of microvessels (Figs. 5e, 5f). The following types of non-pottery arti- facts were found in my Mucuchies excava- tions: round clay discs (modified potsherds), serpentinite plaques, polishing and grinding stones, metates, manos, celts, hammerstones, one shell pendant, a very thin gold pendant, and a few miscellaneous types (Figs. 5g, 5h, 6). The largest amount of lithic material from Mucuchies is serpentinite plaques, 4881 pieces of different shapes (bat-wing pendants, rectangular plates, fragments, un- finished specimens, debris and pieces of raw material). The size of the wing-shaped speci- mens ranges from micro-pendants to large, heavy plaques. They are made from ser- pentinites and steatites, a type of ultramafic rock that so far has not been found in the Venezuelan Andes (C. Schubert, personal communication).

The first habitation site that produced these objects in clear association with other cultural mate- rial was Miquimii, in the Carache area (Wagner 1967b:53-56). In the Tairona region, Colombia, wing-shaped objects of polished stone are common; Mason (1936:179) found nearly one hundred fifty specimens. Only one worked shell pendant consisting of Cyphoma gibbosa with a bi- conically drilled hole for suspension (Fig. 6b) was found in Mucuchies. A very thin gold or gold-copper (tumbaga) pendant (Fig. 6d) was the only metal artifact found. Rouse and Cruxent (1963:79, Pl. 30B) describe and illustrate the only figurine made of gold alloy previously reported in the Venezuelan archaeological literature, which they regard as unique and which may be considered as an import from Colombia. Human skeletons, charred corn cobs, animal bones, and mollusc shells are the biological remains found in my Mucuchies sites. Trench A-1 of El Mocao Alto yielded eighteen human skeletons, most of them in a flexed position, associated with serpentinite plaques. (This material has not been ana- lyzed and will be described elsewhere. The charred corn cobs were analyzed by H. Cutler and P. C. Mangelsdorf.) Most of the corn specimens are an early version of the high altitude Colombian-Venezuelan race Pollo, although Cutler (personal communica- tion) believes that some of the cobs could be classified within a series of ancient small- cobbed races that are widespread from Chile to northern Mexico. A variety of animal bones were identified by O. Reig and his associates, of the Universidad Central de Venezuela. They belong to the following mammals: deer (Odocoileus virginianus go udotti), rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis meridensis), biquiro (Tayassu tajacu torvus), lapa (Cuniculus paca paca), zorro guache de la cordillera (Nasuella olivacea meridensis), and picure (Dasyprocta aguti cayana). Frag- ments of turtle plaques were also found in the excavations. Roger C. Wood (1950) from Harvard University, identified the chelonian material as belonging to the subfamily Tes- tudinae sensu. Rene Martinez, of the Uni- versidad Central de Venezuela, identified several mollusc shells: Pleikocheilus (Drypt- us) sp., Tetraplodon stevensi, and Cyphoma gibbosa (personal communication). CHRONOLOGY Figure 7 shows the regional chronology of Western Venezuela, originally established by Cruxent and Rouse (1958) and Cruxent (1963), with modifications based on recent work by Gallagher (1964), Wagner (1967b), and Zucchi (1967). It shows periods (relative chronology), dates (absolute chronology), styles, and series (sets of styles which devel- oped one out of the other). The Paleo-Indian epoch has been excluded because it is irrele- vant to the present discussion. Cruxent and Rouse (1958:141-142) placed the Mucuchies style within period IV (A.D. 1000-1500) of their regional chron- ology, on the basis of its resemblances to the Mirinday style of the Trujillo area, which yielded a C-14 date of A.D. 1350 (Y-454). Vargas later obtained a radiocarbon date (from San Ger6nimo) of A.D. 1140 (SI-534) which confirms the previous relative dating. Ten charcoal and two human bone samples from the Mucuchies excavations were dated by Tamers (1969:403-404, 1970:513-514). Of these, six are from El Mocao Alto and six from La Era Nueva (Table I). The charcoal dates (except for sample IVIC-651, which is modern), range between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 830. The dates provide an average of A.D. 1100 for El Mocao Alto and a slightly older average of A.D. 1000 for La Era Nueva. The samples of human bone from El Mocao Alto yielded dates of A.D. 1300 (IVIC-645) and A.D. 1720 (IVIC-481). The latter date ex- tends the chronology into historic time. Sample IVIC-651, which is modern, and which is clearly in disagreement with the rest of the dates, was included in the table only for the sake of completeness. Comparisons with western Venezuelan styles also support the inclusion of the Mucuchies style into Period IV.</page><page sequence="9">PERIODS DATES Sn.

Cruxent (personal communication) iden- tified one fragment of blue on white majolica as a "Dutch sherd of Chinoid style," probably from Friesland, dating somewhere between 1650 and 1675. From historical accounts we know that the first European to contact the Indians of the Mucuchies area was Fernando Cerrada (Salas 1908:166) who arrived there in 1559. I placed the Mucuchifes style in the western Venezuelan protohistoric Tierroid series of Rouse and Cruxent (1963:71-75) on the basis of chronological and cultural evidence. So far, Mucuchies is the only style located in the tierra fria zone. Although it differs from other Tierroid styles located in the tierra templada zone (800-2000 m. eleva- tion), such as Mirinday, there are similarities, especially in the ceramic modes (shapes and decoration), which justify this placement, at least provisionally. THE MUCUCHIES PHASE The fact that the Mucuchies ceramic style extended into the historical period makes it possible for me to use the ethnohistorical evidence to reconstruct the rest of the cul- ture associated with that style. I will refer to that culture as a phase. Stone constructions such as mintoyes, walls and fences made of boulders, andenes or agricultural terraces, and stone platforms that could be remnants of aboriginal house foundations were found unassociated with the Mucuchies style. Nevertheless, these con- structions as well as the pottery style both extend into -historic time and are therefore both likely to have been part of the Mucuchies phase. The most striking form of stone architecture is the mintoy. Vargas (1969:33-34) describes a mintoy from San Ger6nimo as a circular chamber forming a cone, whose top is bent sidewise and whose entrance hole was sealed with two stone slabs, one on top of the other. During my survey in the Mucuchies area, I found a mintoy at Misteque (see Fig. 1). This structure is circu- lar in shape and measures 1.60 m. in dia- meter and 1.20 m. in height. A second mintoy was located in the Llano El Hato area (Figs. 1, 8). It has a square entrance hole, but it was impossible to enter and measure it, because it had been filled with boulders. Outside of the high Andes and especially Mucuchies, mintoyes are unknown in Venezuela. Long (1967) described tombs with lateral chambers and shows their dis- tribution in the New World. They vary great- ly in shape, from simple niches at the foot of the structure to complex chambers. Accord- ing to Long, most of them have been reported from Colombia and Ecuador. It is most likely that the Venezuelan mintoyes, which fall within the simple type of stone constructions, reached the high Andes, either directly or indirectly, from Colombia. Febres Cordero (1920), Jahn (1927), and Lares (1952) mention that the mintoyes were used as tombs by the ab- origines, who buried their dead together with votive material in these shaft graves. Alternatively, these enclosures could have been used for storing grains or tubers. Be- cause stones are very abundant in most of the cultivated fields of the tierra fria region, the soil is improved by removing the larger boulders, which are either piled up or used in the construction of house foundations, fences, and walls. Many of these walls are modern, but there are some walls, several km. long, located in areas uninhabited at present, which may be prehispanic. Agricul- tural terraces are common in Colombia. Reichel-Dolmatoff (1965:124, 158, 159) reports stone-lined terraces from the lower Magdalena region and from the Tairona and Chibcha area. Broadbent (1964:501-504) restudied the terraces first reported by Haury and Cubillos in 1953, in the Chibcha territory, some of which are probably prehis- panic. It is probable that some of the stone structures from Mucuchies served a variety of purposes: for protection against the cold or against hostile groups, as boundary markers, etc. Gasparini (1966:10) mentions</page><page sequence="12">206 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973 .Vv.

No weapons have been recovered, but these may have been made of perishable materials. From the accounts of the chroniclers, and from the abundant surface finds in the area, it can be inferred that the region was densely</page><page sequence="13">Wagner] THE MUCUCHIES PHASE 207 populated before the Spaniards subdued and drastically reduced the aboriginal popula- tion. Their subsistence was based on agricul- ture, hunting, and gathering. The botanical specimens recovered from the excavations, the presence of terraced fields and mintoyes, and the available sources of written informa- tion, all indicate that agriculture was well developed. The presence of charred corn cobs is somewhat puzzling, since due to the low temperature in the Mucuchies area maize does not grow at the 3000 m. level. Mangelsdorf (personal communication) sug- gests that corn may have been replaced by wheat when the latter crop was introduced into the high Andes from Europe. As an alternative I would suggest that it was obtained from nearby lower areas (it grows to around 2400 m. elevation) and that the cobs were stored and eaten when needed. At present the basic crops in the region are potatoes and other cold-resistant tubers that grow only at high altitudes such as rubas (Ullucus tuberosus) and cuibas (Oxalis tuberosa). These crops were also known to the aborigines of the area, but they have not been preserved in the archaeological record, probably due to the acidic soil. Hunting was another important activity, to judge from the bones of mammals and turtles found in the excavations. Whether these animals were only hunted or whether some were kept in semi-domestic form is unknown at present. The picure (Dasyprocta aguti cayana) perhaps was kept by the Indians near their habitations and could be the mute dog (perro mudo) which according to Salas (1908:55) is mentioned frequently in the Historia Natural of Oviedo y Valdis. The description which Oviedo gives of the perro mudo coincides with the description of the picure. Wood (personal communica- tion) states that the nearest living relatives of the chelonian specimens found in Mucuchies are probably Geochelone carbonaria and G. denticulata. These specimens are generally inhabitants of lowland forests and savannahs and were probably transported to Mucuchies by the aborigines while hunting. Mollusc shells in natural state were also found, in- dicating that they were possibly gathered as foodstuffs. The crude and simple pottery found in the area suggests that artistic inclinations were not expressed in the elaboration of ceramic vessels. Nevertheless, the Mucuchies people were skilled manufacturers of ser- pentinite objects and other ornamental stone artifacts, as well as tools used for utilitarian purposes. The literature on wing-shaped pendants and related artifacts is vast, as well as the speculations concerning their use (Wagner 1966:30-35, 1967b:53-56). As far as the Mucuchi'es bat-wing pendants are con- cerned, they seem to have been used as funerary ornaments: at El Mocao Alto they were found in situ lying on the chest of the dead (Fig. 9). The skeletons themselves were covered with stone slabs and surrounded by pieces of raw material of serpentinite and steatite, unfinished specimens and polishing and grinding stones. This seems to be the first time that a joint cemetery and artisans workshop has been reported for the Inter- mediate Area. (A more detailed description of this workshop and burial site will be published elsewhere.) Ceremonial life and burial practices among the Mucuchies people were more elaborate than elsewhere in Venezuela. This has been inferred from the chroniclers and from the presence of mintoyes, incensarios, bat-wing pendants, and microvessels. The latter were probably mortuary repre- sentations of larger vessels or simply used as toys. Cacao seems to have been of par- ticular ceremonial importance. Sim6n (1963, Vol. 11:222) states: "The Indians also offer small cotton blankets... and cacao beans ... there are many chiefs and sorcerers who talk with the devil, from whom they receive orders to offer the fat of cacao, which they grind and cook and which the Spaniards call chorote." This fat was burned in incensarios, which have been found in excavations as well as in the caves and rock shelters of the pdramos near Mucuchies. They are ac- companied by anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic clay and stone figurines. These objects were probably hidden in the caves</page><page sequence="14">208 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973 .7m-, : ?z Of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Trade or some kind of direct or indirect contact with people from lower-lying regions seems to have been an important factor in diversifying the diet for the Mucuchifes people. Zoological remains typical of other zones, such as the tierra caliente Llanos and the lower piedmont areas of the Andes, have been found in Mucuchies. Trade is also inferred from the presence of Cyphoma gibbosa, a marine gastropod that could have been obtained from Lake Maracaibo or the Caribbean. The atypical gold pendant is more likely a trade item from outside of Venezuela, probably Colombia. The most abundant atypical material is the large quantity of serpentinite and steatite plaques. These types of rock exist in sufficient quan- tities for the manufacture of such artifacts only in the Cordillera de la Costa, and in the Paraguana and Guajira peninsulas, in north- ern Venezuela. The presence of sherds of the Mirinday Painted and El Chao Painted- Plastic types from the Carache area, also indicate contact with the tierra templada Mirinday people. CULTURAL PATTERNS Having reconstructed the culture of the Mucuchies people, I shall integrate it into the prehistory of Venezuela in terms of cultural patterns. Acosta Saignes (1952) was the first to treat prehistoric Venezuela in terms of large cultural units, from an ethno- historical point of view. He established cul- ture areas, disregarding time depth and cul-</page><page sequence="15">Wagner] THE MUCUCHIES PHASE 209 tural dynamics. For the Andes he established his "Andean Prehispanic Culture Area" (inhabited by the Proto-historic Timoto- Cuicas), which he defined by listing seventy- five traits. These were grouped under major headings, such as agriculture, social organiza- tion, and religion. Later, Cruxent and Rouse (1958:263-265), on the basis of archaeologi- cal evidence, proposed two centers of devel- opment in Venezuela: one in the Orinoco Basin in the east, and another centering around Lake Maracaibo in the west. Both are linked through a central zone of contact which contains an amalgamation of traits obtained from both directions. The pottery in the eastern center is characterized by plain or annular bases, open bowls, rims decorated with flanges, bevels, or ridges, and vertical strap handles; the decoration con- sists of a series of plastic techniques such as modelling, appliqu6, incision, and punctation. Painting is rare; when present, it is white on red. The main crop is manioc, testified by the presence of budares (griddles for baking cassava); burials and ceremonial aspects are simple. In the western center, on the con- trary, pottery shapes are predominantly ollas and jars instead of bowls; rims tend to be plain; bases are varied and can be plain, annular, leg-ring, or legs of tripod vessels. Decoration consists mainly of monochrome or polychrome painting. Plastic techniques, when present, are secondary. The western center is characterized by maize cultivation as shown by the presence of manos and metates, and burials and ceremonies are complex. My own research in western Venezuela has led me to believe that the previous authors, when they established their cultural divisions overlooked the environmental dif- ferences, giving too simplified a picture of the prehistory of the country. As a result of the work done in Carache and Mucuchies, I have postulated the hypothesis that at least two cultural patterns co-existed in the Venezuelan Andes in late prehispanic times (approximately since A.D. 1000): (1) a Sub- Andean pattern and (2) an Andean pattern (Wagner 1967a, 1967b, 1970). By culture pattern I mean the overall direction and quality (levels of development) of a given phase (culture) or phases (cultures). This concept shares some attributes with the con- cept of series, such as the inclusion of the spatial and temporal dimensions. On the other hand, it is distinguished from series in that it includes more than ceramic traits, and it comprises more than one series. In this sense, culture pattern can be equated with Rouse's (1957) concept of "co-tradition," formulated from Bennett's (1948) concept "area co-tradition" (Wagner 1967b:82). The Venezuelan Sub-Andean pattern is centered in the tierra templada and lies approximately between 800 m. and 2000 m. above sea level. This pattern has been con- firmed from an archaeological and ethno- historical point of view on the basis of my research in the Carache area (located at 1200 m. elevation) which produced the cultural elements that characterize the Sub-Andean pattern. Main traits are: corn (Zea mays) is the basic crop; pottery is elaborate; shapes are complex; the non-utilitarian ware is thin, polished, and well-done; elements of decora- tion consist of painted, plastic, and painted- plastic techniques; stone constructions are lacking; and burials are simple (Wagner 1967b). The Venezuelan Andean pattern is located in the tierra fria (above 2000 m. of elevation). The most important characteris- tics of this pattern are: stone constructions, agricultural terraces, mintoyes, shrine caves, complex burials, and a variety of ceremonial paraphernalia such as incensarios, clay fig- urines, and pendants. Subsistence is based on the cultivation of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), and other potato-like tubers such as cuibas (Oxalis tuberosa) and rubas (Ullucus tuberosus). Pottery is cruder and simpler than the pottery from lower alti- tudes, especially in shapes and elements of decoration. Most of the traits that typify the Andean pattern were found in Mucuchies and, there- fore, the Mucuchies phase has been assigned to this pattern. The Andean pattern is prob- ably more closely related to the Colombian</page><page sequence="16">210 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973 highlands, whereas the Sub-Andean'pattern shows Central American resemblances, especially with Panama and Costa Rica. Although Rouse and Cruxent (1963) did not distinguish between the Andean and Sub-Andean patterns, they hinted at them by suggesting that the high Andes of Venezuela have potato staple as food and that certain traits, such as shaft graves, recall the Andean section of Colombia. In connec- tion with the pottery of the high Andes they state: "Nevertheless, the pottery of the high Andes is related to, and appears to bederived from, the pottery of the rest of Western Vene- zuela and so we prefer to include the high An- des in that division" (Rouse and Cruxent 1963:55). They established fourteen ceramic styles for western Venezuela which belong to the Dabajuroid, Tocuyanoid, and Tierroid series (Fig. 7). Some of these styles belong to the Andean and Sub-Andean patterns, as is the case of Mucuchies and Mirinday, but others more likely cut across these patterns, indicating contacts between them. RELATIONSHIPS AND CONCLUSIONS Cruxent and Rouse (1958:141-142) found that the Mucuchies style is most closely related to the Mirinday style in the Trujillo area. They also were impressed by the general similarities between the Mucuch- ies and the highland Colombian pottery described by Bennett in 1944, and by Haury and Cubillos in 1953. Vargas (1969:71-74) established relationships with other Vene- zuelan styles such as Betijoque, La Mulera, Dabajuro, and Tierra de los Indios (Fig. 7). These observations are confirmed by my finds from Mucuchies. In addition, the protohistoric Mucuchi'es style shares with the older Period III Miquimii style from the Carache area bat-wing pendants, solid legs of tripod vessels, and techniques of plastic decoration. It is likely that the Mucuchies and Mirinday styles both received influences from the older Miquimfi style. The foregoing similarities in ceramic traits are paralleled by similarities in other parts of the culture of the Mucuchies people. Many traits that characterize Mucuchies are also typical of the Chibcha and Tairona phases from Colombia. For all three phases there is documentary as well as archaeological evi- dence. There is more detailed written infor- mation for the Colombian phases, whereas the archaeological chronology is better known for Mucuchi'es (Table I). Compar- isons between the three phases will only refer to protohistoric and early historic man- ifestations, because the origins of all of them are so far unknown. No absolute dates are available for the Tairona material, although recently, Bischof (1969:267) has estimated a time depth of 500/600 to A.D. 1600 on the basis of finds from Nahuange and El Pueblito sites. The same is true for the Chibcha area. To my knowledge, no radio- carbon dates are available so far, and more precise comparisons can be made only when Broadbent (1969) publishes and illustrates in more detail her material from the Sabana de BogotA in Colombia, for which she is begin- ning to see some real time-depth. The Mucuchies and Tairona phases share stone constructions (terraces and stone-lined graves), stone artifacts (mainly winged pen- dants), and pottery (modes of decoration and shape). Concerning Tairona pottery, Reichel-Dolmatoff (1965:150) states: "Decoration consists mainly of modelling, applique strips, incision and excision; painted decoration is extremely rare." Except for excision, all of these techniques are present in the Mucuchies phase. Micro- vessels are also present in both phases. The Mucuchi'es and Chibcha phases had in common well developed agriculture, crops such as potatoes, rubas or ullucus, cuibas or ocas, agricultural terraces, stone chambers, votive material buried with corpses, gold objects, and pottery. The Chibcha phase had a variety of gold objects, and the only specimen found in Mucuchies could have been obtained from that area. Broadbent (1965) described stone-roofed chambers from the Chibcha territory which possibly could have been tombs. They differ from the mintoyes of Mucuchi'es in that they were</page><page sequence="17">Wagner ] THE MUCUCHIES PHASE 211 subterranean chambers. Some of the painted sherds from Mucuchi'es (Fig. 5a) look like certain of Broadbent's types from Colombia, and as in the case of Mucuchies, "Chibcha pottery, although competent and tech- nologically well made, is far less elaborate than most pottery from the lowland chief- doms" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965:165). From the chroniclers' accounts, it has been inferred that the Tairona and Chibcha were socially the most advanced groups in the Intermediate Area in protohistoric and early historic times, and Reichel-Dolmatoff (1965:142) has called them village federa- tions. The federations were composed of people that had achieved a higher level of development than their neighbors, marked by dense population, and an efficient tech- nology, and an integrated religious system. The written information for the Mucuchi'es people is very limited, and with our present knowledge, it is better not to make infer- ences in this respect for the Venezuelan aborigines of the high Andes. From the present reconstruction, it can be inferred that the Mucuchfes people shared in a simplified fashion the way of life of their Colombian neighbors. The traits that they had in common include stone construc- tions, subsistence based mainly on well- developed agriculture, and pottery and stone artifacts. Other features, such as more com- plex architecture, metallurgy, and ap- parently more advanced social, political, and religious systems are absent from Mucuchies. It is likely that the Mucuchfes people received many of the traits that characterize the Andean cultural pattern from the Central Andes, via Colombia, late in proto- historic times. To conclude, the Mucuchies phase re- presents a manifestation of the Andean pat- tern. The presence of additional features not postulated for the Venezuelan Andean pat- tern, such as corn and painted-plastic pottery types, typical of the Sub-Andean pattern, indicates that direct or indirect con- tact of the tierra fria people with those of other ecological zones (such as the tierra templada and tierra caliente) was prevalent in proto-historic times in Western Venezuela. Finally, it seems that the Mucuchi'es phase is an extension of the Andean cultural pattern into Western Venezuela from Colombia, and that the tierra fria zone of the Venezuelan Andes was probably marginal in the cultural development of the Andes as a whole.
