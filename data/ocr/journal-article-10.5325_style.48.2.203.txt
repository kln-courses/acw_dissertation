<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> James Carney University of Oxford Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective  Fiction: A Cognitivist Appraisal 1. Introduction  The last decade has seen the cognitive paradigm in literary studies come into its  own as an important—and publicly audible—voice in the humanities (Chace et al).  Largely, this is because cognitive literary studies have expanded beyond their initial  focus on literary form, and into studies of historical periods, specific genres and  individual authors (Jaén and Simon 13‐32). These latter expedients, by showcasing  the usefulness of cognitivist methodologies to a wider scholarly audience, have  been instrumental in securing their acceptance as a legitimate tool for literary  analysis. Certainly, this process has also attracted controversy: for many critics,  the cognitive approach amounts to a surrender, where the interpretive imperative  of the humanities is subordinated to the empirical agenda and cultural prestige of  the (pseudo)‐sciences.1 However, for all that one may appreciate the scepticism  underwriting such claims, it is difficult to square it with the lack of dogmatism  in the work done by cognitivist scholars. Cognitive literary studies is an eclectic  undertaking, and just as its practitioners draw on the cognitive sciences for insight,  so, too, do they draw on other schools of literary interpretation and scholarship. The  result is a mosaic of approaches that refuses any common description beyond that of  wishing to understand how the human mind negotiates its place in the world through  culture. Given the plurality of responses that this inquiry has already generated in the  humanities, it is hard to disagree with Alan Richardson’s claim that “the somewhat  dazzling variety of approaches that continue to proliferate within the new field [is]  a sign of its early strength rather than amateurishness or disarray” (xii).  In the present article, I further complement the range of approaches available to  cognitive literary studies by looking at detective fiction through the lens of research  on religious cognition. To this extent, I reflect innovations like Lisa Zunshine’s  (121–141) ground‐breaking account of the genre using Theory of Mind; however,  where Zunshine takes the mentalising capacities of ordinary human agents as her  point of departure, I suggest that detective fiction is in fact indebted to our conception  Style: Volume 48, No. 2, Summer 2014 203 </page> <page sequence="2"> 204 James Carney of how supernatural agents construct mental representations. Specifically, I show that  developments in the psychology of religion on the concept of “privileged epistemic  access” (Bering and Johnson 120) have an unexpected bearing on representations  of the literary detective. That is to say, I maintain that the detective’s “seeming  clairvoyance in investigation” secularises the unmediated access to the self’s mental  states often assigned to certain classes of punitive supernatural being (Walton 458).  The background to this claim comes from empirical work in ethnography, which  focuses on cognitive regularities in the representation of supernatural agents like  gods, spirits, and ghosts. A crucial element of this research deals with the cross‐ cultural recurrence of supernatural beings that ‘police’ moral and social norms. As  Scott Atran puts it, these “supernatural agents ... function as moral big brothers who  keep a constant vigil to dissuade would‐be cheaters and free riders” (112). Notably,  these punitive supernatural witnesses are not just privy to actions, but to thoughts  as well; in Bering and Johnson’s words, they are “envisioned as knowing, rather  than merely inferring from observable behaviors, the self’s true intentions” (120).  It is precisely this supernatural ability to penetrate into the thoughts and motives  of others that is meant by the term ‘privileged epistemic access.’  On the face of it, these results may seem to have little relevance for an  appreciation of the detective story—especially given the frequent identification  of the detective as the representative of rationalist progressivism by critics like  E.J. Wagner and J. Kenneth Van Dover. Nevertheless, as I explore below, there is  a remarkable coincidence between the rhetorical characterisation of the literary  detective and the traits assigned to punitive supernatural agents: the detective,  in D.A. Miller’s words, offers the prospect of an “absolute surveillance under  which everything would be known, incriminated, policed” (10)—a characteristic  that is entirely consonant with an all‐seeing supernatural witness. For all that the  detective advertises his stunning deductions as the product of minute observation  and cerebral prowess, the fact remains that his achievements in reading the thoughts  of others are functionally indistinguishable from magic. As Srdjan Smajić notes,  “Clairvoyance, telepathy and intuition ... are not just uncannily reminiscent of  the detective’s mind‐reading powers and miraculous feats of deductive reasoning,  but are versions of these practices, and vice versa” (181). Thus, there are strong  prima facie grounds for further investigating the connection between the literary  detective and cross‐cultural intuitions about the supernatural. I pursue this in the  pages below by looking at the different ways in which detective fiction rhetorically  endows the detective with the privileged epistemic access associated with punitive  supernatural enforcers.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective Fiction 205 Then there are the texts themselves. As no study short of monograph length  can do justice to the full volume of materials available, I focus on material from  the classic period of detective fiction—namely, that produced between the 1840s  and the 1930s. Within this, I deal with three bodies of work: Edgar Allan Poe’s  Dupin stories, the Sherlock Holmes narratives of Arthur Conan Doyle, and G.K.  Chesterton’s Father Brown series. The reason for this particular selection is  that the identified narratives established and consolidated the genre of detective  fiction—and in doing so, determined the form of much of the detective fiction that  was to follow. Thus, if these texts can be shown to equivocate between rational  and supernatural modes of thinking in the manner that I propose, then there are  reasonable grounds for thinking that this trait can be found in other texts of the  same genre. Certainly, I could go even further and cite examples of detective fiction  where the supernatural is explicitly included (Agatha Christie’s tales of Mr. Harley  Quin being one obvious example) as evidence in support of my claims. However,  to do so would offer relatively little critical reward, as the supernatural ‘logic’ of  such narratives is already visible on the surface. Instead, a far more rewarding  enterprise involves using this ‘logic’ to resolve critical problems with detective  fiction that have thus far resisted solution in the secondary literature. As we shall  see, this strategy delivers a number of unanticipated results that invite us to rethink  our understanding of the literary detective.  2. Theoretical Background Viewing detective fiction through the lens of religious cognition may seem like a  counterintuitive move, given the ostensibly realist commitments of the genre. This  dissonance becomes even more pronounced when one notes that, at roughly the same  time as the detective genre was emerging, police work was being revolutionised by  the introduction of forensic techniques and the emergence of the police detective  as a professional role (Shpayer‐Makov 62–146). Nevertheless, while the rhetoric  of science impacted strongly on the literary representation of the detective, he also  shares his substance with a markedly different tradition—that of nineteenth‐century  spiritualism. Chris Willis establishes this much when he notes that both phenomena  “began in the mid‐nineteenth century and were widely popular in Britain from the  turn of the century to the 1930s. Both attempted to explain mysteries. The medium’s  role can be seen as similar to that of a detective in a murder case. Both are trying  to make the dead speak in order to reveal a truth” (60). The question this poses is  whether the analogy between the detective and the medium is accidental, or if points  to more fundamental link between the two phenomena. My claim is that this link  </page> <page sequence="4"> 206 James Carney does exist, and that it can be found in a core concept in the cognitive psychology  of religious belief: the fear of supernatural punishment hypothesis (FSPH).  The idea behind the FSPH is that the cognitively costly practice of maintaining  a belief in supernatural entities can be explained if these beliefs play a causal role in  disincentivising individuals from breaking social norms (Atran 114–47). That is, a  conviction that punitive supernatural witnesses always observe infractions is good  insurance against actual witnesses who sometimes observe them, as the fear of the  former obviates punishment from the latter. Ultimately, proponents of the FSPH  maintain, this would have provided a selective advantage that fostered a widespread  disposition to believe in supernatural agents. Thus, it seems that the FSPH offers a  potential source for the link between the detective and the supernatural enforcers  discussed above. The question is, does the evidence support the FSPH? In this regard, a large body of ethnographic work identifies the presence of  the FSPH as a constant in cross‐cultural cognition. Recent surveys by Bering  and Johnson (2005), Atkinson and Bourrat (2011), Dominic Johnson (2004),  Bourrat, Atkinson, and Dunbar (2011), and Johnson and Krüger (2004) have all  affirmed the view that “individual differences in beliefs about God, the afterlife  and morality across cultures support the predictions of the supernatural monitoring  and supernatural punishment hypotheses” (Atkinson and Bourrat 48). Certainly,  this does not mean that every culture holds all supernatural agents to be punitive,  or that punitive action by such agents is everywhere conceived of in the same way  or assigned the same cultural weight. It does, however, ratify the view that belief  in punitive supernatural witnesses is not a function of local cultural norms, but  instead reflects something more fundamental about how human beings conceive  of the moral universe.  It can be objected that such surveys say little about how supernatural intuitions  function in secular contexts. However, a large number of experimental studies on  western populations have confirmed the view that, even among non‐believers, notions  of justice, punishment and quasi‐supernatural agency consistent with FSPH recur  with surprising frequency. Bering, McLeod, and Shackelford’s ‘haunted laboratory’  scenario provides the most dramatic illustration of this. Here, the experimenters  presented a sample of undergraduates with a contrived opportunity to cheat for  a prize in a computerised spatial intelligence test. Unknown to themselves, the  students were split into three groups: a control group that performed the test without  any intervention; an ‘In Memoriam’ (IM) group who read on their screens that the  experiment was dedicated to a deceased graduate student; and a ‘Ghost Story’ (GS)  group that were casually informed by the experimenter that the ghost of the same  </page> <page sequence="5"> Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective Fiction 207 student was sometimes seen in the lab. The results were unequivocal: the students  who were primed by the ghost story were far less likely to consider cheating than  those in the other two conditions.2 Thus, in the absence of any explicit religious  framework to guide their intuitions, students “adopted a policy of social compliance,  despite the temptation to cheat, when faced with the prospect of a supernatural agent  in the immediate environment” (376). Clearly, then, experimental results confirm  ethnographic conclusions by showing that secular populations are no less subject  to the FSPH than those populations for whom it takes a culturally elaborated form. 3. Quasi-Omniscience, Supernatural Rhetoric   and the Literary Detective In Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue,” one of the narrator’s first actions is to record  Dupin’s boast “that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms”  (533). Watson, similarly, is introduced to Holmes’s ‘Science of Deduction’ by way  of an article in which Holmes claims to be able, “by a momentary expression, a  twitch of a muscle or the glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts”  (A Study in Scarlet 23). Chesterton’s Father Brown, for his part, persists until he  penetrates completely into the mental processes of his target: “I wait till I know I  am inside a murderer, thinking his thoughts, wrestling with his passions ... Till I am  really a murderer” (“The Secret of Father Brown” 817). Clearly, by showcasing the  detective’s access to the thoughts of third parties, these examples evince a form of  privileged epistemic access. Just as punitive supernatural agents cannot be deceived  by fabulation because they are privy to the contents of one’s mind, neither does the  detective’s appreciation of motive and behaviour allow for deception. One could go  a great deal further and amass more examples of how both of these traits—quasi‐ omniscience and punitive judgment—recur in representations of the detective; but  in a certain sense, this would be pointless. Every student of the detective genre is  already aware of these conventions, so to exhaustively rehearse where they occur  in the above three examples is only to labour the point. Instead, I suggest that it is  more productive to assume the presence of the FSPH, and see if it can be used to  resolve critical problems in the relevant texts.  Starting with Poe’s Dupin stories, the problem for which the FSPH pays the  most obvious dividends is why narratives that fetishize deductive rationality should  be so singularly unsuccessful in representing it. For all of his rhetorical excess in  identifying Dupin as an adept in the art of logical analysis, the narrator’s account  of the latter’s achievements leaves the reader little choice but to infer the presence  of supernatural abilities. As R. Austin Freeman notes, “The reader is astonished  and marvels how such an apparently impossible feat could be performed. Then  </page> <page sequence="6"> 208 James Carney Dupin explains; but his explanation is totally unconvincing, and the impossibility  remains” (16). In fact, throughout the three narratives this same pattern is visible:  the narrator exhorts the reader to dispense with supernatural explanation, only to  present her with situations and conclusions that are simply not rationally credible.  Thus, the question concerns why, at the very point that detective fiction emerged  as a genre, it should so visibly fail to live up to its own prescriptions.  One uncharitable solution is to cite this mismatch as a deficiency on the  part of Poe’s literary talent. Certainly, detractors like T.S. Eliot, for whom Poe’s  intellect was no more than that of “a highly gifted young person before puberty”  (35), would be quick to ratify this. However, such criticisms run counter to Poe’s  extraordinary impact on popular and literary culture. A more likely solution is  offered by the FSPH, which suggests that Poe, though nominally committed to  rationalism, was nevertheless centrally concerned with intuitions derived from  supernatural cognition. Support for this conjecture comes from Dupin’s rhetorical  marking as belonging to the realm of the all‐knowing dead. He is, for instance,  “enamoured of the Night for her own sake,” and when the “sable divinity would  not herself dwell with us,” he and the narrator “closed all the massy shutters” and  lit “a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and  feeblest of rays” (“Murders” 532‐3). Later, in “The Purloined Letter,” the same point  is emphasised further when Dupin asserts to the Prefect of the Parisian police that  “If [the matter at issue] is any point requiring reflection ... we shall examine it to  better purpose in the dark” (975). It is impossible to miss the iconography at work  here, which, in its references to darkness, tapers and the night, is simultaneously  funereal and necromantic.  In fact, one can go a step further and trace this iconography to its likely origin,  which is in classical accounts of supernatural. In particular, as Lars Albinus notes  (27), the Greeks and the Romans held that the dead could be magically recalled to  prophesy the future and reveal secrets from the past. Considered from this perspective,  Dupin becomes both the source of arcane knowledge and the priest who elicits  it—he is, in effect, analogous to the sibyls of the ancient world who channelled the  gods while overseeing their cults. Remarkably, this sibylline association is directly  evoked in the description of Dupin’s demeanour when he exercises his analytic  abilities. As the narrator records, “His manner at these moments was frigid and  abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor,  rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for deliberateness and  entire distinction of the enunciation” (“Murders” 533). Note here the parallels with  Virgil’s Cumaean Sibyl whose “bosom heaves, and she is taller to behold ... nor  </page> <page sequence="7"> Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective Fiction 209 has her voice a mortal ring since she now feels the nearer breath of the divinity”  (46‐8). Clearly, Poe is using his knowledge of the classics (attested to by Darlene  Unrue, among others) to identify Dupin as the quasi‐omniscient bearer of truths  that cannot be secured by ordinary mortals.  Thus, the FSPH explains the slippage of the rational into the supernatural that  forms such a problem in the appreciation of Poe’s detective fiction. In creating a  moral monitor who is aligned with the rule of law, Poe would have found himself  delineating a concept for which a pre‐reflective idea already existed—that of an  omniscient supernatural witness. Moreover, given that this idea already existed in  several cultural forms, Poe’s use of it would have been both intuitively satisfying  and culturally sanctioned. Thus, there should be no surprise that Poe’s representation  of Dupin incorporates the content of the FSPH. Indeed, it may well be because of  the intuitive plausibility of the FSPH that Dupin occupies his canonical position  as the prototype of the literary detective.  Moving on to Conan Doyle’s work, the principal issue that emerges here is the  uneven nature of Sherlock Holmes’s knowledge. On the face of it, Holmes—much  as the FSPH would lead one to expect—exhibits near‐infallibility; in Robert Paul’s  words, “his universal surveillance and unfailing rightness ensure that all will be well  in this best of all possible worlds” (58). Nevertheless, Watson notes that Holmes’s  acquaintance with literature, philosophy, and astronomy is nil—with even the fact  of the earth orbiting the sun, famously, falling outside his knowledge (Study 21).  For a man whose “marvellous faculty” (The Sign of Four 93) for deduction allows  him to infer from scratches on a pocket watch that Watson’s brother had “good  prospects but ... threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with  occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink ... died,” (Sign  92) these are quite remarkable lapses in basic observation. Indeed, even conceding  their expository value as an index of character, they pose rather practical problems.  As Rory Kraft notes, “surely there would be some aspect of these disciplines which  could lead a consulting detective to solve a case more quickly” (185)—a perfectly  reasonable supposition, given that, over the course of the stories, we find Holmes  “quoting Goethe in German, discoursing learnedly on Buddhism in Ceylon, quoting  the medieval Persian poet Hafiz, rhapsodizing over concert music, discussing the  novelist George Meredith writing a scholarly treatise on sixteenth century choral  music, and reading his pocket Plutarch” (Costello and Bassham 129).  What are we to make of this intellectual inconsistency? Holmes himself  proposes that the human brain has limited storage capacity, so it “is of the highest  importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones”  </page> <page sequence="8"> 210 James Carney (Study 21). However, given the intellectual proclivities just cited, the one person  this is not true of is Holmes, so it is difficult so see why he should offer it as a self‐ justification. The answer, clearly, must lie elsewhere. My suggestion is that the FSPH  offers a more satisfying solution to the problem. In particular, the notion of domain  relevance has a direct bearing on Holmes’s deficient inventory of facts. To clarify,  this concept picks out the way in which supernatural agents are often represented as  operating in well‐defined spheres of action, outside of which they rarely stray. When  it comes to the class of supernatural agents who deal with moral monitoring, this  produces an interesting effect—specifically, our theological belief that such agents  are omniscient conflicts with the limits we implicitly assign to anthropomorphic  beings. The result, according to Barrett and Keil, is “that subjects possess and use  at least two different parallel God concepts depending on the context” (243). In  day‐to‐day moral reasoning, Pascal Boyer suggests that the context favours the  ‘anthropomorphic’ over the ‘theological’ representation, and that this results in  God being assigned a form of strategic omniscience that is restricted to the moral  sphere (Religion Explained 180‐3). That is to say, despite believing that God is  omniscient, I will intuitively assign him the limits of an anthropomorphic observer,  and correspondingly assume that he husbands his cognitive resources by focusing  solely on moral infractions. Thus, while God’s attitude to my extra‐marital affair  may be of major concern to me, I am unlikely to be particularly exercised by his  intentional state vis-à-vis the contents of my garden shed.  Returning to Holmes, this offers a useful explanation of why his ignorance  in matters of common (if impractical) knowledge should be so foregrounded. If  Holmes functions as a secular implementation of a supernatural punisher, then it  follows that non‐moral concerns should fall outside his range of interests—and  this, indeed, is precisely what we see. However, as soon as these ostensibly non‐ moral concerns take on a strategic value in the detection of moral wrongdoing,  they immediately come within the range of Holmes’s knowledge. To this extent,  Holmes’s inconsistent encyclopaedia reproduces the domain specificity intuitively  assigned to supernatural moral monitors—and thus the FSPH elegantly resolves a  puzzling textual inconsistency in the Holmes narratives. When it comes to Chesterton’s Father Brown stories, the situation is analogous  to Poe’s work, in that the main problem concerns the tension between rational and  supernatural conceptions of the world. However, unlike Poe, Chesterton’s must  adjudicate between three rather than two metaphysical positions—namely, whether  the world is supernatural, whether the world is rational or whether the world is some  mixture of the rational and the supernatural. As a Catholic apologist, Chesterton  </page> <page sequence="9"> Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective Fiction 211 naturally adopted the third position; what is interesting is how the Father Brown  stories allow him to do this—and here, again, the FSPH proves its usefulness. In  particular, it clarifies the structural problem of how Chesterton uses the detective  genre as “a symbol of higher mysteries,” (“How to Write a Detective Story” 127),  even when the genre’s realist orientation would seem to preclude him from doing so. Chesterton’s first move in endowing the detective story with a spiritual allegory  comes, as indicated, with dismissing both the supernaturalist and the rationalist  positions. Father Brown, for instance, identifies the villain, Flambeau, as a fake  priest because he attacks reason—an expedient that Brown claims is “bad theology”  (“The Blue Cross” 27). Equally, new‐age beliefs are challenged in stories like the  “Eye of Apollo” and “The Wrong Shape”—just as an over credulous subscription  to supernatural explanations is chided in such stories as “The Miracle of Moon  Crescent” and “The Dagger With Wings.” When critiquing rationalist materialism,  by contrast, Father Brown argues that reason alone is insufficient for reaching higher  truths; for this, spiritual grace is also needed. Thus, his faith allows him to claim  that it “really is more natural to believe a preternatural story, that deals with things  we don’t understand, than a natural story that contradicts things we do understand”  (“The Curse of the Golden Cross” 50). The upshot of all this, as W.W. Robson notes,  is that Father Brown “remains true both to traditional theology, and to the genre of  the detective story, in never decrying reason” (67). Instead, what we see is a type  of dialectic, where supernaturalism and rationalism are counterpoised with a view  to establishing a synthesis that overcomes the limitations of either. The question  concerns how (and if) Chesterton succeeds in bringing about this synthesis.  Here, once more, the FSPH leads us to the answer. If Father Brown is to function  as a punitive moral witness, then the FSPH predicts that he should exhibit actual or  quasi‐omniscience. Moreover, for the reasons just discussed, this omniscience can  be neither wholly rational nor wholly supernatural in origin. Chesterton’s response  to this must be one of the neatest solutions to the problem of quasi‐omniscience  in all of detective fiction: Father Brown’s encyclopaedic knowledge of criminality  comes through confession. In his words to Flambeau, “Has it never struck you that  a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins is not likely to be wholly  unaware of human evil?” (“The Blue Cross” 27). It takes little analysis to see how  this innovation reproduces the FSPH in a manner that satisfies both secular and  religious protocols. On the secular side, the fact of Father Brown hearing confession  is entirely independent of its sacramental truth, as he still gains quasi‐omniscient  knowledge of human evil in a rationally plausible way. On the religious side,  Chesterton would have been keenly aware of the meaning of confession in Catholic  </page> <page sequence="10"> 212 James Carney theology, which holds that “no ... priest, simply as an individual man, however  pious or learned, has the power to forgive sins. This power belongs to God alone;  but He can and does exercise it through the ministration of men” (Herbermann et al  619). In this sense, when Father Brown announces confession as the source of his  knowledge of human failings, he is at the same time insinuating God—the ultimate  supernatural witness—into his source of information. Naturally, this articulates a  core feature of the FSPH by indirectly linking an invisible supernatural witness to  transgressions in thought and action.   Clearly, then, Chesterton’s choice of a priest as his protagonist allows him  to volunteer the secular detective narrative as a “symbol of higher mysteries.”  Throughout the stories, the only supernatural reality admitted is that sanctioned by  the Christian sacraments; outside of these, the rational order prevails. The result is  that reason is presented as the lumen naturale of the philosophers, which, though  capable of establishing profane truths and ruling out gross superstition, nevertheless  falls short of the truths of faith. For the latter, divine grace is required—and this  grace can (for Chesterton) only be found in the Catholic Church. Correspondingly,  when it is recorded that Father Brown “had averted a crime and, perhaps, saved a  soul, merely by listening to a few footsteps in a passage” (“The Queer Feet” 57),  what is really being recounted is how the utilizing of reason in pursuit of secular  ends leads to the exercise of grace—in this case, the repentance of Flambeau. Thus,  the FSPH plays a crucial role in establishing the Father Brown stories as spiritual  allegories in which “the great human adventure of fall and redemption, sin and  salvation, [are] mirrored ... in crime and restoration” (Spencer 13).  What emerges from all of these considerations is that refracting classic detective  fiction through the FSPH illuminates a number of problems and inconsistencies in  the critical appreciation of the genre. What remains unresolved is why this oscillation  between the rational and the supernatural should emerge, via detective fiction, in the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries—especially when the evidence suggests that the  intuitions underwriting it are the common inheritance of human beings everywhere.  By way of conclusion to the present essay, I shall now address this issue. 4. Conclusion In his famous assessment of Tennyson’s In Memoriam, T.S. Eliot cites it as a religious  poem not “because of the quality of its faith but because of the quality of its doubt”  (“Tennyson, In Memoriam” 172). Though pithy critical judgments cannot replace  historical scholarship in identifying the spirit of an era, Eliot is doubtless correct  in interpreting Tennyson’s equivocal faith as the symptom of a time that “had, for  the most part, no hold on permanent things, on permanent truths about man and  </page> <page sequence="11"> Supernatural Intuitions and Classic Detective Fiction 213 God and life and death” (“In Memoriam” 173). Certainly, this is not to say that the  nineteenth century can be reduced to a simple transition from credulous faith to  rational scepticism—as Sydney Eisen suggests, the historical situation is far more  complicated than this. Nevertheless, when one traces a line from the qualified deism  of the eighteenth century to the militant atheism of the twentieth and twenty‐first,  it becomes difficult to disagree with those historians who argue that the long‐term  trend saw “a shift to ever‐more liberal and tolerant forms of religion and eventually  to benign indifference” (Bruce 38). On the face of it, this tendency may seem to offer a ready‐made solution to the  problem of why detective fiction should have emerged when it did. By secularising  supernatural intuitions, detective fiction would, on this view, have compensated  for the absence (or decline) in socially sanctioned religiosity. This much, at least,  is suggested by critics like Michael Saler and Robert Paul, who argue, in Paul’s  words, that “detective fiction ... appeals directly to those moral and spiritual roots  of society unconsciously affirmed and endorsed by the readers” (7). However,  while this supposition undoubtedly contains a portion of the truth, it fails to explain  the uncomfortable shoehorning of supernatural elements into a realist genre that  characterises early detective fiction. After all, if it is simply a matter of compensation,  then any number of fantastical punishers would do the job more effectively than the  (relatively) understated detective. Here, I suggest an alternative hypothesis—namely,  that the decline in religious literalism was countered by demographic trends that  activated a preoccupation with supernatural punishers, and that detective fiction  emerged as a cultural formation that compromised between these opposing pressures. To see why this might be so, it is probably best to start with the demographics.  As is well known, the late‐eighteenth century saw a rise in anxiety about population  growth—an anxiety that was, to a certain extent, justified. As Victor bailey notes,  the huge growth in the population of the western world between 1840 and 1940  brought with a range of problems, not least among which was a corresponding  growth in crime and criminality (94–125). However, empirical studies suggest that  population growth has another unusual side effect: it promotes belief in punitive  supernatural enforcers. On the one hand, this is shown by analyses that correlate  larger community size with moralizing gods (or moralizing institutions associated  with gods)3; on the other, Lauren et al offer evidence that a cognitively salient belief  in moralizing gods lessens the desire to punish norm‐breakers (that is, punishment  is assigned to supernatural agents rather than the self). The idea is that the human  ability to track the alliances and enmities that make up social relationships has a  limit (Dunbar 186–9), and that when actual social demands exceed this limit, cultural  </page> <page sequence="12"> 214 James Carney prosthetics like religion come into play that seek to neutralise the gap between  cognitive architecture and the demands that are placed on it. Thus, I argue that  two counter‐tendencies emerged over the nineteenth‐century: a movement towards  greater levels of secularism engendered by the growth of scientific rationalism;  and an increased propensity to believe in supernatural punishers activated by the  growth in population and the rise of major cities. Though various solutions to this problem are possible, one of the least cognitively  costly involves resolving it in the counterfactual reality of cultural representations  (Sperber 113). And this, precisely, is what we see in detective fiction. As explored  above, detective fiction explores the different ways in which the FSPH can be  integrated with a secular or rationalist worldview. Sometimes, the result is reasonably  successful, such as when Chesterton draws upon the pre‐existing solutions that  Catholicism has offered to this problem; in others, such as Poe’s Dupin stories, the  result is a metaphysical failure, even if the narratives themselves were a popular  success. In all cases, one sees the same thing, which is the symbolic amplification  and elaboration of a contradiction thrown up by historical experience. Thus, far  from being a compensation for absent social forms, detective fiction is an attempt  by competing cognitive, demographic and ideological pressures to arrive at a  compromise in the symbolic sphere. Given that this solution can only be ratified by way of a sustained historical  survey, I can only offer it here as a provisional response. What is certain, however,  is that any answer as to why detective fiction emerged when it did cannot be arrived  at without knowledge of the historical forces that operate upon culture. As I have  shown, detective fiction is shaped by human beings are innately disposed to think  about the world. At the same time, different cultural and historical imperatives will  use pre‐reflective ideas to different ends. For this reason, I submit that the study of  detective fiction can only proceed by being sensitive to the two realities—mental  and historical—that not alone determine what is culturally important, but also how  this importance is represented and communicated to its audience.
