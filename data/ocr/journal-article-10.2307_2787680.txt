Blinkeniberg. al2 Cambridge University, Press. h In this excellent and unpretentious little work the author sets out to trace tlle history of the thunder weapon as it figures at various periods in Greek Art andl Literature. To do so he lhas gone far afield and gathered evidence from remote and unexpected sources, much of it from modern Denmark, Indlia, and even Thibet; but he uses it with discretion and restrainit. He distinguishes two primitive conlceptionls of the force which is active in the thtunder-stroke, or more strictly in the lightning. In the first and more widely spread the stroke is dealt by something conceived as resembling a human weapon. Hence comes the belief in "'thunder-stones," still locally surviving. These in modern times take various shapes, but the weapon was most often conceived as an axe, at first naturally of stone, then later of bronze. In later times this is of course the weapon of a thunder-god, buit before anthropomorphic religion it is itself the god, if the word may be used, and worshipped accordingly. These facts, wlich seem well established, throw a welcome light on the axes which figure so largely as objects of worship in the recent finds in Crete. They appear to represent the earlier, as the axe of Zeus Labraundeus, in the author's opinion, represenits the later stage of the conception. In the second conception, which seems to have prevailed chiefly in Mesopo- tamia, attention is concentrated rather on the lightning itself than oni its effect. Hence we have as its symbol, not anl axe, but a conventional representation of lightning ; some form of zigzag pattern, developing later into a pronged weapoln. This reappears in Greece as the trident of Poseidon, and with a reduplication of the prongs, wlhich is found also in Assyria and elsewhere, as the familiar heraunos of Zeus. Once more the evidence is good, and it is characteristic of the writer's sanity that he does not attempt to prove that the trident, whatever its origin, was not a fish-spear in the eyes of the classical Greek. The book contains much other matter of initerest and well deserves study. F. R. EARP.</page></plain_text>
