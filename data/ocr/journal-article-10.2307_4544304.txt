I. IT cannot be denied that questions concerning knowledge, and in particular the special form of knowledge proper to human beings, are among the most delicate that the philo- sopher has to consider. They are also the most radical of all his problems, and their answers are influential over the whole range of philosophical theory. No one who has followed the Humian analysis with insight, or the more precise expression of it in recent times with attention, will be disposed to approach these problems lightly or in any partisan spirit. Here, at least, the utmost candour is not merely an advantage, or a counsel of prudence, but a categorical imperative of the intellect. Not that its demand is easy to meet: for the philosopher, with his interest in clearness and rationality of conception, it is perhaps most difficult of all. For there is dispute at the very threshold of the inquiry about the nature of the ultimate data and criteria, while the further we pursue the inquiries the more paradoxical are our conclusions apt to appear. But we must not despair, or permit ourselves to sink into any easy dogmatism. I think we are sufficiently on our guard against what I may call dogmatisms of the right, idola theatri in the grand manner; at the moment they are too unpopular to be generally seductive. I am not so sure about our immunity to dogmatisms of the left, whose more subtle enticements lurk in definitions and restrictions that quietly determine the trend of the inquiry, and even necessitate its conclusions. Nor can we safeguard ourselves against such tendencies by rejecting definition and restriction T</page><page sequence="2">162 H. F. HALLETT. at the outset of the inquiry, for the very question at issue is our right to denominate our various kinds of belief, opinion, conviction, as knowledge. If then, with a fine intellectual Spartanism, we narrowly restrict ourselves to what is susceptible of verification in sense-experience, we shall probably find that we are committed to the conclusions of Hume and his modern positivist associates about the limits of knowledge. Thus the prior question is seen to concern the validity of the restriction. By what right do we confine knowledge strictly to the special capacity of the human knower to take what he is given in particular sense-percep- tion, in the form in which it is given, subjected it may be to precise analysis, but carefully pruned of all structural modification and addition ? One reply would of course be that we have a right to believe in what we are strictly given, and all that it entails, but no right to believe in what we ourselves supply. But however valid this principle may be, it remains most difficult to apply; for we have no assurance that what appears to be given to us is really given in the form in which it appears, and can thus be taken at its face-value. For example, among the data of sense-per- ception are those we are accustomed to call our sense- organs, and experience seems to teach us that modifica- tions of these organs produce effects on the other perceptual data, or at least are accompanied or followed by changes in them. Now even the appearance of such a possibility that one part of the prima facie-given is supplying the remainder, or modifying its character (and, incidentally, modifying also its own character as a prima facie-given), is sufficient, if not to throw doubt upon the precise nature of the given, at least to confuse the conception of " givenness ", and to render primafacie-givenness an insecure ground upon which to make all knowledge depend. If then, it may be argued, we are compelled to face the possible imperative to go beneath the prima facie-given in our search for certainty, why should we subject ourselves to these stringent limitations at all ? Let me formulate the question in a less partisan form: what grounds can we have for releasing ourselves from the restrictions in question ?</page><page sequence="3">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 163 That, of course, was the problem proposed to himself by Kant, a problem that he sought to answer by pointing to characteristic regions of human knowledge (or what were commonly accepted as such) that were in his view patently dependent on a synthetic activity of the mind. In other words, extant human knowledge involves more than receptivity, it is dependent upon mental spontaneity. The purely receptive mind could possess no knowledge at all- would not really be a mind, for even the animal conscious- ness exhibits spontaneity in the minimal form of the association of data. I need hardly point out that such an argument is circular in appearance, or only escapes circularity of appearance by means of the dogma that pure receptivity can provide no knowledge. The truth of the sciences is assumed in order to show how they can be true. The question whether they are true has not even been discussed. But although it has not been discussed, the question has in fact been answered; for in admitting to knowledge the elements said to be due to mental spontaneity, in removing the initial restrictions, the scientific objects have been conceded to be truly known only at the expense of denying that they are truly objects, i.e., realities ; they become only courtesy-objects, objects by verbal definition, mind-depend- ent phenomena. What Kant has publicly given us with one hand and a flourish, he has meanly pilfered from our pocket with the other. Let us look a little more closely at his account of the dual sources of human knowledge, receptivity and spon- taneity. Through sensibility something is given us, through understanding something is done in relation to the given. You remember the famous passage in the Critick of Pure Reason :-" Without sensibility no object would be given us, and without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, perceptions without conceptions are blind . . . The understanding cannot perceive, and the senses cannot think. Only by their union can knowledge arise."* For the purpose I have in view it will not be necessary to trouble you with a detailed * Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, Part 2, I. T 2</page><page sequence="4">164 H. F. HALLETT. account and criticism of Kant's position as it is summed up in this passage, with its distinctions of the given and the thought, the blind content and the empty structure, the sensibility and the understanding, the materials of sense and the perceptual and conceptual forms, thus sliding off into the somewhat different distinction of perception and conception. It is easy to understand how this new method of meeting Hume's sceptical analysis took possession of Kant's mind, and blinded him both to its real circularity and also to its uncritical acceptance of the dogma that only blind, unformed, content can be given, and that structures must in all cases be supplied to the content by the knowing mind. Even his own clear apprehension that the prima facie-given of perception is always so far formed as to be temporal, and with external sense-objects also spatial, did not bring home to him the possibility of dissociating the distinction of matter and form, content and structure, from that of given and supplied by mind. The perceptual forms of space and time in fact fall uncomfortably between the two stools. All this should have set Kant's mind thinking very seriously about the sources of the duality that he had variously detected in human knowledge. But apparently it did not, and he was content to go on with the assumption, incoherent as it was with his own doctrine, that its source is the duality of mind and things. This is, of course, only one more example of the liability of the mind, perhaps even greater when it is in other ways deeply penetrative, to overlook the most obvious incoherencies in its haste and anxiety to resolve most urgent problems. For Kant, indeed, the position in which he stood was even more treacherous, for his new theory itself dissuaded him from making the very inquiries that might have led to his discovery of the source of his error (as I venture to call it): for an inquiry into the rationale of this dualism of sense and thought in the unity of knowledge would itself pass beyond possible knowledge, as thus expounded, to metaphysics, which in his prevailing positivistic mood of the Critick of Pure Reason could not reasonably be undertaken. But what,.1 ask, could be more mischievously metaphysical in</page><page sequence="5">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 165 this sense than the assumption that I have questioned ? Further, it was his tracing of the dualism of content and structure in knowledge to a dualism of separate and dis- parate sources, that made such an inquiry impossible for Kant. We must not explain knowledge in terms of the unknowable. Our only hope lies in the possibility of explaining it in terms of the knowable conditions of the occurrence of human knowledge. I am far from saying that this will in the end prove possible, but at least it is not ruled out from the start by definition. I think it was James Martineau who said that while the key to ancient philosophy is the distinction between pheno- mena and noumena, the key to modern philosophy is the distinction of subject and object; this is undoubtedly true in some degree, but modern philosophy has also notably attempted, again and again, to supersede that distinction. It has never been really happy about the reputed contribu- tions of subject and object to the fabric of knowledge. Descartes had begun by distinguishing innate ideas from adventitious, only to end by finding that all ideas must in some sense be innate. This opinion was shared by the more speculative Leibniz, only to be offset by the whole sensationalistic school that preferred to reduce the sources of knowledge to one, by the elimination of the constructive understanding. Then came Kant who, as we have seen, tried to make the double source the foundation of an eirenicon. The post-Kantian development worked once more towards a unity in favour of the subject, eliminating the mythical unformed materials of sense, and also the unknowable thing-in-itself. The same tendency is found among the neo-Kantians, who eased their intellectual dis- comfort by reducing the real to a system of relations. "The object", says Green, "which the most practical botanist perceives in his observation of the flower is by no means adequate to the real nature of the flower. That real nature . . . must consist in relations of which conscious- ness is the medium or sustainer, though not", he adds, " consciousness as it is in the botanist."* Hume, it is * Prolegomma to Ethics, Sect. 63.</page><page sequence="6">166 H. F. HALLETT. true, did not go to this length in the opposite direction; the relations of ideas are admitted as a species of knowledge, and in that vigorous weeding of the library described by him at the end of the Enquiry, a select shelf of volumes on mathematics escapes the general holocaust of school meta- physics. Whether the writer of the Treatise would have been equally liberal, I leave to the judgment of readers of the chapters on the ideas of space and time that have no counterpart in the later work. The modern period, there- fore, has pretty uniformly agreed that the given is derived from the object-things, the structure from the subject-mind; it has differed in so far as some have held that only the given belongs to knowledge, others that only what is under- stood can properly be called knowledge, viz., the structure or relations that are said to be essentially mental. But the denial of duality is not the same thing as its resolution or explanation. I think it may well be true that an analysis of knowledge qua knowledge may lead to the elimination of ultimate unformed content, so that relations or structure may occupy the whole ground in the know- ledge of objects; but certainly in all human knowledge structure belongs to content, though not always to content otherwise structureless. It has, indeed, become a common- place of Kantian scholarship that the pure material of sense as such can be no content capable of being fashioned under the forms of the understanding, or even of receiving spatio-temporal distribution. As content without structure, it is nothing. It was doubtless some consciousness of this, or this principle working unconsciously from his Leibnizo- Wolffian background, that led Kant to shift his line of demarcation from that between the materials of sense and the forms of spontaneity, to that between perception and conception. For here the content that is " gone through, taken up, and combined " is the manifold given in percep- tion, which already possesses spatio-temporal structure: a content capable of being intuited prior to the constructive operations of the understanding. Whether this new line of demarcation is drawn in the right place or not, is open to question that I desire as far as may be to avoid; but I note</page><page sequence="7">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 167 that with the change of contrast the ascription of duality to two disparate sources of knowledge, mind and things, must tend to disappear; for perception, too, is largely the work of the subject, which imposes the forms of the sensibility. This I take to constitute a substantial movement towards the right, that could only end in Hegelianism. In recent philosophy we may also trace, both directly and also in a curious inversion, the influence of the modern dogma that the content of the object of knowledge is given to us, but its relations and structure supplied by the subject. Directly, with those who have sharply distinguished between the sense-data and the objects, commonsense or scientific, that are fashioned, or constructed, from the data. The precise nature of sense-data is again a question that I hope to avoid, but I note that they cannot be pure structureless content, but must at least be incipiently spatio-temporal. A colour that is not a patch of colour, however vague in outline, enduring for a period, however indeterminate, cannot be a datum, even if it can be sense; even a sound must have duration, and I think also a certain volume; and so on. Doubtless it is the sense-content that is taken to be central in our reception of sense-data, and it is this that distinguishes the special mode of our knowledge of it as " knowledge by acquaintance ", in distinction from the " knowledge by description " that is ours when we know the objects constructed from the data. The data are given us ; the objects are constructed by us. Hence the former are certain; the latter at best only problematical, and at worst fictitious. A paradoxical inversion of Green's principle that the genuine object of knowledge is essentially a system of relations, was expressed from the positivistic side by the late Professor Schlick in his lectures in King's College, London, a few years back: it was to the effect that since sense-content is necessarily private, subjective, and in- communicable, structure alone, which is objective and communicable, is the proper object of inquiry. We can discuss the shape, relative size, physical, chemical, and biological structures of the tomato, but not the colour, the</page><page sequence="8">168 H. F. HALLETT. odour, the taste, that it privately gives us. We cannot even certify that the red that I see is the same content, or even the same species of content, as the red that you see when we both see red: the contents may differ wholly from mind to mind, and agree only in the structural context that can be compared and related and expressed in a formula. Here, then, unless it is the structure that is given and the content that is subjectively supplied (reversing the Kantian order), we shall be in the truly paradoxical position of being unable to found our knowledge upon the given, or to certify what we have not ourselves supplied. Dr. Schlick's own view, I imagine, fell somewhere between these extreme positions. Certainly, Green's doctrine that all genuine knowledge is ultimately metaphysical and con- cerned with systems of relations, is in sharp contrast with Dr. Schlick's conclusion that metaphysics, being concerned with incommunicable intuitions of content, is impossible. II. Two topics have emerged in the course of the discussion in which we have been engaged upon which it is necessary that I should comment before I proceed further. In a complete treatment of the subject it would be necessary to discuss them at length, but if I did so here I should never reach the central thesis of my paper in the time allotted to me. They are (1) the relation between givenness and truth in human knowledge, and (2) the nature of the verification demanded for what transcends the prima facie- given. Evidently the two topics are connected. (1) Let me say at once that I think it is the prime error underlying all disputes between empiricists and idealists, to suppose that content is given to us from things, while structure is supplied by thought. It is also at the root of most of the objections brought against speculative philo- sophy; and as against idealist speculations, erected as intellectual constructions, I think those objections may be</page><page sequence="9">[rHE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 169 valid. Rightly directed speculation, however, uses con- struction only with a view to discovery; it does not raise a tottering edifice upon a dissolving foundation of data, and leave it to support itself as a system of pure thought. For knowledge everything must be given, either given prima facie, or verified as given secretly, or given by implication. And this, I think, applies not only to content, but equally to relations and structure generally: unverifiable subjective additions involve error. But, as I have suggested, not everything that is given, is given prima facie ; there is much that may truly be called given, that has still to be discovered. All that is entailed by the given, is given; all that we can, by means that are legitimate, discover about the given, is given ; and all that is involved in the processes through which the given is given to us, is given. I have italicized this last extension because it is at once essential to my thesis, and also most likely to be disputed. I leave its further elaboration to a later point of my argument, but let me at once briefly explain that the extension rests upon my belief that what is, viewed externally, a process of mediation through which things external to the bodily sense-organism of the knower are brought into cognitive compresence with him, or in some way rendered cognisable by him, does not, and can not, so appear when viewed, as it were, internally or " dioptrically " by the knower himself in the act of knowing. For him the mediating process is irrecoverably telescoped, and is thus incapable of being verified by the knower himself directly by reference to what is to himself prima facie-given, or is entailed by what is so given, or is even discoverable by him without passage beyond his own immediate data without hope of return. Either, then, the mediation is only capable of being known in relation to others, and not in relation to the knower himself, or some- thing is capable of being known to be true for the self that is not empirically verifiable. In the former case it is the fact that the others are cognizing that is not empirically verifiable. I am not prepared to take the view that we cannot know that mediation ever occurs because where it can be verified (viz., with others) the occurrence of cognition</page><page sequence="10">170 H. F. HALLETT. cannot be assured; and where the cognizing can be verified (viz., with the self) the mediation has disappeared.* My point then is that the work of the cognizing mind is discovery ; not the partial creation of objects ; not even the construction of objects, except with the view of verifying the construct by the discovery of its entailment by the given. When things are discovered, they are discovered as given: this is involved in the very notion of discovery. But the significance attached to the term " given " must not be uncritically restricted, but must take into account the special place of the embodied knower in nature, and the consequent conditions of the development and range of human knowledge. (2) I have already said enough to indicate my serious dissatisfaction with the limitation of verification to direct empirical agreement with the prima facie-given. Speculative philosophy cannot consent to any such arbitrary restriction: but not because its business is " ideal construction ", so that it needs to be released from too close attachment to the data, and to spread its wings aloft in an intellectual strato- sphere or paradise of fools; but, on the contrary, because it is essentially analysis of the given in its full extent, and of the conditions under which it is given, so far as these too are given or may legitimately be estimated. With this end in view, I doubt whether it is correct in philosophy to begin by laying down a criterion of givenness in terms of which alone verification can be taken as satisfactory. The acknowledged attractive- * My contention is here closely connected with rejection of the solipsism that is involved in the restriction of verification to agreement with the prima facie-given. We can have no such verification of the existence of other minds; nor, for that matter, of the inward functioning reality of bodies other than our own. Only the outward aspects of bodies, or of their parts or sections, are " given " in the sense required. The much larger but connected question of the mode of our apprehension of our own and of other minds cannot here be attempted. Nor is it really essential to the present treatment. What is required will, I think, be supplied in the section of this paper in which I discuss our knowledge of our own bodies, as distinct from our more commonly recognized knowledge of bodies, our own and others, as external to our sense- organs. It will then be seen in what way, and to what extent, my argument depends on the truth of the belief in the existence of other persons,</page><page sequence="11">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 171 ness of such a method is at bottom, I think, due to no more than our readiness to acknowledge that by cognition we mean apprehension of the real, i.e., of the given without subjective addition or distortion. But the exclusion of sub- jective perversion must not be made the ground for limiting the given to what can be received by an embodied knower (however representative), who, if finite, will be limited in receptivity through his special relation to the world, and will himself necessarily, both as body and as mind, transcend his own receptivity. Such Spartan restrictions will both cut us off from regions of knowledge that are, or may be, open to us, and also blind us to the true character of what we do admit as a legitimate sphere for human inquiry. I hope I shall not be talCen as suggesting that in philo- sophy we should have no criterion of truth. I have agreed that the object of knowledge is a given; it cannot be the result of unchecked construction. We must have reason to believe that whatever may have been the processes used in our inquiry, we have in the end made a discovery; that the subjective work has enabled us to be receptive of a given. Now I do not think that what I have called the primafacie-given, the given of sense-perception in its simplest and most direct form, is the only given that can rightly produce this conviction: our knowledge of the reality of other minds is not so verified; our knowledge of the reality of our own minds is not so verified; nor is our knowledge of the active functioning of an organism-no, not even when it is our own organism. Sense-perception gives us always the outside view, its object is an " other ". What I suggest, then, is that the conditions of satisfactory givenness reciprocate with the nature of the given, and that this yields us the true criterion by which we ought to proceed in philosophy. What is required in all cases is verification congruent with the nature of that which is to be verified. The reason why sense-data are so universally regarded as the proper standard of reference, is that we are normally obsessed by our interest in the external appearance of objects standing beyond our sense-organs. And for this type of being, doubtless, the demand for verification by</page><page sequence="12">172 H. F. HALLETT. reference to perceptual-data is in general correct: the only entities that we can accept as real are those which we do immediately perceive, or which these entail. Some will say that such knowledge is all that is possible; and if that could be established I for one would give up the argument. But we must not assume it in order to prove it. It seems to me that so far from this being demonstrable, precisely the con- trary is clearly the case. Hume himself was unable to proceed in his account of our knowledge of matters of fact without the use of causality, which he attributed to the " imagination " that forms a " habit of expectation "; and I do not think that this can be explained away as no more than a manner of speaking. Does not the theory become mori- bund if for this habit there is substituted a gentle attraction among perceptions. Yet the imagination itself is not a perception, nor is it traceable to any impression; it must therefore either be rejected or verified in some other way. Do not mistake the purport of my reference: I am not emphasising Hume's use of subjective activity in the etiology of our knowledge of matters of fact; I am pointing to his de facto acceptance of the reality of what cannot be traced to an impression, and thus cannot receive the approved verification. I do not take Hume as typical of the attitude of thinkers to this question, but as crucial. Berkeley, who introduced this non-perceptual apprehension under the title of " notions", would be more typical of our common attitude to it as philosophers ; while Locke is typical of the plain man's readiness to take what he needs ; and Kant, in the mood of the Critick of the Practical Reason, of the lengths to which a mind obsessed with the " otherness " of objects is prepared to go in the attempt to meet the claims of indubitable experience. If Hume, then, who thought he had escaped even from solipsism (for he never could discover himself) was not able, even in his studious moments, to exclude this non-empiricist entity, I think it will gravel anyone else to do so. And when he came to himself, when he turned from the narrow contemplation of the superficies of things, and began to enter, body and soul, actively into the bodily and mental</page><page sequence="13">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 173 processes of dining, and conversation, and backgammon, he found nature too strong for him. For this was nature indeed, and not the shadowy passage of mythical idea- contents and impression-contents with their defacto adhesions and separations. The reality of active minds and vigilant bodies was verifying itself in its own way by possession and mutuality. I ask, therefore, is it not the case that no given is able to verify anything but itself, and what is self-entailed ? Is any other passage beyond what is given, theoretically defensible ? Contents may be used to verify contents, structures structures, actions actions; but contents and structures will not serve in the verification of actions, nor, as Dr. Schlick reminded us, can structures be used in the verification of contents. If Hume had restricted himself to knowledge of the relations of ideas, and had realized that for him a " matter of fact " could be no other than his impressions while they remained impressions, he need not have introduced any non-empirical entity or process. He would thus have achieved consistency, though at the expense of sterility. For he would have established no contact with active self, body or mind, or with active bodily or mental " others," i.e., with nature. And his dis- satisfaction with his studies when he returned to them after his bout with nature would have been even more profound than as he describes it. Let it be conceived as even possible that the real is no mere passage of adhering contents with their prima facie- structures or relations, but is an assemblage of active entities, bodily and mental, and that the knowledge possible to any one of these minds is dependent in some manner upon the relations between the bodies or the minds ;-what prospect is there in such a case of genuine knowledge even of the superficial aspects of things regarded as " others ", even of the empiricist's matters of fact, if we wholly neglect to inquire into the precise character of these etiological relations ? How are we to carry out the analysis and inter- pretation of the data, if we must remain in total ignorance of the conditions governing the reception of such data by</page><page sequence="14">174 H. F. HALLETT. the human mind ? If it is said that those conditions are of necessity beyond all possible human knowledge, then indeed is our position desperate ; for we remain over- shadowed by the doubt, or rather by the near-certainty, that the real conditions of human experience are such as to falsify all the conclusions that we base upon the acceptance of the prima facie-data as ultimate and beyond question. Let me repeat what I said at the beginning of this paper: I am acutely conscious of the extreme delicacy of this undertaking, and of the boldness of the attempt to carry through a speculative adventure in the uncharted seas that lie beyond what we are accustomed to regard as our Pillars of Hercules, the immediate data of perception. But in spite of its apparent paradoxicality, both in concep- tion, and even more in its ultimate results, I hope to show that it is speculative in the sense which I hold good. I see no compelling reason for abandoning the enterprise, and no reason at all, adequate or inadequate, for defining the work of philosophy in such a way as to involve the non- sensicality of the inquiry. We are, in any case, not in possession of a theory of knowledge and verification that is beyond cavil, so that our position as philosophers is one of very great danger, in which it is impossible to rest. Common prudence compels us to face our ultimate problems with complete candour, and for my part I am willing to do so. I admit, for example, the primary difficulty that if the conditions governing the etiology* of human apprehension, * I must carefully guard myself against making the suggestion that know- ledge qua knowledge, or even human knowledge quatenus knowledge, has an etiology. Knowing is not a causal relation. But human knowledge quatenus human is, or may be, conditioned as to scope and insight by the nature of the objective factors themselves (e.g., mediation by sense-organ, nerve, brain, or even by apparatus). Such conditioning, wrongly interpreted as an irruption of subjective factors into the objective sphere, is the source of subjective idealism. In my view the mediation is wholly objective: hence the extreme difficulty of rightly separating the factors of a mediation that, for the knower himself, is telescoped, and of discovering how far, and in what sense, our reputed knowledge is truly such, in spite of its etiology. I am ready to admit that our knowledge, even when it has not been subjected to this metaphysical analysis, is genuine knowledge of some objective entity, but I contend that a</page><page sequence="15">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 175 and limiting its grasp of the real, seriously affect the ade- quacy of what remains in prima facie-experience, then our beliefs concerning those conditions, derived as they must be from or through that experience, will also be dubitable; so that we must exercise the greatest care in taking our clues from what appears to be their character as prima facie given. Only if we can estimate how far, and in what way, the conditions limiting human apprehension modify its character, can we be justified in accepting the guidance of common experience. These demands are stringent, but I do not think they are necessarily and wholly beyond our skill. III. IT is time that I brought my preparations to an end, lingered no longer in dock, but putting aside the expostu- lations of my friends and the bugaboos of my adversaries, set forth on my " death or glory " expedition. The examination of human knowledge, its objects, and its modes, reveals various forms of bifurcation: the a priori and the a posteriori factors ; the matter of sense and the forms of intuition and the understanding; perception and concep- tion; sense-data and perceptual objects; intuition and con- struction; knowledge by acquaintance and by description; primary and secondary qualities ; such are some of the forms that the bifurcation has taken as a matter of philosophical history. With some of these I have dealt, and have noted that they are not diverse expressions of the same radical duality, derived from a duality of source in mind and things, but seem to point to something of a hierarchy among knowable entities. It is, of course, from human apprehen- sion and its common objects that we must begin, though satisfactory account of the total objective situation is only possible if we can carry out this further speculative analysis. Human apprehension is per- ceptually clarified, but metaphysically darkened, by the inevitable telescoping of the processes of mediation by the sense-organism and instruments of the knower, and can only be truly clarified by re-expanding that telescope, not perceptually but speculatively, i.e., metaphysically.</page><page sequence="16">176 H. F. HALLETT. our aim in metaphysics is to escape from anthropomorphic relativity to " knowledge absolute ". Too often, I think, there has been a tendency for philosophers to interpret human knowledge as though it were a mere section of a supposed totum of knowledge absolute-a mistake that may yet be shown to be the real source of many of the agelong disputes that have burdened and disfigured the progress of philosophical discovery. The perceptual phantasmagoria of the animal mind is no level section of the Platonic philo- sophy. Even within human experience we find, not a single superficies of contents, framed on a single plan, developing as a single mode, yielding a single object or type of object; but a hierarchy of stages of development, framed on increasingly concrete principles, developing in diverse modes, and revealing a hierarchical object or set of objects. There was, first of all, the distinction in the perceptual object of the incommunicable sense-content and the structural elements through which the content becomes a possible object of perception. Since the most primitive human experience is already in some sense a perception we must regard this distinction as a distinction of reason, though I think that Kant was right in making it the basis of part of his transcendental analysis. It is a distinction of significance if only because the content alone is incommuni- cable. Then there was the distinction between a possible phantasmal consciousness such as might be supposed to limit the higher animal mind, and the commonsense con- sciousness of a world of interacting things regarded as lying beyond the sensorium of the observer, the stage at which categorial structure is imputed but not understood. But we are not, it seems, limited in our grasp to the content of sense-perception arranged in the categorial structure, though our further apprehension may well be limited to what we can discover of the structural character of entities lying above or below the range of commonsense in the hierarchy of objects. This has not always been understood, either by speculative philosophers working upwards towards absolute entities, or by speculative scientists working downwards towards constituent entities.</page><page sequence="17">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 177 Both are tempted to impute the content that we intuit as given or possessed within our congruent range of entities, to the speculative structures beyond. Thus philosophers have thought of the absolute as a person, as a mind, as a designer; the social theorists of societies as moral individuals, and nations or races as mortal bodies; and natural scientists of molecules and atoms as grains of matter like fine shot. I do not think that the truly critical in either class have been unaware of the fallacy of such imputations, and some of them have derisively criticized the anthropomorphism and somatomorphism involved. About the processes connected with such extensions of human apprehension I will not now speak, the subject is in any case very largely beyond my competence, but I must emphasize what I have already said, and what is implied in my caveat about imputing content, viz., that the processes are neither of" ideal construction " upwards, nor of physical dissection downwards. The upward movement appears to me to be a process of analysis, both of the given and of the implications of its givenness, combined with an extension of the range of the recognized given, beyond objects as " others " to objects and minds as they are in themselves, this extension of range resulting in the correction of the objective relativity of perceptual entities. * The downward movement is also one of analysis of the given, and a progressive extension of the range of the given by the use of devices through which essential structure may be discovered quantitatively, and thus with relativity, by the use of pointer-readings.t Now this series of entities, directly or speculatively apprehended, constitutes, not a mere series, but a hierarchy of alternatives. For in our apprehension they are related disjunctively rather than conjunctively. I can perhaps * Structure too, as "other ", must disappear in the absolute, since it has, and therefore is, no " other." What remains must be self-existence as active essence. t It is this limitation to quantity that makes the scientist's " metaphysical" speculation mathematical. Mathematics is the metaphysics of quantity, as Francis Bacon truly said. U</page><page sequence="18">178 H. F. HALLETT. make this point a little clearer by the use of examples: any given observer at any given time either discriminates the sense-contents " red " and " green ", and the spatial structure " round ", or the " apple "; he perceives either the earth very near, the moon more distant, and the stars beyond, or apprehends the solar system within the universe of stars ; he apprehends either a world of interconnected spatio-temporal qualitied things, or the system of nature; either the colour or the speculative oscillations, quanta, or whatever may be its transmissible elements or factors; either the auditory tone or the aeriai undulations. The apprehensions, however, are not completely disjunctive in relation to the total mind of the observer: though in relation to any one mode of apprehension the disjunction is complete, different modes of apprehension may occur conjunctively in the single observer's experience. He can, for example, think of the molecular structure of a substance while observing its molar-form ; hear the music of the violin while watching its vibrating strings ; see the apple while exploring its rotundity; observe the stars while speculating about the reputed expansion of stellar space. If air were visible, we might, with suitable eyes, see the compressions and rarifications of sound and also hear the auditory content; but we could not, with the aid of any device or any frequency of undulation or discharge, at one and the same time, with one and the same organ, in one and the same sense of the term, "see " both the red colour and the waves or discharges of quanta of frequency 5 X 1014. It has been customary to suppose that in deciding the character of the real world, we have to choose between the various types of object- system that I have been exemplifying, and that only that mode of apprehension that presents us with the favoured type of object is veridical. Either speculation, or science, or sense-perception, or sensation; but not all of them. Either the absolute, the atoms, energy, the system of nature, physical things, sense-data, etc.; but not all of them. And there is a certain reasonableness about the refusal to accept them all as co-ordinately real, for its acceptance would give us no explanation of the fact that</page><page sequence="19">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 179 they are not apprehended together, but disjunctively. We cannot trace this to the distinctions of human faculty, for those distinctions are based upon the distinctions of their objects, and thus have no prior determinance. If both the red and the waves or quanta are real, why should one be directly intuited and the other be the result of speculation ? And why should we be ready to agree (as I think we are) in spite of the impossibility of carrying out the experiment, that an intuition of that concerning which we now speculate, viz., the waves or quanta, would exclude the simultaneous intuition of the colour-content; unless, indeed, because we conceive them to be related hierarchically ? The case is, perhaps, clearer with the relations of sense-data and percep- tual thing: so snugly do the sense-contents fit the object that it is matter for doubt whether in fact there are sense-data at all in abstraction from their qualification of spatio- temporal contours. How, then, does the real come to be broken up into stages in relation to which we distinguish our different modes of apprehension, all of which are able to impress us with their essential veracity ? How are we to explain our disjunctive apprehension of the real, together with our belief in the verifiability of all the disjoined appearances ? Why do we apprehend certain stages or features by direct intuition, but are compelled to approach the others by legitimate speculation? Why do we not directly intuit the absolute and the atoms, but only per- ceptual objects, with a problematic extension to their sense-contents and the laws governing their structure ? Further, what is the source of the serious ambiguity in sense-perception as to what constitutes the content of the apprehension, and what the structure; or, what is the same thing, what is the source of the distinction between the sense-data, the spatio-temporal form, and the categorial relations, from the successive discovery of which we derive the sensations, the things, and the system of nature, that constitute the hierarchical content of the real, or part of it ? These are questions so important, so central for epistemology and metaphysics that it is strange that so little has been done towards their solution. Philosophers who</page><page sequence="20">180 H. F. HALLETT. might have ventured on such problems with good prospect of success, Leibniz or Spinoza or Kant, were either too much concerned with actual speculations to recognize how deeply the need for speculation and its defence themselves stood in urgent need of prior clarification ; or too much under the influence of the modern obsession that the structure of the objects of experience is derived from mind, to realize the true nature of the problems. IV. You will not expect me to make good what such intellectual giants have failed to provide. All that I can offer is the outline of a possible speculation. My main contention is that the structures I have described in the objects of know- ledge imply the operation of a screen, or series of screens, or system of screens, between the knowing subject and its ostensible object : not a screen of representative ideas as in Locke's theory of sense-perception, but a screen that is the vigilant, organized, resonating body of the knower. For our initial purpose we must be content to take the body as it appears for the sense-perception of another person (or for the perceiver himself so far as he perceives his own body, or parts of it, as external to his own sense- organs, either directly or in a mirror: not in so far as he may apprehend it in the active function of perceiving). Such a body we already note as possessing a roughly hier- archical character in its neural structure, the several sense-organs being differentiated, but also connected with the more unified central nervous system. In sense-percep- tion, e.g., hearing, there is a transmission of aerial oscillations to a series of mechanisms in the ear resulting in a set of vibrations in specialized parts of the organ (hair cells, rods of Corti, or whatever is the specific auditory part of the cochlea). When that point is reached the series of physical causes reaches its limit-or perhaps in the central nervous system : the details are not of importance for us in this connexion-and the hearer is, or may be supposed to be, conscious of a sound. We must not say that the sensation</page><page sequence="21">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 181 is " caused " by the changes in the auditory organ: but we may say without offence that it occurs upon their occurrence. Thus the sensation of sound must be related primarily, not to the vibrating bell, nor to the aerial oscilla- tions, but to some rhythmical changes in the auditory organ, or their neural synthesis ; it is these that we " hear " directly, and only modifications in these, however they may be produced, affect the auditory perception. Of course. I am very far from believing that this account of the " mechanism " of sense-perception (and a similar account might be given with the other senses, mutatis muttandis) is adequate or even prima facie satisfactory; but it carries the suggestion, which I believe to be correct, that the body operates as a resonator-screen in the processes of sense-perception. The view that we take of the body of another person is external and superficial. It presents what is an entity-in-itself, having its own internal activity, possessing its own existence, as an " other ". Now the external superficies of a man, or of any of his organs, com- plete or in dissection, must be very unlike the same body or organ as it possesses itself in the actual processes that constitute its proper functioning as " a going concern ". The eye and its optical system, for example, as it operates in sight, as it is " seen through ", is very unlike its appearance for the external perception of the oculist. In that inner "dioptric" view it is telescoped to the form of a visual field. Thus we get the impression that the eye has become transparent, as if it were a window that we are looking through. But, of course, the eye that we are said to be looking through, is externally a bodily eye, and no mere hole in the cranium through which a Cartesian soul watches the world. My visual field is my eyes (with their neural connexions) as they are within their own neural structure, as self-possessed and self-active, and thus apprehended more satisfactorily than when they are seen from without as " other things ". No longer separated from their objects, but plumbing visual nature; made one with it, or with a selection of it. My " eyes" as they are in and for them- selves do not lie in their sockets opposing the world they</page><page sequence="22">182 H. F. HALLETT. are to see: their union with their proper object is perfect. Even with reference to an eye as commonly perceived we can say that without its object it is incomplete, it is only potentially an eye, since the eye is for seeing and only becomes an actual eye in the very act of seeing; so in itself, as a visual field, it is neither visual nor a field without its objects. But with its objects it is transformed, by the change in point of view, from a small separate part of the visual world to identity with that world, or some far- reaching selection from it. When viewed as an " other " it is seen to reproduce the visual elements of nature, and thus, after all, to be no mere section of nature, but a resonator to it; and it is thus that to the outward view, the optical system, resynthesizing the relatively loose transmissible visual elements of things externally compresent with it, itself reproduces those visual wholes in its own way and measure, though not, perhaps, in their measure, as they are in them- selves. Now their synthesis in the optical system viewed " dioptrically " is their synthesis in the real visual object, so that the red that we see is no mental addition but a real entity, holding its place at its level, and taken up in those further objective syntheses that we can, by reason of the range of our bodily unity, in part at least intuit. So, I think, it is with all the sense-organs and systems what I perceive is my own body, my essential body as it is in and for itself, though by reason of its finiteness, modified by its " other." Viewing it externally we apprehend it as a resonator-screen in relation to a world of things external to it ; viewed internally, " dioptrically ", it is a perspective of the world-it is the world so far as it is capable of being affected by the world : that is, according to its kind and degree of vigilance. In the external view it is only in so far as my body is constituted as a resonator to this or that activity in its context that my " other " can come under my direct intuition ; yet because, according to its delicacy of response, my body is real as a resonating microcosm of nature, its context is so far truly apprehended. But only selectively, not totally, for nature only filters through the screen as a remainder of " otherness ", not in its totality of</page><page sequence="23">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 183 self-existence, not as self-contained and therefore absolute, but riddled with relativity. Yet it is not divided from nature as a part cut off: it is the embryo-nature lying in the womb of Nature. Now I shall say that the hierarchies of objects that form our original problem issue from the phlysical being of the knower. In the outward view I think this is readily acceptable : for to the sense-data their correspond the separate sense-organs and their various distinct devices capable of responding to the physically transmissible factors of external things, and thus also capable through their unified structure of reproducing the unity of those factors " within " the organism. But this is not externally observable. * To the objects of sense-perception we may suppose there correspond some more extensive structures of the neural individual ; to the system of nature, others; and so on. In the " dioptric" view these structures are apprehended as real union in the perceived world, i.e., in the affected body of the perceiver. May it not be, then, that it is the fact that what is given to the body in the perceptual process is normally only admitted by the sense-organs, that makes it seem so obvious to the uncritical mind that what is given is solely sense-contents, while the structures in which they are arranged seem to issue from the perceiver himself ? If so, then the only error is in supposing that " the perceiver himself" must mean his mind, and not the hierarchical nature of his vigilant body and neural organization. Thus it is, as indeed we observe so far as it applies to * In this connexion may I draw attention to the following paradoxical, and seemingly even contradictory, statements of Aristotle in the De Anima: " Assuming that to perceive by sight is to see, and that what is seen is colour or that which possesses colour, then if you are to see that which sees, that which originally sees, the primary visual organ, must be coloured . . . In a sense that which sees is coloured, for in every case the sense-organ is receptive of the sensible object without its matter." (425 b I7-24.) Yet " it is that which is colourless which is receptive of colour, as it is that which is soundless which is receptive of sound." (4I8 b 26-7.) The seeming contradiction disappears if we understand the philosopher to mean that the optical organ qua inoperant must have no colour that could modify the colour of which it is receptive, but that qua receiving colour it is coloured.</page><page sequence="24">184 H. F. HALLETT. our sense-experience, that the greater the variety of ways in which the percipient's body can be affected and can respond to nature, the more complete is the object that he perceives. In the inward view that object is the troubled vigilant organism revealing its nature as a self limited by its " other ", and thus presenting its own proper degree of transparency and opaqueness of content; not the body as a " featherless biped ", not the skin-full of tissue and bone and blood, not even the tender system of nerves and ganglia and end-organs extended within their supports of flesh, but the body perceived in and through the very act of perceiving, and thus " pellucidated " by efficiency for its task. Thus a perfect eye under an unvaried stimulus is a visual space of unvaried colour; remove the stimulus, the colour goes; but with it goes the visual space; for an eye without stimulus is only potentially an eye, though it may remain as something less. Further, it is because in perception the organism sets its own standard of clearness, that it is identified with its world; we can only detect inefficiency in our sense-organs by the use of instruments or other sense-organs of finer responsiveness as further standards. But even so, the extended, or more subtle organ, sets its own standard. The first part of my answer is, then, that we must distinguish between the perception of things as " other " and the perception of things as " selves ". In the external view of another person the distinctions of sense-data, perceptual things, and the system of nature (to speak broadly) in my knowledge of things, are derived from the hierarchical character of my body operating as a resonator- screen. An animal with sense-organs limited to a single retinal rod or cone with its connexions, might conceivably experience a visual sense-datum; an animal that was a mere collection of sense-organs might perceive isolated things: for the sense-organism operates at once in a positive and in a negative manner-it integrates the loose physically transmissible elements and factors of sensible things to which it is capable of responding, thus reproducing selected features of the world ; and it isolates these from their real</page><page sequence="25">'THE RoOTrs OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 185 context by excluding that to which it cannot respond. In the internal view which I take up myself in the act of perceiving, the distinctions of sense-data, things, and nature, must appear (as indeed they are) as stages in the increasingly complete apprehension of the real. But now I continue: there are regions of the hier- archical real lying above and below the limits of the body's capacity for direct vigilant response, and it must be by speculation, if at all, that we can hope to reach knowledge of such ranges of synthesis lying above that of the body, and culminating in the self-existent absolute, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of scientific objects of ever increasing abstraction stretching downwards towards the limit of a pure structureless " content " that were it not ideal would be identical with non-being. As I have said, it has always been recognized by the truly critical among those who agree that such extensions of human faculty may be veridical, that we are unable to grasp the concrete nature of these speculative entities. As I should express it: man's intermediate status in nature unfits him for the discovery of the content of entities incon- gruent with his own nature. This is no more than a pointed expression of the finiteness that appears externally as the " bifurcated radish ". Thus if we are to defend our- selves as metaphysicians and as scientists (for in this matter both are under the same suspicion), we must plunge more deeply still into these paradoxes. So far I have distinguished between the external view of the human body as a separable section of nature in resonance with selected features of other separable bodies, and the " dioptric " view of it as it identifies itself with a perspective of nature in the very act of perception. But I do not think that the former view is satisfactory even as a description of its external aspect. The blind man's baton, the scientist's apparatus, the poet's stream and mountain, are, even in the outward view, genuine parts of their bodies. Thus the resonator-body is, after all, no mere isolable section of nature, but extends through it indivisibly. Now this unity of the body with its " other ", which x</page><page sequence="26">186 H. F. HALLETT. externally appears as an extension of it, is completed when we transfer our view to that of the perceiver himself qua perceiving his body " as a going concern ". The world that I see is my total optical system; the world that I hear is my total auditory system; the world that I touch is my total tactual system; and so on. The eye does not, of course, seem to see itself, nor the ear to hear itself; nor perhaps the hand to feel itself (though that is not quite so obvious): but, then, equally in the external view, eye and ear are not total organs even when we include their central connexions-they need their proper stimulators before they are fully actual. Further, as Aristotle tells us, efficiency in perception necessitates transparency of eye, and silence of the ear. Why then is perception not altogether trans- parency and silence and emptiness ? I answer, because the perceiver's body, though identical with the world that he perceives, is no more than a perspective of the total real. It is thus incomplete, and its transparency and silence and emptiness are troubled with content. That which we fully apprehend as it is in itself, we cannot perceive as " other "; that which in perception we grasp as " other" is what we are not as " self". It remains a world of " other things", solid, variously coloured, toned, felt-an " objective " world of nature. What we possess as silence and trans- parency and objective emptiness, we are; and what we are not registers itself as " other ", as a not-self, solid, perdurable, ineluctable. It follows that this world of nature, "other " to the perceiver, must not be denied reality because it is " other " and thus opaque, noisy, impenetrable. It registers its reality by its power to give itself as " other "-object. It is real, but it is not complete ; it is " other " and not " self "; outsides, not insides. It is all that at that level we can apprehend of its reality. The externality of our appre- hension of it at once registers our finiteness and its power; the limitation of the self is measured by the simultaneous indubiety and triviality of its " other ": sense-data seem at once insubstantial and peremptory. As the body moves to a higher level of response, the " other " becomes increasingly</page><page sequence="27">THE ROOTS OF DUALITY IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. 187 substantial and dubious. For a perfect self there would be no " other " ; the transparency and silence and objective emptiness that are self-existence, and the opaqueness, noise, and content that is " other "-existence, together compose a genuine through maimed apprehension of the total self- existent real: it is that real, but pulverized and distorted by relativity. It remains therefore, by speculation to de-relati- vize our apprehension, so far as that is possible. We do not, we can not, reconstitute the absolute as it is in its ultimate self-existence, we cannot for ourselves resume its hidden life and creativity. At best we can sketch the structure of its less imperfect expressions, and speculate concerning the ultimate structurelessness of its infinite self-perfection. This limitation of philosophical speculation to structure is characteristic also of the extension of human apprehension in the direction followed by the scientist. The time is past when the atom could be thought of as a minute grain that an homuncule might roll between his fingers. It could, of course, have no secondary qualities capable of setting up resonance even in the homuncular sense-organ. It has, and for us is, a structure, whatever it may be in itself. Its content eludes us, just as the content of the self-existence of the absolute transcends our phantasy. It might well have been supposed that the subordinate entities studied by science, falling as they must within the physical nature of man, ought to be capable of reconstitution, not only as to structure, but also as to content. We must, however, remember that our access to them is only by means of instruments which, falling as they do outside the living organism, there is provided no means for re-synthesizitig the loose factors that are operating. Their content is thus necessarily hidden from us, equally with that of entities transcending our nature, and they remain possibly real, but certainly speculative, structures. In conclusion, let me comment very briefly on two objections that may be raised to my speculation: (a) It may be said that even if I am right, I have done no more than assume that the distinctions determining the</page><page sequence="28">188 H. F. HALLETT. ranges of objects are present in the perceiver's body ; that I have not truly explained their occurrence. I reply: (i) I do not conceive it to be the business of metaphysics to explain things either in the sense of creating them or in the sense of explaining them away. Its business is the ordering of entities according to the order of their real production, passing from the order of our prima facie- experience to the order of nature. (ii) All knowledge must be based on some real existence which it assumes, and it is not matter for wonder if the required existence in human metaphysics should turn out to be that of the perceiver and metaphysician himself, i.e., that of his body in relation to the ordering of objective entities. (iii) But further, if my speculation is correct, I have done more than transfer the distinctions to the body, for I have then shown that the ranges of objects are not merely determined by the bodily structure of the perceiver, but that the two are one when viewed " dioptrically ". (b) Secondly, it may be said that I have produced no real evidence of the co-ordination of the external view and this " dioptrical " view. Let me say quite candidly that if what is here asserted is the absence of a crucial empirical verification, then I must plead guilty. But in extenuation let me say two things : (i) The absence of such a crucial test is no mere accident : if my speculation is correct such a test must be impossible, for one perceiver cannot take two contrary points of view at once with respect to the same set of objects. (ii) It has been a part of my contention, if not actually and essentially the whole of it, that verifica- tion must be congruent with that which is to be verified. An empirical verification for what is essentially non- empirical as a whole (though it is empirical in its parts) is thus not desiderated. The point rather is, does it receive its appropriate verification ? And that is a question that I must leave to your judgment and ingenuity.</page></plain_text>
