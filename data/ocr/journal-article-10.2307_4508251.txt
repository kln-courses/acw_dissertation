SULLIVAN* Legally, it is possible to say of a particular company that it is a party to a criminal conspiracy,1 that it has acted dishonestly2 or that its conduct in matters of safety is so deficient as to amount to manslaughter.3 The mechanism which has brought most serious crimes4 within the competence of companies to commit is, of course, the concept of corporate alter ego or, more precisely, the doctrine of identification. This concept takes the conduct and state of mind of certain high-ranking officials to be the conduct and state of mind of the company itself,5 so that it may commit directly crimes which are not attributable to a company merely on a basis of vicarious liability. The nature and consequences of the doctrine of identification have been justifiably criticised.6 In particular, concern has been expressed that the confined basis of liability which the doctrine entails undermines the recent judicial recognition of corporate manslaughter in the case of companies of any size and organisational complexity.7 Indeed, the Law Commission has proposed a new offence, corporate killing, which has a close affinity to manslaughter and would allow convictions in circumstances where no given individual associated with the company was possessed of the culpability required for the offence.8 The Commission assumes that there is a distinctive form of culpability which is specifically corporate and which need not be tied to the Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Durham.

No. 237 (1996), at paras. 8.1-8.77. 515</page><page sequence="2">516 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] culpability of any one or more persons associated with the company.9 It will be argued that any proposal which admits of a free-standing corporate liability dissociated from the culpability of individuals connected with the company is conceptually ill-founded. As Lord Hoffmann has stated, there is not . . . something out there called the company of which one can meaningfully say that it can or cannot do something. There is in fact no such thing as the company as such, no ding and sich, only the applicable rules [of attribution].10 Moreover, the dissociation of corporate guilt from human culpa¬ bility will, in the context ofa trial and its aftermath, take on something of a formal character. Under the Law Commission's proposals corporate culpability will inhere in the conduct and omissions of one or more individuals associated with company. Those individuals who are subject to criticism at the trial as a necessary condition for a finding of guilt against the company will be closely associated with the verdict. They will share in the stigma of a serious offence even in the absence of any demonstration that they were personally possessed of culpability commensurate with it. To criticise these proposals is not to argue for the current position. If there are gains in welfare to be obtained by convicting companies of serious criminal offences, they are unlikely to be achieved within the narrow doctrine of identification. Besides, that doctrine is itself in the process of reformulation and may well be supplanted by rules of attribution which are more widely drawn. It will be argued here that such an exercise, be it legislative or judicial, must be an exercise in consequentialism. There is no conceptual basis for a retributivist response to corporate illegality and no basis, notwithstanding the arguments of certain philosophers and other academic eommentators,11 for the claim that corporations are substantive moral agents which may perpetrate specifically corporate wrongs. Those who advocate extending corporate liability should not be distracted by efforts to capture the "corporateness" of corporate wrongdoing. They should focus on formulating a straightforward regime of liability which seeks higher standards of safety and fair-dealing for consumers, workers and passengers but does not unduly diminish the provision of goods, services and employment.12 9 Ibid. at paras. 7.21; 7.30; 7.31; 7.33; 8.4; 8.8. 10 Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd. v.

Attribution of Culpability 517 The deterrent resources of the criminal law cannot be efficiently distributed among companies through the mechanism ofthe identifica¬ tion doctrine. Recent decisions have put this doctrine under con¬ siderable stress and, perforce, require the consideration of alternatives. Three alternatives will be considered: reactive fault, the theory of aggregation and a Law Commission proposal for a new form of corporate liability, all of which will be found wanting conceptually and in terms of their likely effects. Finally, vicarious responsibility as the sole basis of corporate liability will be advocated, though subject to a defence of due diligence for serious offences carrying stigma. The Doctrine of Identification Viscount Haldane's speech in Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Ltd.13 was read, at least until very recently, as articulating a general principle for findings of direct fault as contrasted with vicariously derived fault on the part of a company.14 Officials of sufficient seniority were taken to be not merely employees or agents of the company but emanations of the company. Consequently, the state of mind of a high-ranking director or officer could be characterised as the company's state of mind. This allowed corporate liability for crimes and torts failing outside the scope of vicarious liability, which was, until recently, essentially restricted to negligence in tort and to regulatory criminal offences.15 The way was opened to findings such as, for example, that a company qua company had acted fraudulently or with criminal negligence.16 If companies are taken to be formal rather than real entities and to have a purely legal existence sharply differentiated from those natural or legal persons associated with them,17 then the doctrine of identification rests on a category error. It assumes that real guilt may inhere in a purely legal person. If this error had not been made, two quite different responses to corporate criminal liability for mens rea offences might have been made. First, any notion that companies difficulties of theory and practice. For further discussion and references see Wells, op. cit. note 6 at pp. 31-38 and 146-149. A recent Law Commission recommendation to extend beyond the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 the power of courts to order a company to take steps to remedy the causes of an offence would add some welcome flexibility without the difficulties involved in a more extensive supervision of companies: Law Com.

Salomon [1897] A.C. 22.</page><page sequence="4">518 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] could directly perpetrate wrongs involving quintessentially human failings such as dishonesty might have been rejected. If, however, there were perceived to be social gains arising from convicting companies of offences requiring proof of culpability, the boundaries of vicarious liability could have been extended allowing legal yet conventional findings of corporate guilt for such offences. There is judicial authority which insists that corporate liability on the basis of identification is conceptually quite distinct from vicarious liability.18 Within the terms of the identification doctrine, the com¬ pany's guilt is demonstrated rather than attributed to it. Yet a scrutiny of those terms reveals identification to be cognate to vicarious liability. The company's culpability is a derivative of human culpability. Within the doctrine's own terms, a finding that a company possessed the mens rea required for an offence may only be made if a sufficiently senior individual associated with the company possessed the mens rea required for the offence. Functionally then, we have two forms of vicarious liability used to generate convictions against companies: an untrammelled form allowing convictions, in the main for regulatory and licensing offences, on the basis of a finding that any individual associated with the company was acting within the scope of his employment or authority; and a restricted form for offences requiring mens rea which is triggered by findings of culpability in respect of a narrow class of senior officials. The recognition that identification is not conceptually distinct from vicarious liability but is merely a restricted version of it allows a clearer scrutiny of the purpose and effects of the restriction. If we acknowledge that all findings of corporate guilt are based on convention we are better placed to assess the advantages of adopting or discarding a particular convention. In terms of securing a corporate conviction, the identification doctrine is least problematic in circumstances where the highest officer within the company has direct knowledge ofthe elements ofthe particular offence and has conducted himself in a manner causally related to the commission of it. Although the doctrine has been applied to facts failing beyond this paradigm,19 the moment we are beyond it we encounter uncertainty of application.20 When invoked, the doctrine of identification makes for different outcomes depending upon the kind of wrongdoing involved in the case and upon the kind of organisation the company is. These differences do not make for a rational scheme of liability. Take a case where there 18 In particular, Lord Diplock in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v. Nattrass (1972] A.C. 153 advocated restraint in findings of identification in order to demarcate clearly between what he characterised as direct liability from vicarious liability. 19 As in the recent civil case of El Ajou v. Dollar Land Holdings plc [1994] 2 All E.R. 685. 20 Contrast El Ajou with the approach of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Redfern [1993] Crim.L.R. 43.</page><page sequence="5">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 519 is a pattern of dishonest conduct at the heart of a major company, a pattern formed by the conduct of its controllers—the Maxwell/Nadir kind of case. Here the doctrine will allow a finding of guilt against the companies such individuals dominate, although there will be occasions where from the perspective of the "innocent" constituencies within these companies, the malefactor company may be as much a victim as anyone else. Contrast a company which consistently profits by wrongdoing against third parties, as in the case of an insurance company selling, on a regular basis, pension schemes unsuited to clients' needs. There are indications from such cases that company salespersons may have dishonestly misrepresented the effects of policies, whereas all that has been revealed in terms of corporate policy resolved at senior level is a "hard-sell" bonus-based sales scheme. There would be little chance of a corporate conviction for an offence of dishonesty in such circumstances. It is in the matter of standards of corporate safety that the doctrine may be seen at its most dysfunctional. If the culpability for corporate manslaughter has to be proved in terms of circumstances of the death,21 in the case of any large or medium company a senior corporate official is most unlikely to have been sufficiently involved in the incident that led to the death for any culpability to be proved against him. If, for a company, culpability can be established by reference to the taking ofa risk identified in general terms—how likely was it that the company's safety procedures could result in open bow door sailing on one of its ships?—rather than from the specific facts of the instant case, even so, there may be no official of sufficient status possessed of the requisite culpability.22 Much will depend on how the business is organised. A brewery, say, may organise its shipping activities as a subdi vision ofthe main company23 or through a subsidiary with its own board—differences of organisation which may make for differences in liability. If findings of identification are confined to those corporate officials with plenary authority across a sphere of strategic corporate manage¬ ment—the minimum condition for Lord Diplock in Tesco Super¬ markets Ltd. v. Nattrass1*—at least a measure of doctrinal certainty is maintained. That certainty is lost when courts take a wider view in the interests of policy. Inconsistency inevitably arises. We are then 21 Which, of course, would be the position in respect of any individual charged as a principal offender. 22 Which was the case in the P. &amp; O. trial where Turner J. ruled that there was no case for the company to answer because of the lack of any evidence that the risk of open-bow sailings was obvious to those directors sufficiently senior to be identified with P. &amp; O.: R. v. Stanley and others, see note 16 above. 23 As in The Lady Gwendolen [1965] P.294. 24 [1972JA.C 153, 199.</page><page sequence="6">520 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] confronted with cases where, for example, a non-executive director with no involvement in the company's management is nonetheless identified with the company,25 yet the European sales manager of Dunlop (Aircraft) Ltd. is found to be too junior for identification with his employing company.26 Uncertainty is increased when courts depart altogether from the doctrine of identification in circumstances where precedent would indicate that the doctrine was germane. In Tesco Supermarkets plc v. Brent L.B.C.21 proof was required that Tesco "knew or had reasonable grounds to believe" that a hirer ofa restricted video recording was under the age of 18, an issue seemingly to be resolved on the basis of identification.28 However, the Divisional Court confirmed the finding ofthe magistrates to the effect that the knowledge of a check-out assistant should be attributed to the company. The earlier House of Lords' Tesco decision is summarily dismissed on the basis that it dealt with a provision in a different statute.29 Brent cannot be regarded as an aberration since the House of Lords took precisely the same line in Director General of Fair Trading v. Pioneer Concrete plc.20 The case involved appeals by companies against large fines imposed at trial for contempt of court. One would suppose that identification was even more in point for the issue in this case than for the issue in Brent. Although Pioneer involved a civil and not a criminal wrong, the large monetary penalties and the defiance of lawful authority were matters of more consequence for corporate reputation than the summary offence, modestly fined, in Brent.31 Yet the House found the companies to be in contempt because of the conduct of salesmen, conduct of which higher management were unaware.32 These cases presage an upheaval in the matter of attribution of 23 EI Ajou, see note 19 above. 26 R. v. Redfern, see note 20 above. 27 [1993] 1 W.L.R. 1037. And see too National Rivers Authority v. Alfred McAlpine Homes East Ltd. [1994] 4 All E.R. 286. 28 In the view of Professor Sir John Smith, [1993] Crim.L.R. 626. 29 [1993] 1 W.L.R. 1037, 1042 (Staughton LJ.). 30 [1995] 1 A.C. 456, 474 (Lord Nolan). 31 It will be recalled that civil contempt requires mens rea, can result in imprisonment or unlimited fines, that the criminal standard of proof obtains and that there are the same rights of appeal as apply to criminal contempt. The division of contempt into criminal and civil heads was criticised by the Court of Appeal in Attorney-General v. Newspaper Publishing plc and others [1988] Ch. 333. 32 It has been argued that Pioneer does not decide that a company may be liable for contempt on the basis of vicarious liability as "liability ultimately turned on the wording of the restraining order the companies had allegedly breached, which prohibited each company "whether by itself or by its servants or agents or otherwise' from giving effect to restrictive practice agreements". (CM.V. Clarkson "Kicking Corporate Bodies and Damning Their Souls" (1996) 59 M.L.R. 557 at p. 564). However, in none of the speeches did anything turn on the wording of the order: the companies' liabilities were resolved in terms of general principle. Besides, the effect of a court order, however worded, is limited by the substantive law. If the House of Lords had decided that the mens rea of contempt was to be established on the basis of identification, then the servants or agents in question would have had to have been sufficiently senior to be identified with the companies or have been directed to act in the manner that they did by someone who was.</page><page sequence="7">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 521 corporate guilt, a view amply confirmed by the Privy Council decision in Meridian Global Funds v. Management Asia Ltd33 There, the contested issue was whether the company "knew" that it had acquired a share holding in another company for the purposes of a statutory disclosure requirement.34 A fund-manager was aware of the relevant facts but he was found to lack sufficient status to be identified with the company. Nonetheless, his knowledge was found to be corporate knowledge. The Privy Council advised that the statutory policy which lay behind the disclosure requirement—transparency in a fast-moving securities market—would be frustrated if an obligation to disclose were to arise only if there was relevant knowledge on the part of senior management. Consequently, the ruling was that knowledge on the part of any corporate officer or employee obtained in the course of employment would suffice.35 The striking feature of the Meridian decision is a re-statement by Lord Hoffmann of the correct approach to questions of attributing criminal liability to companies. He denies that there is any general theory in the matter of attributing states of culpability to companies. For him, Nattrass and Lennard's Carrying do not lay down broad principle; they are merely authorities on the statutory provisions at issue in the respective cases.36 There is no overarching theory of attribution; rather, specific rules of attribution tailored to the terms and policies of the statutory provision or common law offence under review in the particular case.37 The threshold consideration is whether the offence in question is one that may be perpetrated by companies. If it is, one then moves on to a consideration of the level in the corporate hierarchy where culpability should be located in order to give best expression to the terms and policy of the offence.38 Taking Lord Hoffmann's re-statement to be the new orthodoxy, the immediate effect is to individuate all previous cases dealing with corporate mens rea. It is not easy to discern how new configurations can be imposed on this case-law. It must be emphasised that the doctrine of identification is not superseded; its status is merely reduced to one ofa set of particular rules of attribution. Which particular rule of attribution governs in a specific case not covered by previous authority is worked out by reference to the terms and policy of the offence under consideration.39 This will substitute a large measure of judicial discretion for rigid doctrine, The salience of judicial discretion 33 [1995] 2 A.C. 500. 34 Securities Amendment Act 1988 (New Zealand) s. 20(3)(4). 35 [1995] 2 A.C 500, 511. 36 Trade Descriptions Act 1968; Merchant Shipping Act 1894. 37 An approach welcomed by Professor L.S. Sealy, [1995] C.L.J. 507. 38 [1995] 2 A.C. 500, 507. 39 Ibid, at p. 507.</page><page sequence="8">522 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] may be illustrated by some examples provided in rather cursory form by Lord Hoffmann himself. In the case before him, as we have seen, the corporate knowledge which triggered a share disclosure requirement was attributed on the basis of vicarious liability. His Lordship also approved that form of liability for cases involving contempt of court and making a false tax return with intent to deceive.40 Yet he warned that vicarious liability would not always be the favoured rule. He seemed content that identification should govern in questions involving primary fault under the Merchant Shipping Act (Lennard's Carrying) and "due diligence" within the terms ofthe Trade Descriptions Act (Tesco Supermarkets v. Nattrass).41 His reference to corporate manslaughter is of particular interest. He indicated that it should not be assumed that, post-Meridian, a company would be liable for that offence on the basis of an act done with requisite culpability by any employee.42 What, doctrinally, can be made of this? The guarded reference to corporate liability in manslaughter could be read as indicating that for crimes involving censure, something more limited than vicarious liability is in order. Yet, as we know, Lord Hoffmann approved a standard of vicarious liability for cases of defrauding and contempt. If we turn to offences not discussed in Meridian, discerning the operative rule of attribution is far from obvious. Take the offence of knowingly selling military equipment to a proscribed country, the crime which featured in R. v. Redfern4y The Court of Appeal ruled that identification was the applicable rule of attribution. Yet suppose this matter is now under review by the House of Lords and the House addresses the issue of corporate liability for this offence in the fashion advised by Lord Hoffmann. It will confront a choice between identification, vicarious liability or any intermediate position between those two extremes. On the facts of Redfern the question would be whether the knowledge of the relevant circumstances on the part of European sales manager of Dunlop (Aircraft) Ltd. should be attributed to Dunlop, in the absence of any higher officer possessed of mens rea. The House must now inform its choice by reference to the terms and policy of the offence. It is far from obvious how that choice would be exercised. The fact of the matter is that scrutiny of the specification of any 40 Following Pioneer Concrete, and approving the decision in Moore v. /. Bresler Ltd. [1944] 2 All E.R. 515. #&gt;/&lt;/., atpp. 511-512. 41 Although Lord Hoffmann was concerned to read down Lennard's Carrying and Tesco Super- markets v. Nattrass as cases confined to the construction of the statutory provisions at issue in the respective cases, he approved identification as the appropriate rule of attribution for both cases: [1995] 2 A.C. 500, at pp. 508-509. 42 Ibid, atp. 512. 43 See note 20.</page><page sequence="9">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 523 particular offence will yield little, if anything, in the way of guidance in a problematic case. If an offence is of a regulatory nature, makes no reference to mens rea and involves activities or conditions such as "selling", "polluting" "possession" etc, which can be unforcedly attributed to a company as matter of statutory interpretation, we can be assured that vicarious liability will be the basis of corporate liability.44 Similar assurance is possible for an offence which makes reference to a state of mind but is confined to the observance of the conditions of a licence or to a cognate situation.45 Thereafter, all that we know is that a vicarious liability standard has now been employed in the interests of effective law enforcement in some cases failing outside these spheres, whereas in similar cases, such as the recent House of Lords' decision in Seabord Offshore Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport,46 identification has been required as the basis of liability.47 To date, vicarious liability and identification have been the only liability standards to be employed. Now, however, Meridian has alerted us to the possibility that one or more liability standards which fall between the poles of identification and vicarious liability may also be deployed. Formulating the appropriate rule of attribution for a particular offence is not best conceived as an interpretation of the offence itself. The process involves two major competing considerations. On the one hand there is a concern for effective law enforcement. Exempting companies from liability from a range of criminal offences, including serious offences, will impair deterrence. If an offence is designated as an offence which a company may commit, optimum deterrence will be achieved by imposing vicarious liability. On the other hand, militating against a wholesale adoption ofa vicarious standard, there is a concern for fairness towards companies and the constituencies within them. The more serious the offence, the higher the potential penalty, the more compelling the demand for fairness. To date, restraint in the imposition of corporate criminal liability for serious offences has been achieved by employing identification as the basis of liability, the misguided search for 'real' guilt on the part ofa legal entity. To argue for intermediate categories failing between identification and vicarious 1 i.C. Smith and B. Hogan, Criminal Law (7th edn., London 1992) pp. 170-185. 1 Ibid. ' [1994] 1 W.L.R. 541. Consequently, in Seabord, the negligence ofa chief engineer did not render the company liable for a failure to take all reasonable steps to secure that a vessel was operated in a safe manner contrary to s. 31 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988. Contrast the approach of the Court of Appeal in R. v. British Steel plc [1995] I W.L.R 1356 (discussed at pp. 540-541) where vicarious liability was the rule of attribution for a finding of a corporate failure to provide a reasonably practicable safe system of work under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The deficient supervision of an engineer, one of many employed in a similar capacity by British Steel, inculpated the company. This divergence of approach to very similar questions underlines the unpredictable nature ofthe judicial discretion involved in resolving corporate liability.</page><page sequence="10">524 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] liability is to perpetuate that error albeit with some relaxation of the rigidity of identification. It will be contended that fairness to companies is best achieved, not by creating several intermediate standards failing between vicarious liability and identification, but by investigating the relationship of the company, qua organisation, to any wrongdoing of individuals associated with it. First, however, we must examine arguments and proposals which maintain that founding corporate guilt on the fault of individuals is an inadequate response to corporate harm-doing. Proposals for recasting the manner in which companies may become liable for crimes requiring proof of mens rea have a particular claim on our attention, given the likely demise of identifica¬ tion as a general principle of liability. "Corporate" Corporate Guilt Certain academic lawyers,48 philosophers,49 social theorists50 and now legislatures51 hold that there is such a thing as genuine corporate culpability, a free-standing culpability which need not be derived from the faults of individuals associated with the company. Indeed, it has been asserted that corporate culpability may be present in circumstances where no associated individual has been in any degree at fault.52 Attempts to capture this culpability—"reactive fault", aggregation theory and a recent proposal by the English Law Commis¬ sion for an offence of corporate killing—will be examined directly and their practical implications drawn out. Concern with those implications will lead us to question whether there is such a thing as "corporate" corporate fault. The answer to that question will determine how we should proceed in recasting corporate liability. 48 C Wells, Corporations and Criminal Responsibility (Oxford 1993); B. Fisse and J. Braithwaite, Corporations, Responsibility and Corporate Society (Cambridge 1993); CM.V. Clarkson, "Kicking Corporate Bodies and Damning Their Souls" (1996) 59 M.L.R. 557. 49 P.

Gilbert, On Social Facts (New York 1989). 51 The Criminal Code Act 1995 (Commonwealth of Australia) includes a radical scheme in respect of corporate liability. It provides that where mens rea needs to be proved against a company, it may be established by, "proving that a corporate culture existed within the body corporate that directed, encouraged, tolerated or led to non-compliance with the relevant provision" (s. 12.3(2)(c)) or by "proving that the body corporate failed to create and maintain a corporate culture that required compliance with the relevant provision" (s. 12(3)(2)(d)). Seemingly, a finding of corporate guilt is not dependent on establishing that any individual associated with the company possessed mens rea for the offence unless "non-compliance with the relevant provision" is taken to imply that at least one associated individual must perpetrate the offence in his or her own right. The test for corporate negligence is unequivocally corporatist providing, inter alia, that negligence may be attributed to a company "if the body corporate's conduct is negligent when viewed as a whole (that is, by aggregating the conduct of any number of its employees, agents or officers)": s. 12(4)(2)(b). 52 The most clear-cut claim to that effect is by Professor Dan-Cohen who argues that "personless" corporations are feasible and that they would be capable of full legal agency: op. cit. note 49, chap. 3.</page><page sequence="11">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 525 (i) Reactive fault Professors Fisse and Braithwaite, in their influential writings on corporate crime,53 accept wholeheartedly the notion of an exclusively corporate culpability. They insist upon what they term the holistic view ofthe corporation and argue that an important perspective is lost if we seek always to represent corporate conduct as a function of human conduct.54 Ultimately, however, they do not accept the need to work out the metaphysics of the matter and to craft proposals in the light of any conclusion. The issue is sidestepped and a liability regime is proposed which essentially dispenses with the need to establish culpability. The justification, they argue, is gains in simplicity and deterrence, gains which are not achieved at the expense of fairness to corporations. "Reactive fault", their yardstick for corporate liability is an "unreasonable.corporate failure to devise and undertake satisfactory preventative or corrective measures in response to the commission of the actus reus of an offence".55 Commission of an actus reus is a wide basis for potential liability. Any incident during the course of a company's activities which corresponds to the external elements of an offence raises the possibility ofa corporate conviction, as when an employee is injured in the course of his work or where a company salesperson overprices the product she is selling. Corporate liability may ensue if "reactive fault" on its part can be proved. Finding culpability from acts, omissions and states of mind which occur after the commission of the actus reus is, of course, a radical departure from the norm. Seemingly, the same question—is there reactive fault?—arises whatever offence may be charged against a company. This serves to underline that whatever form of culpability inheres in a finding of reactive fault it is a culpability which differs from the culpability normally required in respect of the offence which is charged. However, their proposal might still be looked upon favourably if we could be sure of the answers to two questions. First, will the alternative culpability proposed by Fisse and Braithwaite be comparable in turpitude to the culpability which would otherwise be required for the offence with which the company has been charged? Secondly, is it possible to establish corporate culpability commensurate with the culpability normally required for the offence in circumstances where no individual associated with the company can be shown to have evinced such culpability? The second question is best addressed later in the course of our See in particular^. cit. note 48, and B. Fisse and J. Braithwaite, "The Allocation of Responsibility for Corporate Crime: Individualism, Collectivism and Accountability" (1988) 11 Sydney Law Review 468. Op. cit. note 48, chap. 2. Ibid, alp. 48.</page><page sequence="12">526 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] discussion of aggregation theory. As for the first question, considerable doubt arises concerning the issue of equivalent culpability. Assume a company employee is killed in the course of his employment in circumstances where his death is not wholly attributable to fault on his part. As we know, under a reactive fault regime, this death per se raises the possibility of corporate criminal liability. Liability depends on what the company does or fails to do in response to this fatality. Difficult questions could arise concerning required levels of ameliorative expenditure, implementation timescales, cessation of production and employment and so forth. Let us further assume that there are now grounds for a finding of reactive fault, that following the fatality the company did not do all that it could and should have done in order to make its operations safer. What of the offence to be charged? Murder is categorically ruled out for as long as the mandatory penalty remains.56 At the present time, the most serious charge that could be brought would be manslaughter. In the terms of our question, a court would have to resolve whether the company's reactive fault, in whatever form it has taken, is equivalent in turpitude to causing the employee's death by a grossly negligent act or omission.57 It may well be that Fisse and Braithwaite do not intend a court or jury to carry out this equivalence exercise. It rather seems from their account that, in the coinage of reactive fault, liability for an offence such as manslaughter may be established against a company if some criticism can be levelled at the company regarding what it did or failed to do in matters of safety following the death of its employee.58 Arguably, to require equivalent culpability is to betray a fundamental misunderstanding of their scheme. Their concern is to fashion a distinctive corporate culpability and in their terms it may simply be a case of confusion to compare what must be proved against a company with what must be proved against an individual. This point could be considered well taken if Fisse and Braithwaite were to create new offences, confined to companies, to complement the new culpability. The fact of the matter is, however, that they wish companies to be liable for well-established serious crimes on the basis of reactive fault. Yet the effective legal imposition of acceptable safety standards need not and should not involve false labelling. The serious moral censure implicit in a verdict of manslaughter should not be invoked, even against companies, unless the grounds for such censure exist. The objection arises more starkly if we substitute in the example under discussion an injury rather than a death. Let us say that the employee 56 Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. 57 Gross negligence would now be the culpability standard for corporate manslaughter in the light of Adomako [1995] 1 A.C. 171, which supersedes Seymour [1983] 2 A.C. 493. 58 Op. cit. note 48, at pp. 47-50.</page><page sequence="13">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 527 sustained a non-self-inflicted cut to his hand, a cut sufficient to constitute a wound for the purposes of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, allowing potential charges against the company under sections 18, 20, and 47 of that Act.59 Will any degree of reactive fault provide proof of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm? If not, are we to assume degrees of reactive fault corresponding to crimes of greater or lesser seriousness? Should reactive fault ever be adopted, an enormous change in the law would be brought about. Most deaths or injuries arising in the contexts of manufacturing industry, mining, extraction, building and construction, air, rail and sea transport, road accidents involving corporate vehicles, and so forth, would potentially involve serious criminal liability on the part of companies. Problems of resources and time60 would entail an enormous discretion on the part of prosecutors. The cases likely to arise under a reactive fault regime would impose great forensic burdens. The issue would not be culpability with regard to a particular incident but a review of corporate safety or other relevant procedures within an open-ended time frame. Given the familiarity of companies with their own procedures and the opportuni- ties for obfuscation and prolixity that would arise for organisations with the resources to take them, there would be much to be said for placing a burden of proof on the company to establish a lack of reactive fault. But this would make the change even more profound. For reasons of principle and policy it is submitted that reactive fault is an untenable basis for corporate liability. (ii) The theory of aggregation The theory of aggregation is an attempt to capture and express a truly corporate guilt.61 Crucially, the theory allows the culpability specified in a particular offence to be established even though there may be no individual associated with the company who is possessed of the culpability for the offence. Yet the starting place for the theory is the faults of associated individuals. There is nothing in the theory itself which informs whether the faults of all or only a restricted class of those individuals associated with the company may be attributed: that would be a matter of stipulation on grounds other than the theory itself. Under the terms of the theory, the faults of two or more 59 Wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, malicious wounding and occasioning actual bodily harm, respectively. 60 Concern is frequently expressed about the adequacy of the resources and commitment given to enforcing safety legislation: e.g. D.

A judgment then has to be made as to whether this consolidated fault, in its totality, constitutes the culpability that is required for proof of the offence. If one or more associated individuals is possessed in full of the relevant culpability, the theory will not, in that particular application, extend beyond vicarious liability. The theory comes into its own where it cannot be said of any associated individuals that they have the culpability which the offence requires. When that situation arises the true nature of the theory is revealed. If we are seeking property X— the culpability for the offence—we will not stop until we find X, however many other items we encounter in our search that have an affinity with X but are ultimately less than X. Yet aggregation allows a finding of X without encountering X. The theory should, perhaps, be called the theory of exacerbation. Each fault less than X that we find makes matters worse for the company, and is a step towards X. When X can be said to be found is a matter of imprecise judgment. The theory can only possess a degree of coherence if we assume that one person has exhibited all the less-than-X faults and that person is, of course, the company. The theory is underpinned by the assumption that a corporation is a real person, absorbing over time and space the totality ofthe faults of all those other persons associated with it. Whether companies may be considered as "real" moral agents is a matter to be discussed. First, we should look at some of the practical implications of adopting the aggregation theory. Assume that a company is charged with manslaughter and that the prosecution is allowed to invoke the aggregation theory to prove grossly negligent conduct on the part of the company. Obviously, the prosecution will call various persons associated with the company to elicit what they did or failed to do. As already explained, recourse to aggregation theory is only required if the prosecution cannot establish that at least one of these persons possessed the culpability for the offence; otherwise vicarious liability will do the job.62 Suppose that no individual has been shown to have possessed the requisite culpability and yet the jury, directed in the terms of aggregation theory, has found the comoanv euiltv. All those natural oersons who have been criticised at At present, identification will be the rule of attribution: see note 16 above. When this matter was before the courts the culpability required was based on "Caldweir recklessness, now displaced by gross negligence since the decision in Adomako [1995] 1 A.C. 171. lt is doubtful whether this, of itself will change the rule of attribution employed, given that the kind of recklessness formerly at issue had a very close affinity with negligence. It will be argued below that vicarious liability tempered by a due diligence defence is the appropriate standard for corporate manslaughter, an argument that gains some support from appellate decisions, previously discussed, which have extended, piecemeal, the range of vicarious liability as the applicable rule of attribution. Lord Hoflmann's doubts in Meridian, concerning the propriety of using vicarious liability as the standard in corporate manslaughter suggest caution for any prediction.</page><page sequence="15">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 529 the trial (with likely press coverage) will be closely associated with the verdict. Indeed, apart from being found guilty in their own right, the association could not be closer. What they did or failed to do is the very stuff of the company's guilt. They will fall under the shadow of a serious offence (with possible disciplinary, employment and pension-right consequences) without the necessary culpability being established against them. Moreover, as in the case of reactive fault, the issues to which aggregation could give rise to would entail difficult and protracted trials. The very nature of the theory would encourage the prosecution to trawl for as much fault as it could find from within the company. Employing our earlier convention, in any prosecution where aggrega¬ tion is the only way to establish guilt, the prosecution would have to prove X in a case when none of the facts it sets out to prove will, outside the theory, prove X. What the prosecution must assume is that a sufficient number of less-than-Xs may persuade a jury to find X. This will encourage them to bring to the trial as many less-than-Xs as they can. The melancholy experience with serious fraud63 indicates that sharp-edged, clear-cut issues are even more in point for offences charged against large, complex organisations than for individuals. The Australian Commonwealth Code Act 1995 adopts aggregation as one of the ways in which the culpability required for a particular offence may be attributed to a company.64 To date, English law has not adopted the aggregation theory.65 (iii) The Law Commission's proposal for an offence of corporate killing In its recent report on involuntary manslaughter, the Law Commission has proposed an offence of "corporate killing", an offence which will be exclusive to companies and which broadly corresponds to its proposal for a general offence of killing by gross carelessness.66 The corporate offence will require proof of culpability and is only to be deployed where "the negligence in question must have been very 63 G.R. Sullivan, "The Particularity of Serious Fraud" in Pressing Problems of Law, ed. P. Birks (Oxford 1995) 99, at pp. 102-103. 64 See note 49 above. 65 In criminal law contexts, the theory has been rejected, see citations at note 16. The Court of Appeal in Wilsher v. Essex Area Health Authority [1987] Q.B. 730 and in Bull v. Devon Area Health Authority [1993] 4 Med. L.R. 116 canvassed the possibility of liability in negligence on the basis ofa finding that a system was deficient, a form of direct liability not dependent on proof of negligence on the part of any individual. The trial decision of W.B. Anderson v. Rhodes [1967] 2 All E.R. 850 has been characterised as an example of negligence liability on the basis of aggregation. Figures had been negligently compiled by the company bookkeeper (who was not in a relationship of sufficient proximity with the plaintiff) and passed on to the plaintiff in a non- negligent fashion by a company employee who was in relationship of sufficient proximity to the plaintiff. The criticisms made in the text against aggregation lose some force in civil law contexts but the theory still allows a fabrication rather than a finding of any culpability that may be required. 66 Law Com. No. 237 (1996) para. 8.1-8.77.</page><page sequence="16">530 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] serious".67 The negligence in question is to be a truly corporate negligence, not tied to findings of negligence against any associated individual.68 Findings of corporate culpability can be made without necessarily assessing the culpability of associated individuals because "in practice, it is often possible to state with confidence what the corporation did or omitted to do without investigating the conduct of individual controlling officers".69 While it is true that a judgment on corporate performance can be made without reference to the performance of associated individuals where the question is one of compliance with a strict standard, it is less clear how this may be done where the issue is whether the corporation should be subjected to particular forms of criticism. If a company qua company is to be found seriously negligent (or reckless or dishonest etc.) without that finding resting on the proved culpability of an associated individual, some theory which allows "corporate" corporate culpability has to be at work. The two theories we have discussed—reactive fault and aggregation—are explicitly rejected in the Commission's report.70 The report also discountenances any suggestion that companies are "real"; it adopts Lord Hoffmann's position that companies are mere creatures of law.71 In lieu of any theory we are offered a definition which provides A corporation is guilty of corporate killing if— (a) a management failure by the corporation is the cause or one of the causes of a person's death; and (b) that failure constitutes conduct failing far below what can reasonably be expected of the corporation in the circumstances. (c) ... there is a management failure by a corporation if the way in which its activities are managed or organised fails to ensure the health and safety of persons employed in or affected by those activities. . . ,72 What will constitute a management failure seems relatively straight¬ forward. Such a failure will occur in the relevant sense whenever a death would not have occurred had the company been managed or organised differently in terms of health and safety provision. Far less clear is how it will be established that such a failure constituted 67 /&amp;/&lt;/., paras. 8.5, 8.34. 68 Paras. 7.21; 7.30; 7.31; 7.33; 8.4; 8.8. 69 Para. 7.33. 70 Paras. 7.32-7.35. 71 Para. 8.3. However in the explication of its proposal for an ofTence of corporate killing, the Commission employs language which implies the reality of companies as in para. 8.8, where addressing the best basis of attribution it poses the question "in what circumstances can it properly be said, not merely that the conduct of a corporation's agents has caused a death, but that the conduct of the corporation itself has done so."

Attribution of Culpability 531 conduct failing far below what could have been reasonably expected ofthe company in the circumstances. If, despite talk by the Commission ofthe existence of an organisational liability not reducible to individual liability, we take seriously its professed belief that corporations are legal as opposed to real entities, a finding of sufficiently egregious failure must rest on the managerial or organisational failures of associated individuals.73 This must lead, irrespective of the Commis¬ sion's intentions, to the use of aggregation in obtaining corporate convictions and should this occur, as explained earlier, companies will be treated as real not merely legal entities, whatever protestations are made to the contrary.74 From consideration of the grounds of liability under the Commis¬ sion's proposal, it would seem that aggregation need not be invoked whenever the managerial or organisational failings of at least one associated individual fall far below of what could reasonably have been expected and constitutes one ofthe causes ofthe fatality. In such a case it is immaterial if the failings of other individuals are added to bolster the case against the company. As long as at least one individual has exhibited the culpability required, we encounter a form of vicarious liability restricted to those who perform managerial or organisational tasks. The Report insists however, that corporate liability should not be confined to circumstances where it can be proved that a managerial individual possessed the requisite culpability. It is asserted that liability may be imposed without demonstrating that any individual was culpable.75 Yet if the culpability does not inhere in the corporation as a thing in itself, there can only be a collective judgment on the performance of the relevant class of individuals. If a finding of corporate culpability is made in circumstances where it cannot be said of any individual member of the class that his conduct fell far beyond what could reasonably be expected and was also in a causal relationship to the death, we encounter aggregation by whatever name called. If the Commission's proposal implies aggregation, it is objectionable for the reasons already given.76 If it does not involve aggregation, the basis of liability for this offence is obscure in what is the most prominent part of its potential application. The obscurity results from the lack of any informing theory. The Commission accepts that companies are mere legal entities, yet it essentially treats them as real entities.77 We are given no explanation ofthe reality of companies and 73 At para. 8.4 the Commission envisages juries finding whether a risk, "was or should have been obvious to any individual or group of individuals within the company who were or should have been responsible for taking safety measures, in deciding whether the company's conduct fell below the required standard." 74 See above at pp. 528-529. 75 See note 68 above. 76 Above at p. 529. 77 See note 71 above.</page><page sequence="18">532 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] how they may possess a culpability that is inherently their own. Consequently, it is difficult to determine what matters juries might appropriately take into account if they should ever be called upon to decide what deaths are corporate killings. (iv) Are corporations real? The accounts of "corporate" corporate liability which we have reviewed have been criticised in terms of their foundations and their likely practical effect. Still open is the question of whether corporations are "real" in the sense that they may be regarded as substantive moral agents. If the conclusion is affirmative, it follows that further attempts should be made to identify and formulate a truly corporate culpability. But if the moral reality of companies cannot be demonstrated, it may be best to employ more straightforward means of deploying the deterrent resources of the criminal law against organisations. Many writers on corporate liability take the position that an account of corporate behaviour cannot be exhaustively given by reference to the conduct of individuals associated with it. As Professor Wells has put it, the effect of imposing corporate structures on human interaction is to make "2 + 2 = 5":78 it is in the surplus that we find the quintessence of corporateness. A common way of asserting the reality of this additional substance is to make the ontological claim that the world is not exclusively a natural place but contains non-natural items such as souls, capacities ofthe will independent of mind and body and so forth. Plato and Hegel and other less eminent idealist philosophers have asserted the transcendent reality of the non-natural. It will be recalled that the nation-state was the most real thing of all for Hegel79 and, more recently, Professor Scruton has argued that forms of association such as companies subsume and transcend the individuals associated with them.80 Such an ontology can readily accommodate companies as not merely legally constituted but as actors in the world with their own intentionality and biography. It is submitted that this "idealist" view of companies would provide an unsuitable foundation for corporate criminal liability in English law. It is partly a matter of history and habits of mind. The only flirtation with an organic view of companies in English law—the theory of identification—does not rest on any assumptions about the metaphysical reality of companies81 but on a rough and ready 78 Wells, op. cit., note 48, at p. 88. 79 The Philosophy of Right (translated by T.M. Knox), especially at pp. 279-283. 80 R.

Attribution of Culpability 533 anthropomorphism.82 The most prominent Anglo-American theoreti¬ cal accounts of the nature of companies, the accounts of Hohfeld and Hart,83 bypass organic theory entirely and take it as axiomatic that companies are legal as opposed to real entities.84 None of this might matter if we could be confident that the organic theory is the best account of companies and is the theory that will ultimately prevail. The problem here is how to accommodate those persons, such as Lord Hoffmann, who insist, "There is in fact no such thing as the company as such, no ding and sich . . ,"85 Speaking for himself, this writer cannot see how he would ever become convinced of the reality of companies other than by empirically-founded inductive reasoning and, of course, organic theory derived from idealist philosophy lies entirely outside that tradition. A general Anglo-American adoption of organic theory seems unlikely. However, there are theoretical accounts of companies as moral agents in their own right which are based on a natural account of the world. Perhaps the best known is in Professor French's Collective and Corporate Responsibility.™ French's theory starts from an examination of the way in which organisations of a certain size, complexity and longetivity decide to do things. He maintains that if the modus operandi of organisations is examined and properly understood, an agency is revealed which is intrinsic to corporations and not reducible to the agency, individual or collective, of associated individuals. The key for French is what he terms corporate internal decision procedures. These are characterised by: a Internal organisation and/or decision procedures by which courses of concerted action can be chosen. b Enforced standards of conduct different from and more stringent than those applying in the wider community. c Members filling differing defined roles by virtue of which they exercise powers over other members.87 French maintains that over a sufficiency of time, the decision- making processes of a company are capable of generating plans and projects with which an associated individual may have only a 82 Given vivid expression by Lord Denning in Bolton (Engineering) Co. Ltd. v. Graham &amp; Sons (1957] 1 Q.B. 159, 172. 83 Fundamental Legal Conceptions (Yale 1919) at pp. 198-200; 220 et seq.; "Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence" (1954) 70 L.Q.R. 37. 84 It will be recalled that Hohfeld barely acknowledged any separate legal existence inhering in companies, regarding references to companies as, essentially, a shorthand account of legal relationships between individuals, a view cogently attacked by Hart who allowed companies a reality but a purely legal one. The Hohfeldian view retains currency for scholars who would reduce companies to a "nexus of contracts" as in F. Easterbrook and D. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law (Harvard, 1991) chap. 1. 85 Op. cit. note 10. 86 New York, 1984. 87 French at p. 31.</page><page sequence="20">534 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] contingent relationship. The company, through its procedures, can respond to the world beyond it and adjust and change its plans and projects. Thus it may be (though as a matter of fact rather than necessity) that the company qua company may be possessed of an intention which no individual associated with it shares. That intention may be changed or adjusted as circumstances require through corpor¬ ate decision making procedures. For French this is sufficient for moral agency; ergo companies, for him, are moral agents.88 A similar account is offered by Professor Dan-Cohen in his Rights, Persons and Organisations: A Legal Theory for a Bureaucratic Society}9 He argues that bureaucratic structures with their capacity to evolve, mutate and reproduce may become, essentially, free-standing entities in their own right.90 The relationship between these entities and the individuals associated with them becomes contingent rather than necessary. Bureaucratic procedures may become so complex, automa¬ tic and self-perpetuating that the role of individual human agency in bureaucratic decision-making may become inscrutable.91 He makes the ultimate claim that the reality of bureaucratic structures need not depend on any form of human association. Personless corporations may exist not merely as legal constructs but as intelligent, computer- directed decision-making systems.92 Fundamentally, the accounts of French and Dan-Cohen are empirical accounts. The intelligence and decision-making capacities of companies that they speak of are located in the natural world alongside the capacities of humans and animals. Consequently their work presents a genuine challenge to those, like the present writer, who insist that an exhaustive treatment of the nature of companies can only be given in legal terms. It does not seek, as earlier idealist theories do, to place the "reality" of companies in a non-natural realm beyond empirical refutation.93 Issue, then, can be properly joined. A challenge to the notion of companies as moral agents can be mounted from the perspective of "methodological individualism". An adherent of that 88 Ibid, pp. 35-62. 89 California 1986. 90 A very similar theory is offered by G. Teubner, The Essence ofa Legal Person' (1988) 36 Am. J. Comp. L 130. 91 Dan-Cohen, chaps. 1 and 2. 92 Ibid, chap. 3. 93 For a view that French offers merely a semantic account of the agency of companies rather than a substantive account see G. Ouyang and R. Shiner, "Organisations and Agency" (1995) 1 Legal Theory 283. His semantic account, they argue, means no more than that sentences which ascribe intentionality to a company as in "company x intends to diversify its range of products", have a semantic truth value. As the authors maintain, this is an inadequate basis for a finding of full moral agency. They acknowledge however that other commentators take French to be offering the foundations for a substantive account of moral agency (at p. 301). For this commentator, French is making the claim that the structures of decision-making typical of many companies generate a distinctively corporate intentionality, an intentionality as much part of the natural world as human intentionality. This claim is criticised below at pp. 535-537.</page><page sequence="21">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 535 school would assert that claims that companies are moral agents or "intelligent machines" are not, on examination, empirical claims at all, merely idealist claims dressed up in empirical garb. Methodological individualism is the assertion that all social and economic phenomena are attributable to human agency and human agency alone.94 It is most famously associated with Sir Karl Popper's dismissal ofthe claim that historical laws rather than human agency determine patterns of social and economic development.95 It is equally well adapted to challenging the claim that human agency may be submerged in social and bureaucratic structures and that these structures may take on an autonomous social reality. Methodological individualism would claim that, without human agency, there is nothing left in economic and social terms. That void will appear, however long-lasting, complex and familiar are the structures that humans impose on their social and economic interactions. Corporations and bureaucracies rest on human agency and do not transmute that agency into some form of non- human phenomena. The strength of this position is best tested by posing hypothetical circumstances where a claim ofa true corporate culpability not derived from human culpability may acquire some initial plausibility. Take a company which has been selling arms to a proscribed country and is likely to be charged with knowingly selling military equipment. French, we will recall, maintains that a company may possess a state of mind in circumstances where no individual associated with it shows a like state of mind. A methodological individualist denies that such a fact can exist, asserting that the only minds which exist are the ones inside our heads. Accordingly, if methodological individualism is correct, the French claim is revealed to be idealist and not empirical. Variations on this arms sales theme will be employed to see if we can, in the manner of French, identify corporate knowledge which is independent of the state of mind of any one or more individuals associated with the company. Assume company X has well-established sales links with the proscribed country. The proscription comes into force, but company X makes no changes. Orders emanating from the proscribed country are dealt with and arms are despatched in the long familiar way. Nothing is said, let alone discussed, concerning these sales. Yet if anyone within the company is aware of the destination of these weapons, we can fashion a legal rule whereby that person's knowledge is attributed to the company without any theorising along the lines presented by French. Under the identification doctrine, the individual with the requisite knowledge would merely need to be of sufficient 94 See J.W.N. Watkins, "Historical Explanation in the Social Sciences" (1957-58) 8 British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 104. 95 The Poverty of Historicism (London 1957).</page><page sequence="22">536 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] status to support a finding, within the doctrine's terms, of knowing selling on the part of the company. The narrowness of the identification doctrine is a good reason for looking for alternatives to it as a rule of attribution. French's alternative, if properly understood, is to look directly into the company itself and seek a specifically corporate knowledge arising from the company's decision-making structures. Yet the procedures that a company currently has do not arise spontaneously; they are not the equivalent of a virgin birth. The organisational structure is ultimately the product of human agency, however sophisticated and automated a company's procedures may be. Of course, the current board of company X may have inherited and uncritically adopted the current trading patterns ofthe company; they may be, as it were, on automatic pilot. Yet that very state of affairs is attributable to their agency and is a state of affairs that could be changed or adjusted if they so chose. It is not obvious why one should look for the culpability for an offence within the company structure rather than among those individuals respopsible for maintaining that structure and thereby standing in a relationship of responsibility for the decisions generated within it. The claim that there can be an inherently corporate mental state is made most starkly if we take company X to be one of Dan-Cohen's personless corporations, a company of some future time which can come into legal being, all legal formalities satisfied, as an artificial intelligence system operated by robots. Once the system is set up, it manufactures products, takes and executes orders and so forth without any further human intervention. Because of the sophistication of its programme, company X can respond to the fact that a particular country may not lawfully acquire its products by creating false certification, arranging intermediate destinations for its shipments in order to continue trading with that country. Assume that no human individual, past or present, is in any way at fault for the fact that company X is trading and will continue to trade with a proscribed country: if there is any knowledge present here at all, it can only be the knowledge of company X.96 Whether X's system-guided responses can be taken to be states of mind cognate with human states of mind is a contested philosophical question.97 Yet even if we assume that artificial intelligence is a form ' It may be thought that the example requires too much of a suspension of disbelief. Yet to put the arguments we are testing in their strongest form, we must imagine a world, however unlikely, where AI systems develop and change in ways not anticipated by their programmers and in a manner which eludes detection. D.C. Dennet in "Intentional Systems" in Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology, (Cambridge Mass. 1978) and The Intentional Stance (Cambridge Mass. 1987) maintains that it is possible in principle to attribute intentional states to Al systems even while accepting that those systems lack consciousness or any other "mental" attributes. By contrast, J.R. Searle in Intentionality: an Essay in the Philosophy of Mind (Cambridge 1983) claims that</page><page sequence="23">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 537 of autonomous ratiocination and that an Al system generates genuine states of mind, it is well to remind ourselves that we are not discussing intentionality in its own right but intentionality as a predicate of criminal culpability. Though we have allowed the possibility that there may be non-human systems which can possess intentionality or knowledge, it is, pace French, a further and a much larger step to claim that these properties are a sufficient condition for moral agency. We are presented, in another guise, with the familiar problem of the psychopath. It is not possible to speak of guilt or culpability if the entity to be judged lacks any capacity for empathy, unease, remorse, self-doubt or anything that remotely approaches a conscience.98 It is one thing to employ rules of attribution whereby the genuine culpability of individuals is attributed as a matter of convention to a company in pursuit of whatever gains in welfare such an attribution may bring. It is quite another to declare that culpability has been manifested when the foundations of culpability are nowhere to be found. We have conceded, if only for the sake of argument, that if you take all human (and non-human) animals out of the world you may still be left with some forms of intentionality, but it is doubtful whether we would be left with any forms of guilt.99 All that said, an account of society and its institutions which follows methodological individualism to the letter is to some extent an intentionality loses coherence as a category of experience if we divorce it from consciousness. He argues persuasively that to ascribe intentionality to a non-conscious system omits its representa- tional character and suppresses the fact that an intentional state presents its object in a particular way to a centre of consciousness. 5 For an elaboration of this position see P. Arenella, "Convicting the Morally Blameless: Reassessing the Relationship between Legal and Moral Accountability" (1992) 39 U.CL.A. L. Rev. 1511. Of course, for human agents the lack of empathy, contrition etc. may be characterised as part ofthe very badness that is to be condemned but such reasoning has no application to impersonal entities. See, too, S. Wolf, "The Legal and Moral Responsibility of Organisations" in Pennock and Chapman (eds.) Criminal Justice (New York 1985) at pp. 276-279. For a contrary view see Clarkson, op cit. note 48 at pp. 566-567. Inter alia, he rejects emotional capacity as a predicate for culpability because it would exclude negligence as a basis of criminal liability. While it may be that findings of negligence may appropriately be made against psychopathic individuals, nonetheless negligence is exclusively a human failing. If it is to be said that something has happened because of negligence, then at least one individual, whether or not identifiable, must have been at fault. For Clarkson companies can act negligently in their own right as they are "something more than simply the sum of their human components", a position he takes for reasons similar to those put forward by French. 1 English law does not accept moral blamelessness or indeed moral credit as an answer to a criminal charge even for serious offences: Yip Chiu-cheung v. R.\ [1995] 1 A.C. 111 (P.C), approved by the House of Lords in R. v. Kingston [1994J 2 A.C. 355. All that is required is a match between the ofTence specification and the defendant's conduct and state of mind, subject to recognised defences. On that approach, it could be said that there is only a contingent relationship between mens rea and moral culpability and no legal objection to convicting subjects incapable of moral response. It is submitted that the stance taken on this matter by English law is unprincipled: G.R. Sullivan "Making Excuses" in A Simester and A.T.H. Smith, eds., Harm and Culpability (Oxford 1996) 131, at pp. 148-151. Be that as it may, the argument in the text is that personless companies should be excluded from the criminal law as a morally irresponsible class by way of analogy with infants and the insane. Yip Chiu-cheung concerned a person, not before the court, who had acted irreproachably but who was assumed to be guilty of a serious offence. Unlike an infant or personless company, however, he was a responsible person.</page><page sequence="24">538 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] impoverished account. Professor Ernest Gellner, in his opposition to that school, made the telling point that if we were to avoid consistently any holistic account of our institutions and practices, many tales would take much longer in the telling and there would often be a feeling that something important had been left out.100 "The team played well" may require little unpacking, yet if we were to redistribute that judgment by way of an account, however meticulous and accurate, of each individual's performance the full story would remain untold. There is something missing—call it wholeness, synergy, whatever—if we refuse to allow the group ever to transcend its individual members. This point is made with particular force and clarity in Professor John Searle's The Construction of Social Reality.m He agrees with the methodological individualists that the only intents there are are the intents inside our heads. Any theory that impersonal entities may possess intents is, for him, empirically unfounded and frequently a consequence of conceptual confusion.102 But recognition of that important truth should not blind us to the pervasiveness and necessity of what he terms "collective intentionality". Collective intentionality is his term for those intents that only arise, and necessarily arise, when we interact socially with others. Collective intentionality is mischaracterised if it is presented as a coincidence of respective individual intents. It is an account of the way in which social interactions generate individual intents. The intents flow from the activity or institution to the individual. The coincidence of respective individual intents does not make the institution; it is the other way around. This point is made in an obvious and vivid way by using Searle's example ofa game.103 A resolves that he will tackle B, if B has the ball and attempts to run past him. A has made that resolution because he is playing rugby football. Rugby football requires a collective intention on the part of all the participants to play that game, otherwise the game would not be possible. Once a collective intention to play the game is instituted, it plays a constitutive role in the individual intents formed in the minds of the players. Those individual intents flow downwards from the collective intent to play the game. Searle draws out the centrality of collective intentionality in the making of our social institutions.104 Without it, such items as money, ownership and companies would not be possible. It is responsible for many ofthe intents formed by individuals. Persons who are members E. Gellner, "Holism versus Individualism" in M.

Attribution of Culpability 539 of organisations bonded by a collective intent may form individual, anti-social intents which they would not have formed if they had not been members of the organisation. We have rejected the claim that when such an organisation takes a corporate form it becomes a moral agent in its own right. Nor can any systemic claim be made that individuals bear less responsibility for those intents which are generated by a collective intentionality than for those of their intents which are not. Yet we can and should take cognisance of the fact that the collective intentionality associated with a corporate organisation can be an extremely powerful social force. Consequently, it is entirely appropriate that collective intentionality should be treated as something to which the criminal law can respond and which it can seek to influence.105 It should not do this by issuing false tokens. It should not say that companies are real and have their own distinctive culpability. It should not, as reactive fault and aggregation do, deem a crime to exist when the constituent elements of the crime have not been established. Nevertheless, the culpability of an individual associated with a company may well have been influenced by the organisational character of the company. Improvement in that character and a deterrent example to other organisations may well be achieved by conventionally assigning the individual's culpability to the company for the purposes ofa corporate criminal conviction. Much may also be done by imposing minimum standards for the conduct of companies. These processes should not be side-tracked by seeking the chimera of a corporate culpability disassociated from human culpability. Appropriate standards of safety, pollution control etc. should be formulated and corporate performan- ces assessed in terms of compliance or non-compliance with those standards. The appropriate legal mechanisms for these tasks will now be discussed. Attributing Culpability: the Case for Vicarious Liability tempered by Due Diligence This paper began with an examination of the current state of the doctrine of identification, a doctrine that may be on the point of disintegration. The doctrine becomes even less attractive if we conclude that companies cannot be characterised as moral agents in their own right. The doctrine assumes the "real" guilt of companies and finds such guilt by doing what it can to make company guilt correspond to human guilt. The one merit of the doctrine is that it does not make phantom crimes: the constituent elements of any offence for which a An analogy may be drawn with the "common-purpose" requirement in riot which makes what otherwise would be the offence of violent disorder into the more serious offence: see now Public Order Act 1986, s. 1.</page><page sequence="26">540 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] company may be incriminated by an application of the doctrine will be present, a significant virtue. That exhausts the credit side. There nowhere exists a convincing defence of identification either as a theory or in terms of its practical effects. It is to be hoped that the House of Lords' decision in Pioneer Concrete together with the Privy Council's decision in Meridian mark a new point of departure in judicial attributions of states of culpability to companies. Moreover, recent legislative enactments and the proposals of the English Law Commis¬ sion in the matter of corporate killing are indicative of a widespread perception that change is due.106 Before we discuss how best to attribute culpability to companies, it should first be said that there are significant advantages to be had from a corporate criminal liability which dispenses altogether with culpability and imposes standards which, without more, must be attained by companies. These advantages have been placed in sharp focus by the recent Court of Appeal decision in R. v. British Steel plc.m In that case a question arose under the Health and Safety Act at Work 1974 as to whether British Steel had provided a safe system of work "as far as was reasonably practicable". Repositioning of a steel platform had taken place under the supervision of an experienced and skilled engineer employed by British Steel, and owing to deficien¬ cies in his supervision a workman employed by an outside contractor was killed. The company argued that it should be only liable if some relevant shortcoming could be identified at the level of senior management. The relevant director responsible for corporate safety had done all that could reasonably have been required of him by ensuring that the installation was supervised by a competent person. The Court of Appeal, clarifying previous authority, rejected identifica¬ tion as the rule of attribution under the Act. It took judicial notice of the fact that, in previous trials where identification was taken to be the applicable rule, many days of cross-examination were taken up with the question whether particular individuals were sufficiently elevated in terms of status and role to be identified with the company.108 In the same vein, the Court declined to interpret "reasonably practicable" as the taking of reasonable precautions. It observed that when that reading had been adopted by courts there had been lengthy and complex expert evidence as to what was reasonable in particular circumstances. Accordingly, the phrase was taken to mean "within the bounds of possibility".109 We are thus left with a sharply defined standard: if at all possible, a company must provide a safe system of 106 Op. cit. notes 51, 72. 107 [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1356. 108 Ibid.,SLtp. 1363H. 109 Ibid, aipp. 1362-1363.</page><page sequence="27">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 541 work for its employees and those they engage from outside contractors. Possibility is interpreted in terms of attainability and what is attainable is not measured by considerations of convenience and customary practice. This could be perceived as rough justice, albeit in the context of a trial where the fine imposed was £100, an amount described as "derisory" by the Court of Appeal.110 Yet companies will now know where they stand. A company is responsible for providing a safe system. Only employers can be charged as a principals. Should any individual be charged with complicity with a company, it would be necessary to provide against the individual the culpability which charges of complicity require, whether or not the principal offence requires proof of mens rea.U] The company is punished, but pejorative labels which might stick to individuals are avoided. Above all, British Steel addresses questions of forensic practicability in the prosecution of wealthy and complex organisations, organisations which will vigorously exercise their right to contest prosecutions. The issue was whether the engineer directing the installation of the platform could have done a better job, and that is a manageable question for a jury or magistrate. Contrast the situation that might arise if a similar death at work were to be made the subject of a prosecution for the proposed offence of corporate killing. As we have already suggested, the grounds of liability for this offence are unclear.112 A crucial question that will arise is whether the company's conduct fell far below what could reasonably have been expected of it 'in the circumstances'. The Commission felt that it was neither practicable nor desirable to specify in legislative form what "circumstances" should be taken to include but envisaged a jury, "balancing such matters as the likelihood and possible extent ofthe harm arising from the way in which the company conducted its operations against the social utility of its activities and the cost and practicability of taking steps to eliminate or reduce the risk of death or serious personal injury".113 This balancing exercise invites what can best be described as a full scale safety audit of a company where death has occurred within the course of its corporate activities. While there may be much to be said for wide-ranging safety-audits following such deaths, an adversarial trial is not necessarily the best forum. The scope and nature of the issues to be contested will be difficult to narrow down at the outset and the evidence will range far beyond the essentials of the incident that caused the death. To argue against this proposal is in no sense to 110 Ibid, at p. 1364. Steyn LJ. stated that he would have favoured a "substantial" fine. 1,1 Johnson \.

No. 237 para. 8.6.</page><page sequence="28">542 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] favour a "hands-off" approach to corporate activities. Dangerous activities require regulation backed by sufficient sanctions, funding and enforcement commitment, and a sufficient distance between regulators and the regulated. It is doubtful whether any of these conditions are met at the present time.114 Yet the current offence of corporate manslaughter or even the proposed offence of corporate killing are unlikely to diminish substantially the additional hazards that may arise from de jure or defacto deregulation. Convictions for corporate killing, if the offence is enacted, should be easier to obtain than for manslaughter under the present law, but the offence lacks the guiding authority of clear, industry-specific standards which may be consistently enforced. The point may be made by reference to what was, perhaps, the most disturbing fact to emerge from the Zeebrugge tragedy. It seems that the loss of life could have been averted if an inexpensive electrical device had been fitted to P &amp; O ferries.115 This alerts the bridge if the bow door has not been closed prior to sailing. Such devices were available at the time of the tragedy, though not widely used in the British ferry industry. Could the failure to install such a device be regarded as conduct failing far below the standard that could reason¬ ably have been expected from P &amp; O in the circumstances? Here arises the difficulty of using denunciatory language in reiation to activities which are intrinsically lawful and socially useful if properly conducted. Nowadays, a tragedy related to a failure to install such a device would be likely to attract deserved censure, as such devices are now legally required of ferry companies. But what of the mere fact of operating a Ro/Ro ferry for profit? Is that blameworthy per sel As everyone now knows, the major threat to life comes from the very nature of the vessel. But am I to be liable for the manslaughter of one of my children because I failed to buy a car with a body-shell and air-bags even though I could have afforded it? Safety standards are best achieved by specific regulation, which in the case of companies carrying out hazardous activities may need draconian enforcement. However, it is well established that criminal liability of companies is not confined to regulatory law and the Law Commission, among many others, sees a useful role for serious offences carrying stigma to enhance standards of corporate safety. The shortcomings ofthe present state of regulation imply a residual role for such offences. The question then arises how the culpability required for serious criminal offences is best attributed to corporate organisations.

Attribution of Culpability 543 rhetoric should not be employed unless an event meriting such a response has occurred. On the view of companies taken here, that must mean that at least one individual associated with the company has exhibited in the course of employment the culpability for the offence for which the company has been charged. That fact alone should bring the company to the threshold of liability for the offence. "Course of employment" should be given the interpretation familiar from well-established legal usage. However, in the context of serious offences, a crime perpetrated in the course of employment should not inculpate the company where the company, in terms of its constituencies, is itself the sole victim of the offence.116 There will however be "mixed" cases where both the company and interests external to it are adversely affected by the criminal acts of an employee. We can take the case of an insurance salesman who pockets for himself premiums paid over by the company's customers. In such a case both company and customer are likely to suffer adverse consequences. The detriment to the customer should render the company potentially liable for the offence notwithstanding its own loss. This proposal for vicarious liability for all offences is an alarmingly wide basis of attribution where serious offences are concerned. Taking our insurance example, even an impeccably run company may find itself employing, from time to time, an employee who turns out to be dishonest. It would clearly be unfair to label the company dishonest in such a case and accordingly some attenuation of vicarious liability is desirable in such circumstances. This should not involve looking for alternatives to "course of employment" as the initial trigger for potential corporate liability. All things considered, it is the most clearcut, practicable standard to employ. It is notable that in the recent cases where appellate courts departed from identification, they opted for vicarious liability and not any via media between identification and vicarious liability. Formulating an appropriately nuanced rule of attribution for each particular case would be a difficult exercise involving outcomes likely to defy prediction. By contrast, vicarious liability is a long familiar principle. That too provides it with a signal advantage over alternative schemes such as that proposed by the Law Commission, which would require forensic bedding-down. Yet if vicarious liability is to be the general rule of attribution, in the case of serious offences, well-run companies should be afforded an opportunity to distance the organisation from an offence perpetrated by one or more of its officers or employees. This will become particularly pertinent if, in the wake of some future large-scale As is the position in U.S. Federal law: Standard Oil Company ofTexas v. United States (1962) 307 F. 2D. 120.</page><page sequence="30">544 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] tragedy, prosecutors have recourse to an offence such as corporate manslaughter which is imputable to the company on the basis of untrammelled vicarious liability. Complex processes involving myriad human and computerised interactions over the course of time may give rise to risks which elude the most sophisticated and conscientiously applied risk appraisal systems.117 More effective risk perception and improved regulation frequently follows a particular tragic incident. A company involved in such an event should be allowed to argue that despite a grossly negligent act or omission on the part of one or more of its personnel, its safety procedures and practice were all that could be reasonably asked of it at that time. The more demanding standard of feasibility is appropriate to the Health and Safety at Work Act and cognate regulation but not for manslaughter or similar offences such as the proposed corporate killing. Emotive labels and their damaging penal and reputational consequences should not be applied to organisa¬ tions that have conducted themselves reasonably. Thus, it is proposed that companies should be afforded a defence of due diligence for non- regulatory offences that carry a stigma. The onus of establishing due diligence on a balance of probabilities should be placed on the company. It will be familiar with its own procedures and this will ease a forensic burden that, in any event, is likely to be a formidable one for the prosecution where large complex organisations are involved. The Law Commission in formulating its proposal for an offence of corporate killing firmly rejected vicarious liability as a basis of liability for that offence.118 There were two grounds of rejection. First, vicarious liability was perceived to be under-inclusive in that the Commission believes that corporate fault may be established in circumstances where it is not possible to demonstrate that any individual associated with the company manifested the requisite culpability. This dissociation of corporate culpability from human culpability has been rejected in this paper.119 Secondly, the Commission took vicarious liability to be over- inclusive in that a company might be inculpated on the basis of individual wrongdoing for which it bore no just responsibility. This is a genuine concern and has been addressed here by tempering vicarious liability with a defence of due diligence. As we have already seen, the Commission's response was to formulate a liability regime which, if it P. Slovic and B. FisckkofT, "How Safe is Safe Enough" in J. Dowie and P. Lefrere eds., Risk and Chance (Milton Keynes 1980) pp. 121-148. Slovic and FisckkofT report a consistent exaggeration ex post facto of what could have been anticipated in foresight. Not all inquiries display this tendency. In his findings on the Hixton railway crossing disaster, E.B. Gibbens Q.C. declined "to criticise anyone unfavourably for having failed to foresee a danger when many intelligent minds and experienced and talented people have conscientiously considered the same problem before the danger manifested itself, yet failed to appreciate it": Inquiry into the Disaster at Hixton railway crossing (Cmnd. 3706) para. 184. Law Com. No. 237, paras. 7.28-7.31. See above at pp. 532-537.</page><page sequence="31">C.L.J. Attribution of Culpability 545 is to go beyond vicarious liability, as the Commission intends, must employ aggregation.120 In making its proposal, the Commission sought support from the body of civil law concerned with an employer's common law duty to provide a safe system of work for employees.121 This case law draws a distinction between managerial or organisational faults for which the employer is responsible and the casual negligence of an employee which does not entail liability for the employer in respect of any workplace injury. The Commission felt that an offence distinguishing between organisational negligence on the one hand and casual negli¬ gence on the other would be unsuitable for jury trial but hoped that its own formulation would capture this distinction in a form suitable for juries.122 It is submitted that vicarious liability is far closer to the "safe system of work" model than the Commission's own proposal. The duty to provide a safe system of work is a direct responsibility of the employer.123 If discharge of that responsibility is delegated to an employee or agent, the employer remains vicariously liable for any managerial or organisational negligence on the part ofthe delegate.124 A salient feature of this case-law is the willingness ofthe courts to find organisational negligence at all levels in the corporate hierarchy, in the organisation of the specific task related to the injury. By way of example we may take Mcdermid v. Nash Dredging and Reclamation Co. Ltd.]2S where the organisational negligence was found in the defective procedure a tugboat captain had devised for unmooring his tug on the particular occasion in question. This "micro" approach may be contrasted with the Commission's "test-run" of its proposed offence against the facts of the Zeebrugge tragedy as found in the report on the inquiry by Mr. Justice Sheen.126 The Commission insists that liability should not rest on the fault, if there was fault, of the Chief Officer of The Herald of Free Enterprise in devising a practice which involved his leaving the car-deck for the bridge before he could ascertain whether the bow door had been closed but, rather, on "the failure of the company to devise a safe system for the operation of its ferries".127This broad question invites protracted trials and will involve 120 See above at p. 531. 121 Op. cit., paras. 8.10-8.34. 122 The Commission was, of course, using this case law as a guide to corporate liability for any deaths causally related to the company's activities and not merely the work related deaths of its employees. 123 Smith v. Baker and Sons [1891] A.C. 325; Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company Limited v. English [1938] A.C 57. 124 Vicarious liability is the term explicitly used in the case-law, e.g. Speed v. Thomas Swift and Co. Ltd. [1943] K.B. 557; Mcdermids. Nash Dredging and Reclamation Co. Ltd. [1987] A.C. 906. 125 Op. cit. 126 Op. cit. 127 Op. ci7.,at para. 8.50.</page><page sequence="32">546 The Cambridge Law Journal [1996] complicated issues for the jury. What has been proposed in this paper is in one important respect wider even than Mcdermid. It will allow the fault of any employee, such as that, if any, ofthe sleeping assistant- bosun of The Herald, to take a company to the threshold of liability, avoiding questions of organisational/casual negligence. It is significantly narrower than Mcdermid in allowing a company that has delegated a task to an employee found to be at fault in carrying out that task to dissociate itself from that fault by establishing its due diligence in the relevant sphere of corporate activity. Conclusion It has been concluded that corporate guilt can never be real guilt and that any regime of liability which is based on the premise of real corporate guilt is accordingly flawed. In the matter of imposing standards on corporate conduct, a preference has been expressed for regulatory regimes concerned with the attainment of standards rather than with culpability. Because of shortcomings in current regulation, there may be a role for imposing liability on companies for offences involving proof of culpability. On the view of companies taken here, this can only be an exercise in consequentialism and not of retribution. That exercise will be most efficiently conducted by using a standard of vicarious liability and that standard should be tempered in the case of serious offences by a defence of due diligence.</page></plain_text>
