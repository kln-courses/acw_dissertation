<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUSSELL MCCORMMACH On Academic Scientists in Wilhelmian Germany In recent years American scientists have been widely criticized by students, political activists, cultural and social analysts, and fellow scientists. The criticisms are well known. Scientists are accomplices in legal criminality, and uncritical of their patrons?big industry, the military, and government?powers that perpetuate Western imperialism, racism, and economic injustice, and despoil the planet. They abnegate their moral responsibility to make the world better, which it is in their power to do through political action and responsible research. Their rational, quan titative view of the world excludes as nonobjective, and thus nonexistent, all that is spiritual, magic, and poetic, distorting man's consciousness, alienating him from himself, society, and nature, and abetting the antihuman forces of the world. By their overspecialization, they bury us in facts, contributing nothing to our yearning to know the interconnectedness of things. Science should close shop; its vigor is spent, its problems exhausted. Science should declare a moratorium: it is too dangerous; it brings too rapid change for man and his institutions to cope with. Besides, the day of the great discoverer is past; science must turn practical to earn its keep. There is talk of new consciousness, of new culture. Whatever one may think of these judgments and predictions, they express attitudes that are important to some scientists, ,as one can easily see by glancing at editorials and cor respondence columns of Science and at certain presidential addresses of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from the mid-1960's. America has been deeply divided by foreign war and internal inequalities, and American scientists and the American public have questioned the social and political responsiveness of science, as they have of all major institutions. Germany in the Wilhelmian years, from 1888 to 1918, was deeply divided by its powerful, quickening industrialization, and scientists and the public faced similar questions about the place of science in a society in change and conflict. Wilhelmian physical scientists found their work identified with a scientifically intensive technology that underlay much of Wilhelmian industrialization and that nourished a one-sidedly practical view of the world; they found it, too, identified with a one-sidedly rational view of the world that offended a segment of educated Germans who formed an avant-garde of an antimodernist culture imbued with artistic, mystical, and nature worship values. By and large, Wilhelmian scientists steered a middle course. They upheld the values of nonutilitarian research and rational and empirical modes of in quiry; at the same time, they promoted industrial technology in limited contexts, as in the creation of applied scientific disciplines, and they recognized nonseientific components in the collective culture and in the worldview of the individual. There are parallels between Germany at the turn of the century and America 157</page><page sequence="2">158 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH today. For one thing, important links between science, big industry, and government?links that in their modern form have elicited searching criticism in America in recent years?were emerging in Wilhelmian Germany. For another, Wilhelmian complaints about the specialization of science and its materialist and alienating tendencies resemble those that are still very much with us. Yet the historical situation of science is vastly different now from what it was then, and so are the practical questions surrounding it, both those of its practitioners and those of its administrators and public. We cannot look to historical parallels to give us specific answers to our contemporary questions about science. What we can learn from a study of Wilhelmian scientists is something about the functions of the scien tific role in a time of rapid social change. Such a study illuminates an aspect of the situation of American scientists today. I return to this point at the end of the article, where I contrast popular conceptions of the scientific role in Wilhelmian and contemporary American societies. II In late-nineteenth-century Germany, one of the dominant justifications of the role of the academic researcher was that science was one of a number of distinct but interdependent cultural factors, and that its contribution was essential to a har monious intellectual and material culture and to a harmonious worldview for the individual. The cultural justification rested on the self-appointment of Wilhelmian academic scientists to the class of culture-bearers. "Culture-bearer"1 (Kulturtr?ger) was a value-laden term denoting those who were considered well educated and qualified to judge matters affecting the quality of culture. The term was used mostly by humanists, but for the concerns I discuss in this article it is appropriate to extend it to scientists as well.2 The culture-bearer?scientist and humanist alike?was vitally concerned with specialization, unity of knowledge, worldview, creativity, and the institutions that served culture, especially the universities that conferred on him his culture-bearer credentials and supported and transmitted his cultural work. Scientists qua scientists saw as their responsibility the advancement and diffu sion of a certain kind of knowledge that transcended national boundaries.8 They regarded it as right and important to honor all major discoveries and their dis coverers, whatever their national origin, and they expected to be so honored themselves. It was deeply satisfying to many of them to contemplate the universal objectivity of scientific knowledge. It was so to the physicist Max Planck, who spoke of the power of certain scientific results to command agreement from all ex perimenters, all nations, all cultures?even, he was sure, extraterrestrial cultures if there should be any. The price of universal truth was a de-anthropomorphic and abstract scientific world picture with its drab hues and alienating force; the attain ment of universal truth was for one like Planck more than worth the price.4 As culture-bearers, Wilhelmian scientists saw their responsibility as honoring the whole of high culture and advancing its scientific parts. Although Wilhelmian scientists and scholars sometimes thought of themselves primarily as bearers of European, Western, or even world culture, in many contexts they conceived of culture with an explicit German reference. Wilhelmian culture-bearers had prac tical career interests that necessarily referred to the national context, but these did not lie at the emotional core of their self-image. That image derived from national</page><page sequence="3">ON ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS IN WILHELMIAN GERMANY 159 cultural heroes, men who had realized in the highest degree the potentialities of the German mind with its penchant for unity, idealism, and abstraction. Wilhelmian scientists had a dual commitment. As members of a scientific dis cipline, their intellectual being was wedded to the universality of scientific knowledge; the fruits of their work were gifts to all mankind. As culture-bearers, their intellectual motivation derived in the main from a national-cultural idealism; their work was in the first instance a gift to German culture, and only through Ger man culture was it a gift to mankind. Their way of resolving the potential conflict in their academic-scientific role was through ideology. To give an illustration: culture-bearers believed that their work was the raison d?tre of the nation and, since the nation was thought to derive prestige from their cultural attainments, they were, as scientists, able to pursue with easy conscience the pure scientific re search that their scientific role encouraged.6 In this article I examine the ideological responses of Wilhelmian academic scientists?especially physical scientists?to industrialization and to its cultural repercussions. For this purpose, I draw heavily on invited addresses at ceremonial occasions and at scientific meetings. The speakers were eminent scientists who were accepted by the educated public as spokesmen for Wilhelmian science. Usually older than the average scientist, their formative years often fell in the early in dustrial period, during the time of heightened aspirations for political unification. Their ideologies reflected strong continuities with the cultural attitudes of pre unification Germany, and they undoubtedly differed somewhat from those of scien tists just beginning their careers in the period of intensive industrialization. By largely restricting my discussion to the views of scientific spokesmen, I deal with what I take to be dominant ideologies of Wilhelmian academic scientists. There is not space in this article to do justice to the intellectual ferment in Wilhelmian science: I do not take up the difficult problem of determining the attitudes of younger, lesser known scientists; nor do I discuss the League of German Monists, the Keplerbund, the Social Democratic Party, and other organizations with quasi scientific ideologies that on certain points differed from the more dominant ideologies of academic scientists. Ill The condition of culture was an absorbing subject among Wilhelmian intellec tuals, who studied it from every side, even organizing whole disciplines such as cultural history and cultural philosophy around it. For the purposes of this article, Wilhelm Lexis' comprehensive essay on culture is particularly fitting.6 Although he was a humanist, Lexis had strong sympathies with the pure and applied sciences. His essay was the introductory statement in Kultur der Gegenwart; many of the twenty-two volumes that appeared?before the war put an end to the proj ect?were devoted to the individual sciences and included contributions by the leading spokesmen for Wilhelmian science. For Lexis, "culture" meant the "rise of man above the natural state through the development and use of his intellectual and moral forces." He recognized that inherent in his understanding of culture was the threat that eventually a state of "overculture" might arise in which man would live in artificial conditions, wholly estranged from nature. Lexis stressed that although culture was created by individuals, it could not arise outside society and the state. In addition to providing the conditions for</page><page sequence="4">160 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH cultural work the state had to take on cultural tasks, leaving, however, cultural decisions to the educated opinion of the culture-bearers. Unlike social progress, the aim of which was to level inequalities, cultural progress depended on a small elite, and only a minority could fully enjoy its highest achievements. Since culture sprang from the whole of man's complex intellectual nature, it had several in terrelated aspects?practical, scientific, artistic, and ethical. Lexis believed that scientific culture evolved from a prior artistic culture, the earliest expression of the worldview of mankind's leading intellects. In recent times, scientific culture had fed into the practical?the economic and technical?culture, and was itself now dependent on its practical applications. However, in its essence, scientific culture was independent of the applications of science, for it was dedicated to a knowledge of nature, man, and humanity?a knowledge desired for its own sake?and to a worldview based on that knowledge. Like artists, scientists sought immaterial, ideal "cultural goods," deriving self-satisfaction from creative drives; by contrast, the driving force behind practical culture was human need, and its results were material "cultural products." Scientific culture shaped and ennobled the intellec tual life of an educated people, for although few intellects were capable of advan cing scientific knowledge, everyone was affected by it. Lexis explained that since culture arose from different peoples and their dif ferent historical experiences, "cultural goods" bore specific national char acteristics. In different cultural nations and at different times, different aspects of culture were emphasized, resulting in a fruitful international division of cultural labor. This specialization, however, entailed the danger that one aspect of culture might predominate and destroy the harmony of the whole. Lexis warned that measures had to be taken in time to prevent an imbalance of cultural factors from arising. IV German scientists had long placed their scientific ideology in the service of their greatest political cause, the unification of Germany. They regarded their largest, multidisciplinary national organization?the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians?as a model for Germany's future, and one of its sustaining pur poses was that of furthering the unification of the German states. In 1871, at the meeting of the Society following unification, an official proudly recalled that formerly German "national unity" had existed only in its "scientific life," which had refused to allow the "beautiful myth" of unity to be forgotten. His boast that the "conquest of German arms is a conquest of the German mind"7 expressed the culture-bearers' faith that Germany's scientific success contributed to her emergence as a great power. Into the 1880's, the Society might still be reassured that Germany's importance in the world was due primarily to her pure scientific achievements and only to a very minor extent to her material.8 The vision of Ger many as still predominantly a land of thinkers was the nostalgic vision of the traditional culture-bearers, and one that was to be increasingly challenged in the period following unification. The physical chemist Walther Nernst lectured the Berlin Academy in 1905 that whereas Germans used to look to "poetry" and "philosophy," they now looked to "grain fields" and "factories," and that if a</page><page sequence="5">ON ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS IN WILHELMIAN GERMANY 161 scientific institution like the Academy did not adjust to that reality it would lose its influence in the nation.9 The background of Nernst's observation was the recent, impressive scientific and technical development of German industry and agriculture. German industrialism developed rapidly from the time of unification?in creasingly so from about 1890?transforming Germany from an industrially backward power to Europe's leading industrial power. The scientific-technological drive of Wilhelmian Germany is illustrated by the electric industry, which was based almost wholly on recent developments in pure science. The grand commer cial vision of Emil Rathenau, head of the giant combine Allgemeine Elektrizit?tsgesellschaft, was to convert the entire German economy to electricity.10 In the Wilhelmian era, whole German cities were electrified,11 and Germany produced one-third of the world's electrical manufactures.12 Indeed, the great prosperity of Germany from the end of the depression in 1895 to World War I owed much to its electrification.18 It was soon clear that Germany's industrial revolution promised to work at least as great a change in German life and consciousness as the political unification that had made much of it possible. In particular, Germany's industrialization challenged the educated Germans' comfortable assumption that the nation's values were iden tical with their learned and artistic values.14 Many of them publicly deplored the noise, stench, and overpopulation accompanying industrial technology,16 as well as the "nervous haste of our modern world"18 and the whole complex of changes?ur banization, mechanization, and class conflict?engendered by the "soulless" machine age.17 For culture-bearers, however, much more than sensibility was at stake. Emerg ing with industrialism was a new cultural complex, controlled by the wealth of the propertied middle class, managed by a new professional class of engineers, and im bued with the politics of the working class. That the traditional culture-bearers felt a resulting sharp loss of authority in the nation is evident from the gloomy assess ment of their situation by the psychologist Ernst Meumann.18 Like many culture bearers, he responded to the modern world with nostalgic yearning. He liked to believe that until the middle of the nineteenth century, the German princes and public took an avid interest in their great scientists and philosophers. By contrast, in his day the truly talented were obscured by a crowd of scientists with small talents, busy with small problems. The worldview of the public was shaped by scientific popularizers writing for the flood of half-scientific papers and reviews. In the rise of organized interests, scientists, scholars, and artists had been replaced by businessmen, press barons, and politicians, and Meumann concluded that the culture-bearers had all but lost their intellectual influence in the cultural life of the nation. The alleged eclipse and degradation of the public conception of science in the emerging mass culture was not the only, or even the most severe, challenge to the Wilhelmian scientists' cultural place in the industrial age. Because of the widespread belief in the dependence of Germany's economic success on the scien tific basis of industrial technology and because of the encouragement by industry and government of the expanding contacts of the physical sciences with technology, Wilhelmian scientists witnessed the increasing association of their dis</page><page sequence="6">162 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH ciplines with technical and industrial achievement. That association was a source of disturbing ambivalence for them, for they did not regard their national function as economic in the first instance, but intellectual, often priding themselves on their in dependence from productive forces. Their sharp distinction between science and technology, or more generally between theory and practice,19 was rooted in part in their understanding of the condition of their intellectual freedom and creativity and, thus, of their cultural contribution to the nation. At the same time, however, they could welcome, along with the physicist Wilhelm Wien, the understanding that their work created the "firm foundations on which the pillars of our industry stand, which support a great part of our economy."20 That understanding was one of the grounds for their unstinting support of Germany in her rise to great-power status, for they were convinced that an economically and militarily powerful Ger many was a precondition of a science that reflected well both on themselves and on the nation.21 Wilhelmian scientists had no intention of denying that their work had valuable applications, even when they denied that they had direct responsibility for them. What troubled them was the possibility that people had come to see the applications and nothing else. They heard on every hand that "in recent times technology has given the natural sciences so many valuable stimuli that a certain displacement of the scientific center of gravity toward the technical side may hardly fail to be recognized";22 that although scientists still sought basic natural truths, in the selection of their research problems they thought "technologically";28 that although science brought technology into being, technology and not science determined the character of the present age;24 even that technology now deter mined the science of the time rather than the reverse.25 Within the Wilhelmian academic world a movement was launched to reorient academic science toward applications; its premise was that modern industry and the scientific technology that guided it were the dominant forces in contemporary culture.26 That move ment provoked the fear?fed by the frequency with which scientists saw their dis coveries equated with telephones, electric lights, and the steam-powered conquest of space and time?that if technology were admitted into the universities the "trumpet sounds of technical success [would] drown out the soft music of natural laws."27 Wilhelmian scientists were fond of arguing, from the principle of the divi sion of labor, that they benefited technology most efficiently by ignoring it and leaving it to the practical specialists, resting their case on the classic scientific ideology: it was in the "proper advantage of state and society" to support a "free science, free from the proof of direct utility, free of course from signposts and warn ings of forbidden paths, just as it originated in the time of past cultural con ditions."28 V A leading source of cultural discontent in Wilhelmian Germany was the specialization of modern research, a condition that was sometimes associated with the technological division of labor. Scientists shared in the discontent, feeling that excessive specialization produced something less than science; they spoke contemp tuously of "mere facts" and "mere details." It was not that they denied the need</page><page sequence="7">ON ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS IN WILHELMIAN GERMANY 163 for specialization; indeed, they understood that the strong development of specialized disciplines was at the root of German scientific hegemony and that the institutions that housed them were the model for much of the scientific world. Rather, they were concerned that the intellectual significance of science was jeopar dized by research that was more compartmentalized than it need be. Wilhelmian scientists repeatedly reminded one another that they were more than specialists; they were committed to the unity of science and beyond that to the unity of in tellectual culture. To themselves as educated men and to the culture that shaped them and whose guardian and developer they were, they felt a responsibility to op pose the unwanted consequences of specialization. In their general writings and ad dresses delivered to audiences inside and especially outside their own specialties, they often touched on the dangers of specialization. Appropriate occasions for Wilhelmian specialists to address a wide audience were the annual meetings of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians. The meetings evoked expressions of hope and despair from scientists; in principle they united members of all specialties in the entire German cultural spectrum like no other occasion, yet at the same time they exposed, in their specialist sectional organization, the growing fragmentation of modern research. The number of general sessions in the meetings decreased over the century; more important, the number of specialist sections increased, from three at the founding of the society in 1822, through seven in 1828, fifteen in 1871, to thirty-eight at the end of the century. In 1901, the Society reorganized to "counteract the too exten sive splintering of the scientific interests of the meetings which had occurred over the years," reducing slightly, by combining neighboring disciplines, the number of specialist sections to twenty-seven. The President that year interpreted the Society's move as a promising sign that the peak of specialization had passed, that the different scientific specialties were interacting more and were approaching rather than receding from one another.29 The formal restructuring of the specialist sections of the meetings, however, was to provide little lasting comfort. Wilhelmian scientists continued to lament the uncontrolled growth of specialization. Associating narrow specialization with an un healthy growth in what once was living, organically unified learning, they railed against the "measureless unhealthy splintering [of science that] carries within itself the seed of death," and the "excessive detailing [that] leads to the degradation of knowledge to the level of mere bread-and-butter study, to industrial training in stead of true university education, to an abandonment by researchers of the ideal side of thought."80 The President of the Society in 1912 put it succinctly: specialization was the "sickness of our time."81 Wilhelmian scientists repeatedly commended the Society for acting as a counterweight to the specialist scientific societies and congresses that constantly sprang up,32 reaffirming its function of compensating for specialization. They com mended it, too, for its original plan of bringing together in fruitful scientific relations natural scientists and physicians.88 The unity for which German scientists praised their Society, however, was largely symbolic; coming into being only once a year, it could scarcely maintain "living contact between closely related neighboring specialties."84 Having deplored the trend of specialization in their opening ad dresses at the meetings, scientists spent most of their remaining time in the sections</page><page sequence="8">164 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH of their specialties where the serious work was done. Yet the cultural values they expressed in ceremonious rhetoric were an essential element in their scientific com mitment and elicited from them a powerful emotional response. The continuing ex istence of their national society reaffirmed the collective commitment of German scientists to the goal of the unity of knowledge. They spoke with pride of the ac complishments of their specialties, but as scientists imbued with holistic values they expressed recurring discontent with their regime of specialization. VI In reaction to the "social and cultural strains" arising from industrialization, some Wilhelmian intellectuals proclaimed a cultural crisis.86 Political unification had not realized the hopes that had accompanied it; within industrial society, new internal divisions arose, leading some intellectuals to seek a new cultural unity based on antimodernist principles.86 They opposed science and technology together with the whole new industrial "civilization," calling for a return to tradition, organic community, and Germanic "blood."87 Large numbers of Wilhelmian middle-class youth believed that the condition of overculture had arrived with the new industrial urban society. They rebelled culturally, not politically. The youth movement, founded in the 1890s, accented irrationality and instinct; its members embraced a romantic ideal of nature,38 and opposed the "meshes of the mechanized modern life"89 and, in general, the forces of modernity, including, often, science and technology. The impatient, contemptuous attitude toward science of rebellious Wilhelmian youth was reflected in the play Ithaca by the young Expressionist Gottfried Benn.40 The play is set in the laboratory of a professor of pathology, a monster of specialized pedantry. At the close of a course, the professor describes the precise tint of the stained cells from a rat's cerebrum. He knows that his students will un derstand the importance of this point, since a publication has recently appeared from a rival institute contesting his thorough researches on it. He boasts of the "enormous perspectives" he has opened up and which deserve a publication: from this fine staining procedure, one could also differentiate rats with long black fur and dark eyes from those with short rough fur and light eyes, assuming that they are the same age, nourished with candy sugar, have played a half hour a day with a small puma and have all been allowed to evacuate their bowels twice in the evening at a temperature of 37.36?. These perspectives bring man "one step nearer to the knowledge of the great con nections that move the universe." The professor's students and young laboratory assistant are unmoved. For them, the universe that science depicts contains no un ity, faith, feeling, or meaning, but only fragments, numbers, abstractions, words, and the brain; they demand instead myth, the transcendental, ecstasy, and dreams. They reject wholesale what they hold to be the scientific vision of the new man?"Homo faber" in place of the earlier "Homo sapiens"?that has resulted from the last hundred years of science and the technology that grew out of it. Outraged, they murder their professor. In the final speech, a student declares: "We are youth. Our blood cries out for heaven and earth and not for cells and worms." In rising "up in arms against the scientific century" and invoking in its place a "primitive way of life,"41 Benn, through the students and laboratory assistant in his</page><page sequence="9">ON ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS IN WILHELMIAN GERMANY 165 play, expressed the feelings of many Wilhelmian youth. The intellectuals, in turn, felt their criticisms, their rejection of specialized learning,42 their worship of Nietzsche, a presumed enemy of science,48 their longing for metaphysical world views.44 Especially influential in the literature of cultural criticism was Julius Langbehn's Rembrandt als Erzieher; published in 1890, it went through thirty-nine editions within two years.46 Detesting science and celebrating the mystic and irrational, Langbehn rejected the ideal of a balanced culture, proposing in its place a culture that was wholly artistic. He believed that the vocation of science was to "submerge itself in art,"46 and he looked to an age of art to succeed that of science. Science, he said, had to become wholly subjective: false science was objective, deal ing only in facts, whereas true science delivered value judgments.47 For him, the epitome of the odious German science professor was the Berlin physiologist Emil Du Bois-Reymond, whose materialism was only to be expected from one who bore a French name.48 The physicist Paul Volkmann criticized Rembrandt for its "conscious hostility" to science, but soon concluded that the book was not a serious threat.49 Hermann Diels, Secretary of the Berlin Academy, thought that the book may have con tributed to attacks on the Academy, but that by 1902 it was "already forgotten."80 It is no doubt true that Rembrandt was in itself unimportant for science, but its great popularity pointed to a cultural condition that was. Volkmann discounted the exclusively artistic education that Langbehn advocated on the grounds that since artistic talent was as rare as scientific such education would produce a crowd of flighty dabblers,61 but the proposal had no real prospect anyway and only appealed as cultural fantasy. Langbehn played on the widespread anxiety that culture had become one-sidedly scientific and technical and that it had lost its idealistic and creative bearings as a result. Rembrandt was only one of many expressions of Wilhelmian longings for cultural rebirth that involved antimodernist attitudes; others included pan-Germanism, the cults of the peasant life and the Middle Ages, and the revival of Sturm und Drang in the arts. VII Although Wilhelmian scientists were familiar with attacks on what they regarded as their value-free, nonutilitarian research, even on their commitment to a rational, objective view of the world, they felt relatively secure in their scientific role. They tended to attribute the great success of science to the understanding that the first responsibility of the scientist was the unfettered search for natural knowledge. They believed that the exclusion of extra-scientific concerns had in sured steady scientific progress through past times of social turmoil as it would through present ones. American scientific spokesmen talk somewhat less than their Wilhelmian counterparts about unified worldviews and other lofty scientific and cultural ideals, but they too like to emphasize the cultural significance and motivation of their work. For many of them, science is a part of creative "culture,"62 benefiting art and the humanities.68 It belongs to the essential "intellectual infrastructure of society," like politics in Greece and religion in the Middle Ages.64 It is a "way of looking at</page><page sequence="10">166 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH the world,"55 capable of influencing the "concepts of man's place in the order of things."56 American scientific spokesmen talk of the "curiosity" that has motivated the great discoverers,67 of their "deep commitment to knowledge for its own sake,"68 of their response to the "beauty and intellectual austerity" of scientific ideas.59 They associate their motivation with the "traditional" meaning60 and "highest alle giance"61 of science?the search for truth. American, like Wilhelmian, scientists attribute much of the discontent over science to broad cultural forces, only they tend to react more strongly. They see as a principal source of discontent the belief that science has failed as a cultural force for the good. Their spokesmen point to evidence of popular disillusion with scien tific thought. That disillusion applies to the rationality of science,62 to its ideal of quantitative, ethically neutral knowledge,68 to the very possibility of objective knowledge,64 and to the belief in the inexhaustibility of the intellectual challenge of science.66 The critics of science charge that science has not satisfied man intellec tually and emotionally. With its dangerous tendencies, which scientists concede, of "overspecialization"66 and "Balkanization,"67 science has failed to produce the uni fied picture of the world its critics ask of it. Scientists range in their responses to the cultural criticism from those who hold that science has much to learn from its philosophical critics68 to those who hold the more traditional view that scientists should show the public the strongly "unitary nature of science,"69 emphasizing the "connections between its different fields."70 In America today, as in Wilhelmian Germany, scientific spokesmen acknowledge that their work influences society not only through culture but also through technology,71 and that attitudes toward technology, like those toward culture, are a principal source of the criticisms of science.72 In language reminiscent of the Wilhelmian era, they may regret that today many Americans confuse the "high culture" of theoretical science with a technical "popular culture," a mix of applied science, technology, and materialism.78 The contemporary criticism of the link between science and technology differs from Wilhelmian criticism in that it relates above all to the inhumane scientific technology of the war industries74 and to the technological origins of the ecology crisis.76 It relates, too, to certain applications of the new biology,76 as well as to computers, automation, and other recent technological developments whose origins can be traced to advances in the physical sciences. American scientists, like Wilhelmian scientists, respond variously to criticisms of the technological implications of their work. Their responses include affirmations of the traditional view that scientists should be free to work on what they choose and not be compelled by funding policy to work on "relevant" problems.77 They include, too, urgings that scientists redirect their interests to social problems78 and mobilize to attack the critical problems for mankind's sur vival.79 Spokesmen for American science differ from Wilhelmian spokesmen most strikingly in their professions of social concern. They see the increasingly integral part that science plays in society and politics as a basic reason why criticisms of science are more severe today.80 They talk of bringing science and politics closer together,81 of developing a national science policy,82 and of the role of science in helping to forge an ?cologie, economic, and ethical world unity.88 They look on the "asocial" ivory-tower scientist84 as a phenomenon of the past; for having gained</page><page sequence="11">ON ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS IN WILHELMIAN GERMANY 167 large social support, today's scientist has come to recognize the social responsibility that accompanies it.86 Scientists point out that not only does their work have an in fluence on values,88 but that science itself is not a "value-free activity,"87 and that scientists themselves may create values in times of crisis.88 Many accept that science, like other cultural activities, must expect criticism,89 and that scientists themselves should exercise a critical function by pointing to the risks as well as the benefits of their activity.90 They argue that even if scientists are not responsible for the applications of science, they are responsible for making known the implications of their work,91 thereby serving as a "watchdog"92 on applications and helping to avert the disasters that may result from modern technology.98 VIII Although the unprecedented importance of science in World War I assured that science would be implicated in the moral outrage provoked by the war, just as it was in Walter Hasenclever's 1915 drama Der Retter likening modern war to the "child which atavism has begotten upon modern science,"94 the most pressing moral perplexities of the scientific life were still largely in the future. Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer case, the space age, big science, the ecology crisis, and the Viet nam war have shaped our moral, social, and political concerns in ways that contrast with the predominantly cultural concerns of Wilhelmian academic scientists. Today one sometimes hears science referred to as merely a problem-solving "game," a way of speaking that would have been unthinkable to most Wilhelmian scientists and which, I believe, points to a basic difference between then and now. It is not that Wilhelmian scientists did not know the pressures of our professional scientific life; they knew them well?the scramble for place and prestige, the cons tant, often harsh judgments, the overwork. Nor is it that they were less sophisticated about science then we; most of them had already given up the idea that science tells us about a real world beyond the senses. They did not conclude, for these or other reasons, that science had diminished intellectual or moral significance, and both their rhetoric and their actions were directed to substan tiating their faith. The assurance that their work was widely prized as an essential cultural good provided a measure of insulation against hostility toward science, and militated against the scientific skepticism and indirection we sometimes see today. It is the absence, indeed the impossibility, of any comparable assurance today that makes science seem to some of its commentators and practitioners little more than a game, perhaps even a "dirty" game, interesting enough, and reasonably well paid, but without further significance. That is a reason why young scientists may feel anomie, like that of the industrial physicist in The Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry: A Novel, who, having spent his youth in Los Alamos where his father worked on the atomic bomb, quits his own defense job, wondering if "it was ever proper to feel love for science," certain only that he could never feel his father's robust commitment to the scientific life.96 We should not be surprised when we see that some scientists today respond to the moral issues that have attached to the scientific life since the Wilhelmian years by questioning the scientific role and, often, by combining their professional scien tific work with political and social commitments. Such commitments may give</page><page sequence="12">168 RUSSELL MCCORMMACH meaning and direction to their work, serving in that sense much the same function that the commitment to a culture-bearer role within high culture did for Wilhel mian scientists. It would be valuable to study further the social and psychological reasons why some American scientists feel greater vulnerability than their Wilhel mian predecessors.96 Here I will observe only that the scientific role continuously evolves, and that the recent great complexity of the involvement of science in national and international affairs has made a redefinition of the scientific role a matter of utmost urgency for some scientists.

In his analysis of the role of the academic researcher in Germany, Joseph Ben-David, too, calls attention to certain shared values of scientists and humanists (The Scientist's Role in Society [Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 1971], pp. 108-138). In this article, where I write "scientists" I mean "natural scientists." 3. For a perceptive analysis of this and related aspects of German scientific ideology, see Paul Forman, "Scientific Internationalism and the Weimar Physicists: The Ideology and Its Manipulation in Ger many after World War I," Isis, 64 (1973), pp. 151-180. My understanding of Wilhelmian science is heavily indebted to this and other writings by Forman. 4.
