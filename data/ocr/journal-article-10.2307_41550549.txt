<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reframing the Bible: Genesis and Exodus on Toledo Cathedral's Fourteenth-Century Choir Screen* TOM NICKSON University of York Abstract Toledo Cathedral's stone choir screen was carved by lo- cal artists in the late fourteenth century, during a period of heightened anti-Jewish rhetoric and widespread conversion. Its fifty-six large reliefs show stories from Genesis and Exodus, and stand out from contemporary choir screens and sculpted ensembles owing to the inclusion of rarely depicted Apocry- phal legends and the absence of New Testament stories. The extensive narratives of the Creation, the life of Cain, the death of Adam, the plagues in Egypt, and the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt are particularly unusual. The presence of some of these stories can be explained within a specific local devotional and liturgical context, in which the screen served as a back- drop for processions, preaching, and baptismal ceremonies. The unprecedented iconography of Cain biting Abel on the neck betrays an engagement with Hebrew scholarship and should be understood in the light of patristic and polemical texts then found in the cathedral library. Recurrent themes include an em- phasis on stories that were commonly considered types for the division of Jews and Christians. Reliefs showing the Israelites in the desert can be read as a critique of Jewish idolatry, while also articulating ideas about the proper veneration of images in the Christian church. A relief on the west face of Toledo Cathedral's late four- teenth-century choir screen bears an extraordinary image of the first murder (Fig. 1). Following scenes of the Creation and Expulsion, the panel shows Cain slaying his brother Abel by biting him on the neck. This unprecedented image is the most spectacular of a remarkable sequence of fifty-six large reliefs of Genesis and Exodus narratives that decorate the exterior of Toledo's choir screen, a screen that G. E. Street, the nineteenth- century architect and writer, deemed "the most important work of the age in Spain" (Fig. 2).1 Study of the carvings raises fun- damental questions about the relationships between texts and images, images and liturgy, sculpture and manuscripts, and Christian and Jewish polemics. Examining them clarifies our understanding of artistic practice in the medieval West as well as the particular social and artistic conditions of medieval Iberia, a contact zone between Islamic, Jewish, and Christian cultures. Building on the pioneering studies of the screen by Angela Franco, this paper, drawing on recent scholarship on biblical illustration, proposes that the choir screen articulates new attitudes to images and the Bible at a time when Christians and Jews in the Iberian Peninsula were radically redefining GESTA 50/1 © The International Center of Medieval Art 201 1 FIGURE 1.

Since that period of redefini- tion is central to my argument, I will follow a brief description of the screen with an examination of the evidence for its dat- ing, before turning to the reliefs that are the focus of my study. Finally, I will discuss the artists responsible for the screen and the kinds of models they might have employed. Occupying the two easternmost bays of Toledo Cathe- dral's nave, the screen encloses the liturgical choir on all except the eastern side, which faces the high altar east of the crossing (Fig. 3). Two altars were originally set into the screen on each face and still survive; the altar now in the center of the west face occupies what may once have been an entrance tq the choir, blocked probably in the early sixteenth century, when the upper storey was also altered. Each face is divided vertically 71</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 2. Choir screen, west face (photo: author ). FIGURE 3. Toledo Cathedral, plan ( after R. Amador de los Ríos, Monumentos arquitectónicos de España: Toledo [Madrid, 1905], unpaginated). by richly colored marble columns carrying heavily ornamented blind arcades; above them are the reliefs, each covered by a gabled baldachin.2 The fourteen surviving reliefs on the screen's west face show the Genesis story from the Creation to the Rebuke of Cain, and this narrative continues on the south face in twenty- one reliefs, with scenes from the Death of Cain to Joseph with His Brothers in Egypt (Table l).3 Exodus stories fill the north face, from the Plagues in Egypt to the wanderings of 72 the Israelites in the desert. In 1987 Franco published the first detailed study of the screen, in which she emphasized the rar- ity of such an extensive stand-alone Old Testament cycle and the inclusion of many unusual Apocryphal scenes.4 In this and subsequent publications, she proposed various textual sources for the scenes; compared them with cycles at Saint-Savin- sur-Gartempe, Salisbury chapter house, and illustrated Jew- ish Passover manuscripts (especially the Sarajevo Haggadah); discovered compositional analogues in sculpture from across medieval Europe; and suggested that the reliefs complemented the passages from Genesis and Exodus that were read as part of the Easter Vigil liturgy. Although fundamentally sound, Fran- co's observations can be considerably refined and developed through further consideration of attitudes toward the Old Testa- ment in late fourteenth-century Toledo. The Choir Screen and Toledo Cathedral Seat of the peninsula's most powerful archbishops from the eleventh century onward, Toledo occupies a central posi- tion in the geography, history, and politics of medieval Iberia.5 A major Roman city and urbs regia of the Visigothic kings, Toledo was captured after the Islamic invasions of 711 and flourished before its conquest in 1085 by Alfonso VI of Castile. At that moment Toledo's congregational mosque was recon- secrated as the city's cathedral, and in the following centuries Toledo was settled by Christian and Jewish émigrés from both north and south, who played a central role in producing the translations for which Toledo became famous in the twelfth century. For many scholars, Toledo's multiconfessional popu- lation and varied architectural traditions have made it an icon of convivencia , a much-disputed term that in its widest meaning describes the everyday coexistence of different confessional communities.6 Less controversial is the fact that across the peninsula anti-Jewish sentiment and legislation accumulated between the twelfth century and 1492, when all Jews were expelled from Spain. The decades either side of the terrible peninsula- wide pogroms of 1391 were especially significant in that uneven trajectory and coincide with the carving of the cathedral's choir screen - with possible ramifications for its iconography.7 Toledo's Gothic cathedral was begun in the 1220s to replace the converted mosque, and its scale, plan, and design are especially indebted to models in France, Rome, and Cór- doba.8 The choir's position west of the crossing, similar to that at Reims Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, was envisaged in the cathedral's original plan and may betray ambitions to make Toledo the coronation church of Castile.9 Construction pro- gressed roughly from east to west, and the old mosque - from which the screen's colored marble columns may have come - was probably not fully demolished until the early fourteenth century.10 The cathedral was largely completed by 1381, and it fell to Pedro Tenorio (r. 1377-99), one of Toledo's most pow- erful archbishops and a keen patron of the arts, to embellish</page><page sequence="3">TABLE 1.

While there is no documentary evidence to show that Tenorio directly financed the screen's construction, his heraldic lion features prominently on it, as it does on other projects sponsored by him.11 An account book of 1383 from the cathedral works - the only such book to survive in Toledo from this period - also records daily payments of one maravedi to the otherwise unknown Juan de Valencia for working on the doors and stairs of a pulpito.12 In a will made in August 1388, the head chaplain, Alvar López, also left the substantial sum of six thousand maravedies "for works on the pulpito ," which suggests that the screen was financed jointly by the archbishop and the chapter.13 Stylistic comparisons sup- port this evidence, and the screen can be confidently dated to Tenorio' s archiepiscopacy, 1377-99. Typology and Liturgy The concentration of stories from Genesis and Exodus on Toledo's choir screen is without precedent. Although sculpted Old Testament narratives had long occupied an important posi- tion in peninsular art, none is as extensive as the choir screen or bears notable formal similarities with it.14 The lack of New Testament imagery on the screen is especially striking, and whereas the composition of Old Testament narratives elsewhere commonly emphasized their typological significance (.e.g., Isaac carrying wood in the shape of the cross), such devices are rare in this instance.15 This does not, of course, mean that the reliefs cannot be read typologically : given the presence of altars in the screen, the reliefs showing the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Fall of Manna, or Moses Striking the Rock could certainly be interpreted as types of Christ's sacrifice and the Eucharist. Even if not particularly highlighted on the choir screen, typologi- cal readings of Adam, Abel, Isaac, Joseph, and Moses could, moreover, be found in any of the numerous commentaries on Genesis and Exodus in Toledo's capitular library - including the so-called St. Louis Bible.16 This bible moralisée , compiled in Paris about 1226-34, probably entered the Toledan library in the late thirteenth century and was translated into Castilian in the late fourteenth century, presumably by a member of the Toledan chapter.17 Despite this contemporary interest in what was arguably the most comprehensive program of typological imagery in medieval Europe, whoever devised the choir screen emphatically rejected the kind of explicitly typological or Eucharistie themes usually found on northern European choir screens.18 This reflects a fundamental difference in function: while many northern European screens shield the high altar, 73</page><page sequence="4">Toledo's choir screen simply encloses the choir stalls, and the cathedral's high altar is located in a separate presbytery space, east of the crossing.19 We will see later how passages read during the Easter Vigil could enhance the typological resonance of many of the screen's reliefs, but in one sequence, the story of Adam's death and Seth' s return to Paradise, the Christological significance is implicit in the narrative. The story generally forms part of the Legend of the True Cross, which was best known from the widely diffused Legenda aurea (compiled ca. 1260) and its derivatives, of which the first Castilian translations date from the same period that the screen was made.20 The narra- tive unfolds across five reliefs on the choir screen's south face and is framed by the scenes of Cain's death and Noah and the Ark. The central and most striking scene shows Seth return- ing to the Garden of Eden: guided by St. Michael, Seth looks through the gates of Eden, where he sees a tree with a child in its branches and a head in its roots (Fig. 4). This unusual detail, absent from the Legenda aurea , derives from a specific Adamic 74 vita that had developed in northern France by about 1220 and is known as the Post peccatum Adae (PPA).21 Only two copies of Adamic vitae have yet been identified in the peninsula, both PPA, but the incorporation of PPA into the Memorial de Jesu Cristo, written about 1416 by a Toledan convert from Judaism, Juan el Viejo, suggests that it was circulating in Toledo when the choir screen was made.22 According to PPA, the head in the roots represents the soul of Abel, while, according to Juan el Viejo, the child in the tree prefigured both Christ and the Cross.23 In the final relief of Adam's life, located almost directly above an altar, the tree that ultimately will provide the wood of the Cross has grown above Adam's grave, its three different leaves a type for the Trinity (Fig. 5).24 Earlier peninsular versions of the True Cross story do not contain these unusual details from PPA, so why were they included at Toledo?25 Franco suggested that this extended Adamic narrative might be connected with paraliturgical dra- mas of Adam and Eve, but there is little evidence that such dramas were performed in Castile before the fifteenth century.26 FIGURE 4. Toledo Cathedral, choir screen, south face, Seth and the Archangel Michael at the Gate of Paradise (photo: author ). FIGURE 5. Choir screen, south face, the Tree of Life Grows on the Tomb of Adam (photo: author ).</page><page sequence="5">One possible indication of performative practice, however, is that the Escorial version of PPA is bound together with Peter of Poitier's Liber poenitentiali (composed ca. 1210-15), and PPA commonly formed part of penitential rituals.27 A number of near-contemporary German portals with the same Adamic narratives have also been linked to penitential rituals, as have the Adam and Eve sculptures at Autun, Compostela, and else- where.28 However, although Adam's sin was cited in such peni- tential rituals in medieval Castile, it seems that in Toledo and other places these rituals always took place outside the church, and thus cannot be connected too closely with the screen.29 The True Cross legend may, however, be connected with other forms of liturgical celebration. In other churches in the peninsula and beyond, the story was closely associated with relics of the True Cross.30 Toledo was no exception: devotion to the Cross was strong there even before a relic was acquired from Louis IX of France in 1248. 31 By the 1330s this relic had been installed in a cross that was borne in processional ceremo- nies in the cathedral on Sundays and feast days, and no fewer than four feast days were dedicated to the Cross before 1356, when these were reduced to one, the Triumph of the Cross.32 Evidence from elsewhere suggests that the story of the True Cross was read on such feast days, and although no manuscript of PPA has been discovered in the cathedral library, fifteenth- century annotations to Toledan copies of the Legenda aurea clearly indicate that they were used for sermons.33 Although there is no definitive evidence that the screen's True Cross nar- ratives were in any way implicated in these readings or proces- sions, the prominent insertion of these episodes in the screen's Genesis narrative reinforces devotion to the Cross by empha- sizing its salvific role in biblical history. The Division of Peoples The Adamic narratives on Toledo's choir screen are symp- tomatic of a propensity to expand particular biblical narra- tives.34 Other unusually extensive narratives include the plagues in Egypt and the Exodus of the Israelites, the story of Cain, and the Creation sequence, but not - as was common in other cycles - the story of Joseph.35 It is precisely in these departures from the norm that it is possible to discern the screen's dis- tinctive qualities. Examination of the dramatic relief of Abel's murder, for instance, helps to clarify aspects of the screen's conception. As I have tried to show elsewhere, the iconography of Cain biting Abel has no precedent in European medieval art but was most likely invented in response to Jewish expansions of the Genesis narrative.36 These were increasingly familiar in Christian circles, because since the twelfth century, Christian scholars in the peninsula and elsewhere had borrowed exten- sively from Hebrew scholarship to enrich their understanding of scripture's "literal" sense and to bolster their own arguments in staged disputes and polemical texts.37 The most famous of these scholars was the French theologian Nicholas of Lyra (ca. 1270-1349), who in the early fourteenth century drew on the scholarship of Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki (1040-1105, known as Rashi) to write his postils on the Bible (1322-31), a work that subsequently enjoyed immense popularity in Castile.38 Nicho- las' postils were familiar to Toledan scholars even before his death, and in 1383 Archbishop Tenorio donated a lavish three- volume edition of the postils to Toledo's capitular library (it had to be specially bought in Paris), together with Peter the Chanter's Summa Abel (ca. 1 191-97) and commentaries on the Pentateuch by Stephen Langton (d. 1228). 39 Although Nicolas' postils do not refer to Cain biting Abel, Tenorio' s acquisition of them and his possession of numerous biblical commentaries indicate an interest in detailed Old Tes- tament narratives at the time the screen was made.40 Hebrew expansions were readily available in Toledo, long-renowned as one of the most important centers of Hebrew scholarship and translation of the Old Testament in the peninsula.41 More- over, Hebrew texts were particularly accessible when the screen was carved, since many were confiscated in the turbulent final decades of the fourteenth century; an unknown number of Tole- dan Jews also converted in this period, including Tenorio' s own physician, Rabbi Haym.42 Since the twelfth century, converted Jews (conversos) had played an especially prominent role in deploying Hebrew scholarship to Christian ends, and it is quite possible that a converso could have advised Tenorio or whoever devised the iconography of the screen.43 There is, in fact, one famous and well-documented local instance in which a rabbi advised on the content of a Christian Bible and its illustrations. The so-called Alba Bible was com- missioned in 1422 by a Toledan nobleman, Don Luis González de Guzmán, and preserves in its preface the correspondence between Don Luis, Rabbi Moses Arragel, and Brother Arias de Encinas, superior of the Franciscan monastery in Toledo.44 According to these letters, Don Luis requested from Moses a Castilian translation of the Bible and a commentary that would surpass that of Nicholas of Lyra. At the same time, Brother Arias assuaged Rabbi Moses' anxieties about images by assur- ing him that illustrations could be added by local painters after the text was completed, based on "the Bible from the sacristy of the cathedral, which is very well historiated."45 Although the Alba Bible reveals no clear debts to the St. Louis Bible, to which this passage is often thought to refer, the exchange none- theless implies that Toledan artists were accustomed to consult- ing older models as inspiration for unfamiliar iconographies.46 Indeed, in one unique instance, an illustration in the AlbaBible is directly indebted to Toledo's choir screen, and it is none other than Abel's murder on fol. 29v (Fig. 6).47 The accompanying text makes no reference to this unusual iconography, but there can be little doubt that it either derives from the choir screen or shares with it a common source.48 If the text of the Alba Bible does little to clarify the ico- nography of the choir screen, the Bible nonetheless provides a local, well-documented, and near-contemporary case of Judeo-Christian collaboration in a major project of biblical illustration, one that deploys Hebrew scholarship to expand the 75</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 6. The Alba Bible, Madrid, Palacio de Liria, fol. 29v, Cain and Abel (photo: from the limited-edition facsimile of the Alba Bible, www.facsimile -editions, com! en! ab). commentaries of Nicholas of Lyra, raises questions about the propriety of religious images, and borrows from a wide range of artistic sources.49 If this provides a possible model for the genesis of Toledo's choir screen, then it also raises questions about why particular iconographies were chosen. In the story of Cain and Abel, for instance, the emphasis lies not on the broth- ers' sacrifice as a type for the Eucharist, as was usual elsewhere, but on Cain's horrific crime - commonly understood as a type for the murder of Christ.50 By this logic, Cain's bestial and can- nibalistic attack on Abel, which resonates with contemporary Christian portrayals of Jews, underscores Cain's status as the prototypical wandering Jew.51 Such interpretations belong to a tradition of tracing the division of religious peoples in the Old Testament: popularized by such early fathers as SS. Augus- tine, Isidore, and Caesarius of Aries, it features prominently in works by Stephen Langton that were owned by Tenorio and was revisited in the first part of Alfonso de Cartagena' s mid- fifteenth-century defense of conversos, Defensorium unitatis Christiane.52 Not just Cain and Abel, but the Good and Bad Angels, Ham and his brothers, Jacob and Esau, Joseph and his brothers, the Israelites and the Egyptians, the Levites and those 76 who worshiped the Golden Calf - all anticipated the division of religious peoples, according to these commentators, and all are rendered with particular prominence on the choir screen.53 Nor were such interpretations confined to dusty librar- ies. As with stories of the True Cross, they are often found in sermons.54 The sermons of St. Caesarius of Aries (d. 542), for instance, were kept in Toledo Cathedral's sacristy from the thirteenth century, presumably because they were regularly . used.55 Although peninsular choir screens were rarely used as preaching platforms, an eyewitness account from 141 1 proves ž that sermons were sometimes delivered before the choir screen. During his visit to Toledo Cathedral, the renowned Doñiinican preacher Vincent Ferrer climbed into a throne or pulpit which the Church had had made inside the church, which was so high that it drew level with the figure of God the Father, which is above the Virgin Mary, which is in front of the great font [baçin] which is in the middle of the church. And he said a sung mass and preached very solemnly and with great devotion.56 A variety of sources confirm that there was a statue of the Vir- gin and some sort of font in front of Toledo's choir screen, and from here Ferrer must have addressed his large audience.57 At the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, Archbishop Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada had purportedly directed his audience to the paintings in the Lateran basilica when arguing for Toledo's primacy: Might preachers in Toledo Cathedral have occasion- ally used the choir screen for similar illustrative effect?58 On this occasion Ferrer's sermon was less inflammatory than many others, but there is nonetheless some overlap between the con- tent of Ferrer's subsequent Toledan sermons (e.g., on the Ten Commandments) and the stories shown on the choir screen.59 These overlaps do not imply contingency between screen and sermons but, rather, that shared themes invigorated the choir screen with expository potential. Baptism If sermons sometimes provided a kind of metatext for the choir screen reliefs, then so too could the cathedral's regu- lar liturgy. We have already seen how the reliefs showing the True Cross legend might have been glossed by readings on spe- cial feast days, and Franco has demonstrated that many of the screen's Old Testament subjects correspond with the lessons read at the Easter Vigil and are common types for baptism.60 Although reformed in the late fifteenth century, Toledo's Easter Vigil ceremony is recorded in an early fourteenth-century cer- emonial and a book of capitular acts from 1435.61 These relate how on the night of Easter Saturday a silent procession circum- navigated the darkened church, led only by the Paschal candle. At unspecified points in the church the procession stopped for twelve readings from the Old Testament, the first four of which</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 7. Toledo Cathedral, choir screen, north face, Crossing of the Red Sea (photo: author ). included stories found on the screen: the Creation, the Flood, the Sacrifice of Isaac, and the Crossing of the Red Sea (Fig. 7). The ninth reading told the Passover story, and after the twelfth reading the procession advanced to the font, where the Agnus Dei was chanted before the cathedral was dramatically relit.62 It is worth pausing here to consider the precise location of these readings, because although most processions in the cathedral passed through its outer aisles - at some distance from the choir screen - it is unlikely that Toledo's great Easter Vigil proces- sions ended in a small side chapel: they probably concluded at the font located directly in front of the choir screen.63 At times, therefore, the Paschal candle must have illuminated narratives on the choir screen while corresponding Old Testament pas- sages were read in the darkened church. The procession's climax at the font also relates to the tra- dition of Easter baptisms in Visigothic Spain and medieval Italy.64 Although there is no direct evidence for Easter baptisms in fourteenth-century Toledo, accounts of its Easter Vigil make clear that associations with baptism were nonetheless preserved in the liturgy, even after major reforms in the fifteenth cen- tury.65 This is significant, for while baptism, of course, began the sacramental life of every Christian, in fourteenth-century Castile it also had more dramatic connotations with conversion, especially of Jews. It is, indeed, as part of a discourse of conver- sion that the unusually extensive Exodus narratives on the choir screen's north face are best understood. In the already men- tioned anthology of sermons kept in Toledo Cathedral's sac- risty, for instance, St. Caesarius of Aries argued that the plagues in Egypt represented a kind of conversion experience and were remedies against false learning and philosophers.66 But it is St. Augustine who offered the most influential interpretation of the plagues in a commentary on Psalm 78 (77) in his Enarratio- nes in psalmos , written between 392 and 418.67 St. Augustine read this paraphrase of Exodus as an extended metaphor, writ- ten, "not as if addressed to Jews, but rather as if, addressed to ourselves": God had sent the plagues to liberate the Jews from Egypt but had received in return only ingratitude and idolatry.68 The Jews' only hope of salvation was baptism and conver- sion to Christianity, prefigured by their crossing of the Red Sea: "And our enemies the sea hath covered, He hath effaced them in baptism by the remission of sins."69 St. Augustine's arguments were rehearsed in texts on baptism and conversion by SS. Isidore and Ildefonso, in Peter the Chanter's Summa Abel , and in Nicholas of Lyra's postils.70 All these texts, includ- ing Augustine's, could be found in Toledo's capitular library and were still read in the late fourteenth century.71 Augustine's commentaries also attracted the interest of those concerned with conversos. In the 1460s the prominent converso apologist Juan de Torquemada - onetime prior of San Pedro Mártir in Toledo - was still citing Augustine in his own commentary on the Psalms, while in a sermon delivered in February 1412, Fer- rer himself appealed directly to prospective converts:72 "There- fore, Jews, this is what you have to do. That you enter into the Red Sea, which is holy baptism, which is open and drawn with the rod of the holy cross, and [once] baptised, you will be saved, and all your enemies will be drowned."73 What does the choir screen have to do with conversion? Detailed archival records from Aragon reveal a steady trickle of Jewish conversions in the decades before and after the mas- sacres of 1391 as a consequence of escalating anti- Jewish vio- lence and polemic.74 Although such comprehensive records do not survive in Toledo, it is likely that there was a similar pattern of conversions in the late fourteenth century.75 Ferrer alone was said to have converted more than fifteen thousand Jews, includ- ing Benedict XIII's personal physician, Jerónimo de Santa Fe.76 Yet despite the fame of conversos such as Jerónimo or his one- time tutor, Pablo de Santa Maria, and notwithstanding copious legislation on the circumstances under which baptism could take place, little is known about conversion ceremonies.77 Many conversions were probably spontaneous events, performed under pressure in the streets, but depictions of conversion bap- tisms in the manuscripts of the Cantigas de Santa Maria (ca. 1272-84) suggest that they could also be elaborate ceremo- nies, and across Europe monarchs regularly acted as godparents to prominent converts.78 As already mentioned, Archbishop Tenorio' s personal physician, Rabbi Haym, had converted in the 1390s and taken the name Pedro, which strongly hints that Tenorio may have acted as godfather to him.79 It seems highly likely, therefore, that prestigious converts such as Haym would 77</page><page sequence="8">have been baptized in the cathedral, with the choir screen reliefs acting as a fitting gloss and backdrop to the ceremonies. Such associations are seductive but need not be reductive. As demonstrated by the discussion above, correspondences between the choir screen reliefs and the rituals and ceremonies performed before them are by no means neat or programmatic. Just one event in the liturgical calendar could not exclusively determine the imagery of so prominent a feature of the cathe- dral interior; flexibility and adaptability were more desirable than rigid conformity. Indeed, on nonfestal days, regular read- ings and chants were not performed before the screen but hid- den behind and within it, rendering any fortuitous connections with the reliefs all the more mysterious and resonant. The Converso Viewer In his Apologia of 1416, the converso Juan el Viejo de Toledo argued that baptism could wash away the sins of idola- try.80 The idea is found also in St. Augustine, and anxieties concerning Jewish attitudes toward images feature regularly in exchanges between Iberia's confessional communities in the Middle Ages.81 As elsewhere in Europe, most of the evidence for these exchanges survives in texts from Christian sources that focus simultaneously on Jewish hostility to Christian images and a perceived propensity to idolatry - the latter premised on the biblical account of the worship of the Golden Calf.82 A number of peninsular texts and images attest to such concerns in the thirteenth century, and these multiply in number after the mid-fourteenth century.83 In the retributive decades after 1391 Jewish accusations of idolatry were directed at the producers and consumers of the richly illuminated Haggadot, for example, and we have already encountered Rabbi Moses' disquiet about images in the prologue to the Alba Bible.84 Juan el Viejo com- mended conversos for rejecting their idolatrous habits, but, in contrast, as the fifteenth century progressed, fears of converso crypto-Judaism grew among those who identified themselves as "old" Christians, and with it, anxieties about their attitudes to images and lack of Christian catechesis.85 By the time of the anticonverso riots of 1449, accusations of idolatry were one of three major complaints directed at conversos.86 Only recently have art historians begun to consider the significance of these mass conversions for image theory in late medieval Castile, but close examination of the screen reveals a subtle articulation of ideas concerning images and idola- try - ideas that in many respects belong to a supratextual dis- course conducted through the images themselves.87 At other times and in other places anthropomorphic images of God, for example, might be conventional, but in late fourteenth-century Toledo they were charged with polemical intent. The scrupu- lous avoidance of anthropomorphic representations of God in fourteenth-century Jewish Haggadot contrasts emphatically with the screen's insistently corporeal figures of God and with the figures of God that were added to the Alba Bible as part of the revisions undertaken when it was completed in the early 78 1430s.88 It is also possible that the sheer scale and quantity of imagery on the choir screen were intended as an endorsement of the use of images in the Christian Church, just as the painted representations of articles of the Creed in Tenorio' s funerary chapel, painted in the 1390s, assert the archbishop's own ortho- doxy.89 In both cases images are implicitly defended by their didactic potential.90 Only in the 1470s and 1480s would the conspicuous display of Christian images be explicitly cited as an index of Christian orthodoxy, but we have already seen that images had long been central to Jewish-Christian polemic.91 There is no reason to assume that images always followed texts rather than vice versa, especially when articulating ideas about images themselves, and the screen can be understood as a kind of supratextual, self-reflexive performance in itself.92 Apprehensions about idolatry nonetheless surface along- side this robust defense of images. On the screen's south face a relief between the Drunkeness of Noah and Abraham with the Three Angels shows two figures in conversation before three small images on a platform, with fallen figures at their feet (Fig. 8). Believing it to be misplaced, Franco identified this story as Jacob's destruction of the idols (Genesis 35:1-8), but it can more logically be read as an episode from Abraham's life, when his father, Terach, discovers the idols that Abra- ham has destroyed.93 Although absent from traditional Old Testament narratives and rarely depicted, this story is found in Alfonso X's General estoria (ca. 1270s), where it is followed by a chapter on the perils of idolatry.94 It was also illustrated in a few late fourteenth-century Jewish, Muslim, and Chris- tian manuscripts as evidence of Abraham's condemnation of idolatrous religions; here its insertion anticipates Christianity's triumphant rejection of Jewish idolatry.95 The hazards of employing figurai sculpture to critique idolatry cannot have been lost on the devisers of the screen, and it is in the treatment of the Exodus narrative on the north face of Toledo's choir screen that the most subtle articulation of contemporary image theories can be discerned.96 In a sequence of six episodes from Exodus 32-40 (largely recapitulated in Psalm 78 [77]), the narrative charts a movement from idolatry to righteous veneration, from violent discord to social harmony. Following a relief showing the creation of the Golden Calf, we see it consumed by fire, and simultaneously Moses' destruc- tion of the first tablets of the law (Exodus 32:3-19; Fig. 9). Next, the calf is ground down to powder, mixed with water, and drunk (Exodus 32:20); the idolaters are massacred by the sons of Levi (Exodus 32:27); and Moses is shown bringing the tablets of the law for the second time (Exodus 35:1; Fig. 10). In the last relief of the screen, the Israelites are shown kneeling before the Wilderness Tabernacle, where the tablets of the law are displayed (Exodus 40; Fig. 11). Close attention to the three representations of the tab- lets of the law helps to clarify how this sequence was con- ceived. Whereas the first set of tablets of the law is shown with a rounded edge (Fig. 9), the new set more closely resembles a codex, on which the Israelites place their hands as though</page><page sequence="9">79 FIGURE 8.

This motif has a long and complex history in Jewish and Christian art and was variously used to symbolize the tablets of the law (and, by extension, the Jewish faith), the universe, and the Tabernacle.99 Here, the tablets resemble a diptych placed on an altar, a resonance made emphatic by the contemporary bourgeois dress of those kneel- ing before it - the only instance of such dress on the whole screen.100 As in early Spanish texts and Bible illustrations, the Wilderness Tabernacle is thus presented as a type for the Chris- tian Church: led by Aaron and Moses and rid of their idolatrous brethren, those kneeling before the altar endorse the veneration of images that was proper to orthodox Christians.101 Reread from the perspective of fourteenth-century Toledo, familiar biblical stories became newly resonant, providing models and aspirations for the Spanish Church as it struggled to accom- modate an influx of uncatechised converts. Making the Screen The sophisticated imagery of Toledo's choir screen was surely devised by a member of the cathedral chapter or a local converso, but what of its makers? The building accounts of 1383 indicate that Juan de Valencia's daily rate was a pitiful one maravedi (compared with five maravedies for other work- ers), so he cannot have been the master responsible for the • screen.102 This was most likely a member of the Alfonso fam- ily, which had provided Toledo's master masons since at least 1355. 103 The screen's rich decorative vocabulary - notably, harpie corbels, green men, lavish fioriate ornament, complex base moldings, tiers of blind paired lancets, and tracery in the form of old-fashioned telephone dials - is found in other proj- ects linked to the Alfonso family (Fig. 12). These include the central portal of the west facade of the cathedral (after 1337); the wall tombs of the San Ildefonso chapel, complete by 1372; and the Santa Caterina portal and entrance portal to Tenorio' s funerary chapel, largely constructed between 1388 and 1399.104 The figure carving in these projects closely matches the reliefs on the choir screen's west and southern faces: hair is care- fully delineated and often tucked behind ears or parted; faces are swollen, with small, pointed features attached; and drap- ery hangs in ornate but relatively naturalistic folds (Fig. 13). Despite their Toledan roots, however, members of the Alfonso family were clearly aware of other schools of sculpture, par- ticularly in Lérida, Barcelona, and Girona.105 Juan de Valencia's toponym draws attention to further similarities with the north transept portal of Valencia Cathedral (complete by 1354), and 80 FIGURE 12. Choir screen, detail of north face (photo: author ). there are also close stylistic affinities with corbel sculptures in the Santa Caterina Chapel in Burgos (after 1316). 106 The clumsy setting of many of the screen's reliefs and dec- oration indicates an assemblage of parts carved off-site, and a number of workshops may have collaborated on this large proj- ect. The reliefs on the north face are generally cruder and flatter than those on the south and west faces, with more figures and shorter beards, while a third group can also be distinguished in ten reliefs now in the cloister, where scenes from Christ's infancy are crammed under gabled baldachins (Fig. 14). 107 Too narrow ever to have been intended for the choir screen, these ten New Testament reliefs originally formed part of the internal screen of a royal chapel situated in the cathedral's northwest corner and can be dated from heraldic evidence between 1390 and 141 8. 108 Although situated too far from the choir screen to be understood as part of its iconographie program, the New Testament reliefs are sufficiently similar to those of the choir screen to suggest that some of the latter may have been carved</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 13.

It is virtually impossible to identify specific formal sources for Old Testament scenes that were common sculp- tural subjects, such as the Creation of Adam or the Sacrifice of Isaac: no single Old Testament cycle is particularly close to Toledo's choir screen, but its carvers could have taken inspira- tion from innumerable models for such subjects. Departures from the norm are more telling. For example, representations of the plagues are extremely rare in medieval sculpture, and there is no obvious sculptural tradition on which the screen's carvers could draw. The plagues are, however, quite often seen in wall paintings - notably those of Old St. Peter's in Rome and its copies - and in manuscripts, including a number of early Castilian Bibles, Byzantine Psalters, the St. Louis Bible, and several fourteenth-century Haggadot from Catalonia- Aragön.109 In almost all these examples, Moses and Pharaoh stand facing each other, so it is unlikely that they provided models for the Toledan reliefs, where Pharaoh sits centrally enthroned (Fig. 15). The closest match is found in fols. 8 and 8v of the so-called Morgan Picture Bible (MPB), illustrated in Paris in the 1240s or 1250s (Fig. 16). 110 Fol. 1 of MPB also provides the closest analogue for Toledo's relief of the Fall of the Rebel Angels, another story that is rarely found in medi- eval sculpture (Figs. 17 and 18).111 Once again, representations of this story in other manuscripts - including the St. Louis Bible and peninsular copies of the Breviari d'Amor - do not in any way resemble the Toledan relief, whereas MPB shares both Toledo's centralized composition and its tripartite archi- tectural canopy.112 Although it had been taken to Italy by the early fourteenth century and continued to attract interest there, there is no evi- dence that MPB ever reached the Iberian Peninsula, so how can these similarities be explained?113 One possibility is that the screen and MPB share a common model, possibly one of the early Castilian Bibles that have sometimes been connected with MPB, such as the Codex Toletanus of 998.114 Surviving examples of these early Bibles do illustrate some of the unusual scenes found on the choir screen, yet none offers compositional analogues as close as MPB.115 Alternatively, the carvers of the screen might have seen MPB and recalled it from memory or else had access to some sort of motif book derived from it: various paths of transmission were open between Toledo and thirteenth-century Paris or fourteenth-century Italy, and this is how Katrin Kogman- Appel has explained similarities between illustrated peninsular Haggadot and MPB.116 Yet it would be very unusual for a medieval sculptor to use manuscript models to inform his design; instead, these might simply be indepen- dent artistic solutions to the challenges of illustrating the same text.117 It is striking, however, that the reliefs of more common subjects on the screen (e.g., the Creation) do not resemble the same scenes in MPB, as though manuscript sources were used only as a last resort when more obvious sculpted models were otherwise lacking. The Genesis and Exodus narratives of the now-destroyed wall paintings of Old St. Peter's in Rome from the fourth or fifth century may represent a different kind of inspiration. Here, the narratives depart from the Exodus account in showing only seven rather than ten plagues, the plague of hail in two phases, and angels as bringers of death to the firstborn.118 As Herbert Kessler has shown, these deviations are consistent with the paraphrase of Exodus in Psalm 78 (77), analyzed by St. Augus- tine: Is it coincidental that the same deviations are also found on Toledo's choir screen?119 Some sort of influence on the choir screen is not inconceivable, for the wall paintings of Old St. Peter's - which must have been known to Tenorio from his time in Rome in the 1360s - certainly provided a model for Italian church decoration throughout the Middle Ages and have been linked to a large number of illuminated manuscripts.120 Kessler has also argued that verbal or written descriptions of monumental cycles circulated widely in the Middle Ages, and although there is no specific evidence of this in Castile, a mem- ber of Toledo's chapter annotated a local chronicle in the early fourteenth century with partial details of the dimensions and inscriptions of Old St. Peter's.121 The Toledan reliefs could thus be understood as a reimagining of those wall paintings from partial oral or written descriptions - methods of transmission that would account for iconographie similarities but formal differences between the two cycles. However indirect Toledo's debt to Old St. Peter's, the wall paintings there endorsed the idea that extended Old Testament narratives could belong to a discourse of baptism and conversion - one as relevant in four- teenth-century Toledo as it had been in fourth-century Rome. Conclusion Toledo Cathedral's choir screen is not some petrified deposit of a specific idea and moment but, rather, a testament to strategies of polemic and display that had evolved since the twelfth century and earlier. Its concentration of Old Testa- ment imagery reflects a strand of biblical interpretation that flourished in fourteenth-century Castile, but the reliefs were undoubtedly not recognizable to all, nor do they illustrate a specific text.122 This makes them, however, no less effective. In the relief of Abel's murder we see art's capacity to render violent, visceral drama, while anthropomorphic representations of God or images of iconoclasm contribute to a discourse of images in the very language of representation. The screen could be glossed by texts that were read or sung before or behind it; its narratives could be read linearly or in parts; and its meanings could be amplified by processions, performances, and objects carried or worn within the church.123 But with a syntax and vocabulary that are particular to monumental sculpture, the screen articulates ideas about the Bible and Judeo-Christian relationships that are at least as sophisticated as any contempo- rary text or sermon. As in so many aspects of medieval society, encounters with Jewish thought and life engendered anxieties, the consequences of which were entirely disproportionate to the 83</page><page sequence="14">size of Jewish communities in Toledo and beyond.124 It should be emphasized, however, that although evidence from Toledo and elsewhere suggests that Jews and Muslims did sometimes enter church spaces, it was Toledo's majority population of "old" Christians who would have been most familiar with the screen, just as they constituted the majority of Vincent Ferrer's audiences.125 And while the monumental internal screens that proliferate in later peninsular churches betray their imitation of the primatial cathedral's liturgical configuration, Toledo's extensive Old Testament narratives were never again attempted in stone: they were too expensive, too subtle and complex, too vulnerable to misinterpretation. 126 On the great choir screens of Renaissance Spain, Gospel narratives dominate: Old Testament scenes vanish, and the prophets stand mute.

Some reliefs (possibly up to six) at the center of the west face were replaced in the 1570s by reliefs of God the Father flanked by Innocence and Guilt: S. R. Parro, Toledo en la mano, 2 vols. (Toledo, 1857), 1:209. Any reconstructions would be purely speculative, but see H. M. von Erffa, Ikonologie der Genesis, 2 vols. (Munich, 1989-95), 1:88-239, for pos- sible subjects. 35. The rarity of these stories and the exclusion of other common Genesis narratives (e.g., of Joseph) discredit the possibility that these are included simply as filler, though see discussion in A. A. Jordan, Visualizing King- ship in the Windows of the Sainte-Chapelle (Turnhout, 2002), 9-10. For Joseph, see Erffa, Ikonologie, 2:389-474. 36. See D. C. Matt, ed., The Zohar, 5 vols.

In fact, the Alba Bible's illustrations betray a detailed knowl- edge of midrashic scholarship and Jewish ritual, suggesting that Rabbi Moses did play a role in determining their content: C. O.

The closest com- parisons are with the figure of Charlemagne from Girona Cathedral (mid- fourteenth century); works produced in the mid-fourteenth century by the Lérida school; or the tombs connected with Elisenda de Monteada (d. 1364) in the monastery of Pedralbes, Barcelona.

On the south face, the two reliefs of Joseph also belong to this second group. 108. Toledan winters are exceptionally cold, so the pierced screen below the New Testament reliefs cannot originally have divided the chapel from the cloister (it is now blocked by a wall behind). The chapel was dismantled in 1534. See D.

Of a total population of about 25,000 in late thirteenth-century Toledo, there may have been about 350 Jewish families: R.
