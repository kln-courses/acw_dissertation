<plain_text><page sequence="1">COSMIC PURPOSE PROFESSOR J. W. HARVEY THE phrase " Cosmic Purpose" and others akin to it are familiar enough, particularly in the literature of edification. It is the aim of this article to examine the idea the words convey rather more closely than we do in our common use of them; to deflate the expression, so to speak, of those gaseous suggestions of "uplift" which too often hang about it. The question involved is, of course, in what sense, if in any, purpose may be attributed to the Cosmos, to the universe in its totality. And we have to ask, in case the term so used should turn out to be really misused, Is it a sheer error that dissolves away under criticism, or is there some valid core of meaning which may be restated in other terms? If these are well-worn questions, yet the problem is too fundamental for them ever to be altogether trite. I It may be best to begin, in Aristotelian fashion, with a summary of certain typical opinions on the matter, those of intelligent but not specially "philosophical" persons. Four such typical standpoints may be considered. They differ markedly from one another, but all have certain points in common, and these I note first. Every common-sense view about purpose and its place in reality takes for granted, I think, the reality of temporal process. If "purpose" is denied to the Cosmos, it is not because the realization of purposes "takes time." Suggestions that time is "unreal" belong to a phase of thought more metaphysical (or more sophisticated) than that which I am at the moment considering. Again, I do not think that there would be, at this level, any dispute as to the meaning of "purpose." For a process or a course of events to manifest purpose it would be admitted that there must be a Mind or Spirit capable of looking before and after, and shaping the course of events in order to bring about a future result. An envisaged "ideal" "not-yet" must both have determined and given value to the experienced actual "now," if "purpose" as common sense understands the term is to be admitted. "Blind" purpose, such as instinctive behaviour has been held to exhibit (though this is never wholly "blind"), and such as has been detected by some thinkers in plant life, is, from the standpoint from which I am starting, purpose in a very Pickwickian sense indeed; and with this I am not at present concerned. 295</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY Our diverse typical views agree, then, in taking time as real and in the meaning they assign to the notion of purpose. Otherwise they differ. I will call them the views of Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson. Smith's position is that of unreflective Christian ortho- doxy. "Cosmic" purpose means the supreme overruling purpose of God or "providence," to which all the happenings in nature conform. Its relation to the finite and fragmentary purposes of men is not probably thought out very clearly; but Smith does not doubt that it is a harmonious relation. The best human purposes adumbrate or indicate, however imperfectly, the general nature of the divine purpose. We can at any rate be confident of the direction, though we cannot define the goal. The realization of a completely har- monious social or ultra-social order would probably be the nearest Smith could come to specifying the nature of this end or goal; but he prefers to put it in religious terms as "the realization of the Kingdom of God." He is perhaps content to accept the language of poetry and speak of "a far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves." What he is mainly concerned to maintain is that this divine purpose which the "whole creation" is engaged in realizing is not indifferent to, but corroborative of, man's highest and most earnest endeavours and aspirations. The world is not only through and through teleological, but the "telos" is one which man can in some measure already make his own, and which had he better understanding he could acknowledge to be the end and aim of his truest being. Brown is a man of a more agnostic temper. He does not deny that the universe may be fundamentally teleological, or even that the "cosmic" purpose may be called in a sense "divine." But if so, it is the purpose of a deus ignotus, a deus absconditus, and we can in nowise equate or even compare it with any purpose of man. Brown feels, in fact, drawn to emphasize the incommensurableness of cosmic and human teleology. Ends may be-are being-furthered by the universe, but they are not our ends, to which the cosmic process is supremely indifferent, though not, of course (as a sort of inverted anthropomorphism would have it), actively hostile. If he speaks in religious phrase, it will be in the words of the Psalmist: "For my ways are not as your ways, neither are my thoughts your thoughts, saith the Lord." If he adopts the language of the poet, he will say, with Sir William Watson (in that fine agnostic utterance The Unknown God): "Though kneeling nations watch and yearn, does the primordial purpose turn?" A stage farther in the same movement away from the position of Smith is represented by Jones. Jones likes to think of himself as a man of emancipated mind who has outgrown the naive and unscientific ascription of "purpose" to the universe at large. The 296</page><page sequence="3">COSMIC PURPOSE Universe to him is Nature, and Nature is mechanism. Determinism must therefore replace teleology. Man, it is true, has his purposes: Nature provides the firm and assured material basis upon which he may work and with which he may implement them. But there is no extra-human or super-human purpose anywhere, and to use language to that effect is to fall into sentimentalism and self-deception, if not into sheer obscurantism. The fourth typical view, that of Robinson, is at once a refusal to attribute purpose to the Cosmos and a repudiation of the mechanistic or any other "scientific" scheme which is for Jones the obvious alternative interpretation. The Cosmos as an ordered system disappears. The universe (if even that term may be kept, for Robinson inclines to a defiant pluralism) in its ultimate nature is an overwhelming mystery, parent alike of cruelty, disaster, frustration, and of beauty, joy, and thrilling fruition. If he may toy with the poet's dream that the "dreaming, dark, dumb thing" may become eventually a conscious will, it is for him but a dream. But for Robinson, if there is one thing more childish than the assumption that the inscrutable mystery that is Reality is a benign providence, it is the arrogant claim of "science" that its nature is to be adequately comprehended and formulated in terms of law, order, fixed and regular system. These four representative opinions, though not by any means equally widely held or equally influential, are all, I think, typical contemporary points of view. For the first and second there is a Cosmic purpose: it means "God's purpose," which is held to be in the former case providential to man, while the latter denies our right to assume that it has any relevance to human concerns. For the third and fourth there is no "cosmic purpose," mechanism being its substitute in the one case and mystery in the other. II Consideration of the attitudes I have tried to present above may begin by a dismissal of the fourth, ascribed to my imaginary Robinson. Robinson is a mystic, though a literary and poetical rather than a religious mystic, and his attitude is not really based on rational considerations at all; his conviction upon this matter is part of a thoroughgoing epistemological scepticism as to the power of thought to interpret the nature of reality. He will hardly, therefore, deign to argue upon the question, and we may spare ourselves the trouble of considering his position further. This is not to say that his position is not in some ways the most interesting and challenging of the four; but as the most sceptical of them it would demand separate and lengthy treatment. 297</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY Turning to the position of mechanistic determinism, we are dealing with a belief that is put forward and defended on rational grounds. Mechanism excludes teleology: if future events are deter- mined causally by past and present events, and are in principle exactly ascertainable, they cannot (it is maintained) be determined purposefully. But the prestige of mechanistic determinism has suffered some- thing of an eclipse to-day even among the Scientists, and its claim need not be dealt with at length. In the first place, if "mechanism" is taken in its strictest sense of explanation in terms of mechanics, Mr. Jones, the mechanist, has to be told that he is trying to "have it both ways." The attractiveness of "mechanism" as a key-con- ception is due to our familiarity with machines, and a machine embodies a "purpose" in the double sense of being the product of an inventive, contriving mind and being itself productive of intended results. In claiming, therefore, to disavow a universal purposiveness as anthropomorphic illusion, and to affirm Nature as a fixed pre- determined order, the popular "mechanist" is all the time exploiting a phraseology which carries with it like a sort of penumbra the suggestion-none the less comforting for being kept vague and unanalysed-that this order may, after all, be assumed to mean something, to be "getting" somewhere, to have point and drive and effective purport. This criticism that a "mechanism" is, literally, a device, and that a device implies an end, is a familiar one enough, but it will be probably dismissed by the mechanists as a verbal quibble. Still, when we have widened the word to the utmost and freed it from the clinging suggestion of "a machine," there is still to be considered the objection that to claim that mechanism excludes teleology is to claim that a "how" can exclude a "why." No regularity in a deter- minate causal nexus is incompatible with purpose. Explanation-to adopt a familiar contrast-may be mechanical-causal and interpre- tation teleological. The determinist world of physics may be not only "in order" but "in order to"-an end. The teleological view of Nature is at war not with any conception of order, however rigid, but rather with the conception of the universe as a mere chaos. This plea that mechanism and teleology are not in any way at variance has often been made. But it leaves our scientific mechanist cold, and it is easy to see why. It is a cogent plea on condition that both categories are applied not to the totality of all that is, but to a part only; on condition, that is, that "nature" is not the total reality. This granted, we can posit a Purposer making use for ends of his own of a "natural order" which may be as rigid and mechan- istic as we please. But once this transcendent Real, the wielder or bearer of the purpose, is denied or left out of account, the opposition 298</page><page sequence="5">COSMIC PURPOSE between determinist causation and teleology does become a real and irresolvable one. Thus Descartes and Newton have no difficulty in affecting the reconciliation; whereas to Kant the problem is more complex because he cannot allow himself to bring super-nature-his ethically based theism-fairly and squarely into his interpretation of "Nature." And the modern materialist for whom there is no reality at all beyond "Nature" finds himself unshaken in the belief that no reconciliation between the two points of view is possible. If there is a "Super-nature," then "Nature"-the world of the scientist-may be at once mechanically and teleologically deter- mined. If there is none, it cannot be both. Can this conclusion be avoided by reinterpreting the conception of "purpose" so as to make it wholly "immanent"? If so, we might identify "Nature" with "all that is" and yet hold that natural processes, and even Nature as whole, have a purposive aspect. But what will this mean? It must mean that we recognize in the present not only the "promise" or prospect of a more valuable future, but a "nisus" towards and for it. We are almost bound to use metaphorical language, to speak with Leibniz or Professor Alexander of the present "big with" or pregnant with the future or with some yet unrealized supreme "quality," or to speak with Shakespeare of "the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come." Thus the conception of "immanent teleology" applied to the Cosmos as a whole either is a mere comforting "als ob" which cannot be taken too much in earnest, or it takes us right out of the world-view of mechanistic determinism. It is in fact the growing recognition of the inadequacy of mechanistic determinism as a scheme of explanation which makes it necessary for the disbeliever in "cosmic purpose" to dig deeper and base his objection upon more fundamental grounds. III The more thoroughgoing criticism of the notion of a cosmic purpose, a universal teleology, may begin by considering what is really maintained by those who affirm it. Both the typical views on this side (those of "Smith" and "Brown") contrast, though in different degrees, "cosmic" and human purpose, which would seem to indicate that they do not strictly attribute purpose to the "totality of all that is." And this follows also from the fact that both views-though again with different degrees of explicitness- regard " Nature" as not the source of the cosmic purpose or its bearer, so much as the sphere of its manifestation. The phrase expresses, in effect, the universally pervasive and controlling opera- tion of a supreme power and will "at the back of" reality, which for the more theistic of the two points of view becomes the "creator" 299</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY of nature the "creation." But leaving this latter conception out of account, the phrase "cosmic purpose" will be a phrase like "the policy of Russia." The Russian state as a whole corresponds to the absolute total Reality. Within it is a directing power, making and carrying out the "policy" in and through the citizens of the state and their institutions. The illustration used by Aristotle (Meta- physics, xii, 1075a) might be adapted to the present discussion. Is the "good" in the world, he asks in effect, like the leader in an army, a distinguishable reality within it, or is it more comparable with the spirit of loyal co-operation that animates the army through all its ranks? (Aristotle says "the order of the parts," but the above is a permissible extension of his meaning.) Aristotle suggests that it is both: we may recognize a "good" as the unifying principle pervading the world, yet as specially embodied in the power directing and controlling it. Just so, theist and semi-theist may find the will of the "power behind" manifested through and for the whole natural order, and so employ the rather vague term "cosmic purpose." Taken in this way the phrase points towards theism, and defi- nitely away from pantheism or any form of monism. The army co-operates to carry out the general's strategy, and in identifying itself loyally with it may be said to make that strategy its own. But it does not literally make or devise the strategy. As Aristotle puts it, "the leader does not depend on the 'order' of the army, but vice versa." In the same way Smith will speak of man being a "fellow-worker with God," and Brown will speak of "accepting the inscrutable decrees of heaven "; yet neither will claim that man can modify in any way or contribute anything to the supreme purpose or plan which it is his business to acknowledge and realize. And probably both would agree that to accept a view like that of the late Dr. McTaggart, for whom the universe was in the last resort a society of immortal individuals undirected by any single supreme overruling will, would be to deprive the term cosmic purpose of all real meaning. But here we are confronted by the real difficulty in the conception, rendered familiar by the criticism in particular of Rationalists and Idealists of different schools. The realization of a purpose implies usually two things which seem to make it impossible to attribute purpose either literally to the totality of all that is or in the more theistic interpretation just considered to the "Father and Fashioner of all that is." These two things are, first, an environment, spiritual or material, to serve at once as the arena, the means, and the inspiration of achievement; and, second, an imperfection in the purposer, the contrast between the incomplete actual present and the envisaged ideal. And the difficulty of finding a meaning for these when we pass from human 300</page><page sequence="7">COSMIC PURPOSE to divine purposings is well illustrated in one of the most famous of all attempts at a cosmic teleology, that of Plato's Timcaus. There the v7ro3Sox or matrix supplies the arena and the material, the ELS&amp; or Forms contemplated by "God" the inspiration or pattern for the carrying out of the Creator's divine purpose, while his need to impart his perfection is Plato's way of admitting that even the divine nature has not really completeness and self-suffi- ciency. The attempt was a heroic one, but the advowedly semi- mythic character of the account suggests that Plato is tiying to fuse together in the fervour of his creative vision elements that are really incompatible. To be engaged in working out a purpose is to be so far limited and defective; "finite" in the modern sense, "infinite" (i.e. incomplete, without wholeness) in the Greek sense of the term. Can the whole of reality be thought of so ? Or even that which is the supreme reality ? More modern philosophic critics of cosmic teleology reinforce this objection by attempting to show that the temporal process is "unreal" in the sense of not being ultimate, that the "last word" about the world is not that it is "passage." This is, as already hinted, to cast doubt upon what unreflective common sense assumes without question to be real. But the doubt once cast is disquietingly clinging and oddly infectious. Even so whole-hearted a believer in time, change, process, and the dramatic and purposive character of reality as William James is found admitting "the solid meaning of life is always the same eternal thing. .... In this solid and tri- dimensional sense, so to call it, those philosophers are right who contend that the world is a standing thing, with no real progress, no real history. The changing conditions of history touch only the surface of the show."' This claim that the Cosmos must be whole and entire, and ulti- mately supra-temporal, and therefore that the conception of purpose cannot be applied to it as a whole, leaves us with the question: What, then, are we to do with this teleological category? For it seems to clamour for employment, it demands obstinately to be applied-even to the universe in its entirety. The critics of teleology have to tell us what attitude we must take up about it. And they are quite ready to do so. Two of the most famous solutions to the problem may be briefly considered. IV First, there is the endeavour of Spinoza, heroic in its austerity, to think away the whole teleological category as a human illusion. 1 Talks to Teachers, pp. 299 ff.; quoted by Bosanquet, The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary Philosophy, p. i9i. 30I</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY In the famous Appendix to Part I of the Ethics he seeks to show that it is possible simply to lay aside our attribute of "final causes" to Nature or God, and therewith to discard all the human "stan- dards" and "values" which are the badge of our servitude. If we think clearly, we are to recognize that there is no place for all these in a world of absolute systematic determination. They are a pathetic fallacy, and teleology dissolves when we see things clearly and dis- tinctly as they are. But this heroic renunciation cannot really be made. It is not merely that even an illusion remains an obstinate fact, though this familiar platitude is strangely often disregarded. Nothing is unmade by a name. The most "illusory" experience remains obstinately knocking at the door of our minds, a guest who, however unwelcome, cannot finally be excluded. Spinoza, it is true, was very conscious of the pertinacity of the illusory "values" of "imagination." But Spinoza, as has been noted,' virtually gives back what he has bid us abandon by reinstating values and a goal for human effort under the name of "perfection"; and with this returns willy-nilly the idea of final causes and teleology. "Fines" expellas furca, tamen usque recurrent. It is not indeed possible consistently to think away our valuations. It may appear to be so because it is easy to confuse two very different things-the substitution of new values for old and the abandonment of the category of value altogether. We may, for instance, with Nietzsche, welcome a "transvaluation of moral values," but to rethink our verdicts is not to unthink the judgment of value itself. The other answer to the question what is to be done with tele- ology is that of Hegelian, or perhaps rather Neo-Hegelian, Abso- lutism. Instead of contemptuous dismissal, the claim of purpose receives a qualified and rather grudging welcome. It has a right to admittance, but it must not be allowed to presume or to suppose that it can be anything more than a subordinate member of the household. In other words, the teleological point of view has its place in reality, but must not be applied to reality as a whole. Teleology refers to finite conscious experients. Reality is a Totality, i.e. a complete Individuality, and the sort of unity displayed in the realization of a plan, in choosing means for ends, doing this for the sake of that, can never be more than a "sub-form"z of indi- viduality (i.e. it is only a quasi-individual form of unity?). Its application to the Universe "is got at primarily by freeing the idea of end from some incidents of finite purpose which cannot apply to the true whole."3 Purpose is bound up with Time, and I E.g., by Professor Laird in his Study in Value. a B. Bosanquet, The Principle of Individuality and Value. 3 Bosanquet. 302</page><page sequence="9">COSMIC PURPOSE Time with indefinite and therefore ever incomplete process, and purpose, therefore, must share the subordination that on this type of theory befalls Time. Temporality is real, but Reality is not temporal. The time-scheme, one might perhaps say, is true "for all intents and purposes"; the purpose-scheme is true for all time. But this is not to deny that both are inadequate characterizations of the Absolute Real. The Absolutist position, particularly as developed so eloquently by its modern English exponents, offers indeed a formidable criticism of the attempt to apply the conception of purpose in its stricter sense to reality as a whole. But an uneasy doubt remains, whether it has done quite full justice to the teleological point of view. It is to repeat a familiar criticism to suggest that Absolutism tends to present us with a "Totality" which, in absorbing finite "individu- ality" and taking over its name, has come to sacrifice something of its meaning. It is possible perhaps to detect in the belief in a "cosmic purpose" a fumbling protest on behalf of the unique import of the particular and against a too smooth and even incorporation of all the subordinate reals into a single all-comprehensive Reality. V We suggest, then, that the attribution of purpose even to the whole of reality does figure in groping fashion a true meaning which it fails literally to express. What this is may perhaps be made clearer by a reference to instances in which the notion of purpose is misapplied even within the sphere of ordinary human concerns. Examples may be found in the everyday business of life as well as in the field of moral and aesthetic judgments. As to the latter, it is sufficient to note that, leaving out of account all disputed questions of ethical theory, the point of view of purpose, in so far as it implies "means and end," cannot possibly always do justice to the facts of voluntary action. We often act "on purpose" where we could not say we act "for a purpose." It introduces a false abstraction and separation of elements, by which the act and its result are set in a misleading contrast. Again, in a work of art, it is becoming a commonplace that to ask the purpose of the picture or the tragedy is to reveal mere crass ignorance of what a work of art is. The "purpose" of King Lear, or of Shakespeare in writing King Lear, was-King Lear. If there was any ulterior purpose in Shakespeare's mind, then "the less Shakespeare he." The tragedy embodies its end: it is means and end together. But the chief point which a work of art, such as a drama, illustrates is this: If we take it in its temporal character, as a whole of successive parts, the acts and scenes, is there any sense in which 303</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY we can regard these parts as standing to one another in the relation of means to end-as embodying, that is to say, the gradual realiza- tion of a purpose ? We cannot, clearly, in the obvious and ordinary sense of these words; or rather, if we can, that is in so far forth a damaging criticism of the play. (One might say, for instance, of an inferior piece of work: "Act 2 has no justification save to prepare for the crisis in the third act." But in a masterpiece each scene of the play adds something to the total impression; is certainly not merely a means to some "effect" later to be produced.) Andyet-and this is the special relevancy of the illustration-we can none the less say that one act "leads up to" a later situation. That is not its sole "purpose," but that is one of its aspects. And we can and must recognize that though the import and significance of the play pervade the whole, and though every part may have a value for the whole, yet there are in it moments-or a single moment-of climax, crisis, culmination, in which the significance of the whole is in a unique degree concentrated and focussed. These are the moments, the great scenes, that give the play its "point"; and in this sense it would not be very unnatural, though it would be strictly inaccurate, to speak of them as being the purpose of the other scenes and parts. We see the same thing well illustrated in a more trivial instance, in the difference between a good story well and ill told. A man with no gift for anecdote may remember every word which comprised the "point" of the story, but in his hands it is a dull and lifeless thing just because the details which "lead up to" the point are merely the "means," and not, as in the hands of the real raconteur, themselves charged with a flavour of the "interest" which makes the story engrossing as a whole. And yet, though over-impatience to "get to the point" may spoil both the telling and the hearing of the story, there is a sense in which the "point" may be called the purpose of it. Another illustration might be taken from the experience of travel. A man cruising for pleasure may plan out his voyage with a certain destination in mind. In a sense the journey, as far as the destination, is a "means" for arriving there, a route among other possible routes. But the most satisfactory journeys are those in which every place has also a value in itself, and not merely as a stage on the passage to the next.' The destination need not be the purpose of the whole voyage, for this has value and meaning throughout. And yet the x Many a sightseeing tourist finds travel disappointing because he has not disengaged himself from the means-and-end point of view, and so does not allow himself to find fruition in each new experience as it comes. His purpose is in fact not even, e.g., "to get to Rome," but "to return home after having been to Rome." 304</page><page sequence="11">COSMIC PURPOSE destination may, by its character of culmination, by being the acme of the entire experience, assume plausibly enough the appearance of being the "end" to which the rest of the journey is a "means." The above examples are drawn, as is to be expected, from types of experience in which the time-factor enters very intimately. But the same point is illustrated (though less obviously) by others in which temporal process plays a much less essential part. In some forms of aesthetic experience, for instance, though the appreciation of the work of art "takes time," as its creation "took time," yet time does not enter into its meaning. We may wander about a cathedral for hours gaining a richer and richer experience of it, and its architect and builders may have worked at it for decades making it a richer and richer object to experience; but, once completed, it is "all there together," and there is no reason but the defect of our faculties why we should not intuit it in a single perceptual instant. Yet in this case, as in the others, we might, incorrectly but not unnaturally, select a certain part of the building as its virtual "purpose," because, though every part of it had its own contribution to make to the whole effect, this part had a special and crowning importance to which the others were also subordinate. In short, within the sphere of ordinary human experience the application of purposive terms may sometimes be in strictness mis- taken and yet not without some justification. In so far as "means" and "ends" fall apart, and "means" become, as it were, an alien price to be paid away to secure the "end," teleology gives but an imperfect and frustrated unity, and some experiences have an aspect of whole- ness to which this point of view does less than justice. But even in such cases the conception of purpose may, none the less, have relative validity in pointing to the special function in such expe- riences of particular dominant "moments," focussing points for the meaning of the whole, to which the subordinate elements are ancillary, and from which in turn they derive a secondary import. And so with the affirmation of a "Cosmic Purpose." Press the conception home, and we are caught in knots which a defiant Theism may cut but can hardly disentangle. Yet to dismiss it with contumely is too drastic a renunciation, and even to damn it, as Absolutism does, with faint and mitigated praise may be to slur or blur an element of true insight contained in it. And this would seem to be the implicit affirmation that Reality in its temporal aspect (whether this can be transcended or no) means culmination rather than destination. Thus the cosmic process will be thought of not so much as the passage to an indefinitely distant goal or outcome (which is what the term "purpose" strictly used would seem to imply) as a historical-dramatic process containing dominant "moments," focal points, which contribute to the significance of the whole-in 305</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY so far as we insist upon the wholeness of the Real-yet draw to themselves the meaning of subordinate features: crucial contexts in the march of time, climaxes, or even a single climax, in "the eternal deed that is the heart of reality."'
