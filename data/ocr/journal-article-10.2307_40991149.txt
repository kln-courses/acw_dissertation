<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and Personhood on the Farm Cattle in Crisis in the UK Kay Milton Queen's University Belfast RESUME Science et subjectivité à la ferme : crise bovine au Royaume-Uni Cet article examine la relation entre science et subjectivité au Royaume-Uni, spécifiquement en relation avec la crise de la fièvre aphteuse de 2001. L'élevage intensif nie que les animaux soient des « personnes », c'est-à-dire des êtres avec des pensées et des sentiments. Par contre de nombreux animaux, y compris des animaux d'élevage, sont traités comme des personnes individuelles dans la vie de tous les jours. Pendant la crise de la fièvre aphteuse, le contraste entre ces attitudes était particulièrement clair. Cet article montre que la science et le respect qu'elle inspire en tant qu'arbitre de la vérité ont façonné les représentations et le traitement des animaux de rente, pendant cette crise et d'autres crises récentes.

Kay Milton Queen's University Belfast School of Anthropological Studies Queen's University Belfast bt7 Inn Northern Ireland k.milton@qub.ac.uk In what is broadly called "western" or "modern" cul- ture, science is considered to be an independent arbiter of truth, and so forms an important basis for decision making. In this paper, I consider how this respect for science has affected the treatment and representation of farm animals in the United Kingdom, taking, as a case study, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001. The paper takes as its starting point the relationship between science and common sense, discussed by Richards [1997], Atran [1990] and Wolpert [1992]. In the work of these scholars, common sense is taken to be a universal way of thinking, rooted in everyday experience, which forms a practical basis for living. There are different views on how science is related to common sense, which are explored briefly below. They can produce very diverse understandings of the world which can prove incompatible in particular con- texts. One such context was agricultural policy and its implementation in the United Kingdom, particularly with regard to farm animals, up to and around the beginning of the twenty-first century. I shall suggest that science fostered a particular understanding of non-human animals which supports their treatment as resources. Treating something as a resource means valuing it in terms of its benefit to others, in this case, to human beings. Common sense, on the other hand, supports the understanding of at least some non-human animals as persons. The con- cept of "person" has been much discussed by anthro- pologists, particularly through comparisons between western and non- western concepts [Lutz, 1988 ; Strathern, 1988 ; Morris, 1994 ; Bird-David, 1999]. In popular British discourse, the term person is almost always taken to refer to a human being. But I suggest that the "personhood" (or "person-ness") of human beings is taken to lie in three main characteristics which are assumed also to inhere in some non-human beings. These characteristics are the capacity to act inten- tionally, the capacity to experience feelings, and the possession of moral worth. When non-human beings are perceived as possessing one or more of these Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1, p. 69-78</page><page sequence="2">70 Kay Milton qualities, they are assumed to have a degree of person- hood [Milton, 2002 : 27-31]. A person is thus some- thing that can have interests, it is a subject rather than an object, and has value in and for itself. So, while resource-based models value things in terms of their benefit to others, person-based models value them in themselves, recognizing their "personal" interests. When people are referred to as "human resources", it is assumed that they are being valued primarily in terms of what they do for the establishment for which they work. Their status as persons is not necessarily denied by such treatment - getting the most out of people often involves paying attention to their personal needs and sensibilities - but their personhood is made to take second place. Similarly, the use of non-human animals as resources makes their status as persons, how- ever that might be perceived, subordinate to their role as providers for human benefit, and often generates actions which deny or violate their personhood. In the case of farm animals, whose very existence depends on their designation as resources, this kind of treatment is routine. The farming of animals in the United Kingdom has undergone two acute crises during the past 20 years, the epidemic of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (bse), popularly called "mad cow disease" which emerged in the late 1980s, and the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (fmd) in 2001. The former, as its name indicates, affected cattle, while the latter affected cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer and some less common farm animals (such as llamas and alpacas). Both crises were dealt with by slaughtering large numbers of ani- mals, and in both cases the decision to slaughter was the direct result of scientific advice given to govern- ment. In the mid-1990s farm animals again became the centre of media attention through widespread pub- lic protest against the export of calves for veal produc- tion. Here I shall focus primarily on the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak, but I shall return to a com- parison of the three cases towards the end of the chapter. In what follows I will first examine the relationship between science and common sense. Then I consider how common sense enables and fosters the perception of personhood in non-human animals, and how sci- ence, to some degree, has discouraged this kind of perspective. I then examine the representations of farm animals during the 2001 FMD outbreak by parties involved in dealing with and reporting on the crisis. I conclude with some general comments on what can Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1 be learned from this case, in comparison with the oth- ers mentioned above, about how people think and feel about farm animals in Britain. My sources of informa- tion consist of government statements, official reports and media coverage, including web sites. My interpre- tation of this material has been informed by many years of participatory research on environmental issues in the United Kingdom, in which discussions about agricul- tural policy and practice, and the moral status of non- human animals, have featured prominently. ■ Science and common sense Richards has drawn attention to the difference between inductivist and anti-inductivist views of sci- ence [1997 : 108]. The inductivists see scientific ideas as closely related to common sense, in that both depend on observations derived from experience. Human beings everywhere, Atran asserted, are endowed with common sense : "They possess universal cognitive dis- positions that determine a core of spontaneously for- mulated representations about the world" [1990 : 263-264]. Science builds on this spontaneously gener- ated knowledge by asking questions about the world and addressing them in empirically testable ways. Sci- ence thus seeks to explain, through rational means, the world that common sense enables people to know. In doing so, it creates knowledge to which common sense has no access, knowledge of processes and substances which are not part of everyday experience, but which nevertheless, according to science, determine such experience. The anti-inductivists see a disjuncture between common sense and science. Common sense is, by def- inition, intuitive, but scientific knowledge is often counter-intuitive. It does not come « naturally » to us as a result of everyday experience, but posits a reality which contradicts what our everyday experience tells us [Wolpert, 1992]. Common sense tells us that humans and chimpanzees are distinct kinds of being. Science tells us that they are closely related and share a common ancestor. Common sense tells us that the continents are fixed, immovable features of the earth, but science tells us that they are constantly moving and were once joined in a huge land mass. So, while the inductivist view of science sees it as building and elab- orating on commonsense understandings of the world, the anti-inductivist view sees it as stepping outside</page><page sequence="3">those understandings. Whichever view is adopted, sci- ence can generate very different understandings of the world from those produced by common sense. Pre- cisely how science does this, and how the knowledge it generates can differ from that produced by common sense, are discussed below in relation to the person- hood of non-human animals. ■ Common sense and the perception of personhood In his book Faces in the clouds [1993], Guthrie argued that human beings have a natural tendency to perceive human-like forms and influences in their environment, and that this tendency developed because it is an evo- lutionary advantage. If we hear a noise behind us it is safer to assume that it is someone out to get us than to assume it is insignificant. The former assumption leads to action - we either run away or prepare to defend ourselves. Either assumption could be wrong, but the first offers the better chance of survival. I sug- gest that Guthrie's characterization of the kind of per- ceptions it generates is unrealistically narrow. It is just as important to be alert to non-human dangers as to human ones ; our early human ancestors would have faced danger from many non-human predators. It thus makes more sense to suggest that we perceive agency in the world around us [Lawson and McCauley, 1990], than to assume that we perceive human-like forms and influences. In other words, we perceive the presence of intentionality, of beings which act with some pur- pose, of persons ; the perception of personhood in the non-human world is a matter of common sense. There is another line of argument which I find more persuasive. It seems reasonable to assume that entities which appear to behave in similar ways have similar characteristics, even if these are not directly observable. The entities whose characteristics we know most inti- mately are ourselves. I know my own internal world of feeling and thought, and I know how my behaviour and actions are related to various aspects of my inner world. This knowledge forms a starting point for understanding my fellow human beings. I cannot observe their inner worlds directly, but I assume that they are like my own in certain fundamental respects, that they include thoughts, feelings and intentions which are associated in particular ways with behaviour and actions. Of course, as I get to know my fellow Science and Personhood on the Farm 71 human beings more intimately, I modify my under- standing by learning in what ways they differ from me and from each other. But, generally speaking, an over- riding sense of our common personhood - a sense that we are similar kinds of entities, with inner worlds of thought and feeling reflected in behaviour - remains and underlies all our interactions. I suggest that we make similar assumptions about non-human entities. We assume the presence of an inner world of thought and feeling whenever behav- iour appears to suggest it. When I see a dog eating I assume that it feels hungry ; when it cowers I assume that it feels afraid. Even animals whose emotions are less easy to read, such as fish and insects, still act in apparently purposeful ways (they seek food, avoid dan- ger, defend themselves when attacked). On the basis of our own experience of meaning to do what we do, we might be inclined to assume that all apparent actions are so driven, including the daily rising of the sun and the blowing of the wind. This would produce a general perception of agency in the universe, which could form a basis for religious beliefs [op. cit.]. Even if we do not perceive intentionality everywhere in the universe, we are likely to perceive it in non-human animals, self-contained living beings like ourselves, who appear to act intentionally. When a cat hunts a mouse or a spider spins a web or a male pigeon struts before a female, we tend to treat intentionality as self-evident. It is important to stress that these comments relate to the cultural context with which I am most familiar, a white, British, middle-class context, which undoubt- edly shares many of its values and assumptions with the wider "western" world. Atran's definition of com- mon sense, quoted above, seems to imply that there are "spontaneously formulated representations" of the world which are found everywhere, that common sense generates universais in human knowledge. This may be so, but in the face of anthropological studies which indicate the fundamental nature of some cross- cultural differences in knowledge, I would not wish to assume that it is so. For this reason I stress that I am not suggesting, in the argument presented above, that people everywhere commonsensically perceive non- human animals as persons. I am suggesting that it is common sense for people to draw inferences about the nature of other entities from their experience of them- selves. In British culture, where people think of them- selves as persons, and where persons are assumed to possess a capacity for intentional action and emotional Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1</page><page sequence="4">72 Kay Milton experience, this process is likely to produce common- sensical perceptions of non-human animals as persons. It is common to use the term "anthropomorphism" to describe this way of interpreting non-human things [Kennedy, 1992 ; Einarsson, 1993 ; Peace, 2005]. I pre- fer the term "egomorphism" [Milton, 2005] because it more accurately reflects the personal nature of the experience on which such interpretations are based. It is important to clarify one possible misunder- standing about commonsense knowledge before embarking on a closer examination of science. I am not suggesting that commonsense knowledge is general knowledge. Knowledge generated through common sense can be extremely specialised. We would expect farmers to know a great deal more about their cows than a casual observer might learn. But a farmer's knowledge is still commonsense knowledge, as distinct from scientific knowledge, because it is generated in everyday experience, in practical and routine engage- ment which produces knowledge spontaneously. We should expect commonsense knowledge to vary a great deal in degrees of specialism, simply because people's everyday experience is so diverse. ■ Science and the denial of personhood It would be misleading to suggest that science nec- essarily denies the personhood of its objects of study, but, as I have noted elsewhere [Milton, 2002 : 21], personhood in science is problematic and contentious. According to Tylor, writing over a century ago, the role of science was to replace ideas about personal forces in nature with ideas about impersonal forces [Tambiah, 1990 : 50]. This did not mean simply replac- ing ideas about God as creator with ideas about the big bang and human evolution ; it also meant trying to explain what human and non-human animals do in impersonal terms. So, for instance, behaviour was explained in terms of its evolutionary function rather than in terms of internal subjective states. This is rela- ted to the need for scientific theories to be testable and provable. Since the existence of states of mind in non- human animals (and even in human ones) is difficult to prove, reference to them was not considered scientific. This had a very significant impact on the develop- ment of certain disciplines. Those whose subject mat- ter consists primarily of entities which could be Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1 understood as persons (such as human beings and other animals), and which include anthropology, sociology, psychology and ethology, have often struggled to be recognized as true sciences by the practitioners of dis- ciplines such as physics and chemistry, which focus on non-personal phenomena. For much of the twentieth century, anthropologists and sociologists analysed social and cultural systems rather than trying to describe people's inner worlds of thought and feeling, while psychology and ethology went through an era of strict behaviourism. Psychology and the social sciences have since moved away from behaviourism and now take seriously the study of thought and emotion. And as a result of the efforts of Goodall [1990] and other pioneering ethol- ogists [Fossey, 1985 ; Moss, 1988], and of many studies, under controlled conditions, of animal communication and intelligence, it has become not just acceptable but fashionable to study the subjectivity of animals. There is now a considerable demand for this kind of work, much of which is driven by developments in policy (in farming and wildlife management, for instance). But this development has taken a long time to pene- trate political culture, and at the time of the fmd out- break in the United Kingdom, the legacy of positivism remained strong, particularly where science was used as a basis for decision making. Here, the supposedly unbiased, provable nature of scientific knowledge was considered its most valuable characteristic. The point is that, despite developments in ethology, science could, until recently (and probably still can in some contexts), get away with denying personhood to non-human animals and was considered more useful to decision makers when it did so, when it restricted its pronouncements to what could be proven. By deny- ing non-human personhood, science became an important ally to economics. It is no accident that the period when positivism and behaviourism were strong in science coincided with the development of intensive farming. Science made the use of animals as resources easier by not regarding them as persons. Only persons have rights, so the exploitation of non-persons for eco- nomic purposes is morally acceptable. I now turn to a brief account of the 2001 fmd outbreak, and a consideration of how farm animals were represented in the public discourse that accom- panied that event.</page><page sequence="5">■ The Foot and Mouth Desease outbreak of 2001 The FMD outbreak began in February 2001 and ran for about seven months. The outbreak progressed rap- idly ; by mid-March there were over 250 cases and by 26 April there were 1 480 cases. By late April, how- ever, the fight against the disease was taking effect and the following two months brought less than 400 new cases [Anderson, 2002: 94]. Much of England was affected, with particularly serious outbreaks in the north-west and south-west. Parts of Wales and south- west Scotland were also badly hit. By the end of the outbreak, nearly four million animals had been slaugh- tered. The Countryside Agency estimated the cost to farming at between ^800m and £2Abn, and the cost to tourism at between £2bn and ¿£3bn [Kirby, 2001]. The losses to tourism were the result of severe restric- tions on movement in rural areas. Sport and politics also suffered, as fixtures were cancelled and the general election, which was to have taken place in May 2001, was postponed until the 7th of June. Given the draconian way in which the government responded to the outbreak, many people are surprised to hear that FMD is not fatal for the animals it infects. The response was based on the principle that the Uni- ted Kingdom must retain (or regain, after the outbreak) its "disease-free" status. To lose this status would have seriously damaged the UK's participation in the inter- national food market. There was therefore never any question that infected animals or, indeed any suscep- tible animals on infected properties, would be allowed to survive. Initial measures included banning move- ments of animals in infected areas and slaughtering animals on infected farms. By mid-March it was becoming clear that the outbreak was not under con- trol. Further measures were announced on 1 5 March ; in selected parts of the country sheep on properties within three kilometres of infected sites would be kil- led [op. cit. : 92]. During the subsequent few days there emerged two policies which appear to have changed the course of the outbreak. The first of these was "slaughter on sus- picion" : from 24 March, animals on properties where FMD was suspected were slaughtered, instead of waiting for the disease to be confirmed through blood tests [op. cit. : 95]. The second policy was "contiguous cull" : computer models produced to predict the course of the outbreak indicated that the most effective Science and Personhood on the Farm 73 approach, in addition to the swift killing of animals on infected properties, would be to kill susceptible animals on neighbouring or "contiguous" properties within 48 hours. This policy was never fully implemented [ibid.], and there were legal challenges from some farm- ers, some of which succeeded [op. cit. : 98], but enough was achieved for the government to announce a relax- ation of the contiguous cull on 26 April. From then on, the killing of animals on farms neighbouring infec- ted properties was no longer mandatory, but was left to the judgement of vets. ■ Animals as non-persons The killing of farm animals to restrict, for economic reasons, the spread of a disease which is not particularly harmful to them, effectively denies them the status of persons ; it denies them the moral consideration to which persons are normally considered, in British cul- ture, to be entitled. It defines them unambiguously as resources for human use, and in doing so it simply perpetuates the principles on which the whole animal farming industry is based. Indeed, it would have been amazing if the government had taken any other course of action. To have allowed animals their personal rights at the risk of serious damage to the industry would have been a violation of the economic values that drive farming. It would have been irrational within the eco- nomic context in which farming is practised, and would almost certainly have provoked widespread opposition from farmers concerned about their eco- nomic future. It is clear that science played a role in this denial of personhood to animals caught up in the FMD outbreak. The government was concerned, throughout the crisis, to stress that its actions were based on sound science. The government's Chief Scientific Adviser, an FMD Science Group under his chairmanship, the State Vet- erinary Service, and epidemiologists working in gov- ernment and in academic institutions, were all closely involved in informing the decision-making process. The models drawn up to predict the course of the outbreak under various policy scenarios [op. cit. : 94] treated farm animals in purely quantitative terms, by showing what would result if so many were killed in certain circumstances and at certain times. This was science being used in the service of economics ; it was obliged to ignore animal subjectivity because Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1</page><page sequence="6">74 Kay Milton economics itself has tended to do so, though this, too, is changing, particularly in organic farming [James, 1993]. ■ Animals as persons The representations of farm animals in the media contrasted sharply with the impersonal nature of sci- ence-based government policy. While farmers appa- rently accepted as necessary the slaughter of animals on infected farms, they nevertheless contrasted their own feelings of closeness to their animals with the impersonal treatment of these animals in economic terms : "People talk of the beasts as if they are a commodity, but it's so much more than that. We talk to them. They are our friends. " [Farmer quoted on the Guardian Unlimited website1, 5 March 2001] The killing of healthy animals, on farms near to or contiguous with infected properties, was a step too far for many farmers. Statements in response, quoted in the press, often described the animals in vividly per- sonal terms, stressing the bonds formed through the close associations of routine husbandry : "How can they expect me to hand the ewes and lambs up some morning to be put down. I know most of them. y) "We feel we've wasted 20 years of our lives. Our sheep are part of our family. . . " "No one seems to give anything for our feelings and what we feel for these animals. }&gt; [Farmers quoted in The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2001 : 5] An organic farmer in Anglesey, writing of the effects of FMD in his area, described his pregnant ewes as "my friends and grazing managers" [Robertson, 2001 : 98]. One admittedly exceptional farmer of rare breeds who never, even in ordinary circumstances, sent her sheep for slaughter, said, "I intend being with them if they have to die, since I have been at nearly every one of their births" [The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2001 : 1]. Paul Vallely, writing in The Independent [26 April 2001], quoted a farmer's wife as saying, "We have known and nurtured these animals since birth. How would you feel if someone came to your home and set about killing your pets ?" A farmer in Devon, whose sheep were due to be killed the following day, still tended his ewes giving birth in the barn : "I already knew the lamb would be going to go, and I could just have left him. But he could have died at birth and his mother Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1 might have died. Where's the dignity in that ?" [The Sunday Times, 18 March 2001 : 12]. The contrast between farmers' feelings for their ani- mals and the government's utilitarian approach is illus- trated by plans to turn a burial site of 500 000 sheep and cattle into a nature reserve. The government had intended it to be used for agricultural production - not to produce food but to grow willow and rape as fuel. Local residents wanted it to become a nature reserve, "a memorial to those dead animals. Not a tourist trap but a place for education and interpreta- tion". A government official had been "taken aback by the depth of feeling, especially among the farmers", who "mourned" the animals they had lost2. Cynics would claim (as some did) that this concern for animals, most of whom were destined to be slaugh- tered in any case for the meat market, was hypocritical on the part of farmers whose true concern was for their own economic livelihoods. Paul Vallely was told by the farmer's wife quoted above, "You don't under- stand... It is quite possible to feel for an animal, and care for it as well as you can, until the moment comes when it has to go to market" [The Independent, 26 April 2001]. Vallely accused the farmers of muddled think- ing. Given that animals would recover from FMD, there was never any need, in welfare terms, to kill them. "The smoke rising from the long pyres is a holocaust to the god whose name is Productivity rather than Necessity. Livestock prices and the export market are a greater concern than animal welfare here" [ibid.]. Similar arguments were made by animal rights and welfare activists [e.g. Tyler, 2001] pointing to the hypocrisy of an industry in which animals are bred to be exploited or as waste products (in the case of dairy calves) 3. The cynical comments of animal rights activists implied that farmers' representations of their animals in personal terms, as friends and family and known individuals, were merely rhetoric designed to win sym- pathy for their economic plight. According to a recent analysis of the experience of farmers in the north-west of England [Convery et al, 2005], such an interpreta- tion is unjustified. This outbreak brought about a total disruption of the relationships that constitute a normal farming way of life. These relationships are spatial (ani- mals live on the farm and die at the abattoir), as well as interpersonal (between individual farmers and indi- vidual animals) and familial (between the farmers' families and their herds, sometimes extending over generations). In particular, the fact that death was</page><page sequence="7">happening "in the wrong place" destroyed the deeply ingrained image of the farm as a place where animals are caringly nurtured. Franklin described this disrup- tion of normality as follows : "The fanner weeping next to the blazing pyre of dead sheep is a complicated portrait of a breach in the relationships between animals and humans that are ordinarily maintained through a much more normal- ized machinery of animal death. These disturbing scenes of burning carcasses make explicit the realities industrialized farm production usually manages to render invisible. . . " [Franklin, 2001 : 5] For the purposes of my argument, however, the issue of whether farmers really think of their animals in personal terms forms only a part of the picture. Equally important is the point that representations of animals in this way tap into a broad public cultural understand- ing of animals as persons, as thinking, feeling beings worthy of moral concern. The most vivid illustration of this was provided by Phoenix the calf, who became a national celebrity. ■ Phoenix the calf Phoenix was born on April 13 2001 on a farm in Devon, in south-west England. The small herd to which she belonged was culled because fmd had been confirmed on a neighbouring farm, victims, therefore, of the controversial "contiguous cull" policy. A few days after the cattle were killed, when officials returned to disinfect the site, the calf was found alive next to the body of her mother. She was named "Phoenix" by her owners, who refused to allow government vets to kill her without a court injunction. The calf s pho- tograph appeared on the front pages of national news- papers and her owners received gifts and letters of support. MP Tony Banks, a well-known campaigner for animal rights, was quoted as saying,"... to kill Phoenix would be taking cruelty to the point of per- version", and a regional director of the National Farm- ers' Union, which had supported the contiguous cull, was reported as saying, "Killing Phoenix would make Herod look like a humanitarian". On 26 April, the relaxation in the contiguous cull policy was announced (see above), which gave Phoenix a reprieve. She quickly became known as the calf who changed government policy. Within a week there was talk of Phoenix mugs and dolls, advertising contracts and a role in a pantomime. Her owner had done radio Science and Personhood on the Farm 75 interviews for Sydney, New York, Washington and Canada and his son had appeared in newspapers in Iceland [The Guardian, 4 May 2001]. Phoenix was promised "a long stable future" on the farm, where a horse and a dog were now the only other non-human residents. She has since made guest appearances at agri- cultural shows throughout the country. It is not Phoenix's treatment as a celebrity that marks her representation as a person. After all, many inani- mate objects are paraded in public and used for pub- licity. What marks her representation as a person are the expressions of concern for her "personal" interests and well-being. Her owners thought she "deserved" a chance ; a possible pantomime in London was not con- sidered because, "that wouldn't be fair on her" ; she was described as "traumatised" ; a farm animal charity said, "she's been through enough". A brief biopic was printed in The Observer [29 April 2001], complete with "Hobbies" ("playing with the dogs on Clarence Farm, dancing on her hooves...") and "Big moment" ("sur- viving to become international celebrity and changing Government slaughter policy at the age of two weeks"). The majority of press reports referred to Phoenix using gendered pronouns ("she", "her") ; only the more sceptical commentators (such as Vallely in The Independent, 26 April 2001) and nfu spokesmen referred to her impersonally as "it". Phoenix, along with a few other named individuals whose public profile was less enduring (Misty the goat, Lucky the lamb, Porky the pot-bellied pig), became a touchstone for public opinion against the mass slaugh- ter policy, and provided the government with an opportunity to make a popular gesture. Indeed, she created something of a dilemma for the government. The prospect of saving a national favourite shortly before a general election was very attractive, but they did not want to be thought of as straying from a strict science-based policy. What appears to have happened is that the decision to modify the contiguous cull was taken in consultation with government scientific advis- ers, but that the announcement of the change was made a few hours earlier than originally intended in order to forestall the appearance of further press reports depicting the government as heartless [Jones, 2001]. Moreover, the announcement was made directly by the Prime Minister's office to the press, instead of through the Agriculture Ministry, and it referred per- sonally to Phoenix, enabling "Blair saves calf head- lines to appear on the main evening news [ibid., 2001]. While benefiting from the warm glow created by this Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1</page><page sequence="8">76 Kay Milton news, the government then had to convince its critics that the policy had not been modified in order to save Phoenix, and that the decision was taken on scientific evidence and not for electoral reasons. The opposition, of course, made the most of this situation, and were still raising questions about it in Parliament six months later [Hansard, 12 November 2001 : Column 574] 4. ■ A speculative comparison In contrast to the prominence of animal personhood in the debate surrounding the FMD outbreak, the earlier debate on the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (bse) crisis, in which millions of cattle had been slaugh- tered and their bodies incinerated, made virtually no reference to it. I can recall only the pro-animal MP Tony Banks declaring that he was sorry for the cows. None of the animal welfare groups spoke out in defence of the cattle. Why was this ? Sociologist Keith Tester suggested that protests about the treatment of animals are inconsistent because the public's real concerns are not for the animals them- selves but for human interests. In 1995, hundreds of people gathered at ports in southern England to protest about the export of British calves to be reared in veal crates on the European Continent. Animal person- hood was paramount in this discourse. The issue was one of cruelty, of identification with the suffering of fellow creatures. People risked their lives to stop the lorries taking the calves for export, whose drivers were called "Murderers" [Lane, 1995]. According to Tester, the residents of Shoreham, one of the main export sites, were really concerned about the pollution of their pretty environment, presumably by ugly lorries [Irwin, 1996], and the reason why there was no public outcry in support of the cattle slaughtered in the BSE crisis was that public concern was directed elsewhere, at the industrial production of cattle feed which had caused the crisis, and the public realisation that food is an industrial product rather than a natural one [ibid.]. I suggest that the answer is much simpler than this, and it does not require us to disbelieve the overt expressions of public concern. The veal crate issue was unambiguously one of animal welfare. There were no counter interests to detract from public concern about the calves and their suffering. No human beings would suffer in any significant way if the export were stopped. Consequently, protest was unequivocal and extreme. Ethnologie française, XXXIX, 2009, 1 People put their own physical well being on the line, just as they did many times in Britain in the 1990s, in protesting against roadbuilding and other development schemes [Milton, 2004] 5. In the FMD outbreak, the issues were not so clear cut. There was some public sympathy with the need to protect the UK's "disease-free" status, on the under- standing that if this were lost, the industry and the people working in it might suffer genuine hardship. For this reason, the killing of animals on infected prop- erties seemed to be largely accepted. What aroused public anger was the killing of animals on uninfected properties, animals which did not have and might never have the disease. But even this anger remained largely unspoken, except by the farmers themselves, until Phoenix gave it an appropriate vehicle for public expression. In addition, of course, the conditions cre- ated by the FMD outbreak restricted the possibilities for public protest. No doubt many people would have joined Phoenix's owners in physically blocking the path of the ministry vets who came to kill Phoenix, but given the restrictions on movement around the countryside, they could not have done so without endangering the object of their concern. So they turned, instead, to gifts and messages of support. In the BSE crisis there was an overriding human interest. BSE is thought to be the cause of variant CJD (Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease) in human beings. The pros- pects of a human epidemic placed beyond question the need to ensure that no infected meat entered the food chain, so the mass slaughter was accepted with little opposition. Any suggestion that the cattle should not be killed was unlikely to attract much support. The BSE slaughter was also much less visible than the slaugh- ter that took place during the FMD outbreak. Cattle at risk of carrying BSE were taken away, killed and dis- posed of in incinerators. And even though some of the most memorable images of the crisis depict stiff-legged bodies against the glow of the furnace, there were no mass pyres in green fields, no clouds of black smoke hanging over the countryside, no farmers weeping by the remains of their herds. In the FMD outbreak, death was sudden, public and wholesale ; in the BSE crisis it was hidden and piecemeal. So I suggest that levels of human activism for animal welfare vary, not because people are not really con- cerned about animals at all, but because, in each sit- uation, they respond to a range of values which are more or less motivating. The sight of a young girl suffering from variant CJD is more compelling than the</page><page sequence="9">relatively clinical and invisible deaths of millions of cattle. In contrast, in the FMD outbreak, human and non-human suffering were much less in opposition, and often on the same side. And in the veal crate issue, there were no images of human suffering to counter the sight of hundreds of Phoenixes starring pitifully from between the slats of the export lorries. What Science and Personhood on the Farm 77 makes such images emotionally compelling is a com- monsense capacity to recognise our common person- hood, a capacity which is nurtured in British culture, but which has also been suppressed by the use of pos- itivistic science in the service of mainstream economic and political processes. ■ I Notes Aknowledgements I am grateful to participants in the Inau- gural Conference of the Animals and Society (Australia) Study Group (University of Western Australia, July 2005), and to participants in seminars at Queen's University Belfast and the University of St Andrews, for comments on earlier versions of this chapter. 1 .

I ABSTRACT Science and Personhood on the Farm : Cattle in Crisis in the UK This paper examines the relationship between science and personhood in the context of farming in the UK, and specifically in relation to the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Intensive farming systematically denies that animals are "persons", beings with thoughts and feelings like ourselves. In contrast, many animals, including farm animals, are treated as individual persons in everyday life. During the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001, the contrast between these attitudes was prticularly clear. This paper shows how science, and people's respect for it as an arbiter of truth, has shaped the representation and treatment of farm animals during this and other recent crises. Keywords : Science.

I ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Wissenschaft und Subjektivität am Bauernhof: Britische Rinder in der Krise Dieser Artikel untersucht die Beziehung zwischen Wissenschaft und Subjektivität, wie sie sich im Umgang mit der Maul- und Klauenseuche 2001 in England gezeigt hat. Die Massentierhaltung verneint, dass Tiere „Menschen" sind, d.h. Wesen mit Gedanken und Gefühlen. Dennoch werden viele Tiere, Zuchttiere eingeschlossen, im täglichen Leben behandelt als seien sie menschliche Individuen. Zum Zeitpunkt der Maul- und Klauenseuche trat die Diskrepanz zwischen diesen Positionen besonders deutlich hervor. Der Artikel verdeutlicht, dass die Wissenschaft - gerade auch in ihrer Position als Schiedrichterin der Wahrheit - den Umgang mit der Thematik und mit den (ausgediehnten) Tieren während dieser und früherer Krisen bestimmt hat.
