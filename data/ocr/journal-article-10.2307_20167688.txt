S. and C. B. Cosgrove In 1919, C. Burton and Hattie S. Cosgrove bought land in Grant County, New Mexico, and began excavating ruins containing Classic Mimbres (ca. a.D. 1000-1150) ceramics. The self-trained archaeologists so impressed A. V. Kidder of the Peabody Museum that he invited them to manage a museum expedition to the Swarts Ruin. Long out of print, this classic volume is the Cosgrove's report of their Mimbres Valley Expedition seasons of 1924 to 1927. The excavation recovered nearly 10,000 artifacts, including an extraordinary assemblage of Mimbres ceramics. Hattie Cosgrove's meticulous line drawings of over 700 individual Swarts Ruin pots have long been an invaluable design catalogue for contemporary Native American artists and a rich resource for designers seeking Southwest inspiration in their work. This clothbound facsimile edition of the original 1932 publication is an essential addition to any serious Native American collection.

Former lawyer Watson Smith joined the expedition as a volunteer during the 1936 season and became one of its most productive researchers, as well as one of the Southwest's foremost archaeological scholars. In this volume of the Peabody Museum Papers series, first published in 1952, Smith reported on the remarkable painted murals found at Awatovi and other Puebloan sites in underground ceremonial chambers known as kivas. Now reissued in a stunning facsimile edition, the volume includes color reproductions of the original serigraphs. The aesthetic power and symbolic imagery of the sacred wall-painting tradition of the aboriginal American Southwest still fascinate today. Archaeologists, art historians, collectors, and artists alike will welcome the return of this long out-of-print classic.

In the Press's new series, distinguished scholars and curators offer a look behind museum walls at collections of unsurpassed artistic, historical, and anthropological value. A NOBLE PURSUIT The Duchess of Mecklenburg Collection from Iron Age Slovenia Gloria Polizzotti Greis Foreword by Peter S. Wells Photographs by Hi I lei S. Burger In 1905, the 48-year-old Duchess Raul Friedrich of Mecklenburg took up the practice of archaeology. In the ensuing decade, she successfully excavated twenty-one sites in her home province of Carniola (modern Slovenia), acquiring the patronage of Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef I and German Kaiser Wilhelm II. Mentored by the most important archaeologists of her time?Oscar Montelius and Josef Dechellette?the duchess became an accomplished fieldworker and an important figure in the archaeology of Central Europe. The sites she excavated form an exceptional resource for studying the scope of Iron Age cultures in the region. Most of the excavated materials reside in Harvard's Peabody Museum, making up the largest systematically excavated collection of European antiquities outside of Europe. This colorful account of the duchess and her work provides an overview of the collection as a whole, presents a selection of beautifully photographed artifacts, and incorporates previously unpublished correspondence and other rare archival documents. 128 pp., 75 illus., more than 50 in color, 8" x 81/2" Paper with flaps, ISBN 0-87365-404-8 $21.95 COLLECTING THE WEAVER'S ART The William Claflin Collection of Southwestern Textiles Laurie D. Webster Foreword and commentary by Tony Berlant Photographs by Hi I lei S. Burger The Peabody Museum holds a remarkable collection of 66 outstanding Pueblo and Navajo textiles donated in the 1980s by William Claflin, Jr., a prominent Boston businessman, avocational anthropologist, and patron of Southwestern archaeology. Claflin bequeathed to the museum not only these beautiful textiles, but also his detailed accounts of their collection histories?a rare record of the individuals who had owned or traded these weavings before they found a home in his private museum. Textile scholar Laurie Webster tells the stories of the weavings as they left their native Southwest and traveled eastward, passing through the hands of such owners and traders as a Ute Indian chief, a New England schoolteacher, a renowned artist, and various military officers and Indian agents. Her concise overview of Navajo and Pueblo weaving traditions is enhanced by the reflections of noted artist and Navajo textile expert Tony Berlant in his foreword to the text. 160 pp., 60 illus., 43 in color, 8" x 81/2" Paper with flaps, ISBN 0-87365-400-5 PAINTED BY A DISTANT HAND Mimbres Pottery of the American Southwest Steven A. LeBlanc Foreword by Rubie Watson Photographs by Hillel S. Burger Highlighting one of the Peabody Museum's most important archaeological expeditions?the excavation of the Swarts Ranch Ruin in southwestern New Mexico by Harriet and Burton Cosgrove in the mid-1920s?Steven LeBlanc's book features rare, never-before-published examples of Mimbres painted pottery, considered by many scholars to be the most unique of all the ancient art traditions of North America. Made between a.D. 1000 and 1150, these pottery bowls and jars depict birds, fish, insects, and mammals that the Mimbres encountered in their daily lives, portray mythical beings, and show humans participating in both ritual and everyday activities. LeBlanc traces the origins of the Mimbres people and what became of them, and also explores our present understanding of what the images mean and what scholars have learned about the Mimbres people in the 75 years since the Cosgroves' expedition. 120 pp., 76 illus., 68 in color, 8" x 81/2" Paper with flaps, ISBN 0-87365-402-1 $21.95 GIFTS OF THE GREAT RIVER Arkansas Effigy Pottery from the Edwin Curtiss Collection John H. House Foreword by Ian W. Brown Photographs by Hillel S. Burger In 1879 Edwin Curtiss set out for the wild St. Francis River region of northeastern Arkansas to collect archaeological specimens for the Peabody Museum. By the time Curtiss completed his fifty-six days of Arkansas fieldwork, he had sent nearly 1,000 pottery vessels to Cambridge and had put the Peabody on the map as the repository of one of the world's finest collections of Mississippian artifacts. John House brings us a lively account of the work of this nineteenth-century fieldworker, the native culture he explored, and the rich legacies left by both. The result is a vivid recreation of the world of Indian peoples in the Mississippi River lowlands in the last centuries before European contact. The volume's focus is Curtiss's collection of charming and expressive effigy vessels: earthenware bowls and bottles that incorporate forms of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians, and humans, including the Peabody's famous red-and-white head vase. 120 pp., 55 illus., 45 in color, 8" x 81/2" Paper with flaps, ISBN 0-87365-401-3 $21.95 $21.95</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN SCHOOL OF PREHISTORIC RESEARCH BULLETINS EXCAVATIONS AT TEPE YAHYA, IRAN, 1967-1975 The Iron Age Settlements Peter Magee C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky General Editor and Project Director With a contribution by Peter Grave and an introduction and project bibliography by C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky Tepe Yahya provides a stratigraphie sequence that stretches some 6,000 years, from the Neolithic period to the early centuries A.D. As a result, the site is critical for understanding cultural processes in southeastern Iran. In this fifth volume of results of the excavations at Tepe Yahya, Peter Magee presents evidence from the Iron Age occupation of the site. Looking beyond the epigraphic and historical data and examining the insights provided by the artifactual record, Magee describes how a small settlement, located some distance from the main centers of power, came into being and was affected by the emergence of the Achaemenid imperial system, which stretched from Pakistan to Libya.

Burger Foreword by James P. Ronda When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led the Corps of Discovery across the American West, they were acting as Thomas Jefferson's diplomatic emissaries to the Native American peoples they encountered along the way. In Arts of Diplomacy, Castle McLaughlin challenges convention al wisdom about the expedition and reveals it as a com plex process of diplomacy, mutual discovery, and exchange. The vehicle for this analysis is the Peabody Museum's "Lewis and Clark collection," a set of magnificent eigh teenth- and early nineteenth-century objects. McLaughlin and a team of anthropologists, art historians, and material culture specialists analyzed these pieces, long thought to be the only surviving ethnographic items acquired by the Corps, and traced their histories from public and private collections to their sources among Native makers and users. With contributions by Native American artists and scholars, the book is a model for how museum collec tions can be used to tell their own vivid stories. Republic.

Stiner A decade of zooarchaeological fieldwork (1992-2001) went into Mary Stiner's pathbreaking analysis of changes in human ecology from the early Mousterian period through the end of Paleolithic cultures in the Levant. Stiner employs a comparative approach to understanding early human behavioral and environmental change, based on a detailed study of fourteen bone assemblages?with associated artifacts and well-preserved hearths?from Hayonim Cave and Meged Rocksheiter in Israel's Galilee. Principally anthropological in outlook, Stiner's analysis also integrates chemistry, foraging and population ecology, vertebrate paleontology, and biogeography. Her research focuses first on the formation history of bone accumulations, and second on questions about the economic behaviors of early humans, including the development of human adaptations for hunting large prey and the relative "footprint" of humans in Pleistocene ecosystems of the Levant.
