<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN FINE ARTS CONSERVATION STEVEN W DYKSTRA ABSTRACT-A formal claim was made in the mid- 20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but con- current debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficul- ty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful per- spectives on the essential nature of art and the auton- omy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. TITRE-L'intention de l'artiste et la tromperie intentionnelle dans la conservation des oeivres d'art. RESUME-Au milieu du 20e siecle, on pretendait que l'objectif de la restauration &amp;tait de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des diff6rences de consid6ration sur les r6les relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interpr&amp;tation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un d6bat s6par6 mais parallele parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques litteraires fut d6clench6 par la publication d'un article brudit intitul6 "The Intentional Fallacy," qui s'opposait a cette r6f6rence aux intentions des artistes et des auteurs dans la critique artistique et litteraire. Dans ce d6bat particulier, la difficult6 de l'6valuation et de l'application de l'intention de l'artiste provenait de l'ambiguite meme du terme "intention." L'auteur examine 11 significations diff6rnetes de ce mot, et il pose le problkme de l'intention de l'artiste dans les contextes lies au domaine de la restauration. En outre, il pr6sente des points de vue plus rec6nts, tir6s des sciences sociales qui associent les problkmes de l'intention de l'artiste ' celui de son r6le dans l'existence continue de l'oeuvre d'art. Les ouvrages des philosophes contemporains apportent des perspectives utiles sur la nature essentielle de l'art et de l'autonomie des oeuvres vis- a-vis de leurs cr6ateurs. L'auteur pense que l'interpr&amp;etation et l'&amp;tude des intentions de l'artiste est une tiche interdisciplinaire, et que son 6valuation dans les contextes de la restauration doit &amp;tre limit6e a la consid6ration des caracteristiques stylistiques particulieres qui d6montrent l'individualite correlative des artistes et de leurs oeuvres.

INTRODUCTION The restoration of fine art, as it is conceived and practiced in the West, is occasionally accompa- nied by controversy. Since the Renaissance, var- ious standards and principles of restoration prac- tice have been proposed and pursued, debated, and revised or discarded by succeeding genera- tions. Among the most prominently debated principles in the 20th century is the claim that the goal of art conservation should be to present the artwork as the artist originally intended it to be seen. This idea emerged informally and anonymously in the late 19th century after advances in scientific analysis raised the possibil- ity of identifying the artist's original materials and distinguishing them from later additions or alterations due to age, nature, accident, or human intervention. It was inevitable that science would be applied to art and art history. Scientific approaches to worldly knowledge found increasing acceptance and recognition in the previous two centuries, and, by the early 19th century, the scientific perspective was formed into a system of philosophy based on the posi- tive data of sense experience. Positivism located the roots of truth and knowledge in positive, observable scientific facts and their relations to each other and to natural law. In reaction, antipositivism arose to proclaim and defend the validity of human experience and human knowledge beyond the analytic reach of scien- tific method. Antipositivists concerned them- selves with the soundness and cogency of expe- rience and knowledge in the personal and social realms, especially in what came to be known as the social sciences. Debate between positivists and antipositivists received the most focused attention in the fields of anthropology and soci- ology. By the end of the 19th century, posi- tivism was so broadly exercised and widespread that national differences in its application to art and art criticism were apparent (Broude 1991). In art history and in the emerging discipline of art conservation, debate about the role and influence of science and scientific technologies became involved with the concept of artist's intent in the National Gallery cleaning contro- versy of the 1940s and 1950s, when a techno- logically defined idea of following the artist's intentions was formalized as a principle of art conservation. Simultaneously, in literary and philosophical circles, the concept of artist's intent became the direct subject of another debate, unrelated to sci- entific and technological considerations. The phrase "intentional fallacy" was coined in the title of an influential scholarly article claiming that artists' intentions are neither available nor desirable as a standard for assessing art. The posi- tion established in "The Intentional Fallacy" JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="3">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 199 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1946) became known as anti-intentionalism. Intentionalists disagreed, arguing that any sense of the artist's intention, however obscure, can be a useful resource in interpreting a work of art. Philosophy is not often a forte of the prag- matic practitioner, concerned with empirical results. Unlike philosophers, historians, and lit- erary critics, art conservators did not separate along intentionalist and anti-intentionalist lines. While other disciplines perceived their specific issues in terms of positivism versus antiposi- tivism and differing theories of art criticism and interpretation, conservators were artificially and superficially separated into two ad hoc schools- aesthetic conservators and scientific conserva- tors. The broader issues became mired in methodological disagreement, and the principle of adherence to the artist's intentions was reduced to a casual tenet of conservation theory. Most of the uncertainty and ambiguity sur- rounding artist's intentions can be directly attributed to the use of the word "intention" when it is applied to artists and their work. The word is tightly tied to subtle and diverse refer- ences to artistic biography and to competing theories of art, creativity, and aesthetics. Unrav- eling the knotted meanings of this word is nec- essary for improved discussion of the idea and its surrounding issues in the field of art conserva- tion. Precise language and a deliberate under- standing of the role of the artist in the artwork allow artist's intent to be carefully compre- hended and applied to art conservation issues in a clear and constructive way. Important contributions to this work come from philosophers working in the field of con- temporary hermeneutics, the specific subdisci- pline of philosophy concerned with the process- es of interpretation, discourse, and humanistic understanding. In the past two decades, this work has shed new light on artistic discourse, the role of the artist, and the fundamental nature of works of art. The nature of art, artist's inten- tions, theory of the text, and theory of the work are all vital topics in contemporary hermeneutics. 2. MATERIAL MORTALITY: THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM Artists' intentions can have various levels of complexity and reference, but conservators quickly recognize a familiar problem at the root of the surrounding issues. Time, grime, and mishap always create conditions that obscure, alter, or destroy the character of the artist's orig- inal work. Paints dry, crack, and flake; canvases sag; and panels split. Organic colorants may fade to translucence, and metallic pigments can oxi- dize from red and green to black and brown. Additionally, one or more restorers may have had a hand in the artwork by reinterpreting or attempting to reveal, repair, or replace what the artist created, often with temporary effect. Eter- nally durable and changeless materials are unavailable to artists and conservators alike. Natural processes and physical conditions even- tually alter the attributes of materials that suc- ceed under the artist's hand or in the conserva- tor's studio. Conservators know how difficult it can be to predict or control these alterations, and it makes for wary work. Regardless of the artist's clarity of purpose, all his or her material deter- minations are subject to physical damage, decline, and decay. Artistic achievements are not and cannot be fixed forever in the final physical result of artists' creative work. Recent analytic research in art conservation makes the temporality of artists' materials painfully apparent. A work of art that is care- fully protected from grime, environmental and mechanical stress, mishap, and restoration is nonetheless subject to chemical decomposition. Changes in materials begin in the first instant of their use. Depending on the artist's choices, changes may be rapid or slow, but usually chem- ical change becomes apparent within a quarter century. Georges Seurat's La Grandejatte (1884-86,Art Institute of Chicago) lost its initial luminous charm within five years. Its yellow, orange, and green pigments were quick to decay into more stable, less colorful chemical compounds (Fiedler JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="4">200 STEVEN W DYKSTRA 1984). Albert Pinkham Ryder's incessant reworking with mixtures of varnish and paint was driven, in part, by quickly fading artistic effects (Svoboda and Van Vooren 1989). Until his death, Ryder struggled with the appearance of The Tempest (1890s and later, Detroit Institute of Arts), first exhibited to the public more than 25 years earlier. Today, many of his paintings have deteriorated almost beyond recognition. Twentieth-century art is not exempt from this effect. Joseph Albers's meticulously chosen and applied paints exhibit differing types and rates of deterioration within the same painting (Garland 1983). Mark Rothko mixed his paint for the Houston chapel to achieve a special paint sur- face quality that proved to be exceptionally short lived (Mancusi-Ungaro 1981). Some contemporary artists consciously disre- gard the quick mortality of the media they select, suggesting that permanence is irrelevant to their work. Jasper Johns once joked that he would be a richer man if he were the conserva- tor of his encaustic paintings instead of their cre- ator (quoted in Wyer 1988, 46). Robert Rauschenberg said, "Art has risk built into it... I don't consider any material unavailable to me" (quoted in Wyer 1988, 46). Anselm Kiefer's works that include straw on the surface deterio- rate so readily that debris was reported to accu- mulate on an exhibition hall floor between reg- ular sweepings (Wyer 1988, 48). The technical impossibility of stopping the deterioration of an artist's initial creation is clearly understood today. In the face of desper- ate problems, lighthearted conservators may playfully wish for frigid, lightless, airless storage vaults, perhaps deep in caves on the dark side of the moon! Equally playful is the futuristic hypothesis that molecularly exact reproductions could substitute for artists' deteriorated origi- nals. There is a note of ironic humor in the real- ization that the next generation of conservators would meet the deferred problems again when faced with conservation of the replica. Because physical artworks are the primary grounds for representing artist's intentions, a paradox occurs: physical materials decay, but artists' purposes, aims, goals, and objectives exist in a psychological arena where they do not decompose or deteriorate. Eventually and inevitably artists' materials lose fidelity in their allegiance and attachment to artist's intentions. Recognition of physical decay or damage invites questions about the materials' reference to the artist's intent. These questions can be surpris- ingly varied and complex, and there are equally various and complicated ways of attempting to answer them. 3. POSITIVISM AND THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS Beginning in the later 19th century, science and the scientific method were introduced into the mix of crafts and techniques used by serious art restorers. Scientific advances and refinements in scientific method opened the possibility of uni- form and analytic approaches to restoration problems and processes. The use of scientific procedures promised relief from confusion and criticism caused by idiosyncratic or arbitrary restoration practices in the past. An emphasis on preservation and the use of knowledge in the physical and chemical sciences eventually came to distinguish the new discipline of art conser- vation from the older trade of restoration. Applied to art and art conservation, positivism implied that aesthetic and art historical appre- hension had to be acquired candidly through the senses and be based on frank observation and experiment. In the positivist's view, intuitions, impressions, insights, suppositions, feelings, and the like are questionable and uncertain ways of understanding. "Positive" knowledge depends on empirical science (Broude 1991, 114). By the time the first American conservation laboratory was established at the Fogg Art Muse- um in 1928, it was simply accepted that the nat- ural sciences were the model and method for describing the standards by which artworks would be restored and maintained. Art conser- vation was understood to be a matter of chem- JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="5">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 201 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION istry, physics, and mechanics, and it was the responsibility of professional practitioners, working under strict guidelines based on a solid scientific foundation (Stout 1948, vi-vii). Although science became an indispensable part of the conservator's training and perspec- tive, it could not become an exclusive approach. Science provided the means for developing technologies, detecting significant facts, and matching them to theory. In practice, it could describe reliable means for achieving certain ends, but it could not decide the suitability of those ends or justify them by scientific virtue alone. Instead there was a belief that the author- ity of science and scientific technologies would complement the art of restoration and lend it the type of credibility that was carved out in the natural sciences. There was confidence that a measure of scientific objectivity would dispel any perceptions of art restoration as an entirely interpretive and unrestrained process. Scientific foundations notwithstanding, con- troversy embroiled the young discipline of art conservation just as it had plagued earlier means and manners of restoration. In 1947, the National Gallery, London, held a special exhibi- tion of newly cleaned paintings, partly to demonstrate the results of serious scientific con- servation. Reactions to this exhibition were not universally favorable. Contrary and inflamed opinions were expressed by the general public in letters to the Times and the Sunday Telegraph. In addition to the public tumult, some distin- guished art historians and respected critics also disputed the cleaning results. Many of the most rational and scholarly arguments were eventu- ally presented in the pages of Burlington Maga- zine. Three months after the exhibition's open- ing, Burlington editors commented: Though our most serious quarrel is with those who maintain that the national pictures have been damaged, we still cling to the suspicion, which even this most reassuring Exhibition cannot entirely dispel, that the responsible authorities set too much store by science, and too little by that capricious barome- ter registering sensibility (Burlington Mag- azine 1947). Helmut Ruhemann, the gallery's director of conservation, was a strong supporter of a posi- tivist approach. In response to demands and questions from an independent board of inquiry, conservators at the National Gallery referred to technical evidence and scientific analysis done during the treatments to argue that historical speculation and metaphysical clutter had created misconceptions about the true appearance of old paintings. Ruhemann and the positivist conservators firmly believed that scientific observation, study, and experimentation validat- ed systematic art conservation technologies and that consistent application of these technologies accurately exposed, preserved, and truthfully presented the materials originally laid down by the artist. In this way, the intentions of the artist were served equitably, without interpretive dis- tortion. Ruhemann and his supporters defined and defended their position by appealing to the artist's intentions as an authoritative principle. Conservators from the National Gallery claimed: "It is presumed to be beyond dispute that the aim of those entrusted with the care of paintings is to present them as nearly as possible in the state in which the artist intended them to be seen" (MacLaren and Werner 1950, 189). In its most dogmatic form, this claim implied that all artifacts of aging and all previous retouching should be removed or remedied to the extent technologically possible without harming or obscuring the remaining original paint. The conservator's job was "to preserve and show to its best advantage every original particle remaining of a painting," and in so doing he or she should be "guided by the mas- ter's intention" (Ruhemann 1963, 202). This technologically driven program for fol- lowing the artist's intentions was supposed to represent an objective, noninterpretive approach to restoration. It was questioned by conservators JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="6">202 STEVEN W DYKSTRA and art historians with antipositivist leanings who insisted that artistic, aesthetic, and historical considerations were not receiving enough atten- tion in a narrow and insensitive conception of conservation goals. Cesare Brandi, head of the Instituto del Restauro in Rome, told attendees at the 1948 International Council of Museums meeting in Paris, "We may often find ourselves in closer touch with the mind of the artist by leaving the picture with its patina than by removing it" (1949, 188). Paul Coremans of the Courtauld Institute defended the cleaning of a Rubens in the 1947 exhibition but admitted, "I do not claim to have exhausted the subject, especially since my argument is confined to chemical, physical, and technical considerations, and since the cleaning of old pictures should at the same time be judged in the light of aesthe- tic criteria" (1948, 261). In reaction to Ruhemann's 1961 publication of a positivist approach to Leonardo DaVinci's use of sfumato, art historian Ernst Gombrich revisited the issues raised by the 1947 exhibition and became leader of the antipositivist opposi- tion with a claim that strictly technical approaches to conservation treatment yielded paintings whose condition and appearance were newly artificial and alien to any human memo- ry or recollection (Gombrich 1962). Art histor- ical understanding and connoisseurship should control the course of conservation treatment, he argued. New appearances should not be discov- ered or determined by technical methods alone. Gombrich and his supporters insisted that paint- ings should be restored with a comparative and discerning eye toward their faded colors, their characteristic patina, and inevitable decay. They claimed that prudent aesthetic and historical interpretations should have precedence over technologically determined expositions. The National Gallery cleaning controversy, which also became known as the Ruhemann- Gombrich debate, revolved around issues of artist's intentions. Both camps invoked these issues in their arguments (Carrier 1985, 291-92). On Gombrich's side, the general claim was that a technologically driven approach does not necessarily respect artistic or historical con- sideration of an artist's work (Gombrich 1963). Argument from historical research asserted that certain Old Masters anticipated the aging of their work, intending them to darken and fade (Kurz 1962, 1963). Connoisseurship and aes- thetic observation suggested that purposeful artistic effects, perhaps the use of tinted varnish- es and glazes, were not recognized by positivist methods and techniques (Rees-Jones 1962). Additionally, paintings change in time, Gom- brich and his supporters argued, and in a way that is not retractable; they cannot be returned to their original order and state as they appeared in the hands of their makers. Referring indi- rectly to the cleaning of Titian's Virgin and Child with Saints John &amp; Catherine, Gombrich remarked, "One should have thought it is com- mon ground that Titian is dead and that we can- not ask him what his intention was" (Gombrich 1962, 54). The National Gallery cleaning con- troversy deflated somewhat after Ruhemann's camp contrived a mocking pun accusing Gom- brich and followers of fascination with "dirty" pictures (Walden 1985, 118). In 1977, a similar controversy erupted at the National Gallery of Art in Washington over the cleaning of paintings, especially one attributed to Rembrandt. By this time, the differences between positivist and antipositivist approaches divided the art conservation profession into sci- entific and aesthetic camps, at least in the per- ception of the communications media and its public (Hochfield 1976, 1978). John Brealey, conservator at the Metropolitan Museum ofArt, was cast to represent the aesthetic antipositivist approach (Tompkins 1987): "What we don't do here is try to make believe the whole thing is scientific, wear white coats and use Formica tables and pretend we're dealing with absolutes" (quoted in Glueck 1980). Scientific or purist conservators were less willing to entertain media attention. Their research, techniques, and analy- ses were supported by publication in technical and professional journals, and when invited to JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="7">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 203 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION counter their antagonists and critics, they often chose to remain nameless (McGill 1987). Although their rhetoric was adamant and their arguments were sound, aesthetic conservators could not reduce the power and status of the sci- entific approach. The personal authority of individual erudition was essential to the aes- thetic conservators' position. Its personal source and subjective premises did not hold against the impersonal authority of science. The controversy and debate between conser- vators refocused and intensified the uncomfort- able atmosphere of ad hominem argument that has surrounded restoration issues for centuries. Titian, for instance, restored several masterpieces in his day and employed a personal insult to crit- icize Sebastiano del Piombo's retouching of the famous rooms at the Vatican, originally painted by Raphael (Dolce [1577] 1970, 22-23). Eugene Delacroix claimed that restoration was vandalism perpetrated by miserable daubers who destroyed artworks by usurping the place of real artists, substituting new work for the originals (1948, 104). Speaking of the individual erudi- tion necessary for the aesthetic conservator's work, one conservator remarked: [There] is an implicit tendency for the method to create prima donna restorers, who, as they are actively changing old masters, must lay claim to great sensitiv- ity and a highly perceptive eye. This can lead to futile discussions since, to disagree with an individual of such capacities, simply confirms your own lack of those qualities (Hedley 1985, 19). Conservators, art historians, and critics with less polemical responses to controversy avoided the sharpened horns of this dilemma between scientific and aesthetic methods. Many believed that scientific authority and art historical weight can often be balanced in conservation work. Another conservator recalled Erwin Panofsky's tribute to Paul Coremans, who "more than any- one else encouraged the art historical lamb to dwell with the scientific wolf," quoting Core- mans's words: We intend to grant an equal importance to the elements of appreciation in the areas historic, aesthetic, scientific and technical. We believe, in effect, that it is erroneous and baneful to raise a barrier between knowledge called scientific, the result of observation and of the interpre- tation of the facts, and the knowledge called intuitive, born from contempla- tion. We have, on the contrary, the con- viction that only their association, their interpenetration, always in a more pro- found way, will permit us to progress towards treatments ever more effective and more respectful of the objects (quoted in Weil 1984, 91). In the long lingering aftermath of the National Gallery cleaning controversy, it eventu- ally became clear that the positivist postulation about serving the artist's intentions was hollow. A strict, technologically driven approach achieved only a scientifically bona fide presenta- tion of authentic material-a presentation that did not necessarily reveal the artist's original cre- ation, support conventions of connoisseurship, or fulfill art historical research and precedent. 4. THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY: INTENTIONALISM VS. ANTI-INTENTIONALISM Mid-century debate among conservators and art historians about standards, principles, and the artist's intent was contemporaneous with a par- allel debate in literary and philosophical circles. However, there was little if any crossover on this subject between the art conservation profession and the disciplines of art criticism, literary criti- cism, and the philosophy of art. In these other disciplines, discourse on the intentions of artists and authors and intentionality in general were less polemical, more orderly, and more prolific. JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="8">204 STEVEN W DYKSTRA A debate between intentionalists and anti-inten- tionalists was inspired by Wimsatt and Beards- ley's essay, "The Intentional Fallacy," appearing in the Sewanee Review (1946). This debate ulti- mately arrived at the description of many subtle conceptual differences packed into the seem- ingly simple abstraction "intent." The word and its exact reference in a given context became a subject and a problem in itself. The intentional fallacy is not an error of for- mal logic like the circular argument or begging the question. Instead, it represents the claim that artist's intent is neither available nor desirable as a standard for assessing artistic works: mistaken justification occurs when readers or beholders attribute scientific, critical, or historical interpre- tations to the mentality of the author or artist. This justification appears mistaken because these interpretations have sources that are several steps removed from the artist's thought. Only the work was directly created by the artist, not the interpretations derived from it by beholders. The intentional fallacy applies when critics, his- torians, or conservators associate their analyses and interpretations with the artist's work and equate their conclusions with the artist's aims. Simply stated, the intentional fallacy insists that our interpretations are our own and we are mis- taken if we identify them with the artist instead of ourselves. Wimsatt and Beardsley's article framed the topic of artist's intent in a way that provoked dis- cussions and invited critiques. In the following years, a number of scholarly articles were pub- lished drawing examples to support or contra- dict its application to specific literary and artis- tic cases. Controversy, confusion, and excite- ment grew and the intentional fallacy gained a certain notoriety as a burdensome stumbling block in art and literary criticism. Within a decade, the proliferation of commentators on this topic led to the organization of a sympo- sium on "Intention and Interpretation in Art" at the annual meeting of the American Philosoph- ical Association, Eastern Division, in 1955. The purpose of the symposium was to air and clari- fy intentionalist and anti-intentionalist views. Anti-intentionalists argued that the relevance of the artist's intent is found only in the artwork, not in the inner workings of the artist's psyche. If the artist's intentions are carried out success- fully, the artwork shows what the artist was try- ing to do. If the artist did not accomplish what was intended, the unrealized intentions remain undisclosed in that work. To attempt to find intentions elsewhere is to move away from the work at hand in pursuit of psychological specu- lations that have nothing to do with the aesthet- ic features of the work itself (Hungerland 1955). Intentionalists countered that artists' personal- ities, intellectual approaches, psychological stances, and creative attitudes all affect the dispo- sition of the artworks they create. Awareness of these factors shapes our perspective when we wish to make critical or analytic interpretations. These considerations do not take us away from the artwork, but rather they bring it closer. If their influence is denied or refused, our resources for interpretation are desperately impoverished (Aiken 1955). In the philosopher's language, Ruhemann and the other conservation positivists were anti- intentionalists who found their guiding evi- dence in the artwork alone. The approach espoused by Gombrich and his followers char- acterized them as intentionalists in their insis- tence that artistic, aesthetic, and historical inter- pretations must also be considered in conserva- tion work. During and after the symposium, it was wide- ly acknowledged on both sides that the debate was vexed by words and phrases that frequently proved to have indefinite references to different facets or aspects of intent. Part of the problem was precision-talking about the same thing in arguments about artist's intent. Careful and extensive explanation was necessary to make it clear exactly what about artist's intentions was under discussion. The emphasis of debate among philosophers, historians, and critics shift- ed to the identification and description of vari- ous conceptual differences within the broader JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="9">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 205 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION abstraction of "artist's intent." 5. VARIATIONS OF MEANING OF ARTISTIC INTENT In "Criticism and the Problem of Intention," Richard Kuhns (1960) identifies 11 distinct variations of meaning carried by the term "intent" when it refers to artists and their work. Discussion in the following subsections will put the 11 meanings in the context of art conserva- tion, demonstrating that talk about artist's inten- tions may refer to artistic biography or to com- peting theories of creativity and aesthetics. Additionally, artist's intentions can be confused with effects that artworks create on their own. In conservation contexts, the different meanings associated with artist's intent frame important questions about the concepts involved and their applicability to conservation work. Kuhns first addresses the idea that artists aim at a result, separating it into four different senses related to artists' motives and differing theories about the nature of creativity. Discussed in sec- tions 5.1-4, these four senses of intent-bio- graphical motives, aims vs. outcomes, expression in media, and inherent creative spirit-provide distinct perspectives on creativity and the artist's purposes, and they raise important questions about setting conservation goals: Can only one of these perspectives be applied to every case? Can we agree on how to draw from these dif- ferent perspectives and apply them to each case? What general assumptions do we make about artistic motivations and creative processes, and how do they affect our preconceptions when we discuss artist's intent? Kuhns next considers the artist's intention as the conveying of a meaning and divides it into three senses of communication, articulation, and expression, discussed in sections 5.5-7. These three perspectives on the artist's intended mean- ings view art as an instance of discourse-an occasion when somehow, something is commu- nicated to someone. Kuhns's analysis is con- cerned with distinguishing and identifying vari- ous senses of intention and not with the conser- vator's need for useful explanation. It remains unclear how these types of communications are constituted and what they entail. From the con- servator's viewpoint, these are the deepest ques- tions about artist's intent and the intentional fal- lacy: What are the qualities and meanings in fine art that are most clearly attributable to the artist, and how do they come from the artist into our awareness? What can we know of the artist's intent, its importance, and the process of its communication to us? Recent work by hermeneutical philosophers to open this vein of questioning is discussed in section 6, "The Role of the Artist." Kuhns continues his analysis by observing that the term "intention" is sometimes used in reference to an artwork's overall effect. He describes three senses in which a work of art is seen as an active, intentional presence-its aes- thetic expression, its appeal for reference and characterization, and its aesthetic agency-and relates them to differing art theories, discussed in sections 5.8-10. Kuhns associates the last and otherwise unrelated sense of artist's intent with ideas about the moral justification of art, dis- cussed in section 5.11. These final segments of the analysis suggest that the apparent agency of an artwork itself can be confused with the artist's intent. Kuhns concludes that the various usages of "intention" show how misleading it is to speak in simple terms about artist's intentions or the intentional fallacy. For the conservator, Kuhns's analysis indexes the broad spectrum of approaches and issues involved with artist's intent. 5.1 BIOGRAPHICAL MOTIVES Ulterior motives can be found for any artist's creative work. He or she may be seeking fame or profit or competitive success in the creation of an artwork. The satisfaction of patrons, emo- tional catharsis, and the desire to establish or contribute to a body of related work are typi- cally cited as germinal artists' intentions. These JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="10">206 STEVEN W DYKSTRA first aspects of the artist's aims are primarily bio- graphical. When curators, critics, and art histo- rians approach an artwork with this perspective on artists' intentions, they are motivated by the desire to find evidence of artistic, social, political, economic, or perhaps romantic influences in the artist's life. These influences relate to artists' per- sonal circumstances and careers. However, to equate an artist's work with his or her life is to see the work and the life as a single "object" (Kris 1952). When confronted with the physi- cal nature of the work of art, the conservator is likely to find that the artist's life and career are parenthetical to the specific characteristics of his or her particular creative products. 5.2 AIMS VS. OUTCOMES When we think that the artist aims at a cer- tain result, we may be thinking that the artist conceives the work in his or her head and is confronted with the problem of realizing it in a chosen medium. This way of thinking divides artistic creativity into two parts: purely technical skill with media follows a purely mental formu- lation of the work. The creative plan and pur- pose behind a work of art are considered sepa- rately and distinctly from artistic expertise and the efficacy of media. The evaluation and con- servation of a work of art will require an assess- ment of how well the artist accomplished what he or she set out to do. If this perspective on creativity is adopted, pentimenti in a painting may be seen as disfig- urements that distract from the design and pur- pose of the artist's creative conception. They are technical errors or media defects that were inad- equately concealed by the artist or revealed later by material deterioration. It is seldom clear that faded color, cracking, loss of structural integrity, and other normal effects of age and decay cor- relate with an artist's original aims and concep- tions. Any technical flaw or unanticipated result is a shortcoming not in accord with the artist's original intent. In conservation treatment, this conception of the artist's intent may be used to justify a call for compensation of all damages and artifacts of aging, whether caused by the artist's choice and use of materials and by natural dete- rioration or by accidents of later circumstance. Although some conservation treatments may successfully re-create or preserve a "like new" appearance, it is often impossible to reach for an ageless and flawless representation of the artist's initial conception. 5.3 EXPRESSION IN MEDIA In another conception of artistic creativity, the artist is allowed a degree of suspense between aiming at a specific effect and finding its precise expression in the medium. The char- acteristics of the chosen media are thought to influence the development and realization of the artist's creative idea. Under this theory, the medium has something like a franchise on the artist's aims, granted by the artist when they were invested into material form. In this perspective, a pentimento becomes an incidental disclosure that reveals the course of the artist's creative effort. As a coincidental fea- ture of a painting, curators and conservators might treat it as a disfigurement, subject to a degree of retouching. Or the pentimento could be accepted as a casually significant happen- stance and left as it appears. This way of think- ing about creativity and intent encourages a belief that the artist's true intentions for the work can be picked out from the interference caused by changes in the condition of the media. With this idea in mind, curators and conservators set treatment goals that seek to combine preservation with a lasting balance between compensation for loss and damage and the frank presentation of aged or deteriorated artist's materials. Adoption of this perspective implies that critics and conservators will make judgments regarding the extent or degree to which the condition of the media represents the artist's creative intent. Tradition and practicality seem to determine how this approach is applied. Traditionally in JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="11">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 207 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION older artworks, some varieties of deterioration are commonly accepted despite their deviation from the artist's original conception while other instances of decay within the same work are not. In baroque painting, especially landscapes, there is a tendency to concede the appearance of brown paints that we know were originally green, but the pale transparent hues of paints once tinted with fugitive red lakes immediately suggest color reinforcement. In practice, the desire to keep compensation to a minimum tends to allow only the most efficient efforts to unveil aspects of the artist's intent. In the baroque paintings, there is compelling economy of treatment in a decision to touch up red accents and leave browned landscape back- grounds alone. 5.4 INHERENT CREATIVE SPIRIT Another conception of artistic creativity maintains that artists have intentions that are broadly purposive, not just specifically purpose- ful in the same sense as the previous two cases. Artistic creativity appears as a personal quality, like fertility, and artworks are produced when creative persons consort with governable mate- rials. In the creative moment, artistic spirit and physical substance merge and incorporate. From this perspective, artists and their media share equal responsibility for bringing forth their aims and inclinations. With this approach to artist's intent and cre- ativity in mind, curators, critics, art historians, and conservators view the choice, use, and phys- ical characteristics of the artist's materials to have significance equal to the artistic effectiveness of their control. Ideas about intent are focused on the artist's creative participation with the media. In painting, the concept of pentimenti becomes irrelevant. All the paint has equal importance and authority in any effect, whatever layer, whether carefully contrived or haphazardly applied. Conservation plans and treatment goals will prioritize preservation, protection from cir- cumstantial damage, and the retardation of decay. Only the most disfiguring losses due to insult or accident become candidates for com- pensation. Modern and contemporary art attracts this perspective on artistic work because it offers a liberal perspective on artistic purpose and accepts virtually anything into the realm of artist's materials. Living contemporary artists apply this perspective to their own efforts when they emphasize the importance of their partic- ipation with media and their freedom to choose materials. In a distorted adaptation, this empha- sis can suggest that the chosen materials have extraneous characteristics not pertaining to the artist's endeavors and accomplishments. When the artist's intent is defined by partic- ipation with materials, it is subject to their fate. A hallmark of this perspective is the belief that the artist's participation is necessary for genuine compensation. In the absence of the artist, a decision for compensation admits a need for pretense because the critical element of the artist's participation is lacking. Any damage or loss could be deemed fundamentally beyond compensation because a piece of the artist's original participation is distorted or missing. 5.5 THE ARTIST'S SPEAKING In thinking that the artist aims at a certain result, we may be thinking of meanings that the artist wishes to convey. In one sense, artists are interlocutors who say something to beholders through their work. This way of thinking about the artist's intended meaning makes an analogy between artwork and language, specifically liter- ature, where a text may be thought to be a form of the author's speaking. In the philosophy of literary criticism and interpretation, this assump- tion is highly questionable because texts can draw their voices and meanings from realms outside the author's personal domain. Literary works appear in the medium of written lan- guage, but a work of fine art, although it may be considered a text of some kind, is not a work of language. JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="12">208 STEVEN W. DYKSTRA In this way of thinking about artist's intent, language metaphors are common. We may want to "hear" or "read" what the artist is "saying" to us, but we are forced to discuss the perceived messages in our own words. For conservators, critics, and art historians, the intentional fallacy clearly comes into play when we use our own perceptions and phrases to put the artist's mean- ings into words-meanings that are, by nature, unspoken in the work of art. 5.6 THE ARTIST'S TELLING In another sense of conveyed meaning, artists are prime beholders uniquely situated to be ideal interpreters of the meaning that their work conveys. The artist is an expositor of the work rather than an interlocutor. The situation of the previous sense is strangely reversed. The artwork itself expresses something, but it is the artist who tells beholders what he or she means it to say. Contemporary art lends itself to this approach in the form of consultation with living artists. A typical example of the methodology is provided by Davenport (1995), who reports the results of treatment-specific consultations, artist inter- views, and artists' written responses to a ques- tionnaire. Davenport acknowledges that com- peting theories of art and creativity can deter- mine how much authority is given to artists for interpreting and explaining their work. Results from eight artists show that they embrace or decline this authority idiosyncratically, with sub- stantive vacillation in their individual replies. The following excerpts illustrate the range of variation. Adrian Piper: "I don't feel that I have privileged access to the ultimate meaning of my work. I think that is determined by social con- text and history and so forth" (quoted in Dav- enport 1995, 46). Petah Coyne: "There's a per- iod when I'm connected with a piece, at least four or five years. Then at a certain point you become almost in awe of it, and you don't know how you could get back into that flow" (p. 50). Fred Sandback: "Who should be the primary source of determining how a work should look over time? Well, sure, I should be. This is my game and I want it played my way. But the question becomes interesting as I begin to fade out of the picture" (p. 51). Investigations like Davenport's make it clear that there is no con- sensus among living artists regarding any status as privileged or ideal expositors of their work. There is an obvious proprietary element in the relationship between artists and their work, and there are statutory laws about copyright and authorship that protect artists' interests in this respect. However, artists' rights are difficult to apply to the meaning or the interpretation of their work. Psychological properties, moods, and meanings that the artist wishes to convey or explain are not fixed or objective. The artist's personal internal states and understandings are subjective, and to be shared they must be appre- hended and recognized subjectively by each individual beholder. When artists choose to dictate the meaning, sense, and import of their work, they assume the burden of proof in defending their assertions. Their choice and use of media may fail to sup- port their aspirations or cease to sustain their immediate achievements. History may reveal unrecognized circumstances or uncover surpris- ing horizons. Beholders can judge the artist's claims against their own apprehension and choose how much to be convinced of the artist's credibility in his or her stated purposes. A deci- sion to grant artists superior authority about the disposition, meaning, and purpose of their work diminishes or denies the relative roles played by their media, by art historical contexts, and by beholders' apprehensions. Conservators, art his- torians, and critics are not obliged to take the artist's assertions or explanations without question. 5.7 THE ARTIST'S EXPRESSIVE CHARACTER Another way of thinking about how an artist's meanings and purposes are conveyed considers his or her work to represent an expressive sys- tem. This approach maintains that artists' per- JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="13">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 209 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION sonalities and worldviews are reflected by their work and represented in it. The mind behind the work is a necessary part of the work. We recognize artists' expressive systems or individual styles in the same way that we recognize and categorize people's personalities and attitudes through their body language and manner of speech. Seemingly anthropomorphic remarks associating attributes of an artwork with the mood or personality of its artist usually come from this perspective. Claims that Vincent van Gogh's work expresses agitation or that Jan Ver- meer's work expresses serenity rely on this view. Personal intuition, psychological insight, and sympathetic understanding all play a part in rec- ognizing the artist's expressive character or style. However, recognition is not the primary prob- lem faced by the conservator concerned with the physical work of art. To make decisions about compensation and the treatment of mate- rial decay that are sensitive to the artist's expres- sive character, it is necessary to understand the scope and function of this "mind behind the work." For conservators, the deepest underlying questions about artist's intent are concerned with its scope and function and ask for clarifica- tion of the role of the artist in the artwork. 5.8 THE ARTWORK'S AESTHETIC EXPRESSION In art-related discussion, it is sometimes said that the artwork itself exhibits an intention, related by Kuhns to organicist, Gestalt, and ide- alist theories of art. In a variety of common contexts, intentions of the artwork can be con- fused with artist's intent. These next three per- spectives on intention in art demonstrate how and why attributes of art itself are accidentally ascribed to artists. In the first of these theoretical perspectives, the work of art is seen as a purposive organic whole. It encompasses a complex but necessary interrelationship of parts, similar to that in living things. Like an organism, it is a kind of individ- ual, and as a singular entity, it seems to be com- posed for some end. It embodies some knowl- edge or truth or meaning it aims to express. Kuhns (1960, 9) quotes the observation from Immanuel Kant's Critique ofJudgment (1790) that we can make the fundamental nature of art intelligible to ourselves only by postulating a source of will and purpose. Objectively, an art- work is an inanimate thing, but there is an over- whelming tendency to find an expressive entity within it. Artist's intent has a reflexive relation- ship with the nature of art. This approach to art interpretation has little direct bearing on art conservation except to suggest the difficulty of distinguishing the artist's part from the whole of art. As an older theoretical approach, this perspec- tive on art reflects the contemporary hermeneu- tical idea that a work of art is a potential event of discourse, dependent upon a beholder to hap- pen (Gadamer 1975; Ricoeur 1981). When beholders bring their receptive tendencies to art, communication occurs. Because beholders are necessary to realize and fulfill an artwork's exis- tence, comprehensive conservation measures will enhance access to it. This is why a cave on the dark side of the moon is not an appropriate answer to the desperate preservation needs of the most fragile works of art. 5.9 THE ARTWORK'S APPEAL FOR REF- ERENCE AND CHARACTERIZATION In Kuhns's application of Gestalt art theory, a work of art may be thought to have an intention because it makes analytic demands. It makes a claim on its beholders by inviting or asking for characterization and classification. The power of an artwork to make an appeal for relevance is determined by its ability to point to some reali- ty common to a beholder and itself (Gadamer 1975; Ricoeur 1981). For the conservator and art historian, the artwork's demand for a com- mon ground of reference can be dangerously seductive. Han van Meegeren's forgedVermeers, for example, had a 1930s and 1940s look, including a near-likeness of Marlene Dietrich JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="14">210 STEVEN W DYKSTRA unquestioned by many experts at that time (Walden 1985). The situation of the experts who accepted van Meegeren's Vermeers was similar to that of Professor Hauser of Berlin, who in 1911 restored the painting once popularly known as Rembrandt's Mill. When The Mill (now in the National Gallery of Art) was purchased in Eng- land by the American collector P.A.B. Widener, his dealer sent the famous painting to Hauser before importing it to the United States. Like most turn-of-the-century restorers, critics, and art historians, Hauser had definite preconcep- tions about how Rembrandt paintings should look. It was understood that Hauser would improve the painting's condition by making it conform to the appearance of many other paint- ings that shared broad attributions to Rem- brandt in that period (Wheelock 1977). In a broader sense, historical periods, aesthet- ic styles, and genres of art have purposes that go beyond those of individual artists. Panofsky uses the term "intention" in this way in connection with his thesis that each historical period in Western civilization had its own special out- looks, assumptions, attitudes, and concerns. For example, he maintains that the development of perspective in the painting of the Middle Ages was intended to situate previously unconnected images in a unifying context (Panofsky [1927] 1991). Baxandall specifies this meaning of intention in art (1985, 41-73), using specific artists' works to illustrate the sense in which intention refers to "a picture's relation to its cir- cumstances" (p. 72). The various purposes of period, cultural style, and genre are easily equat- ed with artists' individual efforts. 5.10 THE ARTWORK'S AESTHETIC AGENCY In its reference to Kuhns's analysis, idealist art theory maintains that a work of art in itself pos- sesses the means and ability to act toward partic- ular effects. For theologically inclined idealists, this quality may represent a metaphysical power or the presence of divine will or inspiration. Ritual or religious works may be thought to possess specific qualities in this respect. Beyond spiritual effects, works of art are also credited with emotional effects, psychological effects, social and political effects, and in more material- istic senses, optical, visual, and simply decorative, ornamental effects. This is the most common and least specific reference of the term "inten- tion" when applied to works of art. In this sense we say that an artwork is meant to be dis- played or seen in one way or another-that it "works" better in a certain light, on a pedestal, in a period frame, or in a particular interpretive environment or setting. Taken collectively, the overall effects created by a particular work of art denote its aesthetic intentions. The highly variable nature of the effects created by a single artwork suggest the difficulty of discussing its aesthetic intention in an exacting way. In a section of Kuhns's essay following the completion of his analysis, he works toward an improved definition of the art- work's intention by offering the concept of "focal effect" to summarize the most constant and sustained of the many and variable effects created by an individual work of art. Kuhns's attempt to reconsider and rehabilitate notions of intention is weakened because he does not use the term "aesthetic intention" to refer to the intentions of a work of art. Instead, in a few potentially ambiguous passages he refers to the intent of the artwork as "artistic inten- tion." Consider the confusion created in this para- graph about the subject matter of art criticism: However, we are concerned with the intention of the work in the proper artis- tic sense of intention: what the work sus- tains as a certain kind of experience, its focal effect. The artistic intention may or may not be what the maker was aiming at. His intention, psychologically speak- ing, may have been quite different from what the work effects. But it is the artis- tic intention that matters for criticism. It JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="15">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 211 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION may be that the intention of the work is what the maker would inevitably effect with his handling of the medium because of social and cultural factors, but this, too, is extraneous to criticism (Kuhns 1960, 22). Dictionaries support the reference of "artis- tic" to both art and artists, while references of "aesthetic" are given to the theory and philoso- phy of art and beauty, beauty itself, and people's sensitivity to art and beauty. In our ordinary language, all of an artwork's different effects can be called either aesthetic effects or artistic effects. The potential for ambiguity and confu- sion in Kuhns's paragraph demonstrates that we have no universal, commonly understood habit of language for distinguishing between our aes- thetic impressions of meaning, grace, and qual- ity and our appreciation of the artistic skills, techniques, and mastery that create them. How- ever, this distinction is critical in art professional discourse. When we wish to turn our attention strictly to artist's actions, deeds, and efforts, our references to artist's intent need to be clearly and consistently defined. Careless or confused attri- bution of an artwork's focal effects to the artist instead of the work is one of the greatest pitfalls in discussing artist's intent. In any discussion of the artist's intent, as con- servators we should be clear whether we are talking about artistic characteristics, the strategy and facility of the artist's work, or aesthetic char- acteristics, the meaning and beauty that may emerge from effects created by a work of art. A helpful clarification comes with an analogy between the artist and a puppeteer: hand motions, pulling of strings, and other technical tricks of puppetry are more easily distinguished from the evocative nature and drama of the pup- pet's dance. If we consistently and specifically use the word "artistic" to be indicative of artists, and not of art in general, our use of the word "aesthetic" will be strengthened in its reference to the effects of artworks themselves. Failure to make this distinction is the most frequent cause of ambiguous or inexact references when issues of intent are raised. 5.11 MORAL EFFECT OF THE ARTWORK Kuhns finds one last sense of intention in art, which does not fit into any of the previous cat- egories or examples. In this sense, a work of art in all its artistic and aesthetic qualities is subject to evaluation of what it ought to do or be. It has an intention in that it exhibits moral and intel- lectual content. The purpose, meaning, and value of an artwork are judged by the end it achieves and/or the ends for which it may have been created. In the case of Robert Map- plethorpe's Self-Portrait, 1978 (1978, estate of Robert Mapplethorpe), the moral intentions of both the artwork and the artist became subjects of agitated debate. Conservators confront issues of moral intent when faced with artworks that were altered to improve their modesty. In past periods of prud- ery, drapery was added to nudes and carnal scenes were veiled by the addition of landscape elements or other accouterments. Decisions to retain or remove these additions may involve assessment of their artistic, aesthetic, and moral intentions and the moral intentions of conserva- tors themselves (Beck 1993). Surface cleaning and removal of aged coatings may invite consid- eration of moral intent when treatment reveals hidden details, modeling or flesh tones sugges- tive of licentious meaning. The moral character of portrait subjects and other depicted persons, their piety, nobility, rationality, and so forth, may also become the subjects of this meaning of intent. 5.12 RESULT OF KUHNS'S ANALYSIS When it was published, Kuhns's description of the meanings and references of "intent" was more a summary than a complete revelation. Although it provided necessary and welcome analysis and contributed to clarification of the JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="16">212 STEVEN W DYKSTRA issues, it did not attempt to achieve any final res- olution of the debate between intentionalists and anti-intentionalists. Its importance was in providing reference to the continuing variety and proliferation of scholarly articles on this subject. Attempts to discredit and discard the intentional fallacy continued to emphasize its ambiguity (Lyas 1983). Exhaustive summaries of intentionalist and anti-intentionalist positions, with detailed analy- ses and discussions, were published by Juhl (1980) and Margolis (1980). These in-depth studies consolidated the issues, leaving bare sev- eral core questions: What, if any, is the impor- tance of artist's intent? What can be known with certainty about it? And how do we come to know it? Ambiguity surrounding artist's intent became recognized not just as a word and refer- ence problem but as a manifestation of uncer- tainty about the fundamental nature of a work of art and the artist's role in it. After 35 years of scholarly attention, questions about artist's intent boiled down to questions about the essential nature of art itself. 6. THE ROLE OF THE ARTIST Confusion and ambiguity surrounding artist's intent and the intentional fallacy represent a lack of clarity about the role of the artist in the art- work. If the essential nature of an artwork's existence were better explained and understood, the role of the artist would not be so vague and debatable. Very few writers have made broadly constructive contributions to solving the prob- lems presented by this issue. Artists from the past are enshrined in our cul- tural memory. We often refer to individual art- works by the artist's name: "Did you see the Picasso? I preferred the C6zanne." Somehow we see a personality, however ambiguous, behind every work of art. Andrew Wyeth's paintings of Helga speak to us about him and his relationship to her as much as they do about her, the mani- fest subject. We do not mean to speak anthro- pomorphically when we say an artwork ex- presses tenderness or anger or melancholia. We might as well call them "artist's works" to show how closely we identify these types of creations with their creators. The role of the artist in the artwork emanates more strongly than other fac- tors that contribute to the essential nature of works of art. Published discussions of artist's intentions fre- quently address the nature of creativity and artists' interaction with media. The bearing of history on the interpretation of artworks is also an occasional consideration in discussions of artist's intent, but the role of media and the role of historical contexts are seldom collated with it. This disjunction occurs, in part, because the lan- guage we use does not lend itself to discussing these things together. It seems awkward or obscure to speak of the media's intentions or the intentions of the social and historical context in a work of art. Even in the light of Kuhns's analysis, the word "intention," as we are some- times tempted to use it, often fails us. It is possible, however, to define a meaning and apply the idea of artist's intent to art con- servation work in a way that correlates method- ologies in history, science, and connoisseurship. A deep and deliberate understanding of the role of the artist in the artwork is necessary. In the past two decades, philosophers working in con- temporary hermeneutics provided new explana- tions and refreshed perspectives on efforts in this direction. 6.1 AUTONOMY OF THE WORK OF ART: THE PROCESS AND PHENOMENON OF DISTANCIATION Paul Ricoeur's philosophy of criticism and the text and Hans-Georg Gadamer's aesthetics elevate an older proposition that the effects and interpretations arising from a work of art are autonomous, separate from the artist. Ricoeur claims in "The Hermeneutical Function of Dis- tanciation" (1981) that human discourse is trans- formed when it becomes fixed or objectified in a literary work or a work of art. When discourse JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="17">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 213 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION takes the form of a work, it escapes from the here-and-now situation of talking together face to face. It occurs in an alternative mode and receives a new status-the status of a text. Ricoeur calls this transformation "distanciation" to indicate that texts transcend their native cir- cumstances, moving beyond them into territo- ries where they are circumscribed by new horizons. As works of discourse, the artwork and the literary work experience distanciation in four ways. First, when a piece of art or literature comes out as a work, it meets with readers or beholders and it is emancipated from the imme- diate references and shared reality of live com- munication. Second, works of fine art and liter- ature become decontextualized in time and space. They can be, and often are, removed from the places and the social and historical condi- tions of their creation. Third, decontextualiza- tion allows them to appear in foreign circum- stances, where they are subject to new, perhaps unanticipated perspectives. As a result, they are opened to series of unrestricted readings or beholdings in which new and different mean- ings can be found. Fourth and finally, when a work of art leaves its creator's hand, the actual act of writing or painting or sculpting it becomes eclipsed by its own self-evidence. Dis- tanciation explains both the phenomenon and the process by which a work of art becomes autonomous from its creator, the author or artist. The effects of distanciation suggest that when we perceive the artist in a work of art, it is the artwork itself that is communicating with us about the artist; the discourse happens between the artwork and the beholder. The artist's mean- ing is covered by what the artwork can convey about the circumstance and disposition of its own creation. For the conservator, the impor- tance of distanciation is the suggestion that the aesthetic effects of an artwork can function independently from the artist's intent while at the same time locating the ground of reference for artist's intent in the artwork at hand. The perspective afforded by the concept of distanci- ation, where the artwork has a reflexive rela- tionship with the artist's intent, is an improve- ment over the anti-intentionalism of the 1950s and 1960s, which would admit only intentions proved by their effective results. We are free to find the sources of our speculation about the artist's intent in the artwork and elsewhere with- out being obligated to endorse their authority over aesthetic effects. 6.2 THE DESIGNATION OF ARTISTIC INDIVIDUALITY From a hermeneutical perspective, the appar- ent agency in a work of art refers not to the artist but to the artwork's own singular pattern of identity. "A work is given a unique configu- ration which likens it to an individual and which may be called its style" (Ricoeur 1981, 136). An artwork's individuality is what draws anthropomorphic remarks about emotions, moods, or desires that it seems to possess and convey. Ricoeur observes that artistic style is the active principle of individuation. Employment of artistic style produces the individual artwork, and in so doing, it retroactively designates the artist. "Artist" says more than maker or producer; he or she becomes an artist by pro- ducing a work of art. The artist and the artwork are realized contemporaneously. The singular configuration of the work and the singular configuration of the artist are strictly correlative. Man indi- viduates himself in producing individual works. The signature is the mark of this relation (Ricoeur 1981,138). Here is the symbol of the meaning in art that is attributable to the artist. The signature repre- sents the stamp of artistic style, the accomplish- ment of individuality in a work of art-both the individuality of the artist and the individuality of the work itself. The role of the artist is to JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="18">214 STEVEN W. DYKSTRA enfranchise the artwork with an individual iden- tity. While it is the artwork that bears all mean- ings to the beholder, it is the artist who shared with it the process of identification and deliv- ered into it the individual means to speak for itself. The artist's creative work endows the art materials with its evidence, making them into the venue for individuality and meaning that we call a work of art. The correlated individuality of artists and their artworks allows the process of attribution. The artistic expression of individuality also per- mits the identification and characterization of otherwise unrecognized or unknown artists like the Master of Flemalle and other nameless but influential Old Masters, some of whom are dis- tinguished by one work alone (Davies 1972). In addition, the integrity of this distinguishing individuality is essential to the concept of art forgery. Any imitation or copy, no matter how perfectly modeled in the manner of another's hand, never properly bears a borrowed signature or claims an accurate attribution to the maker of the copied model. 6.3 LIMITATIONS OF APPEAL TO ARTIST'S INTENT The personality, focus, and individuality of the artist have strong and mutual correlations with what is expressed in any work of fine art, but for clear consideration of the artist's invest- ment in the artwork, what is expressed and how it is expressed should not be confused. Matters of affect and iconography and the moods and meanings of works of art are what is expressed, and they are unwittingly credited to the artist alone. More accurately, moods and meanings, cues and symbols, the significance of the com- position and the like are ascribed to the artwork as a whole. The artwork in its entirety carries the correlation between what is expressed and how it is expressed in the material result of the artist's creative work. Although the autonomy of artworks from their makers is by no means proven or taken for granted in all quarters, explanations of it are clear and tend to be per- suasive. Nevertheless, there is a strong impulse to assign great weight to artist's ideas and expla- nations about their work, whether those ideas are clearly and specifically expressed or only dimly inferred. In art conservation contexts, when artist's intentions come into consideration the chal- lenge is to judge their importance and applica- bility in each case. The ideas of distanciation and autonomy suggest that the authority of the artist's role is inexorably relative to concurrent roles played by media, by art historical contexts, and by beholders' apprehensions. Interpreta- tions of emotional, psychological, and intellect ual meanings and purposes in art have only con- ditional associations with the artist's intent in these respects. Any apparent communication along these lines happens between the artwork and the beholder. Conservators can find the sig- nificance of artist's intent in the ability of an art- work to communicate about the individuality of its artist and the circumstances of its own creation. In the work of art conservation, the least provi- sional and most secure associations can be made between the artist's intent and his or her individ- ual skills and techniques, strategy, facility, and mas- tery of media in producing the work of art. 7. CONCLUSIONS: THE APPLICATION OF ARTIST'S INTENTIONS IN CONSERVATION WORK The technologically defined idea of following the artist's intentions did not survive as an authoritative principle of art conservation; it was scientifically doctrinaire and lacked scope and rigor. Its narrow definition placed it at odds with conventions of connoisseurship, the mor- tality of materials, and historical explanation. Critical debate surrounding the intentional fal- lacy illustrates significant obstacles to defining and judging artist's intent, and philosophical explanation of the autonomy of artworks con- tradicts its authority over the artwork as a JAIC 35(1996):197-218</page><page sequence="19">THE ARTIST'S INTENTIONS AND THE INTENTIONAL FALLACY IN 215 FINE ARTS CONSERVATION whole. In art conservation, following the artist's intentions remains attractive only in its reference to evaluating and considering the characteristic individuality of artists exhibited in their work. A specific branch of the literature of analyti- cal research in art conservation is devoted to describing and measuring particular artist's dis- tinctive methods and materials. Measurable, material things such as the choice and prepara- tion of media, size, and shape and order of brush strokes, even idiosyncrasies of drawing, model- ing, and line-all represent artistic intent in a limited and specific sense. In the narrowed focus on the distinctive use of materials in a particular work, psychological insights, social and intellec- tual purposes, and aesthetic effects are not addressed. The artist's intent, in this individual and characteristic sense, can be interpreted sys- tematically in the individual stylistic aspects of an artwork, specifically in technical matters of distinctive artistic style. Appeals to artists' intentions through this type of characteristic individuality can find a useful role in art conservation only if the artist's specif- ic investment in the work of art is not equated with broader, nonindividual connotations of aesthetic style, historical period, genre, and oeu- vre or equated with the remains of the artist's original materials. The artist's investment is expressed in the choice, preparation, and appli- cation of the media, not in the nature of the media itself. This is the explicit reference that conservators can maintain with professional expertise to save discussions of artists' intentions from falling into ambiguity. However, its appli- cation to conservation work requires more than the scientific delineation of an artist's style. The history of debate among conservators, critics, and art historians over artist's intent illus- trates the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach. Historical knowledge and interpreta- tion can inform the relationship between con- servation treatment needs and perspectives on the disposition of the artist's work. Connois- seurship can suggest the desirability, quality, and extent of treatment necessary for maintaining the individuality of the artist and the individual- ity of the work and placing them together in a meaningful context. Scientific analysis of the physical structure and chemical nature of the artwork can indicate how the artist's use of materials and their present condition pertain to the selection of conservation treatment goals and technologies. The interdisciplinary task of applying artists' intentions to conservation work requires exact- ing contributions from historians, critics, and connoisseurs, philosophers of art, scientists, and conservators alike. Purposeful discussion of the role of the artist in the artwork requires careful language and deliberate understanding of the essential nature of art. Precise language, com- monly understood, is the first step in this direc- tion. The importance of unambiguous language is paramount. Clear language among the disci- plines will be necessary to describe how the artist's individuality and the individuality of his or her work can be fulfilled and maintained in conjunction with three other factors-the his- torical contexts in which the artwork is docu- mented and perceived; the traditions of connois- seurship that give it reference; and the physical and temporal characteristics of the media employed. Artists' intentions can be investigated and applied to art conservation issues in terms of the distinctive characteristics that determine the individuality of artists and their work. The pro- ductive application of this specific conception of artist's intent will account for and acknowledge that the artist's investment functions in concert with these other factors to give an artwork a meaningful and lasting life.
