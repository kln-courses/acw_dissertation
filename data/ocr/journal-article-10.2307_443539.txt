<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM HARVEY WHEELER Washington and Lee University STALIN'S "MODEL A RUSSIA" WE CAN BE SURE that changes of far-reaching importance are taking place in post-Stalin Russia. It is impossible to analyze them day by day, in the hope of predicting the immediate policy implications of this or that shift or demotion. We can never harness the explosions of a crisis and read from them the pattern of the future; they are themselves the froth expelled. Although we may think what we most want to know is whether Malenkov is "harder" than Bulganin and whether Gromyko and his successors will be unyielding Molotov-type foreign minis- ters, these are questions the men themselves could not rightly answer, nor would such answers really be of much help to us if we had them. No matter how complete our knowledge, we cannot predict the details of the next Soviet moves. However, we can analyze the larger problems which confront the Soviets. If our analysis is accurate, it will help explain the larger trends which have characterized their post-Stalin crisis and will also help us to make a few tentative conjectures about some of the problems still to be met in the future. We cannot say what their answers will be, but we are not precluded from visualizing possible answers. From the outside a crisis appears to be a time of tremendous flux and innovation, and often it is. However, the apparent contemporaneousness of a crisis hides from our eyes the deeper fact that the crisis has occurred be- cause traditional institutions are for one reason or another incompetent to solve present problems consistently with traditional institutional forms. When the problems come entirely from the outside, as in an invasion or an earthquake, this is serious enough. But when the difficulties are internal, then the events which mark the progress of the crisis are not only novel reactions to new situations but also readjustments to changes too long postponed. Institutions are in this respect like machines in a factory. If they are extremely rugged to start with, they will survive much abuse and last a long time. Their very sturdiness is the measure of both their excellence and their injuriousness. For in being good enough to last a long time they are good enough also to survive beyond their technological obsolescence. As with Henry Ford's fabulous Model A plant, institutions may be so attuned to the problems of the past that even after they are obsolete they can be supplanted only with great difficulty in a long and serious crisis. 634</page><page sequence="2">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 635 Something like this condition is at the heart of the post-Stalin crisis in Russia. The parallels between Stalin and Henry Ford are, after all, deeper than mere technical emulation. Stalin was a kind of Henry Ford on a ruth- lessly vast scale. He answered the problems of his day by constructing a tremendous mass-production operation which seemed almost foolproof in its time. But its very proficiency continued to preserve it when underlying conditions had already made it obsolete. Post-Stalin Russia now faces some- thing like the problems encountered by the Ford Motor Company in shift- ing to the superior decentralized and constitutionalized control system pioneered at General Motors. The post-Stalin crisis is in large part merely the adjustments which have been forced on Russia in recognition of this fact. To understand these it is helpful to review first some of the general problems of industrialization which have had to be met wherever it has been undertaken. MERCANTILIST INDUSTRIALIZATION, HISTORICAL AND TERRORISTIC The problem of mercantilism is to reorganize the economic system of a feudal or an underdeveloped economy to produce for a market rather than manorial subsistence. Mercantilism achieved this in a way which also pro- vided sufficient savings for investments to make possible the later inaugura- tion of industrialization. Moreover, mercantilist savings tended to accumu- late in the hands of potential investors, facilitating decisions to invest. Mercantilism itself is not industrialization, for it is basically an organiza- tional rather than a technological revolution. However, mercantilism can be viewed as one organizational way of preparing for industrialization. This is seen best in the later mercantilism of the Hamiltonian type, which explicitly and rationally planned for industrialization. The pre-industrial central economic policies we know generally as mercantilism also acquired the special names of Colbertism, Kameralism, the Hamiltonian system, rationalization, and the Meiji system. Under the relatively simple economic conditions of the West from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century it proved necessary only to provide the basic power, transportation, and communication facilities, and to divert reorganizational savings into investment through centrally planned and chartered enterprises. We can now see that once this process was under way the prospect of huge personal rewards accomplished the rest "as if guided by an unseen hand." For England this story of the transformation of the mercantilist to the laissez-faire system has been related from different points of view by Karl Polanyi' and T. S. Ashton.2 There is no reason to 1The Great Transformation (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1944). ST. S. Ashton, in F. A. von Hayek (ed.), Capitalism and the Historians (Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1954).</page><page sequence="3">636 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY dispute the accuracy of either picture. There certainly was a persistent movement during the maturity of English capitalism to convert all values into market prices - this is the point of Polanyi, who follows out the story of how the institutional foundations were laid which we memorialize in classical economic theory. Ashton has explained how, as a result of this process, the wealth of England was so increased that wages could be steadily raised throughout this period of luxuriant entrepreneurial capital- ism. And though he is right in revising our normal historical picture of utter urban and industrial poverty during the industrialization process, a serious deficiency in his own corrected picture is that is fails to take into account the non-economic effects of the conversion of labor into a market commodity. The entire family structure is changed when this happens and many nonmonetary values cannot be easily assessed when one describes the transition from a low money-income subsistence peasant family in a large extended family system with each family providing its own social services. The new smaller atomized urban family unit has a seemingly higher money wage. The real value of that money wage may have grown steadily through the nineteenth century, and still not compensated for the other economic values provided by the worker's previous status. Nor is it clear that early industrial wages, for all their progressive attributes, covered the specialized new needs of industrial living for the uprooted laborers flooding the towns. Whenever it has occurred, industrialization has been a far from pretty picture. In the United States, the nation's fabulous wealth and the fertility of its great unsettled expanse of territory served to soften some of the cultural shock accompanying industrialization. However, the story recorded in the labor songs of the Negroes and of the Eastern European peasants who cultivated the South, drove the rails across country, worked the earliest mines, and built the first steel mills attest to the fact that industrialization has not been a process associated with humanitarian promptings or methods. And vigorous as is the story of American industrialization through free enterprise, we are prone to ignore the fact that it sprang from self-consciously planned mercantilist foundations. This is sometimes ob- scured from our historical view by our tendency to trace back the history of public policies through the federal government alone. However, during our early days most public policy was state-controlled. Professor Louis Hartza has shown that for Pennsylvania, at least, mercantilism lasted long into the nineteenth century and the systematic laissez-faire conversion of values into market prices did not take place until some time after the Civil War. ' Economic Policy and Democratic Thought: Pennsylvania (Cambridge: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1948).</page><page sequence="4">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 637 German industrialization during the latter part of the nineteenth cen- tury was built on a traditional Kameralist foundation and was systemati- cally fostered and planned under the auspices of the Prussian elite. The Tsarist inauguration of Russian industrialization followed the mercantilist pattern familiar from earlier European history. However, given the con- siderably more advanced stage of industrial development reached by the late nineteenth century, relatively larger initial capital investments were needed to begin with, and considerably more rigorous central controls were necessary to provide all the human, educational, technical, financial, marketing, and material resources required by that time. It is easy to forget that at the time of the Russian Revolution Petrograd and Moscow were industrial centers. Their factories and mills were not primitive seventeenth- century establishments, but very large enterprises, the remote outcome of the planning of the "first Bolshevik," Peter the Great, and his efficient mercantilist ministers. The industrialization of Japan is in many ways the most fascinating cultural endeavor ever consummated. Land reform to expel feudal barons and centralization of authority in the Emperor followed something like the pattern of European mercantilism, with the addition that considerable intelligence was focused upon the related problems of arranging social, political, military, and religious forces so as to march hand-in-hand with the industrialization process. It is certainly true that the various components of an industrial culture must mutually reinforce and mesh with each other, even though they may be of more than one general pattern and still fit the needs of an industrial culture. The virtual omission of the early stages of industrial development and the sudden introduction of large-scale capitalism under the guidance of political power, so conspicuous in Germany and Japan, presented the problem of technological phase-skipping. The problem attracted the atten- tion of Thorstein Veblen and Leon Trotsky; for the latter, as a Marxist, it offered a serious theoretical problem. In early Marxist theory' the nonrational economic factor is the inde- pendent variable and all other cultural factors - especially the political factor - are dependent variables. Political power could reflect, not com- mand the economy. Therefore socialism was to come as a consequence of the maturity and collapse of capitalism; the world revolution would begin in the most advanced capitalist countries. If one held to that theory (found in Marx's early historical and philosophical writings) then clearly an untrustworthy historical accident had occurred in Russia. The Trotsky- ites, who held to the early, more rigidly deterministic economic doctrines, 4 See Karl Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, in Selected Works (New York: International Publishers, 1935), I, 356; Capital (New York: Charles S. Kerr, 1906), I, 25.</page><page sequence="5">638 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY concluded that the only rational policy would be to use the fortuitously gained Russian power, not to achieve Russian socialism, which was impos- sible under Marxist theory, but rather to help trigger the more legitimate Communist revolution thought to be in the offing in Germany. World revolution, which would then spread out protectively from the theoretically most likely spot, was to be the overriding aim, and Russian power was to be used, not for its own sake, but to further that "foreign," or supranational ideological aim. Only then could the premature revolution in Russia be made secure. This position was not defeated decisively for many years - not until after the great purges of the thirties when the characteristic Stalinist notion of socialism in one country won out. This consolidated the political transformation of Marxist theory. This political transformation came to full development in the Bolshevik movement. It is one - but only one - of the many reasons Western attempts to predict Soviet moves on the basis of early Marxist economic determinism have been ineffective. The Soviet dictatorship of the pro- letariat - the institutionalized form of the unconventional October Revo- lution - was itself a doctrinal revolution, and it brought about a succession of related revolutions in other parts of Marxist theory, all along the line. Technological phase-skipping to industrialize at twentieth-century levels requires more capital than anybody in an isolated underdeveloped economy except the government can command; and, furthermore, even the govern- ment of an underdeveloped economy cannot command sufficient capital for industrialization at twentieth-century levels without exerting dictatorial power over people and materials. Under Stalin, who is sometimes called Russia's second mercantilist (Peter the Great was the first) the Soviets per- fected dictatorial political techniques for industrialization which we know by the name of "socialism in one [underdeveloped] country." It is for this reason that twentieth-century "Marxism" (meaning Stalinist political Marx- ism, henceforth to be called simply "Stalinism") has found its greatest appeal and success in the very underdeveloped areas which appeared to be least ready for Marxism as traditionally interpreted.5 Some brand of Stalinism as a twentieth-century form of mercantilism appeared to be the only means for a relatively independent industrialization by such countries. So long as this continues to appear true, and so long as the West fails to recognize this, counter-Soviet policies in underdeveloped areas will remain quite romantic. To carry out the internal requirements of rapid industrialization by means of a Stalinist dictatorship requires rigid discipline and compliance. For what is involved is the politics of squeezing people by increasing their ' Alberto Moravia, "A Novelist's Thoughts in Post-Stalinist Russia," The Reporter, April 18, 1957, p. 16.</page><page sequence="6">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 639 productivity while their expectations of change are held at zero, or depressed. Again, this is the opposite of the early Marxist formula of the priority of economic motivation. In Stalinist theory, political power is used to increase productivity and also to keep people from expecting to increase their levels of consumption as they are forced to increase their levels of production. Such standard of living increases as are given are given politi- cally and not through any economic inexorability, though the political decision whether or not to give increases may turn on economic calcula- tions of the comparative economic advantages of the carrot or the stick. The doctrinal explanation of this development turned on the defense of the dictatorship of the proletariat in its task of laying the foundations of socialism. PROTECTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIALISM The two grave threats to socialism, internal bourgeois survivals and external capitalist encirclement, were said to require the maintenance of a political dictatorship dedicated to protecting the feeble institutional begin- nings of socialism in its early foundation-laying stage. Accordingly, once the sturdy foundations for socialism were securely laid, the practical need and the theoretical rationale of the dictatorship of the proletariat would have disappeared. For many years one of the platitudes of intellectual exchange among members of the world cognoscenti has been the remark that if Marxism and Stalinism were synonymous, the only safe generaliza- tion one could make about communism in practice was that the state would never wither away. Some people wondered whether the flagrant denial of such a basic myth as the withering away of the state might not some day rise up to trouble the Stalinist dictatorship. It was sometimes suggested that this myth, plus Stalin's intensive educational program, were Bolshev- ism's two hostages to history. Moreover, there could be no doubt that indigenous Communist leaders in many underdeveloped areas of the world saw the obvious effectiveness of Stalinism as a mechanism for industrialization at twentieth-century levels, but feared for their own regimes in such a rigidly disciplined and ruthlessly administered movement. With each new purge inside Russia and in her satellites, disturbing questions were raised everywhere else about when "the foundations" of socialism would be securely laid. It was, therefore, of more than passing interest when before and during the Twentieth Party Congress the Khrushchev regime began to deflate and demote the old Stalinists. Let us recall some of those events. Molotov was forced to recant concerning a public statement that the foundations of socialism had not yet been laid, correcting himself and announcing that, on the contrary, everyone knew socialism was well estab-</page><page sequence="7">640 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY lished in the U.S.S.R. Khrushchev's own speech - the public one - before the Twentieth Party Congress had touched forcefully on similar points. Not only was socialism alleged to be internally secure; it no longer had to fear external capitalist encirclement. The Soviet Union's military and nuclear position, Khrushchev proclaimed, established it as an equal force in the world "balance of terror." When Molotov and Kaganovich, the two remaining old Stalinists, were twice retired (but not liquidated for treason), this seemed possible further confirmation that one large prop of the Stalinist system of terror had been kicked away. If the foundations of socialism were already firmly established internally, and if external capital- ist encirclement was no longer a problem, the only remaining reason for the dictatorship was internal bourgeois cultural survivals. Stalin's use of this notion was patently forced and it could not survive the proclamation of mature socialism. DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM Khrushchev's famous secret speech at the Twentieth Party Congress documented the way the Stalinist dictatorship systematically employed terror to achieve its political and economic goals. The formal administra- tive theory which accompanied the method went by the name of demo- cratic centralism. In theory, problems and issues would percolate up from the bottom of the party pyramid. This was a requirement. If anyone in the "grass roots" covered up a problem, he might suffer later for having done so. This was the "democratic" side. As problems percolate up through the successive stages of the party hierarchy, they are increasingly collected and synthesized. When they reach the party apex they are like the product of the upward movement of staff recommendations in any large bureauc- racy. However, once the party apex gets those issues and decides party policy on them, there is no longer allowed any substantive debate on the validity of the decision, its wisdom or accuracy. The decision is transmitted back down to the grass roots in the form of absolute, sovereign command. Substantive opposition is the dread "deviationism." The only debate allowed is how best to carry out the decision, not whether it is right. This is the centralism side of democratic centralism. It was an almost inevitable organizational concomitant of the consolidation of the political transforma- tion of Marxism we associate with the name of Stalin. It is not a particu- larly new idea. Wherever motivations are such that the only problem in administering people is organizing them, large-scale operations almost always bring something similar. But it is a misnomer to call it democratic, for the only way it could be worked in the early days of the Soviet regime was through the reinforcing terror of the Stalinist machine described by Khrushchev. Terror solved the motivational problem which would have</page><page sequence="8">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 641 otherwise plagued democratic centralism in a peasant-based preindustrial population. However, if we leave out terror and change its name to "bureaucratic" centralism we can see the same administrative principle at work in an army, in E. I. Du Pont de Nemours, and in the Department of Agriculture. For internal Soviet administration it was undoubtedly effective. However, a very serious problem arose when this internal principle of Soviet administration was extended throughout the world Communist party, destroying the autonomy of national Communist parties. This result was abetted by the defeat of Trotsky and by the failure of Communist parties in other parts of the West to develop revolutionary potentials inside their own countries after World War I. There appeared to be nothing else to do but concentrate on the achievement of socialism in one (underdeveloped) country and to bend every effort, not only within Russia but also outside, to insure the success of the Soviet effort. We have already seen how this coincided with what we called the political trans- formation of Marxism, and how it then developed into the internal adminis- trative principle of democratic centralism. But when these events happened, it was also to be expected that the various unsuccessful Communist parties in the rest of the world would be incorporated into the Moscow organization and take their places in the general party congresses as units in the demo- cratic centralist hierarchy. It also followed that their national or local problems and issues would be percolated up to the Moscow apex for deci- sion and the Moscow orders which filtered back down would have the binding effect of sovereign law. In this way it happened quite naturally that all questions of local strategy and tactics for the various world Communist parties came to be decided, not on the basis of what the early Marxist economic calculus dictated concerning the appropriate revolutionary tactic to fit a given national stage of economic history (this type of Marxism had been anathematized long since), but on how they affected domestic prob- lems within the U.S.S.R. In this way the political transformation of Marx- ism within Russia effected the conversion of other Communist movements into foreign agencies of one government. This was how Communists throughout the world became capable of such seemingly bewildering shifts of tactical position on word from Moscow. Their shifts were only bewilder- ing to those (both in and out of the Communist movement) who persisted in thinking of communism in terms of mid-nineteenth-century Marxism of the economic variety. The tragic experiences of the liberals of the popular front episode are traceable to this error. The name of Stalin will be permanently associated with the execution of the internal and external organizational and enforcement implications of the politicization of Marx- ism initiated after the Paris Commune and established in the Bolshevik movement. This aspect of Stalinism reached its apex just prior to World</page><page sequence="9">642 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY War II. The disintegration of the Stalinist system began during World War II and was made inevitable by the dynamics of postwar Communist suc- cesses outside of the U.S.S.R. TITOISM AS AN AMERICAN-TYPE REVOLUTION During the war it became apparent that two national units in the hierarchical organization of world communism were on the verge of achiev- ing local ascendancy. Stalin, aware of the organizational difficulties which would arise from successful independent Communist regimes in other countries, fought both movements. He lost both fights, and world com- munism has never afterward been the same. In his fight with Tito Stalin lost because Tito was able to get first British and later Anglo-American support. In his fight with Mao Tse-tung he lost because for a number of reasons it was impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to stay in power." However, once the Yugoslav and Chinese Communist parties assumed power in their respective countries, it was apparent that the structure of world com- munism would have to be reorganized to accommodate these occurrences. For though strong Stalinist attempts were made to preserve the old struc- ture, it was obvious that all problems and issues of local Communist organi- zations everywhere could no longer be decided solely on how they affected the domestic problems of the Soviet Union. Titoism is little more than a demonstration of this point. The same holds true in the satellites acquired after the war. The Soviets attempted for a long time to treat them as merely democratic centralist extensions of Russia. This was possible only so long as two conditions held: (1) the presence of crisis conditions inherited from war devastation; and (2) the maintenance of cold war tension, creating urgent common needs and justifying strong defensive measures. But as these two power-enhancing consolidating forces began to lessen, Titoism became an ever increasing problem, not because of any magic associated with his name, but merely because the Stalin regime could not accommodate itself to the success of communism outside Russia - not even in its own satellites. It came to be seriously debated among world Communists whether or not an anti-Soviet SThe Chinese Communists were never thoroughly assimilated into the democratic cen- tralist hierarchy, nor can Communist China be regarded as a "satellite" if the term is given technical precision to distinguish it from ally and colony. See Owen Latti- more and Urgungge Onon, Introduction to Nationalism and Revolution in Mongolia (New York: Oxford, 1955), p. 41: "The satellite is under strong pressure, sometimes amounting to coercion, to rem9del its internal life, social structure, political institu- tions, and economic methods on those of the country in whose orbit it moves, while normally the protectorate and the colony are prevented from doing these very things." The satellite condition is, however, not so novel as this suggests. It was one of the most common forms of imperialism prior to the industrial revolution and may be said to have characterized the relationships between England and the white colonies during the First British Empire.</page><page sequence="10">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 643 position might have become the essential precondition to the achievement of postindustrial socialism (as distinguished from the more peculiarly Stalinist problem of the rapid industrialization of an underdeveloped economy). Long before Stalin's death all these undigested problems rose together in the shape of a serious doctrinal and organizational crisis, the issue of which is not yet by any means clear. It may be of help to observe that Titoism raises in modern form the issues of the American Revolution. The analogy between the present condi- tions inside the world Communist movement and the problems inside the First British Empire at the time of the American Revolution is direct and obvious. The primary American grievance was economic. It was not so much a theoretical issue of taxation as it was a matter of the kinds and purposes of the parliamentary taxes. The constitutional problems at issue traced back to the difficulties which arose when the American colonists were confronted with the impact of the parliamentary revolution inside England. For when Englishmen neutralized the power of the king in Parliament, they proceeded to interpret the neutralized areas of traditional royal absolutism as being subject to the predominant domestic needs of England, even in the case of problems primarily of colonial signficance. That is why the Declaratory Act which followed the repeal of the Stamp Tax was even more provocatory than had been the actual tax. For the purposes of the tax and the spirit of the Declaratory Act made it clear that the English Parliament regarded American economic interests almost entirely as their own foreign investments. They considered colonial economic problems in terms of how they affected the English economy rather than on their own merits from the standpoint of local colonial needs. This was an affront magnified by the passage of the Declaratory Act. The second affront was tied up with military occupation by British troops. The pre-Revolutionary American colonists responded with proposals for changes in the constitutional theory of the British Empire to allow for colonial autonomy in matters of primarily local import and unified sub- ordination of local to imperial interests in areas of common defense and general significance for the Empire as a whole. For such general problems the pre-Revolutionary American colonists were prepared to admit the deter- mining primacy of England. This was the theory of a Commonwealth of Nations, first worked out by the American James Wilson and much later reluctantly agreed to by England in the form of the British Common- wealth of Nations. The American Revolution marks the end of the First British Empire and the beginning of the second. The feature which characterizes the Second British Empire is the ultimate adoption of Wilson's dominion</page><page sequence="11">644 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY theory as the constitutional principle of the British Commonwealth. Of course, Ireland remained a persisting hotbed of revolutionary outbreaks, but British policy was unshakable regarding this area. Ireland and Scotland were so close as to make Britain too vulnerable to attack from enemy forces to allow either national independence, even though in the case of Ireland a long military occupation accompanied by repression of local nationalist leaders continued to mar the exercise of British rule. The lessons of the American Revolution were clear. Eighteenth-century American Titoists forcefully demonstrated to the British that the general- ized parliamentary sovereignty they had applied throughout the Empire would no longer work. The Commonwealth of Nations was a form of federal union allowing for some degree of union for general purposes but large areas of autonomy for local purposes, all under the effectual hegemony of the "mother of parliaments." If Titoist Yugoslavia is the America of the twentieth-century "mother of Soviets," we may perhaps suggest that following the death of Stalin the Khrushchev regime attempted to apply the lessons of the Yugoslav episode and permit the development of the principles of a Commonwealth of Soviets, allowing a considerable measure of local autonomy for mature industrial economies within the framework of larger Communist control from Moscow over general problems. Gomulka's Poland may in this sense be compared to the Canadian achievement of dominion status. There is every reason to believe that similar dominion status was in the cards for Hungary until it became Russia's Ireland, many tragic times over. Though this analogy must not be pressed too far, it is useful because the types of problems were similar in both cases, and it helps us to think of satellite problems as they are seen from inside that system rather than as they con- front us aggressively from without. This also helps us understand the significance of the initial Khrushchev-Tito agreements. When Khrushchev and Bulganin went to meet Tito in 1955 the pur- pose of their meeting was to work out some preliminary solutions to these problems. Those agreements were epoch-making. First, the Soviet leaders acknowledged that there may be more than one path to socialism (consider- ing socialism here as involving both the Stalinist problem of the industriali- zation of an underdeveloped country and the traditional problem of post- industrialization distribution). The principle of the autonomy of national Communist parties was thereby admitted for the first time since the success of the Bolshevik revolution. Secondly, it was therefore necessary for the Soviets to agree not to interfere in local Yugoslav Communist party matters: to pull out all Soviet agents and commissars, overt and covert, and to keep hands off Yugoslav affairs. Finally, the Soviets agreed to cease "scapegoat- ing" Tito in the mass media of the U.S.S.R. and the satellites. This third</page><page sequence="12">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 645 feature was no less important than the others. It represented a develop- ment of the movement initiated after World War I and known as "moral disarmament." 7 It was later referred to by the Nazis in some of their international agreements. MORAL DISARMAMENT TODAY Tito insisted on a mutual agreement against scapegoating because he was aware of the simple proposition that under conditions in which wars are culture wars, no modern war can be fought unless the culture is well prepared in advance. Preparation consists of a program of intensive scape- goating in which the assumed enemy is shown to be responsible for all internal and external difficulties. Walter Lippmann demonstrated long ago that under contemporary conditions this can be done only through opinion mobilization in the mass media.8 One of the definitions of a "cold" war is a prolonged period of stand-by scapegoating to keep a population emotion- ally prepared for war on a moment's notice. Because mass opinion formation is an elaborately public matter, it is not possible for a great nation to keep secret its general aggressive potential. Any modern country can tell something about whether another country is a potential enemy by sampling its mass media. That was why the Khrushchev- Tito agreement against mutual scapegoating was significant. It was a way of formally agreeing to thaw out a cold war relationship. And the agree- ment was to some extent "self-enforcing," for official scapegoating can be detected as readily as the detonation of an H bomb. Neither country need depend merely upon the other's good faith. Both need only agree to exchange mass media. It is tempting to consider the more general potential application of such mutual guarantees against mass media scapegoating. However, their utility diminishes under conditions of full mobilization and virulent war hysteria. For under such conditions it may be immaterial to the aggressor where the aggressive strike is made, or whence comes the allegedly intolerable national affront. Under such conditions an inflammatory incident from a previously unscapegoated quarter may serve to set the conflict in motion. Moreover, it is possible that what we know as a "cold" war is the necessarily endemic condition of modern mass industrial cultures in pre- arbitrational forms of conflict-resolving communication. For if the maxim is true that nations must always be prepared to resort to war as an exten- sion of national policy, when all wars are culture wars then national security demands the maintenance of the entire culture in a condition just 'E.

Under such conditions of arousal, war involvement with a given country may not require specific preparatory scapegoating of that country. Mutual agree- ments against mass media scapegoating are by no means foolproof. How- ever, they do provide a method for reducing the violence potentials in a situation threatening conflagration. And indeed 1956 was a period of rela- tive peace between Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R. When relations worsened during the winter of 1956, several public and official statements from Mos- cow effectually renounced the principles which had been mutually agreed to a year before. A short period of potential conflict was then initiated. However, for a time, two Communist governments had contrived a self- enforcing type of modus vivendi, and their example remains potent for all who confront similar problems in the future. THE CONSERVATIVE CRISIS IN STALINISM The chief ingredients of Stalinism and the reasons for its breakdown have been described. Since Stalin's death each successive regime has been plagued with problems resulting from the breakdown of Stalin's terroristic industrialization program. However, the mere fact that a system has broken down does not necessarily mean that it will be repaired. Crisis need not even bring remedies. For although our normal presupposition about crisis is that it permits obsolete institutions to be supplanted, sometimes the oppo- site happens. Sometimes a crisis may actually reinforce the position of those least conscious of its causes. This may happen when a group of reformers, aware of approaching crisis, acquires enough power to hold office but not enough power to carry out needed fundamental reforms. Even though they gain strength steadily, their rate of gain may be slower than the rate of crisis development. So, when the crisis comes, the reformers are the ones who are in authority and receive blame for the crisis. Because of this type of lag it is possible for a crisis in traditional institutions to discredit those most aware of its approach and to stabilize the authority of those least aware of the deeper social and transitional implications of the crisis. This is the pattern of a "conservative crisis" - one which produces conservatism. It has occurred frequently when crisis has set in after a gradual decline in traditional institutions. It occurred in Great Britain following the cabinet crisis of 1931.9 It occurred in Russia after the troubles in Hungary and the ministerial changes of the winter of 1956-57 which momentarily revived the Malenkov group. Even though in the Eastern European satellites the terms "liberal" and "conservative" are applied to the opponents and the defenders of Stalinism, it is not quite valid to regard the Khrushchev fac- tion as liberals and the Malenkov faction as Stalinists. The distinction is ' Harvey Wheeler, The Conservative Crisis (Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1956).</page><page sequence="14">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 647 more like that which Burke made between the old and new Whigs of his day: neither were yet liberals. In post-Stalin Russia both groups are neo- Stalinist, with characteristic differences. Both groups have tried to survive the crisis in Stalinism by paring away the most glaring evils and getting the machinery back into operation. However, in addition to these crisis prob- lems, new ones arose which the two groups met in different ways. After the death of Stalin the new "collective" leadership masked violent differences at the highest levels. The first result was the purge of Beria and momentary consolidation under Malenkov. Then came numerous reorganizations and reforms. Pressing economic problems had to be solved in such a way as also to consolidate and protect the new regime's authority. Many of the economic problems were merely managerial. The farm prob- lem had been endemic. But the most serious problem grew from the dis- tributive needs of a mature industrial economy under conditions of state capitalism. A highly industrialized and urbanized population develops characteristic material and cultural needs which can be denied only through terror, or the pressure of a great national emergency. The death of Stalin (somewhat comparable in this respect to the death of Elizabeth I in s'eventeenth-century England) did not introduce those problems, but during his lifetime the pressure of crisis could be maintained and solutions post- poned. This engendered an isolation between the top managerial elite and the party rank and file which magnified the troubles of the post-Stalin collective leadership. The Malenkov group of second-generation Stalinist bureaucrats con- fronted these problems in conjunction with grave threats to their own power positions. Their attempted solution had two elements. They tried to buy time and job security by reducing heavy capital outlays and divert- ing that productivity into housing and consumption goods, to a degree neglecting the party organization in a bid for mass popularity. Economic decentralization, which had already begun under Stalin, was greatly extended.10 Politically they set about arranging other types of job security by reforming the worst evils of Stalinist terrorism. In both cases the process appears to have been quite similar to that described by Gaetano Moscall in his brilliant analysis of the constitutionalizing process he called "juridical defense." Although Mosca did not make this explicit, the implication of his data is that political and economic liberalism can be interpreted as the stabilizing regulations of an oligarchy attempting to regularize and preserve 0 Articles by William J.

In order to do this it is necessary to organize and extend equitable political and economic conditions. This is the sociology of liberal constitutionalism and it appears sound for both nineteenth, and twentieth-century conditions. The Malenkov political and economic reforms marked the first appearances of "liberalism" in the conservative sense Mosca described for a stabilizing oligarchy. The Malenkov maneuver was also neo-Stalinist, however, for it appears to have been an attempt to preserve the Stalinist administrative bureaucracy, sacrificing the Stalinist pace of capital development in a struggle against the party bureaucracy. The Khrushchev group which succeeded and ultimately ousted Malen- kov had a larger party base and strong army support. Its neo-Stalinism took the different tack of attempting to preserve the Stalinist industrial program, but it carried the political reforms further under the aegis of de-Stalinization and undertook a reform of the international, satellite and regional Soviet aspects of the Stalinist terrorist organization. The actions of the Khrush- chev group in each phase have had the outward marks of desperation. The calculation appears to have been that the only way to win, without at the same time creating further disruption, was to discredit Stalin personally and to offer him up as the symbolic scapegoat for all the evils and failings of the past. During his lifetime Stalin had served several American political groups well in this capacity. After his death the Khrushchev regime hoped to turn him to their own protective advantage. The spirit of Geneva, disarmament, a shift from guerrilla cold war tactics to economic competition for the uncommitted areas, greater auto- nomy for the satellites (though Titoism was not for importation), and in- ternal adoption of a dogma-free Marxist revisionism, appear to have been another effort to gain time to consolidate job security, trading political and constitutional concessions for a return to Stalinist economic development, presumably more popular in the army and the party than the Malenkov industrialization cutbacks, which had been aimed at gaining mass support. By the winter of 1956 the Khrushchev regime acquired the domestic reputation of having failed in the satellites, in Egypt, and in some internal areas as well. A conservative crisis gave renewed power to the Malenkov group and though Khrushchev held on to office he was forced to renounce publicly most of the leading tenets of the Twentieth Party Congress. How- ever, he was still in a position to inaugurate a dramatic economic reorganiza- tion12 so full of party patronage as to be free from challenge by the Malen- 12 William J. Jorden, New York Times, April 11 and 16, 1957; Childs, op. cit. The patronage- heavy administrative reorganization was a Jackson-like transfer of authority which prepared for the later appeal from a Presidium vote against Khrushchev to the Central Committee. In thus facilitating a larger role for the lesser party bosses Khrushchev may have prepared for the bureaucratic version of a Whig revolution.</page><page sequence="16">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 649 kov group. Under Stalin there had grown up several large industrywide bureaucratic empires. Originally these had been the economic counterparts of the Stalinist political structure. However, as Stalinism broke down, the separate industrial empires became strong centers of independent power. The result was that over-all government was characterized by what may be called an "anarchy of administration." In eliminating this anarchy Khrush- chev's regional decentralization program also consolidated his own political power, enabling him to withstand the June, 1957, challenge by the Malen- kov group through an unprecedented but successful appeal from a Presidium defeat to the party Central Committee.l3 The Khrushchev reorganization and Central Committee victory may cloak a power shift com- parable to that associated with the advent of the American New Deal. As in the American case, the Russian opponents appear to be the economic and the political bureaucracies. As underlying Russian problems remain quite severe, it seems likely that this struggle will continue for a long while yet. And if Khrushchev's announcement proves true that a large number of industrial bureaucrats will be reduced to proletarian status, their result- ing insecurity would be similar to that Marx described for the depressed petty-bourgeois. It is thus possible for the Khrushchev consolidation to create the conditions for the development of "petty bureaucratic fascism." The post-Stalin crisis appears best summed up as consisting of three chief elements: (1) the internal and external complications resulting from the breakdown of Stalin's terroristic industrialization program; (2) the distribution, control, and motivation problems of a stabilizing industrial economy; and (3) the problems of juridical defense in stabilizing the authority of a large party oligarchy under conditions of high industrializa- tion and bureaucratization. As successive attempts were made to deal with these problems several latent sources of conflict, if not "contradiction," were revealed: (1) the opposition between the political and the economic bureaucracies; (2) possible conflicts between the Khrushchev-led party elite and the army; (3) possible conflicts between the Khrushchev-led party elite and the party rank and file; (4) conflicts between the regime as a whole and segments of the general population; and (5) conflicts between the U.S.S.R. and her satellites. The death of Khrushchev, his political displacement, or any serious problem in any one of these areas might set off chain reactions in the others. Traditional Marxist theory had denied the possibility of contradictions between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the people. But because of the gravity of these potential conflicts the recent innovations in Marxist theory by Mao Tse-tung have been of general interest throughout the Communist world.

Party and governmental bureaucrats are said to be able to see the long-run over-all picture, but unable because of their position to see the immediate mass effect of their policies; the masses are the only ones able to say if their shoes pinch, but they are unable because of their localized position to see the over-all picture. This results in a serious contradiction between mass interests and viewpoints on the one side, and bureaucratic interests and viewpoints on the other. Mao Tse-tung's sugges- tion has been that the masses must be free to oppose the administration even to the point of strikes. In expressing such contradictions they are to be given the benefit of the doubt and in the ensuing "rectification" process to be subjected to persuasion rather than violence. Anti-party factions are said to be free to form and to make known their positions.14 The multi-party administration of China is quite a special case. And doubtless the under- lying situation in China made these necessary, rather than gratuitous, con- cessions. But as related underlying situations face Russian leaders, they also may find it expedient further to liberalize Marxist theory and to allow for some comparable theory of functional contradictions. Such Mosca-type liberalizing concessions would not be rejected by the Khrushchev faction merely for being discordant with Communist dogma. In this respect Khrushchev has proved in words and actions to be a Jacksonian pragmatist. This was seen from the start of his regime. The Tito-Khrushchev agreements had tremendous reverberations throughout the Communist world. The two leaders agreed that there might be separate paths to socialism not only in Yugoslavia but in the other satellites as well, and, impliedly, a new path inside the U.S.S.R. To this must be added the effects of the post-Stalin bloodless demotions. The Malenkov program was sovereign law for the democratic centralist hierarchy on one day and was discredited the next. It was superseded by de-Stalinization, which was in its turn sovereign ideological law for less than a year. De-Stalinization was in its turn superseded by a partial rehabilitation of Stalin, which was also exclusive truth for several months. In June, 1957, Khrushchev's defeat of the Malenkov faction purported to re-establish the sovereignty of the Twentieth Party Congress program, but even then the regime was far from unified and the underlying problems were far from solved. This was a bewildering succession of contradictory doctrines, but that was not what made them important. Radical doctrinal shifts had been notorious in the Stalinist past. But under Stalin each shift which required the anathemati- zation of a tenet which had been law the day before had been accomplished through a dramatized purge which attributed past evil to nefarious and 14 Mao Tse-tung, "The Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People," reprinted in New York Times, June 19, 1957.</page><page sequence="18">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 651 subversive foreign and bourgeois influences. Under Stalin there was no such thing as a "loyal" opposition. The logic of the dictatorship, of demo- cratic centralism, and of the infallibility of the party, demanded that every policy error be equated with subversion and every dissident be executed for treason. But the post-Stalin purveyors of error, Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Bulganin, Saburov, Shepilov, and Pervukhin (all, indeed, save the Beria terrorist organization which had enforced Stalinism), not only kept their lives; they also kept administrative positions. In truth this probably was because the shifting factions had enough power to depose their predecessors, but not enough to eliminate entirely the power foundations of those deposed, and alternatively, when there was enough power to carry out a blood purge, the foreseeable aggravation of latent internal and external contradictions prevented an affront to newly rehabilitated "Soviet legality." This means that the deposed, or those who continued to operate on their power foundations, were able to salvage enough power to forestall a blood purge and even to wield a certain veto power while out of dominance. From the outside, however, this was translated into the conclusion that any given official policy might later be overruled as a matter of course. That possibility, even though initially dependent on a power stalemate at the apex and fear of triggering latent conflicts, was subversive of the entire internal party principle of democratic centralism and the absolute indis- putability of a party order once it was handed down. Institutional reinforce- ment of this trend came from various sources: Khrushchev's industrial reorganization strengthened the lesser party bosses; in June, 1957, Khrush- chev was forced to appeal from a Presidium vote to the higher sovereignty of the Central Committee; he sedulously wooed mass opinion with each major innovation. The Khrushchev-managed Twentieth Party Congress had attempted to pare away the most glaring inadequacies and archaisms in the old Stalinist machinery. In scapegoating Stalin the Khrushchev regime recognized that it was also discrediting the principle of absolute party sovereignty. Organi- zational infallibility was, in some respects explicitly but in many others im- plicitly, declared at an end. The institution of greater inner party democ- racy was then announced and thereafter increasingly put into effect. The Twenty-first Party Congress will help us learn if there is to be fruit from these seeds of Whiggery sown in the party bureaucracy. However, even if these trends prosper, it is unlikely that future con- stitutional reforms will be those which we in the West would like to see. There are several reasons for this. One is that having so intensively criti- cized Western constitutional institutions as shams, it is unlikely that even Mosca-type liberal Russians would adopt them forthwith. Moreover,</page><page sequence="19">652 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY despite our own understandable pride in Western constitutionalism, we must recall that a great number of social theorists, themselves anti-Marxist, have concluded that Western constitutional institutions have broken down. This is the position associated with conservatism in general and with the "new conservatism" in particular. Many of the world's most brilliant economists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and historians maintain that the early-modern enthusiasm for representative democracy was fatally naive. The "new conservatism" is the dominant ideological style of the day and most of its expositors agree that the Western democracies must adopt some form of elitist aristocracy if they are to survive. It is disquieting to reflect that just before the disintegration of Hellenic culture the greatest minds of fifth-century Athens came to a similar conclusion. It seems safe to say, therefore, that even should a future reform movement gather strength inside Russia, and even if it were to set about its business of constitutional reform with a large amount of freedom and energy, there is little reason to suppose that it would be drawn irresistibly toward the precise institutional forms revered in the West. In addition, there is at the heart of the contemporary reform of Stalin- ism a deep-seated paradox. One of the signs by which we mark the first appearance of reform is the renunciation of terroristic Stalinist purges. This very constitutionalizing reform mitigates against the appearance of the type of democratic reforms the West would like to see. For powerful groups die hard when they are not terroristically liquidated. Even after their grip is broken they often reform themselves and provide the basis for an ongoing, though historically moribund political tradition. This is how opposing political parties have had their foundation in all Western coun- tries. It seems at least possible that post-Stalin Russia has seen the forma- tion of proto-parties, each of them neo-Stalinist in its own way. THE EXPORTATION OF INTERNAL AGGRESSION The post-Stalin crisis may resolve itself in many different ways. Just as Marxists and many others also have interpreted Western colonialism as an attempt to export their internal economic problems,15 so also it is possible to interpret the contemporary crisis in Stalinism as most likely to provoke an attempt to export the contradictions within the Soviet Union. This prediction has been put forward persuasively by Professor Strausz-Hup.'16 It is his conclusion that the neo-Stalinists will prevent any internal liberal- ization with every force at their command, despite the myth of the wither- ing away of the state. Having passed through the period of the establish- ment of the foundations of socialism inside Russia, they must find a 1 Gunnar Myrdal, International Economy (New York: Harper, 1956). 16 Robert Strausz-Hup6, "The Crisis of International Communism" (Philadelphia: Foreign Policy Research Institute, mimeographed, 1957).

Kenney, "The Twentieth C.P.S.U.," American Political Science Review, L (1956), 776-84.</page><page sequence="20">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 653 replacement for the Stalinist foreign scapegoating formula, because the two conditions (encirclement and bourgeois survivals) Stalin relied upon are no longer workable. The neo-Stalinist substitution, suggests Professor Strausz- Hupe, will be a modernized Trotskyist version of the permanent revolution. That is to say, revolution will be "exported" in both senses - in order to maintain internal stability as well as to revolutionize other countries. This practice will create a dangerous adversary for the West to face. Defense and containment policies will have to be redoubled. Military potential will have to be enhanced. The aggressively countervailing aspects of the cold war will have to be resumed with greater vigor than under Stalinist conditions. Although the underlying analysis has some glaring deficiencies, it can be assumed to be one possible view of present Soviet developmental trends. It seems even more accurate as a forecast of American conclusions and actions. It is therefore valid to hypothesize that Soviet-American relations in the near future actually will follow the paths charted immediately above. However, as they are quite dismal paths, it also becomes imperative to explore the possibilities for more hopeful or creative alternative develop- ments from both Soviet and American viewpoints. For even assuming that this picture of the future may be an accurate one, it is equally legitimate to speculate on any possible alternative picture and what American actions might do to realize these alternatives. In the first place it should be said that the exportation of revolution from Russia is far more likely to take traditional Stalinist than Trotskyist lines, for it is the emulation of Soviet industrialization in underdeveloped areas which has a dynamic potential rather than the emulation of mature Soviet socialism in advanced industrial Western countries. The "perma- nent" revolution which is most likely is of the American rather than the Trotskyist variety in both underdeveloped and advanced industrial areas. In underdeveloped areas this revolution seems directed primarily against the West. In industrial areas it militates against Russia. In underdeveloped areas Russia can combine its exportation of Stalinist industrialization with native nationalist uprisings, inducing colonial anti-Americanism. However in industrial areas Titoism is as firmly grounded in objective fact, for the socialization of a mature economy requires sufficient independence to be able to control internal economic problems. This is merely another way of saying that the disintegration and reorganization of both Russian and Western systems of influence and alliances appear to be one strong possi- bility for the near future. This is the prospect which most nearly fits the actual nature of recent changes in both Russia and the West. The question then becomes, what are the creative possibilities within such a prospect? This involves some consideration of the changed conditions of world balance-of-power politics.</page><page sequence="21">654 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY THE INADEQUACIES OF CONTAINMENT It can be argued in defense of Mr. Kennan's exposition of the idea of containment that it was the most enlightened and least aggressive policy which was both internationally and internally practicable at the time of its adoption. Moreover, there is little doubt that America's immediate post- war rush of demobilization and disarmament, though apparently necessary because of internal political forces, was unwise in the situation of chaos which prevailed throughout the world immediately after World War II. The relatively too-powerless politics of America immediately after World War II was too discordant with world realities to persist long. It is also possible that, given the sentiments of the American voters, the soundest way they could be induced to support the needs of the cold war was through the containment idea. For it built upon the threatened spread of the Communist ideology, but cautioned indefinite vigilance against it, countering Communist expansionist threats and yet refraining from the inauguration of large-scale conflict. With patience and firm resistance, ultimately there would come the working out of the inexorable processes inside the U.S.S.R. which would inevitably lead to its disintegration. That is, the American theory contained the obverse element of the Marxist pre- diction of the withering away of the Stalinist state through collapse rather than dialectical synthesis.17 Walter Lippmann,xs applying his traditional calculus of maintaining a balance between policy commitments and power potentials, immediately leveled a devastating ten-point attack on the containment analysis, largely discrediting its pretensions to validity. Lippmann's points need not be repeated, though they have grown in persuasiveness as the applicability of the containment idea has declined. Three points can be added to the Lippmann criticism. Containment rests upon an anaylsis of early Marxism, not Stalinism. It encourages con- solidation of power rather than disintegration in the opposition. And finally, its outlook envisages perpetuation of antagonistic conflict, not con- flict resolution. Should underlying Soviet conditions call any one of these three elements into question, all other accuracies or virtues of the con- tainment idea (save only its supposed utility in internal American politics) would be discredited. The foregoing analysis of the problems of Stalinism draws into ques- tion the validity of the containment policy on each of these three issues as they apply to three dimensions of the East-West conflict: competition in the "Federico Alessandrini, "semiofficial" Vatican spokesman, on "Communism's Crisis," the first of three articles on post-Stalin Communism, New York Herald Tribune, March 6, 7, and 8, 1957. 18 The Cold War (New York: Harper, 1947).</page><page sequence="22">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 655 underdeveloped areas of the world; the future of the Soviet satellites; and the future developmental trends within the. U.S.S.R. Regarding the world's underdeveloped areas, it must be repeated that it is Stalinist political Marxism which is attractive to them, not communism as an ideology concerned with the problems of late-nineteenth-century Europe. It is Stalinism as a twentieth-century form of bureaucratic mercan- tilism that attracts adherents throughout the colonial areas of the world. Given their choice, these areas will select what appears to be the easiest and quickest way to industrialization. If the West is unable to show them a better way, Stalinism seems almost certain to grow in attractiveness as the ties of colonialism are severed. To attempt to buy verbally anti-Communist princely leaders is a self-defeating and unduly expensive maneuver for the United States. It amounts to the use of American wealth, produced by the general population, for the preservation of doomed foreign investments. Moreover, in being directed toward the preservation of existing local rulers, it puts the genuinely popular leaders on notice that America has set her influence against the industrialization of their country. There is no reason to assume that American-supported princes will be any more secure in the Near East than have Western-supported princes throughout the rest of the underdeveloped world. However, America should be able to profit from her own early Hamil- tonian experience in fostering the growth of industry, as well as from Japanese and Soviet industrialization. The Japanese experience teaches that where some constitutional and land reform is possible a nonviolent indus- trial revolution can be set in motion. Puerto Rico's "operation bootstrap" can be shown to the world as an example of what can be accomplished by American social scientists of ability and integrity, working in conjunc- tion with local experts and leaders. For the Puerto Rican success was due to the soundness of the Tugwell mission in the thirties which produced a rational plan for industrialization, suited to local needs, and building upon the past experiences of the world with these problems. Gunnar Myrdal has recently explored similar approaches.19 In this fashion, the general cultural ramifications of industrialization can be co-ordinated so as to provide for the most rapid possible industrialization consistent with serving the needs of all cultural groups, avoiding the terroristic attributes of Stalinism as well as the host of undigested problems which have sprung up in its wake. The g Development and Underdevelopment (Cairo: National Bank of Egypt, 1956). "Technical assistance" such as was allegedly furnished by the Treasury Department to Ibn Saud concerning taxation policies appears to be just the opposite of that required for a sound developmental policy. See reports of the O'Mahoney investigations in I. F. Stone's Weekly, April 1 and 8, 1957; Richard E. Mooney, New York Times, April 22, 1957. Just as every internal tax, because it redistributes income, inevitably has political ramifi- cations, so also it is not possible to give non-political economic aid to another country. The type of economic aid and its method of distribution have inevitable political ramifi- cations inside both the giving and receiving countries.</page><page sequence="23">656 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY threat to America in the world's underdeveloped areas is not the threat of the traditional Communist ideology. It is the superiority of Stalinist mercantilism over American aid and private investment policies as a method of serving the industrializing needs of underdeveloped areas. Regarding the Soviet satellites, the spread of dominion status like that of Poland to Czechoslovakia and East Germany seems strongly indicated. Russia has shown that she will not allow full Titoist independence to spread, but it is probable that satellites as quasi-autonomous Russian dominions would be more advantageous to us than they would as a series of added Yugoslavias, abrasively playing off East and West, Nasser-fashion. Many political scientists have described the traditional British Common- wealth of Nations as a form of gradual disintegration rather than of union. The dynamics of a future Soviet commonwealth would also be likely to tend toward disintegration as world tensions subside and fuller United Nations arbitration of conflicts becomes possible. Moreover, it would be a questionable tactic for the West to incite further revolts on the Hungarian pattern, thereby engendering massive Soviet retaliation which a future Soviet Dulles may well decide to expand to "times and places of their own choosing." The appropriate American tactic regarding the satellites would seem to be that of reducing integrating containment-type pressures, which tend to weld the Soviet system more firmly together---trussing it in from the outside, so to speak - and to expand pacifying, disintegration-engendering forces. Though many feel it is hazardous to go as far toward military dis- engagement as M. Kennan himself has advocated before Senator Hum- phrey's Subcommittee on Disarmament,20 America has a paramount interest in any action or restraint which might foster the development of a Soviet commonwealth of self-governing satellites. However, the opposition- integrating containment approach works in precisely the opposite direction to that now indicated. THE DIALECTIC OF STATESMANSHIP The third problem, that of American policy regarding future develop- mental trends within the U.S.S.R., is a problem of a much different order and has many novel aspects. From our knowledge of internal Kremlin fac- tions two conclusions follow. The first is that regardless of which faction is 20 Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Subcommittee on Disarmament, Hearings, "Con- trol and Reduction of Armaments," Part 2, January 9 and 10, 1957, p. 1006: "One can- not fail to ask himself what would be the effect on them of some sort of a Western offer to reduce or to withdraw on a mutual basis, the foreign military contingents in Germany and in Eastern Europe .... If . . . we wish it easier for them to withdraw, then I know of no course open to us but to study seriously the various possibilities for .. the eventual reduction or redisposition or withdrawal of both Soviet and American forces ... ." Three months after this the Soviets made a similar proposal. New York Times, April 22, 1957.</page><page sequence="24">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 657 in ascendancy, future Soviet policies and actions will be in some measure influenced by the analyses of American policies and actions made from day to day inside the Kremlin. We know that American policies toward Russia are influenced by analyses of the same type made day-to-day in Washing- ton. The situation appears to be one of chessboard moves and counter- moves. The second conclusion from this process is that just as the careers of American ministers and the influence of Washington factions are strongly influenced by the effectiveness of or the need for the policy pro- posals with which they have become individually identified, such vicissi- tudes, it may be assumed, apply also to the ministers and the factions of the Kremlin. Some interesting conclusions follow from these observations. The containment theory projects indefinitely into the future an antagon- istic competition between the American and Soviet systems. The fact that the strategy proposes the achievement of a countervailing checkmate instead of victory through military offensive is immaterial to the point that so long as one views international problems through the perspectives of the con- tainment idea, one sees the indefinite projection of conflict in something like the process that Socrates termed "eristical." This was his name for the combative process which could be resolved only in the victory of one side. Recently American social scientists have found great attractiveness in the light shed on cold war strategy and tactics by the system of analysis known as game theory.21 This is a mathematical extension of the economic theory of the firm and purports to be a procedure for the reduction of decision-making problems concerning strategy and tactics in a competitive situation to mathematical analysis along the lines of a hypothetical game in which the aim is betterment of one's relative situation. Even though game theory is not consciously employed in the formal development of American strategy toward the Soviets, it is employed by prominent advisers and researchers. And it is clear that the chessboard simile of moves and countermoves; the notion that we are engaged in a cold "war," with the inevitable implication, as in all wars, that the well-being of one side can be achieved only at the price of the defeat of the other; and the war-games framework of our thinking about foreign relations as problems in strategy and tactics - all make the assumptions of game theory appear applicable to the sort of thinking actually being done about foreign relations under our containment policy. Consideration of international relations in this light also throws a flood of light on the inadaquacies of the containment, two- player approach. There are two main difficulties with this approach. The first is that in providing an analytical projection within which only conflict or victory (but not resolution) is envisaged, it is impossible to see "peace" through either game theory or containment spectacles. Secondly, these 21 See Appendix, infra.</page><page sequence="25">658 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY approaches assume a false homogeneity in the make-up of the "players" on each side. Both problems lead to conclusions which draw into question any approach which projects competitive antagonism indefinitely into the future. Regarding the first question we may say that its primary difficulty is that it is nonpolitical. This is more than the reflection that politics is the art of compromise, for the difficulty with a compromise is that nobody is really satisfied with it, since it is nobody's ideal solution. Compromise is not therefore bad; it is merely unstable. The primary difficulty with an unyieldingly combative foreign policy is theoretical. And as both contain- ment and game theory are highly theoretical, this side of the problem deserves investigation. We are drawn to the Socratic distinction between eristical and dialecti- cal conflict. R. G. Collingwood has given the clearest explanation of these two terms and the following explanation is slightly paraphrased from his New Leviathan: Eristical conflict is one in which each party tries to prove that he was right and the other wrong. In dialectical conflict you aim at showing that your own position is one with which your opponent really agrees, even if at one time he denied it; or conversely that it was yourself and not your opponent who began by opposing a position with which you really agree. The essence of dialectical conflict is to proceed in the hope of finding that both parties to the dispute may be in the right, and that this eventuality puts an end to the conflict."2 Dialectical conflict, as here described (and thereby distinguished from the use given the word "dialectical" by Hegel and Marx) is what we often call statesmanship. Mary Parker Follett called it "constructive conflict." 23 The primary difficulty with the competitively antagonistic design of our anti-Soviet policies is that they are eristical and leave no room for a conflict resolution which envisages the future integrity of the opponent. The fact that our opponent tends to make the same error is not at the moment at issue. Statesmanship always contends in an arena characterized by eristical opponents. Containment and game theory as they are applied to American- Soviet relations are both fundamentally eristical and this is their major theoretical deficiency. Great military leaders belong to a profession which at its heart is dedicated to eristical approaches to all conflicts. This is one reason of continuing validity for that American tradition which opposes the use of generals in the highest political and diplomatic posts. It was also for this reason, in essence, that J. A. Schumpeter24 concluded that the business leaders produced by a middle-class society would never be able to develop the statesmanship requisite for running a great country. 2 R. G.

The truth is of course that each "side" is in some respects a shifting amorphous confederation made up of flexible internal factions moving in and out of ascendancy. This appears to be a stable feature of bureaucratic leadership in all large-scale organizations, and there is little reason to expect it will change in the near future. From our own side, we know that the Eisenhower administration has fluctuated between two policies toward Russia. There have been rather stable factions within that administration advocating firmness to the point of belligerency on the one side, and comity to the point of peaceful co- existence on the other. We also know that the recent history of Russian developments has had a strong effect on the ascendancy of these alternative positions and their proponents. When relatively more pacific counsels appeared to have won out in Russia and became reflected in peace-regard- ing actions, the counsels of their American counterparts carried greater weight in this country. When aggression and counsels of violence appeared to have gained the upper hand in Russia, as with the 1956 repressions in Hungary and the reappearance of a more belligerent international posture, the position of peace-regarding Americans worsened and the counsels of their opposite numbers seemed appropriate to meet revived Russian threats. The point of all this is to conclude that within the limits of their own ability to maneuver, the Russians, by the quality of their own actions, possessed an important power to influence the direction of American foreign policy and even the composition of Washington's dominant factions, as did America, also, regarding policies and factions inside the Kremlin. We have within our own selves an important power to "choose" which factions and policies shall win in the crisis in Stalinism which is still working itself out inside Russia. This is a new dimension in power politics and it contains a large lesson for the future of international relations. Following the end of World War II it frequently was said that balance- of-power politics was dead, for it would not work in a bipolar world. At least three players were required to keep the game going; you could not balance a two-legged stool. So long as international politics is viewed as the arena for great monolithic Western and Eastern behemoths astride the world in counterpoised tension, that observation remains sound. However, as soon as attention is directed to the relationship between the various ingredients in an over-all policy, the internal power cluster which had to be amalgamated in order to put the policy position together becomes more significant than its external appearance of unity. It is apparent, there- fore, that one may visualize policy formation on a new level of calculation.</page><page sequence="27">660 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY The effort becomes one of constructing a policy position which is viable regarding one's own internal power factions, and is yet designed to set in motion certain responsive policy harmonies deemed to be latent in the possible factional configurations of the other "side." This is a qualification of game theory in which a changed view of policy formation on each side permits the assumption of hypothetical conflict resolution to replace the eristical assumptions of competitive striving for victory. If one looks at the two players as if they were each federal organizations (as indeed we are taught they must be by contemporary group theory) with their "moves" (policies) a jigsaw confederate projection which adds up to a unity, but which is subject to instantaneous internal reconfiguration or "revolution," then the nature of the process of making "moves" and designing the unified confederate projections for one's own side changes. It is not merely the process of countering a given disagreeable confederation, but of fostering the reorganization of new configurations more dialectically statesmanlike. This appears to have been the thought behind the last recommendations of Secretary Stimson, 2 just before his death. He had lost faith in his own earlier approach to the Russians, which had been the simple proposition that the way to make them trustworthy was to show them they were trusted. In pondering the problem he appears to have concluded that their long period of suspicion of the West, together with the fact that the Rus- sian negotiators themselves (and Stalin most particularly) were close to peasantry, prevented abandonment entirely of the hardened suspiciousness of peasant folk mentality. Such people could not be dealt with as if they were European diplomats. The normal assumptions of Western diplomacy had insufficient basis for application. What would have to be substituted was a unilateral statesmanship which would attempt to develop from the American side policies truly in the interests of both Russians and Ameri- cans, even if their wisdom was not immediately apparent to the Russians. Then the procedure would be to surround Russia with a projection of real- istic forces and situations which when calculated and analyzed by them would have the effect of appearing as a configuration out of which there could be triangulated only one resultant: that policy deemed to be the statesmanlike resolution in the interest of both sides.26 This is dialectical statesmanship in the Socratic sense discussed above. It is the process through which statesmanship works at the resolution of conflict in all arenas. It is possible to be much more explicit about the process of conflict resolution, but such mechanics need not deter us here, for the assumption of the possibility of conflict resolution between the Americans and the Henry L. Stimson, On Active Service in Peace and War (New York: Harper, 1948). 26 Henry L. Stimson, "The Challenge to Americans," Foreign Affairs, XXVI (1947), 10, argu- ing that the aim of American policy should be to create conditions such that "the Rus- sian leaders may either change their minds or lose their jobs."</page><page sequence="28">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 661 Russians raises another major theoretical issue. For it is precisely the validity of assuming any hypothetical resolution of the conflict between the United States and the U.S.S.R which often appears inconceivable, from the viewpoints of both sides. And though peaceful resolution between the two may indeed prove impossible, it is far from inconceivable from within either Marxist or liberal political theory. THE LIBERAL DIALECTIC In the first place it should be stated that there is a strong doctrinal tradition in Marxism which reaches up through Leninism and Stalinism and is dogmatically revolutionary. This is the part of the Communist tradition with which we are all familiar. We may recall also that there is a strong doctrinal revolutionary tradition in liberalism which is prominent in its seventeenth-century foundations and reaches up through Locke, Rousseau, Paine, Jefferson, Godwin, Thoreau, Debs, Laski, and many others. In say- ing this it is not intended to disparage the past significance of either tradi- tion, nor to suggest that they are comparable, nor to contend that either one is dead today. It is useful, however, to point out that at varying times during their histories, cultures have by turns emphasized varying elements of their traditions as the need arose, and held the momentarily de-empha- sized elements in cold storage when they seemed inapplicable. Regarding the revolutionary tradition in Marxism, it would be illegiti- mate to preclude from one's assumptions the possibility of its early re- appearance in some Soviet regime. Indeed, the counsel of caution might dictate the assumption that the return to aggressive revolutionary incite- ment is a constantly threatening tendency to be vigilantly guarded against. Such a policy would be Russia's most anti-American policy, and one that it would be in our interest to prevent, if at all possible. We have seen much earlier that although the words of Stalin may have clothed his actions in the phrases of the traditional revolutionary lexicon, Stalinism in practice actually stood for something quite different and opposed to the revolutionary tradition. If Stalinism as we have known it in the past is revived, it will not bear much resemblance to the doctrines our scholars extrapolate out of Marxist literature. Moreover, there is a strong alternative tradition in Marxism which could provide the founda- tion for an entirely different Soviet trend. Nothing less than the Bolshevik epithet, "right deviationist social democratic Menshevik revisionism," will suffice to describe the doctrines espoused at the Twentieth Party Congress. This revisionist tradition was further reinforced in Khrushchev's Whig-like moves toward party sovereignty in 1957. Already in October, 1955, Khrushchev had told a group of visiting French officials that "we are in favor of coexistence not because we have</page><page sequence="29">662 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY renounced Marxism but because we have remained faithful to it; capitalism is doomed to die even if - and especially if --the third world war, in the ordinary meaning of the term, does not occur." 27 It is doubtless true that in the long historical pull capitalism, as well as communism, is doomed. If Marxists are now prepared to trust to their faith in the historical process to achieve this result, a considerable amount of historical elbowroom yet remains. But reversion to another, more violent tradition is possible. Our own interests, as well as world peace, will be safer if the revisionist tradition remains dominant. To the extent that American policies and actions may affect the counterpolicies adopted inside the U.S.S.R., any American actions, consistent with general American interests, capable of influencing the factional shifts inside Russia away from the revolutionary and toward the revisionist policy would clearly be more in the American interest than actions which would elicit Russian adoption of a policy of exportation of revolution. What are the practical possibilities for the preservation of such a relatively nonrevolutionary Russian policy? We have strong evidence that leading Soviet minds have for a long time profitably contemplated the conclusions of liberal economic theory.28 Indeed, we know from the theories of Marx, Oskar Lange, and Abba Lerner that there is every theoretical reason socialists should do so. There is no such thing as socialist economic theory, or antisocialist economic theory. Economic theory deals with the solution of problems. There is only sound or unsound economic theory. There is every reason to assume that economic theory would be the same on Mars and in Russia as it is any- where else. There is no reason the same propositions should not be true of political theory. Recent political events in the Communist world should have forcefully directed leading Soviet minds back to a contemplation of classical liberal political theory. For when Bolsheviks and Menshevik revisionists alike have been found wrong but not disloyal, it must have been difficult for onlookers to escape the conclusion that such bloodless reversals, having occurred so 27 Alessandrini, op. cit., "Communism and the World." 8 An extensive debate on this problem can be found in the American Economic Review, XXXIV, No. 2 (1944). The argument arose over the interpretation of an authoritative Soviet article on teaching economics. Carl Landauer called attention to classical elements, "From Marx to Menger," ibid., pp. 340-44. Then appeared a translation of the Soviet article by Raya Dunayevskaya, "Teaching of Economics in the Soviet Union," ibid., pp. 501-30. The same author's analysis of the classical revision followed, "A New Revision of Marxian Economics," ibid., pp. 531-37. The ensuing discussion must be followed: Paul A. Baran, "New Trends in Russian Economic Thinking?" ibid., pp. 862-71; Oskar Lange, "Marxian Economics in the Soviet Union," ibid. (1945), 127-33; Brooks Otis, "The Communists and the Labor Theory of Value," ibid., pp. 134-37; Leo Rogin, "Marx and Engels on Distribution in a Socialist Society," ibid., pp. 137-43. The reply by Raya Dunayevskaya, "Revision or Reaffirmation of Marxism, A Rejoinder," ibid., pp. 660-64, appears to have the better case.</page><page sequence="30">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 663 often, might continue to occur in the future, and if this is so, some machinery is needed to facilitate the discovery of policy errors so that neither personal disloyalty purges nor revolutionary putsches provide the only method for correcting errors. Classical liberal theory, when con- fronted with these same problems in the seventeenth century, concluded that the freedom to organize a "loyal opposition" (letting "a hundred flowers bloom" and "a hundred schools of thought contend" was Mao Tse-tung's way of putting the same thought) without incurring suspicion of disloyalty, was essential to the organizational elimination of error. This was never an absolute freedom. Western liberals have denied it to royalists and Catholics, and more recently to fascists and Communists. Within the limits of revolution and counterrevolution this was the liberal constitutional dialectic that was pushed to its highest theoretical expression by John Stuart Mill. It is hard to escape his theoretical conclusions if one admits the possibility of ex cathedra doctrinal fallibility. A LIMITED DICTATORSHIP? Mao Tse-tung has shown how Marxist theory may accommodate itself to this problem.2" Chinese Communists have made a self-conscious applica- tion of the Hegelian process according to which the warlike antagonisms of class conflict were to give way to conflicts over the administration of things. Mao Tse-tung's new dialectical principle follows the definite stages of the expression of conflict (antithesis) and an ensuing "rectification" or synthesis. Some such ongoing dialectical process has always been needed by Marxist theory, and it has obvious links with the early theoretical expres- sion of the "liberal dialectic," especially as found in Locke's Letters on Toleration. In Mao Tse-tung's "bloom-contend" doctrine there appears to be little place for the dictatorship of the proletariat, for that was an institution maintained by the persistence of conflicts which allegedly demanded a distinct role and position for the sovereign party vis-ta-vis the rest of society. Seen in terms of traditional Western theory, the dictatorship of the pro- letariat is similar to pre-modern theories of the royal prerogative, which also rested upon a distinction between princeps and populus. One of the highest forms of this pre-modern theory was Machiavelli's Prince with its natural- istic treatment of the relationships between ruler and subject. The distinc- tive development in modem theory came when theories of legal sover- eignty shifted emphasis from the ruler-subject (potentially antagonistic even 29 "The Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," cited above, lists twelve different functional contradictions which are non-antagonistic and therefore may be tolerated. Among these is included "the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie." There are interesting parallels not only with Locke but also with Lord Balfour's perception that English party strife presupposed a nation so at one on fundamentals that no change in party administration would amount to a revolution.</page><page sequence="31">664 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY in theory) relationship to the Hobbes-Rousseau types of state-citizen rela- tionship, which in theory could not be antagonistic. Mao's shift is a similar development for Communist theory adapted to his own multi-factional Chinese situation. It is nevertheless totalitarian by liberal standards, for it makes all problems, including even questions of belief, political problems. Forms of cultural assimilation which were previously nonrational and found only in the family system, in religious training and on the village level were nationalized and subjected to rational political design: in Chinese totalitarianism the socialization process is fully politicized. Mao Tse-tung joins spiritually with Rousseau in claiming that this does not necessarily require terrorism and despotism. One can avoid facing his problem only as the problem of Rousseau is avoided, by refusing to make rational and politi- cal the process whereby a society attempts culturally to assimilate its mem- bers. If the Chinese succeed they will have provided a counterargument to the most vigorous critics of Stalinism,30 and one which may enhance tre- mendously the appeal of communism throughout the world's under- developed areas. Though Maoism is potentially a stronger competitor to the West than Stalinism, it also facilitates, in theory at least, coexistence between com. munism and liberalism. However, even granting this, is it not unlikely that the Russians would ever allow this more liberal Marxist tradition to develop in actual practice? Is it not impossible for effectual liberalization to take place on the institutional foundations laid by Stalin? This is the final problem of Stalinism to which we must give attention. The question is not whether liberalization is inevitable or likely, but rather, whether it is possible. For if it is possible, then American policy, conceived in the light of what was referred to above as the new balance-of-power politics, can creatively direct its efforts to the encouragement of such a development. Although indigenous foundations for constitutional reforms appear to be absent in the U.S.S.R., the success of the Stalinist industrializing program brought with it a relatively highly educated, mobile, integrated, mature, technical, and bureaucratic population with impulses and needs similar to those we have always associated with these conditions wherever they have arisen. The Russian people are by no means revolutionary; but since the death of Stalin their discontented stirrings have been well remarked in the arts and sciences, the universities3' and the literary journals. Added to this is what we know about the specific effects of industrialization throughout the rest of the world. Marxists should be the first to appreciate the sum 3 Milovan Djilas, The New Class (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1957). 31 Ralph Parker, "Soviet Youth Demands Debate," Nation, April 6, 1957, pp. 295-97; "Letter from a Soviet Student," ibid., p. 297; Wolfgang Harich, "East Germany: Revolt of a Communist," translated by Sebastian Haffner, op. cit., May 4, 1957, pp. 388-90; L.

From this standpoint, it can be seen that viewed internally, from the bottom up, Stalinism reproduced inside Russia as well as in the satellites the same conditions and the same forces which Marx had predicted for Western capitalism. It is ironic that in the West, where Marxism was to have had its day, the very liberal reformism he disparaged effected sufficient ameliora- tion to forestall the outbreak of violence, leading ultimately in countries like England to the constitutional installation of socialism. It was in the indus- trially inauspicious East that Marxists in power transformed Marx's theories, becoming ruthless state capitalists and then proceeding to outdo the repressive prediction Marx had made for the relatively more humane capitalists of nineteenth-century experience. We may suspect that these paradoxical but obvious conclusions have been reflected upon with increas- ing comprehension by growing numbers of individuals throughout the Communist world, for they have had the interpretative guidance of Marxist teaching about the effects of industrialization.," The revolutionary move- ment we know by the name of Titoism has not yet had serious liberalizing results in the home of its birth. The seeds are already sown there, however, for a liberal tradition which may grow in significance with the approach- ing demise of Tito himself. In Poland it seems clear that, as with the earlier American revolutionary experience, the Polish move toward independence cloaked a more fundamental internal social and political liberalization. Moreover, if the history of the middle-class revolution is any guide we may say that the effects of revolutions tend to spread to other countries. This happens both in the actions of the people and in the protective anti- cipatory reactions of their rulers. In eighteenth-century England only war postponed until 1832 the spirit of '89. In Spain, the price of stamping out the middle-class revolution was cultural stagnation. Today the Communist world is confronted with similar conditions. Their response may follow a path of political and economic stabilization similar to the process of juridical defense described in Gaetano Mosca's The Ruling Class. It would be ironic indeed (though by no means impossible) if it happened that the inflexible bastions of Marxism should find it impossible to learn from later sociologists such as Mosca and thereby condemn them- selves alone to suffer from Marx's own deterministic predictions about their alleged ideological opponents. Tentative and hypothetical conclusions may be proposed about possible Soviet reforms consistently with present institutional realities. For it is pos- sible to project a series of changes which might be practicable regardless 32 This point is touched on in "Letter from a Soviet Student" and in the Harich document cited above.</page><page sequence="33">666 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY of which faction of neo-Stalinists holds power. However, one of the institutions unlikely to change in form is the one-party monopoly of the Communist party. Putting this proposition in another form, it can be said that future Communist reforms are not likely to develop along the lines we now associate with the Western two- or multi-party systems unless the Communist party itself becomes transformed into an elaborate decen- tralized parliamentary arena for contending organizational and program- matic battles. The question then is whether the benefits we associate with the two-party system can be achieved in any other way. To answer this question requires a brief incursion into party theory. DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND CONSENT UNDER BUREAUCRATIC CONDITIONS There is no inherent magic in the two-party system as such. Its validity rests upon the assumption that a two-party system will in practice reveal all serious injustices and evils in the society, producing competitive programs for alleviation or redress; and that the voting population will be personally and organizationally capable of selecting the best program from among the two or more competing for their allegiance. These are the two theoretical presuppositions of the Western two-party system. If they do not hold in practice, then regardless of the formal presence of two competing party institutions, the liberal dialectic cannot function, for its two prerequisites, democratic leadership (discovery of evils and development of competitive corrective programs) and democratic consent (personal and organizational capacity to select the better program) will be absent. Reduced to its most general terms, we may say that the functioning of the liberal dialectic re- quires an operating political structure which produces approximations of democratic leadership and consent as defined above. This is the great un- touched area of political theory. Since Mosca there have been very few who have given it attention. Distinctions between eristical and dialectical con- flict may be applied to the internal institutional achievement of democratic leadership and consent. A few brief comments only will suffice here. It is at least possible that "leadership," instead of being viewed always in anthropomorphic terms as what the good democratic leader will do, can be thought of as the process of determining the best approximation to the hypothetically correct solution to any given political problem. To visualize such a process one may think of the adversary proceeding at work in the common law through which "the law" is determined. "The common law" does not exist anywhere. It is unwritten. It is not the animistic spirit sym- bolized in the culture gods. It is really "invented" in a dialectical adversary proceeding in which both parties assume that a hypothetical legal reso- lution of their conflict can be derived. The extension of these principles to almost every type of problem is one of the dominant characteristics of the modern West. Such a procedure may be extended also to the process of</page><page sequence="34">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 667 "inventing" an assumed hypothetically correct solution to any political problem. It would be possible for the proto-parties we think to be at con- flict at the Communist apex to develop some such "leadership" process. Something like it seems almost implicit in what has taken place recently in Russia, especially in the hesitant adoption of juridical defenses by the new collective leadership. The disparagement of the Stalin "Cult of the Individual" was developed for practical reasons. However, if it is extended to a theoretical level it will amount to the elimination of anthropomorphic elements from principles of leadership. This elimination is a requirement for democratic theory under bureaucratic conditions. It is furthermore possible that "consent," instead of being viewed anthropomorphically in terms of what a good democratic follower will be able to do, can also be thought of as the process of organizing the presenta- tion of hypothetical alternatives to the largest number of people for resolu- tion. The United States is doing just that at the present time concerning one of the most serious issues of its entire democratic experience, the issue of extending the protections and benefits of constitutional government to all ethnic and ideological groups. It is probably true that the future of Ameri- can democracy depends upon the practical outcome of this issue. Yet it cannot be said that the resolution of this issue is taking place through the agency of our formal two-party system. It is theoretically possible for a similar principle of consent to be introduced into the established machinery of Soviet bureaucratic centralism, should that system be successfully purged of Stalinist terrorism. As with leadership, some such development is of general significance for bureaucratic conditions even outside the U.S.S.R. Innovations in these two areas of leadership and consent would not approach the Western democratic ideal. However, as was noted earlier, some of the West's most brilliant minds have serious doubts about those ideals. Moreover, our problem was only the limited one of visualizing possible juridical defenses within the present institutions of Russia - a limited dictatorship, not full constitutionalism. These developments appear to be compatible with liberal assumptions. They seem to provide viable corrections of the problems inherited from Stalinism. They appear to be theoretically consistent with the presuppositions of Marxism, and to be functionally practicable within the basic framework of contemporary Soviet institutions. There is even some evidence that such changes are already taking place in embryo. However, the crisis brought by the problems of the Stalinist system is still working itself out in Russia. War or intensification of the cold war may preserve neo-Stalinism for a considerable time, but that solution will not resolve the fundamental underlying problem of the Stalinist system, namely that a terroristic system of rapid industrialization cannot preserve its politi- cal techniques and its economic policies into post-industrial cultural,</page><page sequence="35">668 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY economic, and educational conditions. And it cannot adjust its organiza- tional techniques to accommodate the local successes of Communist parties in other regions of the world. The Stalinist system is a system unable to survive the successful accomplishment of its own purposes, or, to turn it around, the price of its survival is the reform of Stalinism. Of course, this is not surprising. Industrialization wherever it has occurred has brought similar problems. The West incurred some character- istically different conditions as it industrialized more leisurely under the simpler conditions of the period from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Even so, the internal political and constitutional forms developed for Western industrialization did not themselves long outlast its successful accomplishment. One final point needs making. Clinton Rossiter33 and Harold Lasswell34 long ago called attention to the administrative and constitutional changes toward more dictatorial institutions required for Western survival. Louis J. Halle pointed out that a cold war places similar conditions on all its members, when he recently suggested that a "convergence"35 is taking place between the American and Soviet systems. Although these are generaliza- tions about the cold war, they may have long run historical significance. It has already been suggested that a cold war may be the endemic condition of international relations between bureaucratic cultures in prearbitrational forms of communication. In addition to this is the general internal simi- larity of the great cultures which have developed these conditions of high bureaucratization. At the mid-twentieth century Germany, Japan, Russia, and America have all developed similar basic structures, technologies, industries, cities, sciences, schools, and communication media. In all of these areas they have had forced on them a number of correspondingly similar problems. It is likely that whatever solutions to these pressing con- temporary problems are developed in one such culture will be relevant to the similar problems of the others. This may apply even to such basic constitutional issues as the problem of realizing democratic leadership and consent under bureaucratic conditions. This is another reason in support of the general proposition which is the conclusion of this analysis; namely, that the situation in Russia is such that, through careful analysis and policy formation, we may so construct our own policies and so direct our own actions, throughout the world, that relatively more liberal and peace-regarding forces will be enhanced inside Russia, and their opponents relatively discredited. It is through this new type of balance-of-power politics that a statesmanlike foundation may be laid for the ultimate resolution of the conflicts between Russia and America. 33 Constitutional Dictatorship (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1948).

Game theory incorporates many of the assumptions about behavior made by classical economic theory. In making this explicit it has redirected attention to these assumptions. It is clear that if conditions were such that (1) the conclusions actually work in practice even though founded on fictional assumptions, or (2) the distortions in the assump- tions are irrelevant to the empirical problems actually confronted (as with the assumption of absence of friction in Newtonian physics prior to the nineteenth century), or (3) if it is possible to manipulate actual conditions to make them fit the otherwise distorting assumptions, then we may agree with Martin Shubik's defense of fictional problem-solving models.2 However, it is contended below that there are special character- istics of game theory which limit its application to problems of political analysis. The founders of game theory asserted that it was generally applicable to the social sciences. Since 1944 a number of scholars have explored these possibilities, most prominently in sociology,3 military strategy,4 and political science.5 In any theoretical system maintaining rigorously individualistic (microanalytical) assumptions this may be valid. Talcott Parsons, in giving primacy to goal-seeking human actions, has developed a system which con- tains game theory potentials. Many types of power analysis (such as nine- teenth-century balance-of-power assumptions) concentrate on relations be- tween discrete power units in competition for scarce values.

The liberal tradition in political theory which sprang from Locke and was developed into the microanalytical sys- tems of utilitarian economics and individualism also lends itself to game theory applications.7 Arthur F. Bentley's extension of microanalytical principles from indivi. duals to groups8 and the many succeeding applications9 of this approach indicate further possible applications of game theory throughout the "deci- sion-making" process.,0 This amounts to eradicating the distinction between political and economic analysis. " Such an eradication is implicit in Gal- braith's equilibrium analysis of politico-economic countervailing powers,12 and explicit in Herbert Simon's uses of mathematical models for solving problems of social analysis.13 However, there are many difficulties. Jacob Marschak has pointed out some of them. (1) The notion of unique solutions depends ultimately upon assuming certain "accepted standards of behavior" which rule out various types of violence.14 (2) The assumption that everyone is interested in long- run gains is a distortion particularly important in political behavior.15 (3) Game theory requires what Abraham Wald called the conversion of "economic man" into "statistical man.""6 There may be special conditions making this valid but they appear to occur under high bureaucratization. (4) However, it cannot be assumed that individual valuations are mathe- matically addable and transferable (this is the assumption of "transitivity") .1 Karl W.

Jessie Bernard19 has emphasized that game theory requires (7) pre- knowledge of the rules of the game, and that (8) it has poor application in revolutionary situations and (9) where death is probable.20 Duncan Black's unification of political and economic theory21 appears to run into an insuperable difficulty over the differences between money (economic exchange) and power (political hierarchy). For though it is true that in some empirical situations the two appear to be roughly inter- changeable, their precise virtues are that they are distinct. Money is an impersonal medium for expressing relationship; power is a personal relation- ship. Applications of this difference may be seen in comparing payoffs in money with those in power. Money payoffs provide numerical degrees of shares in depersonalized matter. One of the virtues as well as the defects of money is that it even depersonalizes human labor. Power payoffs provide personal dominance. They alter conditions of independence often described in terms of freedom and slavery. This is the chief difficulty in applying economic market assumptions of comparative utility functions to the politi- cal power arena of a conference.22 Recent developments in game theory purport to analyze "games against nature" in which "the United States and Russia may be conceived of ... as playing a two-person non-'zero sum' game with nature as the third player: only nature wins from atomic destruction, only nature loses if resources need not be diverted to military purposes."23 Professor Kaplan points out the diffi- culty, however: "the coalition of men against nature still leaves open how the utilities acquired in the game are to be divided between the participants. And here conflicting interests stand in the way of the joint interests that would make rational a coalition strategy."24 And although it is suggested that we may expect soon a solution of the mathematical difficulties in games against nature25 this does not resolve doubts about the legitimacy of games against nature according to the original game theory assumptions whereby 11 Op. cit. 20 Ibid., p. 423, relying on the findings of Hans Neisser, "The Strategy of Expecting the Worst."

Games against nature appear to circle back on the assumptions, reintro- ducing classical (n-person) equilibrium under the aegis of mathematical simplification. This leads to other questions, directly pertinent to the political applica- tions of game theory. For if one starts out with a game between the United States and Russia, and then converts that game into a new one made up of a coalition of the United States and Russia co-operating against nature, the important political questions are: Where did the new game come from? Who invented it? How was it brought into being? What are the con- tractual conditions under which the coalition proceeds in its co-operative struggle against nature? These are precisely the crucial political difficulties in conflict situations. It is just the impossibility of devising a joint game against nature which is one definition of a cold war. To have "resolved" it theoretically by substituting a new game for the old may be offered as a hope for the future, but in begging the critical question of how the new game is produced it also illustrates the failure of a two-person game to end itself in conflict resolution. This may be seen more clearly through a related situation: Given two players named Morgenstern and von Neumann, can it be assumed that their discrete competitive moves would ever have added up to a total pat- tern entitled The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior short of explicit and rational "political" acts between them whereby definite terms of co- operation formally created a political union for the accomplishment of specified goals? Their newly created game against nature (the co-operative writing of a book) cannot be extrapolated from the previous disunified situ- ation which existed between a discrete economist and a discrete mathema- tician, conceived in the relationships described by game theory. It is precisely the creation of new games, and the establishment of "rules of the game" and "accepted standards of behavior" 26 which is a rational political act unanalyzable at game theory as it now stands. However, it may be possible to change the assumptions, making them political, somewhat like the "dialectical" process described in the "new balance-of-power politics." The political assumption characteristic of classical economic theory is that a political resolution of all conflicts is implicit in the conflicts them- selves; that there is an underlying harmony which will assert itself if not inhibited. In theory, this requires the assumption that microanalytical com- ponents will add up to a total pattern which will be valid "macroanalyti- cally" (considering the problems of the system as a total unit). However, it is precisely Professor Morgenstern who has most notably disproved the "6 Marschak, op. cit., p. 104.</page><page sequence="40">PROBLEMS OF STALINISM 673 theoretical validity of this operation with reference to the relationships be- tween the sum of discrete individual demand functions and an aggregate demand curve.27 His arguments against deriving a national income from the sum of individual incomes are just those which also disprove the validity of using game theory, which is suited to the "eristical" opposition of discrete units, to derive a "dialectical" political settlement in the interests of the entire system. The proof of this statement requires a distinction be- tween politics and economics. Characteristically different types of conflict distinguish politics and economics. Political conflict is action-arresting. Economic conflict is action- enhancing. A strike shutdown pending the resolution of a dispute between labor and management, and a series of bids and counterbids in a market higgling process are two types of behavior normally termed economic. But considered as types of conflicts rather than as types of reward-seeking, the two actions are diametrically opposed. The first is political, the second is economic. The first is a power struggle which inhibits action and progress until the conflict itself has been resolved. An indefinite expansion of the first type of conflict--such a condition would be a "political" general strike - would destroy society. The second, "economic," type of conflict is action-enhancing. It involves competitive attempts to maximize shares of scarce values. It involves con- tract and exchange. Its indefinite expansion may be a positive benefit to society. Politics takes place in an arena, such as a parliament, designed to facilitate the expression and the creative resolution of conflicts, as in the arbitration of a strike or the forging of a great diplomatic or political coali- tion. Politics is the system-generating business of inventing new rules of the game, new standards of behavior, and new hierarchical structures. Eco- nomics is the intra-systemic business of reallocating scarce values under those rules. What may be designated as classical political theory assumes that basic political conflicts will not resolve themselves and must instead be resolved explicitly and rationally by human beings. For even if one followed the classical economic assumption of immanent self-assertive harmony, it would 27 The first systematic reference to this type of problem occurs in Plato's Republic. The whole point of the opening sections is to demonstrate the impossibility of making meaningful propositions about the nature of a political system taken as a whole (macroanalytical, in the terms of the present discussion) on the basis of observations concerning its individual components (microanalytical, in this discussion). Oskar Morgenstern's discussion of this problem is limited; it occurs in "Demand Theory Reconsidered," Quarterly Journal of Economics, LXII (1948), 171 ff., 175 ff. Sidney Schoeffler also comes very close to this point in The Failures of Economics (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955), pp. 18 ff.; the most rigorous application of this prin- ciple to economic theory is found in Ludwig von Mises, Human Action (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1949), "The Principle of Methodological Singularism," pp. 44 ff. This work provides a rigorously microanalytical philosophy for the entire range of economic speculation.</page><page sequence="41">674 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY be necessary to demonstrate where the harmony came from (in game theory, where the new game came from), why it could not be politically discovered, and why it could only assert itself irrationally. The application of game theory to political conflict as here defined is theoretically invalid (though there are many empirical situations known as "politics," such as party competition for the reallocation of scarce ballots, which can be analyzed through the game theory). More than this, its appli- cation imports a characteristic distortion due to the lack of underlying rules. For a model which in an established order need not envisage "eristical" defeat or victory must do so when placed in the empirical situation of "the war of every man against every man." Game theory applied to American-Soviet relations (though not necessarily to the different system of Anglo-American relations) can thus be said to prevent rather than foster "dialectical" conflict resolution, for it does not provide for the conception of the political behavior necessary before the assumptions of game theory will cohere with nonbelligerent relationships.</page></plain_text>
