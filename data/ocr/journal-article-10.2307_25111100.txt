<plain_text><page sequence="1">230 COLLEGE LITERATURE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM Vectors in Recent Moby-Dick Criticism Claude Hunsberger [Periodical abbreviations used here conform to the ML A International Bibliography master list.] For the Melville critic, "the Whiteness" of Moby Dick, the whiteness of infinite time and space, "the heartless voids and immensities of the uni verse," the whiteness of the blank page and the blanker page of the self, demands an explanation, a shape, a hint of color, a local habitation and a name, a response to Cotton Mather's catechistic formula Quid sum??Nil. That whiteness, whether a metaphor for the emptiness of internal con sciousness or the diaphanous noumena behind harlot-painted, multichrome realities, perplexes critical intelligence and releases an exegetical impulse, a frenetic Faustian Drang, to codify the novel's ontological density. The games that critics play with Moby-Dick in the publish-or-perish groves of academe, of course, have their benign pay-offs?promotion, recogni tion, status, identity ?but embedded in the massive blubber, the often re petitive, superficial, meretricious articles and books that the scholarship industry produces in dissecting and flaying the Whale, there are signifi cant critical statements that penetrate the novel's deepest interstices and redeem the profession from inanity. The more-to-be-pitied-than-censured critics, like the Pequod's fractured crew and its thunder-smitten captain, "renegades, castaways, and cannibals," hunger for meaning and truth, and their subterranean mining, as a collective enterprise to lend articula tion to "dumb blankness," has at least given the contemporary reader more insight into Moby-Dick's devious intricacies than Melville's critics possess ed in 1851. For taxonomic convenience books and articles on Moby-Dick since the 1971 edition of Eight American Authors can be categorized in terms of critical vectors that indicate the direction and magnitude of recent Melville scholarship. Source studies (tracing the Whale's genealogy, naming the bones, muscles, joints, glands, connective tissue, organs, reproductive and otherwise, veins and arteries in its leviathanic anatomy, mixing use ful discoveries with ill-considered trifles) recur with high frequency. Despite shifts in emphasis and tendency, history-of-ideas analyses, with their accent on intellectual, philosophical, metaphysical and religious inquiry, have undergone a resurgence, while socio-political investigations have passed into relative eclipse. As in the decade prior to the 1971 Eight American Authors, the primary interest resides in formalistic and psycho logical criticism, with modern Moby-Dick mincers continuing to derive</page><page sequence="2">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 231 their instruments and strategies for dissecting the whale from new criti cism, structuralism, Freudian and Jungian depth psychology, existentialism and archetypal criticism. Finally, critical anthologies and bibliographical and textual studies, Hershel Parker's "bounty of bibliographical guides," offer the reader and critic the cartographic data necessary to navigate the murky waters of Moby-Dick criticism and penetrate the novel's "vital center." I Ideally source studies should function to enrich literary texture through identifying the writer's relation to tradition and demonstrating his capacity for fusing his total experience into what Eliot calls "a new compound." Some researchers, however, occasionally disregard Rosamund Tuve's dictum that only sources that "illuminate meaning and thus deepen feeling" have critical value or confuse echo with influence, ignoring the impact of shared traditions on literary creation. Bruce E. Kirkham in an exercise of shrewd entrepreneurship manages to squeeze two articles out of "the Iron Crown of Lombardy," a reference annotated in the Mansfield-Vincent Moby-Dick (1952). The first article, "The Iron Crown of Lombardy in Moby-Dick (ESQ 58 [1970] : 127-29), supplies encyclopedic information on the crown's historical provenience, its legendary derivation from nails of the true cross and its association with Charles V, Napoleon and Franz Joseph, tyrannical counterparts to Ahab. The synec dochic reference to the Biblical crown of thorns supposedly transfigures Ahab into a death bearing, rather than redemptive, Christ. The second article, "Melville and the Iron Crown of Lombardy" (AN&amp;Q 10 [ 1972 J : 133-34), rehearses the same information, adding minor details and suggesting the crown be interpreted in the context of Moby-Dick circle symbolism. The existence of three previous articles on the relation between Moby-Dick and lob is evi dentally not enough to deter Janis Stout from again commenting on symbolic and thematic parallels between the two works. "Melville's Use of The Book of Job" (NCF 25 [ 1970]: 69 83) performs a minor service in relating Job to Hebrew Wisdom literature and Christian traditions of via negativa and docta ignorantia, though it concludes rather conventionally that Melville's exploitation of Job reveals a "progression from questioning to bitter defiance to resigned acceptance of the irrational necessity of evil." Another study, Thomas Werge's Moby-Dick: Scriptural Source of 'Blackness of Darkness'" (AN&amp;Q 9 [ 1970]: 6) traces the phrase to Sartor Resartus, Edwards' "Future Punishment of the Wicked" and The Epistle of Jude. Ignoring a reference in the Mansfield-Vincent Moby-Dick, Robert L. Carothers and John J. Marsh ("The Whale and the Panorama," NCF 26 [l97l] : 319-28) suggest that Melville found "visual inspiration" for Moby-Dick in Benjamin Russell's and Caleb Purrington's "A Whaling Voyage Round the World." The authors conjecture that Melville may have seen the famous panorama, which Samuel E. Morison calls "A pictorial counterpart" to Moby-Dick, and cite graphic parallels to substantiate that assumption. Herbert Rothchild ("The Language of Mesmerism in 'The Quarterback Scene' in Moby Dick" ES 53 [ 1972 ] : 235-38) traces symbolic and structural parallels between Mesmer's baquet, a ritual circle, and the psychodynamic ceremony in which Ahab emerges as a domi nant force in a "magnetizer-somnambulist relationship." Despite Newton Arvin's claim that Moby-Dick is devoid "of symbolic blooms and allegorical isles and Spenserian bowers," John O. Rees, Jr., ("Spenserian Analogues in Moby-Dick," ESQ 68 [1972] : 174-78) has detected figurative and thematic Spenserian echoes in "The Symphony" and "The Chase ?First Day." Obstacles to Sir Guyon's assault on the Bower of Bliss, the alabaster-white "witch-siren," seductive mermaids, storm, fog, whirlpool, coincide with portentious omens, hazards and al lurements diverting Ahab from his quest. The whale itself, a swan-white Jove from the "Pro</page><page sequence="3">232 COLLEGE LITERATURE thalamion" incarnated as the white-bull ravisher of Europa, with its aromatic armamentarium, "perfume," "musk," "myrrh," its "erotic sensuosity" (Richard Chase) and its "musical rip pling," rises from the sea as an enticing siren from Spenser's "Bower of Bliss." Correcting a spurious citation in Feidelson's Moby-Dick (1965), Gerhard T. Alexis, in "Two Footnotes on a Faceless Whale" (AN&amp;Q 11 [ 1973]: 99-100) traces Ishmael's allusion to the whale's facelessness to Exodus 33:23, noting duplicate images in Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici and Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel. As a contribution to the endeavor to measure Hawthorne's impact on Melville, Mark L. Asquino ("Hawthorne's 'Village Uncle' and Melville's Moby-Dick," SSF 10 [ 1973]: 413-14) argues that the story's old fisherman narrator, a burnt-out fire gazer, inhabits a wasteland for exhausted men that anticipates the funeral, labyrinthine shore world that Ishmael traverses in Moby-Dick. Melville has trans mogrified the whale-bone entrance to the fisherman's honeymoon cottage into the sinister bar in the Spouter Inn, a symbol of "disintegration and death." For archetype hunters extra ordinaire, G. R. Thompson ("A Visual Analogue for The Cassock' Chapter of Moby-Dick?" Extracts, No. 18 [May, 1974]: 1-2) has conjured up from the pages of Konrad Gessner's Historia Animalium a chimerical "bishop-like sea monster" with phallic contours (the original "archbishoprick") .* II Intellectual, philosophical, metaphysical, epistemological and religious themes in Moby Dick have persistently engaged critical attention, generating dramatic controversy and acri monious exchange. In the history of ideas context, current analysis has primarily focused on the novel's exploration of religious and metaphysical problems, though the tendency to mea sure its epistemological and ontological dimensions represents a significant secondary trend. Thomas Werge, for example, in "Moby-Dick and the Calvinist Tradition" (SNNTS 1 [ 1969]: 484-506) combines both interests in examining metaphysical and epistemological Calvinism in Melville's novel. Calvin's insistence in The Institutes that human intellectual deficiencies (fallen man as corrupted imago Dei) function as an impediment to comprehendng self, nature and God finds a counter in Ishmael's ontological and epistemological skepticism. References in the novel illustrate the insufficiency of human knowledge and suggest that the Calvinist dread of the abyss merges with the terror of whiteness. Calvinistic condemnation of the over reaching Faustian impulse expressed in Ahab's monomania finds its symbolic analog in the annihilative "shipwreck and death" that culminate his abortive quest. Ishmael's survival in the context of Werge's interpretation, however, retains its ambiguity and Moby-Dick con cludes without a clear resolution, since it reflects Melville's "ambivalence toward a God who may be man's redeemer but who is accessible neither to man's knowing nor will and whose power destroys those who seek to know fully and rebel against his judgments." Disre garding ontological and epistemological consideration, T. Walter Herbert, Jr. ("Calvinism and Cosmic Evil in Moby-Dick, PMLA 84 [ 1969]: 1613-19) suggests that the novel dramatizes a contemporary religious controversy between Calvinism and anti-Calvinism to define "an actual cosmic evil which challenges the validity of Christian theology altogether." The anti Calvinist's characterization of Calvin's God as "a brutal monster" conditions Ahab's concep tion of Moby Dick as a "symbol for a malignant God who, according to an 'infernal afore thought of ferocity,' created a race of men in order to destroy the greater part of them, and as a means of doing so decreed the fall of Adam." On the other hand, though, Melville has assimilated Calvin's characterization of Ahab in The Institutes, the hubristic reprobate whose intellectual overreaching predestines him to madness and damnation. As a consequence, the reader "may take Ahab's final assault as the climax of a heroic boldness in the face of divine injustice, or we may take it as an expression of egoistic vindictiveness goaded into frenzy."</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 233 In his examination of the religious significance of Moby-Dick, John T. Frederick, in The Darkened Sky (Notre Dame, Ind., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, 1969), focuses on the impact of sectarianism, "higher criticism," and Darwinian evolution on religious tensions in the nine teenth-century American novel. According to Frederick, Melville as a novelist passes from a "painful abandonment of the Christian position" to final acceptance in Billy Budd and the last poems. In Moby-Dick, a novel with significantly few references to Christ and Christianity, Ahab acts out Bayle's assertion in Lyttleton's "Locke and Bayle" that "the mind is free and that rebellion against tyranny is a natural right." Pitted against Ahab, "the obdurate rebel," Star buck, "the only positively Christian character in Moby Dick," reveals "the inadequacy of Christian virutes." An unusual analysis of Melville's novel as a vehicle for a dramatic initia tion to religious consciousness, Morton L. Ross' "Moby-Dick As An Education" (SNNTS 6 [1974]: 62-75) explores pedagogic strategies for inducing reader reaction to experience through developing kinaesthetic responses to the great whale. Such a "sensuous apprehen sion" of the whale's leviathanic majesty and power should lead to the question of "right wor ship" central to "the American nineteenth century debate about the organizing modes of religious feeling which began with the transcendental reaction to Unitarianism and may be said to conclude with William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience."2 The demonic side of Christianity comes into consideration in Helen P. Trimpi's "Melville's Use of Demonology and Witchcraft in Moby-Dick" (JHI 30[ 1969]: 543-62). Trimpi contends that Melville's intention "to write a romance using the various superstitions about the Devil led most importantly to the idea of a hero deceived and destroyed by a supernatural power in the form of an animal." After tabulating nineteen elements from European and American myth, legend and folklore that "enter significantly into the structure and the characteriza tions of Moby-Dick," she argues that Melville's familiarity with "oby" witchcraft, an African form of occultism in vogue among romantic writers, explains the change from Mocha to Moby Dick. Mukhtar A. Isani's "Zoroastrianism and the Fire Symbolism in Moby-Dick (AL 44 [ 1972 ] : 385-97) focuses on another form of occultism drawn from an esoteric mythic and religious source that augments the novel's symbolic and metaphysical dimensions. Commit ted to an irrational quest that duplicates the cosmic struggle between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, Fedallah ("mercy of God") represents "the orthodox quester who believes and obeys," Ahab, "the rebel quester who questions and defies." Their diametrical reactions to fire (one, "reverence," the other "defiance") indicates a fusion of occidental and oriental fire symbolism that emblematically charts Ahab's predestined transition from birth to death and from creative to destructive fire. Despite the intensity of their dedication both "the rebel quester" and "the orthodox quester" fail to penetrate the universe's "metaphysical mysteries." Two recent articles dealing with cosmic ambiguity focus on Moby-Dick's ontological impli cations. William K. Spofford ("Melville's Ambiguities: A Re-evaluation of 'The Town-Ho's Story,'" AL 41 [ 1969]: 264-70) critically rejects interpretations that stress the tale's Christian iconography and vindicatory theodicy and reassesses the Radney-Steelkilt encounter as a dra matization of divine capriciousness and a reflection of an indeterminant universe. Also re jecting alleged critical oversimplications of Melville's crisis of belief, Edward J. Rose, in "Annihilation and Ambiguity: Moby-Dick and "The Town-Ho's Story" (NEQ 45 [ 1972] : 541 58), claims that both novel and story focus on "the antinomies of [ a] fallen world." In such an ambiguous world, Ishmael's survival is both irrational and absurd, while Ahab's tragic heroics are reduced to "futile attempts to grasp his own ambiguity as he sees it objectified in the faceless, white whale to which he is literally tied like a strangled still-born babe to its mother." Given the cosmic incertitude inherent in a cosmos fissured into sexual, meta physical, moral and ontological polarities, only existential "shipwreck" (Jaspers), the nothing ness revealed in moments of crisis, can produce Ishmael's Emersonian insight into "the Being of Transcendence." But Ishmael in his ambiguous survival merges with the Rachel's lost</page><page sequence="5">234 COLLEGE LITERATURE Joseph, whose coat of many colors transforms into "a dust rag for our consumptive mortality for, like Joseph, we are headed for the pit?for annihilation." Two engaging studies, both cognizant of Moby-Dick s ontological density, grapple with the novel's ostensible epistemological dualism and the constitutive function of consciousness. Thomas E. Lucas, in "Herman Melville: The Purpose of the Novel" (TSLL 13 [ 1972]: 641 61) examines Melville's conception of fiction as instrument for optimally revealing conven tional and epistemological "Truth." In the first context, fiction as "the Great Art of Telling the Truth" surveys reality qua reality and culminates in the tragic recognition that a universe "two-thirds in darkness" weaves "black and bright" strands into an inextricable tangle. Mel ville's epistemic inquiries lead beyond naive realism to focus on the failure of Lockean empiricism and Kantian idealism to encompass the complexity of the black-bright world and penetrate the noumena. Despite the eye-mind's gratuitous capacity for transforming sensory data into experiential wholes and the illusory fusion of knower and known suggested in Ish mael's reference to Narcissus, the impossibility of gaining insight into Kant's "unconditioned reality" or the fissured inner self places questions concerning man, world and creator beyond human comprehension. Ishmael can only circumvent the epistemic tragedy that claims Ahab through contenting himself with "attainable felicities." Robert Zoellner's The Salt Sea Mastodon (Berkeley, Univ. of Calif. Press, 1973), a provocative philosophical, epistemological and ontological excursion into Moby-Dick, distinguishes between "Ahabian and Ishmaelian" epistemologies. Each produces diametrical conceptions of the whale-universe, the first, frag mentary, dualistic and dissociative, the second, synthetic, holistic and imaginative. Ahab's vision results from an inner fracture, a fissure between external and internal selves that separates consciousness from phenomena and infers an inaccessible transcendent arcanum. As a function of his conceptual oversimplification of reality, Ahab ossifies into an absolutist tyrant, a retaliatory aggressor in a "thumper-thumpee" universe. Through experiential encoun ters with the whale-universe, Ishmael, however, synthesizes perception and intuition, fact and imagination, phenomena and noumena, encompassing Lockean and Kantian epistemolo gies and realizing a fusion of consciousness and its datum. Studies, such as Georges Poulet's Studies in Human Time and Interior Distance, which ex ploit time and space as either conditions of consciousness or matrices of experience, frequent ly represent a fusion of history of ideas analysis, existentialism and structuralism. In recent years three articles on Moby-Dick treat space or time as structural concomitants to experi ence and consciousness. Carl F. Strauch, in "Ishmael: Time and Personality in Moby-Dick" {SNNTS 1 [ 1969]: 468-83) attributes temporal dislocations in Ishmael's experience to trau matic confrontations with reality and yet considers them fictive strategums for effecting "dramatic irony" through past-future juxtapositions. Ishmael's "philosophical last will and testament," in "The Gilder," moreover, defines a cyclical conception of time and history that corresponds to Emerson's curve of temporal development in "The American Scholar." Ishmael, according to Strauch, discovers meaning in "pursuing the cycle of belief and un belief," while Ahab's "suicidal quest for meaning in a meaningless universe" results in tem poral exhaustion and self-destruction. In their respective quests, Ahab and Ishmael, arche typal twins, "drop clock time and transmute that into mythical time." But Ishmael through "his imaginative response to the whale universe" and his love for Queequeg undergoes a psychological metamorphosis as he passes through the vortex's "vital center" to assimilate "all epochs, all time" and resolve "the Romantic quest for meaning." Eric Voegelin's historic al concepts of "wholeness" and "deformity" exert significant influence on James L. Babin's reading of Moby-Dick as a dramatization of the, soul's quest for transcendent openness. "Mel ville and the Deformation of Being: From Typee to Leviathan" (SoR 7 [ 1971]: 89-114) isolates two modes of historical fugue in American culture and literature: a "return to an intimate relationship with primal nature" and a Utopian quest for perfection in temporal order. While</page><page sequence="6">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 235 these strategies of escape dominate the early romances, in Moby-Dick Melville abandons the quest for the lost Eden and the temporal Utopia and seeks an alternative solution through a direct confrontation with temporal reality which presents his dual protagonists Ahab and Ishmael with the existential choice to either "live or 'curse God, and die.'" In the context of Voegelin's formula, Ishmael achieves salvation through openness to experience and accept ance of suffering as a means of coping with time and history through direct confrontation. After a confused prolegomena, Carl A. Bredahl, in Melville's Angles of Vision (Gainsville, Univ. of Florida, 1972), argues that spatial, temporal and psychological perspectives in Moby-Dick define characteristic reactions to reality and contribute to a description of a uni verse that is ultimately incomprehensible. Ishmael's ability to transcend his "physical per spective" suggests "that will is a major ingredient in psychological perspective and, there fore, in action." Ahab, in contrast, recognizes diverse perspectives but persists in a mono maniacal course. A concentration on philosophical modalities determines the analytical strategy in four essays that focus on Melville's Weltanschauung. Paul McCarthy, in "The Extraordinary Man as Idealist in the Novels of Hawthorne and Melville" (ESQ 54 [ 1969]: 43-51), claims that Ishmael, an Emersonian poet, transcends the minutiae of experience and achieves an organic vision of reality through intuitive apprehension. With a similar emphasis on syncretic or ganicism, Joyce Adler, in "The Imagination and Melville's Endless Probe for Relation" (ATQ 19 [ 1973]: 37-42), approaches Moby-Dick as "a symbolic poem about the world and its place in relation to all existence." Ishmael, again transcendentalized into a quasi Emersonian, represents man's potential for escaping "the old rigid circle of the chase to become integrated into the continuum of life in time and space." In contrast to critics that revel in Melville's ontological optimism, Sanford Sternlicht ("Sermons in Moby-Dick" BSUF 10 [1969]: 51-52) contends that Fleece's sermon to the sharks rather than Father Mapple's Calvinistic redaction of the Jonah story functions as an analog to Melville's novel and articulates his pessimistic philosophy. In a bizarre polemic, Michael Hoffman ("The Anti-Transcenden talism of Moby-Dick," QaR 23 [ 1969] : 3-16) reduces Melville's novel to a trenchant parody on "Transcendental style," sensibility and vision, which presents the white whale as a symbol devoid of meaning, Ahab as a self-reliant egomaniac ranting Emersonian platitudes, and the Pequod's quest as a voyage without purpose. Ill The tendency to see Moby-Dick as a mirror reflecting social crises, technological revolu tion and political controversy has prompted critics in the past to interpret the novel as a par able of totalitarianism's triumph over "impotent good," a conservative allegory and an anti slavery tirade.3 Recent criticism reiterates this concern with the novel's social, economic and political dimensions. Among the ideological yea-sayers, Ray B. Browne, in Melville's Drive to Humanism (Lafayette, Ind., Purdue Univ. Press, 1971) lauds Moby-Dick as a great American epic, an amalgam of popular theater, folklore, frontier humor and sex, celebrating the triumph of "Man Over Superman." In Browne's paralogical rendition of Moby-Dick as musical comedy, Ishmael, both "common sailor" and "demi-god," languishes under "de-sexed" Ahab's totalitarian dispensation until he finally achieves his "apotheosis" as "a symbol for the rise of the common man." His survival as a quintessential democrat assimilating "paganism, Christianity, and all other religions" anticipates the post-lapsarian emergence of "a new race." Another writer to see Melville as a racial egalitarian with "a consistent respect for man's instinctive sense of his own dignity," Edward S. Grejdi (The Common Continent of Men: Equality in the Writings of Herman Melville, Port Washington, N.Y., Kennikat, 1974) reads the early novels as an indictment of white exploitation of non-whites and Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="7">236 COLLEGE LITERATURE as an expression of tolerance, humanity and brotherhood, with all men '"federated along one keel,' united in 'the common continent of men.'" For Harold Kaplan (Democratic Humanism and American Literature, Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1972) democratic value in Moby Dick emerges as an assertion against a neuter cosmos that questions, tests and perhaps nulli fies human ethical systems and "anthropomorphic illusions." This existential confrontation reduces Ahab from Promethean demi-god to hero from the "Kingly Commons," a mono maniacal protagonist who represents every man face to face with death in an impersonal universe. The "ruthless democracy" dramatized in "the contest with the whale itself . . . demonstrates the basis of equality" and establishes courage as a test for status in a demo cratic hierarchy. Stranded between Tocquevillean abysses, Ahab, a "democratic hero fallen from grace," degenerates through a perverse imitatione Ceti into an insane totalitarian who refuses to recognize and accept limited freedom. Interpretations of Moby-Dick as anti-fascist parable recur in the work of politicized critics protesting the tendency to bourgeois conformity, corporate opportunism and totalitarian arro gance in contemporary American civilization. Carl Oglesby, in a flamboyantly dithyrambic, savagely intemperate diatribe against capitalistic entrepreneurship and Faustian imperial ism, reads Moby-Dick as an apocalyptic prefiguration of a modern factory state, in which tran sistorized technology "reduces Leviathan to so much cat food and imitation butter" ("Mel ville, or Water Consciousness and Its Madness," TriQ 23-24 [ 1972]: 123-41). Ahab as Faus tian technocrat participates in a psychopathic vendetta against nature that anticipates modern racial exploitation and genocidal warfare. His laceration of the whale gauges the velocity, violence and rapacity of a entrepreneurial technocracy obsessed with overcoming death through scientific codification and transcendent Faustianism. According to Harry B. Hender son, in Versions of the Past: The Historical Imagination in American Fiction (New York, Oxford Univ. Press, 1974), Melville in Moby-Dick, turns away from the "revolt of 'violence and revenge'" consummated in White lacket to focus on a metaphysical dilemma, since the experiential chasm between consciousness and reality aborts any commitment to historical rectification. As an indication of this abandonment of historically necessary social reform, the Pequod crew's absorption in metaphysical rebellion "represents a perverse form of demo cratic centralism," while Ahab's command reverts into a "nightmare version of a Jacksonian democratic dictatorship." The idealist-materialist dichotomy in American socio-political thought from Transcenden talism to the present prompts Milton R. Stern, in "Moby-Dick, Millenial Attitudes, and Poli tics" (ESQ 54 [ 1969]: 51-60) to read Melville's novel as a warning against "the millenialist assumptions ... of the American Renaissance" and current ideological extremism. Restricting his discussion to Moby-Dick as a political novel, he analyzes Ahab as a dramatic vehicle for Melvillean commentary on "policies based on crusading American assumptions of the immedi ate possibility of absolute newness and total salvation," policies that could potentially rigidify into the totalitarian orthodoxy associated with concentration camps, political purges and wars waged in the name of Pax Americana. While millenialist absolutism consumes Ahab and his crew, Ishmael's accommodation to the limited world rooted in "the lowly needs of the common life," "the wife, the heart, the bed," realizes the "interindebtedness" that binds men in a common historical enterprise. IV Formalist criticism of Moby-Dick in recent years continues to focus on novelistic genre, structural architectonics, narrative perspective, style and symbolism. Critics attempting to force Moby-Dick into Procrustean genre categories have identified the novel as romance,</page><page sequence="8">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 237 tragedy, comedy, epic, burlesque, and, most recently, anatomy. Drawing on Feidelson, Fied ler, Lewis, Harry Levin and Daniel Hoffman, Joel Porte's The Romance in America: Studies in Cooper, Foe, Hawthorne, Melville, and James (Middletown, Conn., Wesleyan Univ. Press, 1969) defines the romance somewhat idiosyncratically as a literary form combining stylistics complexity, symbol, myth, archetype, parable, dream and fantasy to "explore large questions . . . about race, history, nature, human motivation and art." Though the book omits specific discussion of Moby-Dick, in analyzing other Melville romances it focuses on his preoccupa tion with primitivism, "hunting and being hunted, . . . the splendors and terrors of the physi cal world, . . . race, sex, time and eternity," and "the fall into experience." Robert D. Hume's "Gothic Versus Romantic: A Revaluation of the Gothic" (PMLA 84 [ 1969 ] : 282-90) instead locates Moby-Dick within parameters defining the Gothic novel, reducing Ahab to a Pro methean "villain-hero" and the white whale to a Frankenstein monster. Its moral inconclu siveness?"no message, no moral, no final statement of right and wrong"?conforms to the ambiguity of the Gothic Weltanschauung. Helen P. Trimpi ("Conventions of Romance in Moby-Dick," SoR 7 [1971]: 115-29) somewhat more pedestrianly bases her definition of romance on Sir Walter Scott's essay in the Encyclopedia Britannica (1824). As a romance in this context Moby-Dick incorporates materials from "real or fabulous history" ?legends of the white whale and Puritan superstition; its minstrel-narrator Ishmael, a "melancholy," credulous, uneducated seaman, uncritically transmits supernatural events "in which [he] believes and which he asks the reader to believe"; its hero Ahab has direct contact with the Devil through his auxiliaries, the "diabolically oracular Pip" and Fedallah. Moby-Dick's status as tragedy comes under consideration in two recent analyses.4 In "Mel ville and the Tragedy of Nihilism" (The Edge of Possibility: Tragic Forms in Literature, New York, Vanguard, 1972),5 Joyce Carol Oates sees tragedy as a destructive assault on quoti dian pieties. In Moby-Dick, confrontation with an inscrutable, polymorphous God, primitive, intellectual, demonic, terminates in annihilation, though annihilation comes to Ahab as a func tion of will, not fate, as a result of his compulsive demand for identity and parity. Paradoxic ally his vision of a dualistic universe, the battleground for cosmic war between good and evil, sustains his illusory tragic status and justifies his cosmic rebellion, the raging passion that en ergizes his existence and lends him a provisional identity as a "pseudo-god" in contention with "supreme order." Identifying Oedipus, Christ and Satan as dominant tragic archetypes, Dan Vogel (The Three Masks of American Tragedy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana State Univ. press, 1974) contends that Melville's obsession with tragic darkness in Moby-Dick determines Ahab's dramatic centrality as satanic rebel. As an ontogenic representative of the Satan archtype, Ahab derives his lineaments from Prometheus and Milton's Satan and embodies the "transcendental hubris" that refuses to submit to limit and goes down to defeat with a resounding "non serviam." Since in "American tragedy . . . the mask of Satan" merges with the masks of "Christ" and Job, his self-crucifying Jobian demand for knowledge provokes God's response in "the embodiment of the leviathan" and causes the tragic catastrophe in which the self-reliant "American hero dies in defiance of limitation." In an engaging, surprisingly convincing, attempt to categorize structural form in the Mel ville novel, Paul McCarthy ("Elements of Anatomy in Melville's Fiction," SNNTS 6 [ 1974 ] : 38-61) treats Moby-Dick as a development of the anatomy, a discursive, encyclopedic generic form dealing with "mental attitudes" (Frye) and inventorying "elements of the primitive, the magical, and the instinctual" (Stevick). Etymologies, "Extracts" playbill captions, epitaphs, sermons, encyclopedic inventories, philosophical and intellectual speculation on literature, science, history, biology and myth, fusions of narrative, description and reflection, amalga mations of "fact and legend," metaphysical rhapsodies and thematic variations, with the nar rator as a manipulative impressario, mimicking Melville's Weaver-God, directing the whole extravaganza, these diverse components define Moby-Dick as an anatomic tour de force.</page><page sequence="9">238 COLLEGE LITERATURE With the exception of Seelye's Ironic Diagram, which focuses on structure as a paradigm for apperceptive consciousness, current studies on Moby-Dick's internal dynamics confine themselves methodologically to analyzing the novel as a tragic or epic form. In Melville: The Ironic Diagram, John Seelye interprets Melvillean form as a juxtaposition of "contraries" that constitute the provisional parameters of a universe that defies rational encompassment. Ahab and Ishmael consequently function in tandem as "the creations of an artist who regard ed his art as a system of tensions produced by diagrammatic contrasts, a symposium of opposed viewpoints" rather than a systematic totality. With Ahab and Ishmael playing Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in an ironic romantic quest that can only terminate in Gotterdammerung annihilation, the dominant configurations in Moby-Dick fuse reciprocal and antagonistic geometries, the kinetic linear quest (narrative drama) with the circle, "the static, discursive cetological chapters, essays in skepticism given unity by Ishmael's insistence on the relativity of perception." Progressive linearity and the circle of relativistic speculation that begins and ends in the place of death, which is paradoxically the creative center, the vortex, find their rhetorical analogs in Ahab's self-parodic rodomontade and Ishmael's ironic "mockery." Peri odic line and circle juxtapositions emerging and dissolving in devious reciprocity structurally define a book which is "a cipher also, the result of paired possibilities and unreconcilable opposites." Three articles in the last six years offer variations on Moby-Dick's epic structure. In Daniel H. Garrison's "Melville's Doubloon and the Shield of Achilles" (NCF 26 [l97l] : 171-84), an inventory of parallels between these two cosmographic emblems provides the motive for discussing thematic, rhetorical, scenic, characterological and structural similarities in Moby-Dick and The Iliad. Significant examples of Homeric ecphrasis in the novel include the Spouter Inn painting, in which the whale appears as a solar theriomorph, and the doub loon, in which sun, ocean, mountain, equator and zodiacal constellations merge in a micro cosmic configuration. Garrison also contends that the novel's six-part development (Elridge) duplicates the symmetrical geometry and chiastic structure of The Iliad. Despite thematic, structural and rhetorical similarities, however, the epic worlds pictured on the shield and the doubloon suggest diametrical conceptions of reality, The Iliad reflecting a "universal, balanced vision of man's life," Moby-Dick projecting "an equation in which everything can cels out, like the weights in the scales of Libra, like the seasons in Quito ... or the conflict ing meanings extracted from the coin's cabalistics." As an analysis of structural dynamics, Harry L. Golemba's "The Shape of Moby-Dick" (SNNTS 5 [ 1973]: 197-210) tries to justify the narrative shifts in the novel as a Melvillean strategy for commenting "negatively on the nature of Ishmael's balanced, 'equal eye' vision." Both structure and plot, moreover, function to counterpoint "Ishmael's massive accumulation of diverse experience" against "Ahab's total commitment to one goal," so that the novel's six-part epic structure traces diametrical character transformations through critical phases. Since Ishmael consummates his transfor mation "from erring acolyte to novitiate to meditative Magian" in the novel's fifth section, the last section appropriately focuses on Ahab's "linear course to destruction." An essay deal ing with structural contrast in Melville's novel, Edward A. Stone's "The Other Sermon in Moby-Dick" (Costerius 4 11972]: 215-22) extends Howard Vincent's suggestion that Fleece's sermon to the sharks functions as a parodic antimasque to Father Mapple's masque. As a deliberate strategic interpolation, the second sermon reinforces the systematic opposition between the community of the devout in the Whalemen's Chapel and the "depraved and un regenerate" man-sharks serving under Ahab's demonic command. Recent debate on point of view in Moby-Dick has stressed Ishmael's narrative function and offered rationales for the novel's narrative inconsistencies. After an assessment of diver gent interpretations of Melvillean ambiguity, Edward A. Kearns ("Omniscient Ambiguity:</page><page sequence="10">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 239 The Narrators of Moby Dick and Billy Budd," ESQ 58 [ 1970]: 117-20) identifies the unreli able narrator as a source of ambiguity in both works. Ishmael's preoccupation with compre hending a universe of ontological ambiguities and recording the complex, often contradictory data of consciousness, explains his narrative unreliability and'justifies his omniscient per spective in the novel's concluding sections. Narrative inconsistencies, rather than generating confusion, moreover, coerce the reader to expand his interpretative faculties to evaluate the ambiguity inherent in the self and in reality. Barry Marks ("Retrospective Narrative in Nine teenth Century American Literature," CE 31 [1970] : 366-75), in contrast, sees narrative perspective in Moby-Dick as a unique extension of American romanticism that "cuts across traditional genre classifications, and which became the foundation of American literature in the nineteenth century." The tension between narrative past ("past-time story") and narra tive present ("writing-time story") produces a "dramatized narrator" (Wayne Booth) who reconstitutes himself through self-analysis and explanatory retrospection and engages the reader in a comparable evaluative process. As a result of the self dynamically changing in process, Ishmael's discovery of an omniscient stance in the concluding section of Moby-Dick incorporates "in the narrative present . . .the very quality of unself-consciousness which he had long ago learned to admire in his friend Queequeg, and with it ... he acts (i.e., speaks) freely and effectively." A more technical analysis of point of view, Franz Stanzel's Narrative Situations in the Novel: Tom Jones, Moby-Dick, The Ambassadors, Ulysses (Bloomington, Indiana Univ. Press, 1971) also focuses on the first person narrator as a composite of experi ential and narrative selves. The narrative procedures deployed in Moby-Dick satisfy the reader's "illusion expectancy" through sustaining the integrity of narrative perspective by periodically returning to the persona. As a result, the narrative self can oscillate between an "incorporeal, indefinite existence," exempt from spatio-temporal limitations, and "a fully cor poreal mode of existence" without violating the reader's demand for fictive consistency. A quasi-Freudian conception of the narrative self's psychological function emerges from Frederick Busch's "The Whale as Shaggy Dog: Melville and 'The Man Who Studied Yoga'" (MFS 19 [ 1973]: 193-206). Unlike critics who examine the narrative distance between sub jective and objective selves, Busch concentrates on the problem of creating a narrative voice that simultaneously reveals and objectifies the self's repressed potentialities. In this recon stitutive endeavor the writer (Melville-Mailer) functions as a psychological obstretrician en gaged in delivering the foetal self, an alter-ego hero capable of articulating dark revelations and shattering pronunciamentos. In this respect Ahab functions as Ishmael's fictional double, as a ventriloquistic voice externalizing inner anger and turmoil, dramatizing a volcanic psychomachia, and emitting blasphemous, iconoclastic and quasi-insane utterances (Lear's "sane madness"). If symbolism is a dominant mode in nineteenth century American literature, symbol hunt ing has become a dominant pastime in recent Moby-Dick criticism. For Howard P. Vincent ("Ishmael, Writer and Art Critic," in Themes and Directions In American Literature, Lafay ette, Ind., Purdue Univ. Press, 1969), the whale hunt in Moby-Dick symbolizes the act of creation, while the painting in the Spouter Inn, " a ritual icon of the Pequod's quest," extern alizes Ishmael's conscious state and offers a satirical commentary on the novel that anticipates its public reception. As a symbolic replica the painting functions as a "trope" for the novel's inexhaustible meaning, thematic diversity and cosmic complexity. In "The Unshored World of Moby Dick" (CR 13 [ 1970]: 68-83), Graham Burns, rejecting Auden's conception of the sea as a symbol for life in general, examines the critical relation between land and sea with reference to the Pequod's voyage from inland restrictions to the "ambiguous freedom and possibility of the sea." Though the sea offers "the possibility of renewal" and un trammeled imaginative expression, Burns finds it "elusive in its final, total significance," for with the promise of spiritual discovery and regeneration comes confrontation with the unknown and</page><page sequence="11">240 COLLEGE LITERATURE threatening annihilation. That threat has such a traumatic impact on the consciousness that ironically the land, the place of death and insufficiency, becomes identified with "an ambigu ous comfort," though the sea as "a realm of freedom and threat" retains its symbolic power to tease the reader out of thought. Julian C. Rice ("Ship as Cosmic Symbol in Moby Dick and Benito Cereno?" CentR 16 [ 1972]: 138-54) focuses on Melville's ironic exploitation of conventional ship-as-world, captain-as-God symbolism as a strategy for questioning tradi tional assumptions and expectations. In a universe under the command of an incompetent or derelict captain, a remote Deus Absconditus, "the horror of Moby Dick's whiteness resides in the possibility that the world-soul is imbecilic and Promethean heroism only a mad energy directed at blankness." The Pequod itself, according to Rice, represents a Calvanistic universe under the jurisdiction of a punitive God, whose repertoire of responses ranges from "cosmic in difference to anger." With all its replications, the ship as symbol finally reveals "a skepticism concerning the teleological purpose or divine guidance in the universe." Relating cosmic con figuration to experiential rhythm and world view, Darrel Griffiths ("Circles and Orphans," BBr 24 [ 1971]: 68-81) identifies circle symbols in "The Grand Armada," "The Castaway," "The Chase" and the "Epilogue" as insulated spheres, static points of refuge in a turbulent, kinetic universe, associated with the abandonment and reemergence of castaways and orphans. Melville's protagonists, like figures in a Dantesque hell, are stranded on the circle's periphery, condemned to trace an endless "round," while making periodic "brief forays into the 'calm' of its center."6 V Freud and his epigone have had their impact on modern critics infatuated with the "rare ambiguous monster that had maimed [Melville's] sex" (Auden). Emphasis on id-superego conflicts, sexuality and creation, dreams as symbolic keys to the unconscious, impotence, cas tration anxiety, misogyny, etc., has transmogrified Moby Dick into an even rarer monster, phallus and omphalos, yoni and lingam, womb and tomb, mother and father, a protean whale beyond Melville's imagination. For Edward Stone, who opens A Certain Morbidness: A View of American Literature (Carbondale, Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1969) with a tribute to the psychoanalytic tradition in literary criticism, Melville seems to combine psychodrama and abre active therapy in his exploration of the existential anxiety, the "irrational fear, [the] dread of finding Nothingness beyond the mysterious and beguiling phenomena of existence [that] infects the men aboard the Pequod . . . ."As psychological doubles, Ahab and Ishmael are "united in their morbid strain," in their dread of cosmic nothingness, in their skepticism, fatalism, rebelliousness and recalcitrance. But Ishmael girds himself in Solomon's "steel," accepting an irrational universe and loving man and God, while Ahab, the dark side of the doppelganger self, acts out his silent counterpart's covert rebellion and marches "on into the mouth of God's own mortar" to final annihilation. As a disquisition on the relation between sexual energy and creative process, John Stark's "'The Cassock' Chapter in Moby-Dick and the Theme of Literary Creativity" (SAF 1 [1973] : 105-11) identifies three consecutive chapters in the novel as a "parable" for a creative process in which initiatory phallic rites and symbols with religious resonance function, like idolatrous fertility cults in The Book of Kings, to release creative potential. Slicing the phallic whale into "Bible leaves" serves as an analog to Ishmael's cetological taxonomy, a system for classifying cetaceans as books, and trans forms him into a symbolic mincer, turning whales into leaves (a book called Moby-Dick) and extracting "oil from their substance." A militantly psychoanalytical reading of Moby Dick, Mark Hennelly's "Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve" (AI 3- [ 1973 ] : 274 93) equates "the American male's 'flight from woman'" with the European transmigration "to escape a condition of guiltiness for a condition of guiltlessness." The Manichaean-Puritan polarization of woman into madonna-whore casts her as the culprit responsible for the fall,</page><page sequence="12">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 241 for the progeny of Pandora's box, and for man's socio-economic burden. With reference to this sexual dichotomization, the "oneiro-structure" in Moby-Dick conforms to the life-death seasonal cycle, the oppressive stepmother dream occurring at the Summer solstice, the rescu ing Rachel appearing at the Winter solstice, the two in conjunction fusing edipal castrator and "alma mater." The failure of homosexuality and autoeroticism as strategums for eluding the "American Eve" and "the myopia of the prostitute-madonna perspective" finally culmi nate with Ahab, the motherless misogynist, lashed to Moby Dick, "the primal beast-with-two backs," with an umbilical hempline. In contrast to Freudian analysts, Jungian archetype hunters demonstrate greater eclec ticism in exploiting anthropology, psychology, literature and linguistics to disinter "primordial images" buried in the collective unconsciousness. Evidentally unaware of Harry Slochower's analysis7 of the relation between Ahab and the Fisher King in 1950, Janet Dow, in "Ahab: The Fisher King" (ConnR 2, ii [ 1969] : 42-49), combines references to Jessie Weston, Maud Bodkin, Leslie Fiedler and Carl Jung to document the persistent urgency of archetypal myth and symbolism in Melville's novel. Her mechanical recitation of thematic, symbolic and motific parallels between Moby-Dick and the Grail Legend concludes rather orgasmically that "Ishmael, as the Quester, has discovered the vital question" and "attained the Quest? the secret Life itself and regeneration." Martin L. Pops' The Melville Archetype (Kent, Ohio, Kent State Univ. Press, 1970), a psychoanalytic ragout with ingredients from Freud, Jung, Neumann, Eliade and Baird, interprets the entire Melville canon as a programmatic move ment toward individuation through concomitant quests for the "Sacred" and "sexual fulfill ment." In this individuative progression, Moby-Dick eliminates the residual anxiety resulting from failures to assimilate the Shadow in the early romances and culminates with Ishmael's incorporation of Queequeg, his primitive counterpart. Liberated through Ahab's annihilative plunge into preformal chaos, Ishmael, whose survival imitates the cosmogonic rebirth of a divine personage, penetrates the sacral center and revitalizes the sacred past. H. B. Kulkarni, in Moby-Dick: A Hindu Avatar (Logan, Utah State Univ. Press. 1970), treats Melville's novel as a syncretic montage fusing mythic archetypes from Hinduism and various oriental religions with conventional Christian symbols. Etymological derivations, manipulated with a linguistic legerdemain reminiscent of Carl Jung and Norman O. Brown, relate the whale as a Vishnu avatar to Siva, Mithra, Surius and Osirus, and identify him as a solar deity encompassing infinite cycles of birth, death and reincarnation. The doubloon as omphalos merges with the ship and the church (nave, navis, Sanscrit nobhi), and the great white whale, a cosmic lingam, symbolizes regenerative power, Vishnuwaretah, the semen of the universe. In rebelling against infinite power, Ahab simply plays his part in a foreor dained drama and merges with his Biblical prototype, the participant in Canaanite Baal cults and disciple to Vishnu's demonic adversary. To interpret the resonant symbolism struc turing this cosmic struggle, Kulkarni applies a holistic, syncretic, quasi-Jungian methodology that attempts to cohere disparate, often contradictory, fragments into an organic totality. A consideration of symbolic, archetypal and linguistic relations in an existential context, Gordon V. Boudreau's "Of Pale Ushers and Gothic Piles: Melville's Architectural Symbology" (ESQ 67 [ 1972] : 67-82) probes into Moby-Dick's rock symbolism and "its configuration of stone, light, procreant sexuality, sterility, and divine faith under the dominant symbol of the Gothic cathedral." Images of Gothic architecture recur in the whale's mouth (Mel ville's equivalent for "the haunted Gothic cathedral"), the "whale's belly" (a repository for "the living word"), the whale itself, as described in the "late pale" Usher's encyclopedic compendium, the Whalemen's Chapel, the Negro church in New Bedford, the Spouter Inn and the Pequod. Symbolic and linguistic derivations identify fishermen in the novel as sacred</page><page sequence="13">242 COLLEGE LITERATURE and profane "petermen" (petrus, hence, rocks in a living edifice), while the Pequod as cathe dral supplies an altar, "the sacred quarter-deck," for the sacrificial butchery of the whale in order to bring light (the Word) to the world. The Pequod's voyage, then becomes a quest for an imperishable redeemer, "a son of Peter," a stone man. But even though the novel culminates with Ishmael-Jonah's salvation through the tombstone coffin, his individuative quest for "the living word in its prelinguistic formulation," the missing cathedral copestone symbolizing the lost word of God, is abandoned as a hubristic demand for a "self-sufficient rational order." A much less complex exercise in archetypal hermeneutics, Viola Sachs, The Myth of America: Essays in Literary Imagination (The Hague and Paris, Mouton, 1973) imposes archetypal configurations derived from Mircea Eliade's Cosmos and History and The Sacred and the Profane on American literature to argue that Moby-Dick as well as The Scarlet Letter, Absalom, Absalom and The Bear dramatize a dichotomy between the sacred wilderness and the profane human community. VI Examination of the relation between the consciousness and the world in terms of self other, confrontation, alienation, despair, absurdity, temporal fugue, ontological density, undif ferentiated flux, being and nothingness, etc., identifies the existentialist analysis of literary function and form.8 Some essays in recent years also exhibit a Sartrean concern with the self's objective parameters expressed as resistance, density, viscosity or fluidity. With inter mittent aspersions of existential terminology, William Glasser ("Moby-Dick" SR 77 [ 1969] : 462-86) contends that an examination of the relation between external topography and con sciousness "will illustrate Melville's success in dramatically defining the limits of man's cap ability to understand the world and his existence within it." External polarities (port and ocean, warmth and coldness, life and death), biological insufficiencies (the "chinks and cran nies" in the body-house, Ahab's leaky, lightning-seared carcass) and the mute, expressionless universe manifested in the whale's forehead, an outward symbol for psychological anguish and exasperation, provoke Ahab's antagonism, dread and despair as well as his angry de mand for "an immortal life free from suffering." Ishmael, in contrast, discovers a limited freedom through accommodating himself to incertitude, indeterminancy and divine inscrut ability. As a victim of cosmic alienation, "Crazy Ahab," in James K. Bowen's '"Crazy Ahab' and Kierkegaard's 'Melancholy Fantastic'" (RS 37 [ 1969] : 60-64), suffers from "melan cholia," an "overruling morbidness," "a Despair of Infinitude," that conditions his isolation and launches him into a fantasy realm where expectation ("possibility") merges with reality. Immersion in an irrational quest carries him "beyond the world of human interaction" and annihilates his temporal identity. Leon Seltzer's The Vision of Melville and Conrad (Athens, Ohio Univ. Press, 1970) mechanically inventories philosophical, thematic, aesthetic and technical parallels between these two major novelists. Existentialist constructs and configura tions influence the book's discussion of Moby-Dick, in which the ship functions as a micro cosmic stage for the revelation of human diversity and the "sea of doubt" as a trope for epistemological nihilism and cosmic absurdity. Alan Lebowitz's Progress into Silence: A Study of Melville's Heroes (Bloomington, Indiana Univ. Press, 1970) reflects the diffusion of Hegelian thought into contemporary criticism and exhibits an existentialist preoccupation with self, cosmos, confrontation and annihilation as well as a Freudian interest in the edipal quest for a lost father. As a record of his artistic progress into silence, Melville's nine novels (a triad of triads) dialectically trace a personal psychomachia culminating in an abandonment of literature as a viable means of expression and a lapse into "willful silence." As "psychic biography" they each explore the "complex relation between the Promethean hero and the young aspiring neophyte who gains important</page><page sequence="14">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPENDIUM 243 education from him." Moby-Dick, in its "richly paradoxical texture of ambiguities," despite Ishmael's radical alienation from Ahab, the inaccessible father, demonstrates Melville's "new ease with existential ambiguities" and tentative acceptance of cosmic inscrutability. Con centrating on existential texture and density, Jean-Paul Sarte ("Moby-Dick," Adam 343-45 [1970] : 86-88) contends that Melville strips the color from the external world to expose a dichromatic black-white reality inherent in "pure existence, the mysterious whiteness of be ing." Whiteness as a manifestation of the absolute nothingness behind the phenomenal world, moreover, identifies a primordial "bond between men and beast which constitutes hunting, a tie of madness and death." But the hunt, a romantic anachronism, another contentless idea, evaporates into nothingness as the reader grasps Melville's insight into the Void. A complex, eclectic essay, with echoes from R. D. Laing, Norman Brown, Levi-Strauss and Freud, Richard Blau's "Melville in the Valley of the Bones" (ATQ 10 [1970] : 11-16) con ceives Moby-Dick as a quest into an ontological labyrinth to discover "an ambiguous principle of being, part human and part natural, which is felt to have compromised" human existence. The shattering of an authochthonous omnipotence through traumatic confrontations with temporal resistance causes the psychological and physical scars that reduce the self to "an object of vengeance" and culminates in Ahab's defensive "petrification." Though insulated moments offer fugitive release from cosmic cannibalism, in Melville's world "the risks of death, of being overwhelmed, drowned, or crushed are more immediate than is the possi bility of communication and partnership between the conscious and the unconscious much less the self and world." Warwick Wadlington's rather esoteric exercise in "hermeneutic" gamemanship, "Ishmael's Godly Gamesomeness Self-Taste and Rhetoric in Moby-Dick" (ELH 39 [1972] : 309-31), attributes the novel's "animating energy" to a self-generative interplay of reader and narra tor in "a creative act of 'godly gamesomeness'." A "constellation of ludic motifs" culminating in Stubb's "live in the game, and die in it" and Ishmael's cognition of the universe as "a vast practical joke" rescues the novel's narrator-protagonist from "the black despair of alienation" and conditions "his delight in fellowship with humankind and with the All." Exploiting an existentialist conception of linguistic play as a form of mediation between being and nothing, Wadlington argues that a compulsion to manifest or express the diaphanous "white" self, the blank consciousness, through individuative word play generates "the experiential world" as a fusion of being and non-being. These ludic exercises as vehicles for individuation ("self taste") express the self's demand for "distinctive form" as a counter to the cosmic nothingness perceived in pure contemplation and death. Ishmael's diachronic excursion, a self-creating metamorphosis, progresses through discontinuous psychic states, from bondage under Ahab to provisional liberation from "the vital center"?"the Void." Synchronically, Ishmael as retrospective narrator, however, achieves tentative individuation as illusionist-impressario dramatist who engages the reader as an accomplice in an imaginative creation "featured in the unbodied air." Critical anthologies, bibliographical and textual studies, and other reference works support ing creative scholarship have appeared with relatively high frequency in the last six years, though, like critical books and articles, they too indicate that the pressure to publish and get one's name in the record often produces superfluous repetition.
