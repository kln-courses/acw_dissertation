<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Balancing of Child and Adult: An Approach to Victorian Fantasies for Children U. C. KNOEPFLMACHER MUCH has been written on the socializing aspects of chil- dren's literature, on this or that classic's promotion of maturity and healthy growth. Yet children's books, especially works of fantasy, rely just as heavily on the artist's ability to tap a rich reservoir of regressive yearnings. Such works can be said to hover between the states of perception that William Blake had labeled innocence and experience. From the vantage point of experience, an adult imagi- nation re-creates an earlier childhood self in order to steer it towards the reality principle. From the vantage point of innocence, however, that childhood agent may resist the imposition of adult values and stubbornly demand that its desire to linger in a realm of magic and wonder be satisfied. Like Blake's two "contrary states," these con- flicting impulses thus remain locked into a dynamic that acknowl- edges the simultaneous yet opposing demands of growth and arrest. It is no coincidence that the self-divided Victorians who found themselves "wandering between two worlds" in their Janus-like split between progress and nostalgia should have produced what has rightly been called "the Golden Age of children's books."'

H. van den Berg, had little regard for the distinctions among children, adolescents, and young adults.2 Gradually, however, as adulthood became more problematic, childhood became a state of its own. As early as 1839, Catherine Sinclair questioned the propriety of treating "young per- sons" as potential adults by exposing them to books that discouraged "all play of imagination" and that presented instead "a mere dry record of facts, unenlivened by . . . any excitement to the fancy."3 In the next two decades major writers such as Dickens, Thackeray, and Ruskin, all of whom wrote at least one major fantasy for chil- dren, strongly agreed, with Ruskin even going so far as to dismiss those didactic tracts that had been so popular in England and America as nothing less than a violation of the child's "unquestion- ing innocence. "4 By the last third of the nineteenth century, when fantasies for children flourished in England, authors went one step further by self-consciously admitting their own role as mediators between the states of childhood and maturity. Even before he implanted a version of himself as an aged bachelor-guide in the Sylvie and Bruno books (1889, 1893), the Lewis Carroll of Through the Looking-Glass (1871) could tell the dream-child in her "nest of gladness" that "we 2Aries, Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Lzfe, trans.

Similarly, on the very first page of his fine biography of Rudyard Kipling, Angus Wilson stresses Kipling's regressive respect for children and their imaginings, his ability to play with them - even in his sixties- "not, as so many adults do, in order to impose his own shapes, but to follow and to learn as well as to contribute. "6 Again, as Edith Nesbit, Kipling's contemporary, remarked about her own creative powers of empathy: "There is only one way of understanding children; they cannot be understood by imagination, or observation, nor even by love. They can only be understood by memory. . . . I was a child once myself, and by some fortunate chance I remember exactly how I used to feel and think about things."7 Still, for the Victorians who wrote for children, this regressive capacity can never bring about a total annihilation of the adult's self-awareness. Their fictions, especially those which rely on some suspension of disbelief, inevitably incorporate that awareness through ironic distancing devices apparent to the adult, but not necessarily to the child, reader. Torn between the opposing de- mands of innocence and experience, the author who resorts to the wishful, magical thinking of the child nonetheless feels compelled, in varying degrees, to hold on to the grown-up's circumscribed no- tions about reality. In the better works of fantasy of the period, this dramatic tension between the outlooks of adult and childhood selves becomes rich and elastic: conflict and harmony, friction and reconciliation, realism and wonder, are allowed to interpenetrate and co-exist.

And yet this seemingly "adult" implied author never promotes the skepticism that rules his cousin narrator in Vanity Fair; instead, to resolve the tensions on which his fantasy is built he resorts to the magical powers of a Fairy Blackstick who has herself become wary about the role of magic. Like this paradoxical deus ex machina who uses her spells to allow her nurslings to grow up in a world where they will no longer be aided by magic, Thackeray carefully steers between the realms of innocence and experience, subscribing to neither, and yet to both. The division between the perspectives of the child and the grown-up not only led Victorian authors of children's fairy tales to devise fictional structures of considerable sophistication but also re- sulted in their simultaneous appeal to two distinct types of implied readers. The child addressed by many Victorian authors -the Effie Gray for whom Ruskin wrote The King of the Golden River as a young man of twenty-two, the Annie and Minnie Thackeray whom their father tried to divert during their stay in Rome, the Alice Liddell who insisted that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson "go on with my interminable fairy-tale" on the way to Godstow-formed a prime audience fit though few. This private child-auditor, who encour- aged each storyteller to release childhood imaginings embedded within an adult logic, to reclaim the threatened child within, could eventually, upon the story's publication, be expanded into a larger, more impersonal audience of children. Yet the release and dissemi- nation of the story also accentuated each teller's adult awareness of instability and change. Neither Effie Gray nor Alice Liddell were prepubescent girls any longer when the fables written for them were published; like Thackeray's daughters, they had become, or were in the way of becoming, grown-ups. What is more, the act of public transmission involved, by necessity, a consideration of an audience composed of parents, older family members, or governesses, an adult readership as related to the implied author's identity as a grown-up, socialized being as the child-auditor was related to the author's reawakened youthful self. The acknowledgment of this second type of implied reader could manifest itself in a variety of ways, not only within each tale, but also through the superimposition of outward frames or bridges.</page><page sequence="5">Victorian Fantasies for Children 501 In a suppressed epilogue to The King of the Golden River Ruskin felt compelled to allude to the "opinions of the old people of the valley" into which he had transported his regressive desire to erase adult rapacity and cruelty; his tone changes abruptly as he now speaks of the uncomprehending "haberdashers of the district" and refers, semi-ironically, to the "many and edifying comments from the mater" who is now said to have "related" to her children the fairy tale of his own invention.8 Another kind of self-protectiveness informs the "prelude" to The Rose and the Ring, where Thackeray, as "M. A. Titmarsh," pays homage to the cooperative efforts of a fellow adult, his "friend, Miss Bunch, who was governess of a large family" living in the same "house inhabited by myself and my young charges"; it is this fellow occupant, "a lady of great fancy and droll imagination," who, according to Thackeray, supervised his draw- ings and helped him compose the "history" which both "recited to the little folks at night."9 Adult transmission is equally prominent in both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking- Glass, where the opening poems melancholically insist on distancing childhood reverie from adult realism and where Alice's older sister will be given the task of acting as the interpreter of the import of Alice's dreams. Public utterance, then, reenforced a sense of self-division for the Victorian writers of fantasies for children and led them to address a double readership, the young child who (like Gluck, Giglio/ Rosalba, Alice, or Mowgli) sets out on the road from innocence to experience and the adult who wants to travel back to, yet cannot remain arrested within, the pleasurable realm of magical thinking and wishfulness. If some, like Thackeray, brilliantly exploited the friction between these two perspectives, others more characteris- tically tried to effect a balance, often through the introduction of hybrid figures, childlike adults such as the Queen of Hearts or Nesbit's Jimmy, the Egyptologist in The Story of the Amulet, or miniaturized figures of adult power such as the King of the Golden River or the tiny animal guides, Molesworth's Cuckoo and Raven or Nesbit's Psammead and Phoenix.

Yet even Margaret Gatty, the most influential of these maternal moralists, whose long- forgotten, brief parable "See-Saw" will be reproduced and analyzed below, was able to devise a mode that would be imitated, com- plicated, and refined by purer fantasists such as Carroll and Kip- ling, her admirers and successors. In the sections which follow, I shall accordingly treat "See-Saw" as a paradigm for these later elaborations. I "See-Saw" is one of the later tales that Margaret Scott Gatty incorporated into her immensely popular, five-volume Parables from Nature, which she published from 1855 until 1871, two years before her death. Unlike Lewis Carroll (whose work she highly esteemed and helped propagate) and unlike, too, her own daughter Juliana Horatia Gatty Ewing, who together with Jean Ingelow and Mary Louisa Molesworth deftly mined the veins of fantasy first tapped in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Mrs. Gatty belonged to an earlier, more utilitarian generation of writers who mixed fantasy with overt moralization and instruction. Though she would become renowned as a writer of juvenile literature and as the founder and editor, from 1866 onwards, of the popular Aunt Judy's Maga- zine for girls, Mrs. Gatty had begun her career with a biography of the Rev. Alexander John Scott, D.D., her gifted and permissive father, who as chaplain on board of the Victory was noted for having cradled the dying Lord Nelson at Trafalgar. Margaret Gatty's true love remained natural history, especially marine studies. Upon publishing The Fairy Godmothers (1851), her first incursion into children's fantasy, she requested that her pub- lisher repay her with monographs on zoophytes, sponges, and litho- phytes. '0 Although her later writings for juveniles would help augment her clerical husband's meager salary and aid in the edu- cation of her nine surviving children, her continued absorption in seaside studies led her daughterJuliana, still a teenager at the time, to compose a parody of a poem by Kingsley in which she gently mocked the enraptured scientist. The writer who probably valued '0Christabel Maxwell, Mrs. Gatty and Mrs. Ewing (London: Constable, 1949), p. 93.</page><page sequence="7">Victorian Fantasies for Children 503 her single treatise on The History of British Seaweeds more than the twenty volumes for juvenile readers she also authored must, in her daughter's spoof, be wrested away from the rising tide by her hungry children clamoring for their meal. Imprudent and unladylike, she disregards the gurgling water in her boots as she observes a crab crawl over her foot and clasps a marine plant with "ungloved hands." Her engrossment is childlike, almost infantile: "0! is it weed or fish or floating hair? / A zoophyte so rare, / Or but a lump of hair, / My raptured eyeballs see? / Were ever pools so deep or day so fair- / There's nothing like the sea!"" By way of contrast, the teenage daughter who satirizes this regressive behavior acts like a responsible adult: the girl is mother of the woman. In most of her Parables from Nature, however, Mrs. Gatty could find an adult sanction and adult purpose for the childlike wonder she extracted from an animated Nature. She could be sci- entifically accurate, morally homiletic, and yet invest the ordi- nary with quasi-magical properties. Tales such as "The Law of the Wood," an ecological fable with possibly class-conscious social over- tones, or "The Law of Authority and Obedience," a tale about cooperation within a beehive, are indeed "parables." Verifiable truths are made to yield the narrator's faith in moral design: "the instincts of nature confirm the reasoning conclusions of man."' 2 Nature becomes anthropomorphized as in a fairy tale. But there is no need for excursions into wonderlands or for encounters with gob- lins, dwarfs, or fairies. Talking plants and animals, even a loqua- cious Day or Night or Fire, can instruct as well as delight. "See-Saw" partakes of this mode yet also seems significantly different. Its protagonist is, in a sense, unnatural-not a growing organic creature such as the young trees, insects, animals, and chil- dren who abound in the earlier parables but an inert stump of wood. And the children depicted in the story remain apart, oblivious to the tree stump's plight, never benefiting from the edification it, but not they, eventually receives. In their careless indifference, the children become outsiders, uneducatable and unattractive; yet in its self-pitying exaggerations, born of its hyperawareness of distance and change, the tree stump, too, though in the forefront, seems equally reprehensible. Indeed, as we shall see after a look at the tale "Quoted by Maxwell in Mrs. Gatty and Mrs. Ewing, p. 98. '2Margaret Gatty, "The Law of Authority and Obedience," Parables from Nature (London: G.

SEE-SAW. 13 "Turning to scorn with lips divine The falsehood of extremes." - TENNYSON. The felled oak in the corner of the timber-yard lay groaning under the plank, which a party of children had thrown across him to play see-saw upon. Not that the plank was so heavy even with two or three little ones sit- ting on each end, nor that the oak was too weak to hold it up -though, of course, the pressure was pretty strong just at the centre, where the plank balanced. But it was such a use to be put to! The other half of the tree had been cut into beautiful even planks, some time before, but this was the root end, and his time had not yet come, and he was getting impatient. "Here we go up, up, up!" cried the children, as the plank rose into the sky on one side. "I shall catch the tree-tops-no! the church-steeple-no! the stars." Or, "Here we go down, down, down!" cried the others. "Safe and snug on the ground- no! right through the world - no! out at the other side. Ah! steady there, stupid old stump!" This was because the plank had swerved, not the tree. And so the game went on; for the ups and downs caine in turns, and the children shrieked with delight, and the poor tree groaned loudly all the time. "And I am to sit here; and bear not only their weight but their blame, and be called stupid and be told to keep steady, when it is they who are giddy and can't be depended upon; and to be contented, while they do nothing but play pranks and enjoy themselves," said he; but said it to him- self, for he did not know which to complain to -the children or the plank. As he groaned, however, he thought of the time when he was king of the little wood, where he had grown up from the acorn days of his babyhood, and it broke his heart to be so insignificant now. "Why have they not cut me into planks like the rest?" continued he, angrily. "I might have led the see-saw myself then, as this fellow does, who leans so heavily on my back, without a thought that I am as good or better 13"See-Saw," Parablesfrom Nature, pp. 315-17. The epigraph is taken from the concluding lines of Tennyson's "Of Old Sat Freedom on the Heights," a paean to the personification of Liberty as an aloof, "self-gathered," mighty, and grave "mother of majestic works."</page><page sequence="9">Victorian Fantasies for Children 505 than himself. Why have they not given me the chance of enjoying myself like these others - up in the sky at one end, down on the ground at the other, full of energy and life? The whole timber-yard, but myself, has a chance. Position and honour, as well as pleasure, are for everybody except me. But I am to stick in a corner merely for others to steady themselves upon-unthought-of or despised, made a tool of-merely that.-Miser- able me!" Now this groaning was so dreadful, it woke the large garden snail in the grass hard by, whose custom it was to come out from his haunt under the timber-yard wall every morning at sunrise, and crawl round and round the felled oak, to see the world come to life, leaving a slimy track behind him on the bark wherever he moved. It was his constitutional stroll, and he had continued it all the season, pursuing his morning reflections without interruption, and taking his nap in the grass afterwards, as regularly as the days came round. But napping through such lamentation was impossible, and accord- ingly he once more began to crawl up the side of the felled oak, his head turning now to one side, now to the other, his horns extended to the utmost, that, if possible, he might see what was the matter. But he could not make out, though he kept all his eyes open, in the strict sense of the words: so by-and-bye he made the inquiry of his old friend the tree. "What is the matter, do you ask?" groaned the oak more heavily than ever -"you who can change your position and act independently when you wish; you who are not left a useless log as I am, the scorn and sport of my own kith and kin? Yes, the very planks who balance themselves on my body, and mock me by their activity, have probably come from my own bosom, and once hung on me as branches, drinking in life from the life I gave. Oh miserable me! miserable, despised, useless!" Now there may be plenty of animals to be found with more brilliant abilities and livelier imagination than the snail, but for gravity of de- meanour and calmness of nerve who is his equal? and if a sound judgment be not behind such outward signs, there is no faith to be put in faces! Accordingly, Sir Helix Hortensis - so let us call him - made no answer at first to the wailings of the oak. Three times he crawled round it, leaving three fresh traces of his transit, before he spoke, his horns turning hither and thither as those wonderful eyes at the end strove to take in the full state of the case. And his are not the eyes, you know, which waste their energies in scatter-brained staring. He keeps them cool in their cases till there is something to be looked at, and then turns them inside out to do their destined work. And thus he looked, and he looked, and he looked, while the children went on shouting, and the plank went on see-sawing, and the tree went on groaning; and as he looked, he considered. "Have you anything to say?" at last inquired the oak, who had had long experience of Sir Helix's wisdom.</page><page sequence="10">506 Nineteenth-Century Fiction "I have," answered the snail. "You don't know your own value, that's all." "Ask the see-sawers my value!" exclaimed the prostrate tree, bitterly. "One up at the stars, another beyond the world! What am I doing mean- while?" "Holding them both up, which is more than they can do for them- selves," muttered the snail, turning round to go back to the grass. "But-but-stop a moment, dear Sir Helix; the see-sawers don't think that," argued the tree. "They're all light-minded together, and don't think," sneered the snail. "Up in the sky one minute, down in the dust the next. Never you mind that. Everybody can't play at high jinks with comfort, luckily for the rest of the world. Sit fast, do your duty, and have faith. While they are going flightily up and down, your steady balance is the saving of both." If major Victorian fantasies for children abound in color and motion, "See-Saw" almost exults in drabness and inertia. The par- able's protagonist, the "stupid old stump" the children deride, is indeed "insignificant," having presumably been discarded because no "beautiful even planks" can be cut from its rough and knotty "root end." The plank that "leans so heavily" on its back can move up and down with the children. The tree stump, on the other hand, must remain fixed and immobile. And the narrative centered around it seems just as static, almost as if Mrs. Gatty wanted to extend the woodenness of her protagonist to the story itself. In the parable's first half the stump's groans become so domi- nant that they not only drown out the children's exclamations but also displace a voice that might impart direction, or at least a new point of view, to what otherwise threatens to become monotonous. Yet at first Mrs. Gatty deliberately thwarts the reader's eagerness for a discernible authorial stance. We are forced to overhear a mono- logue. The stump speaks to itself because, we are told, it remains unsure as to whom "to complain to -the children or the plank." But there is no assurance that, even if it were to complain to either party, its words would be heard: both the children who speak in a closed chorus and the plank who remains mute throughout the story seem unlikely interlocutors. The narrator, too, appears to be im- mobilized, distanced from her own potential audience, whether of children or adults. How much does the narrator sympathize with the complaints of the stump? We cannot be sure. By calling the stump a "poor tree," the narrator seems to side with it and set herself</page><page sequence="11">Victorian Fantasies for Children 507 in opposition to the "giddy" children who have dismissed it as "stupid." And yet the very prominence given to the trunk's wails becomes suspect. We increasingly are made to feel that the oak's self-pity is as exaggerated as the wishfulness of children who hope to catch stars and emerge at the world's "other side." A story that had promised, through its title, some balancing act now threatens to veer instead, as the Tennysonian epigraph suggests, into "the false- hood of extremes." We are led to yearn for some traffic between those extremes. The children's innocence and the tree stump's ex- perience remain excessively set apart. And that excess proves dis- comforting. If the tree stump is "getting impatient," so is the reader by the story's first half. Not until the appearance of the snail, in the second half, does an expected mediator finally set the parable in motion. Hitherto, the plank on which the seesawers sit has been the only potential inter- mediary between the children and the superannuated stump who so nostalgically recalls "the acorn days of his babyhood." Unlike the stump, the plank can move with the children; it possesses -or so the stump assumes-"energy and life," a life, as we later discover, it in fact may owe to the mutilated speaker who tells us that this "kith and kin" once probably drank nourishment from its "own bosom." Associated with both the children and its parental trunk, the plank would thus be a likely mediator between youth and age, the verti- cality of hope and the horizontality of resignation. And yet this go- between, in its total muteness, seems lifeless or at least asleep. It thus devolves upon another sleeper, roused by the stump's groans, to assume the role the plank, like the narrator, has eschewed. It is the snail who fulfills our expectations by becoming an inter- mediary. Instinct with his own slow and deliberate motions, inde- pendent, he is not tied to the children's jerky impulsiveness. Indeed, this self-propelling creature, the narrator now volunteers, habitually crawls round the felled oak every morning "to see the world come to life." His appearance makes the story itself come alive. For he helps to animate not just the stump, by providing it with the interlocutor that had so far been missing, but also the aroused narrator, who, at last raised from her own torpor, seizes on "Sir Helix Hortensis" as an outlet for a more active and playful imagination. The tiny expositor frees the narrator, who had suppressed herself; her total endorse- ment of his point of view removes any previous misconception we</page><page sequence="12">508 Nineteenth-Century Fiction might have had about her concurrence with the tree stump's para- lyzing self-pity. If she has been too silent until now, that silence may have stemmed from a reflectiveness similar to the snail's own, for he too "at first" chooses to make "no answer" whatsoever "to the wail- ings of the oak." The sober Sir Helix thus replaces the "prostrate tree" as a more appropriate representative of adult experience. More authoritative because of the wider purview that comes with his daily peregrina- tions, he can confirm, yet also soften, the stump's contempt for the "light-minded" children. For the snail is himself a more "light- minded" agent for Mrs. Gatty's intended emphasis. Though his "gravity" makes him a fit companion for the aged tree trunk, his very size and his mock-heroic demeanor also link him to the children who have defied the laws of gravity. If the children "go up, up, up" and "down, down, down," Sir Helix, too, is capable of contrary motions, "his head turning now to one side, now to the other." Though more judicious than they, he adopts their triplings. As they move up, they expect to "catch the tree-tops-no! the church-steeple -no! the stars"; as they move down, they wish to go "on the ground -no! right through the world-no! out at the other side." More solidly grounded, slower to speak, Sir Helix nonetheless also does things by threes: "Three times he crawled . . . , leaving three fresh traces of his transit." "And thus he looked, and he looked, and he looked." He speaks three times. His final message insists on a trinity of obligations ("Sit fast, do your duty, and have faith"). Although Mrs. Gatty endorses the snail's concluding homily, she also treats him with a levity not evident in the story's first half. Whereas the narrator stifled her own voice in recording the tree stump's lamentations, she now offers an extensive description of the garden snail before she chooses to reproduce his own sententious utterances. It is the eyes of the snail itself, "those wonderful eyes at the end" of his probing horns, that the reader, now at last overtly addressed as "you," is invited to behold. All of a sudden, Mrs. Gatty seems conscious of her double audience of children and adults. The child reader is clearly expected to relish her anthropomorphism: "his are not the eyes, you know, which waste their energies in scatter-brained staring." But if the child reader or child-auditor is regaled with such microscopic details, older readers, who might even be expected to know the Latin name for "garden snail," can</page><page sequence="13">Victorian Fantasies for Children 509 cherish the mock-heroic touch in the author's dubbing of her mini- knight: "Sir Helix Hortensis-so let us call him." Such readers might well appreciate other, more subtly embedded, mock-epic overtones: a horned creature who, like a snake, leaves a "slimy track" behind him, who moves "three times" before he delivers his first speech, seems a cousin of that other pseudo hero who thrice assayed to speak before haranguing the torpid and dejected fallen angels of Paradise Lost. Sir Helix thus acts as a fulcrum between the seesawing imagi- nations of grown-up and child. His last words can be applied to his own role in the story. For it is his own "steady balance" between un- reflecting childhood innocence and a paralyzing adult experience that Mrs. Gatty wants to tap in order to overcome the extremes she had represented by the children and the tree trunk. That those extremes seem to stem from a self-division within herself seems un- deniable. Although the tree trunk is presented as a male figure, its allusion to the "kith and kin" that came from his "own bosom" and once drank "in life from the life I gave" suggests that its despon- dency may be akin to that of a mother-author who felt herself, in her old age, unduly removed from children-auditors who had become unresponsive to her ministrating efforts at nurturance and instruction. A year before her death, Mrs. Gatty, who "had lost the power of writing with her own hand, and was gradually losing the</page><page sequence="14">510 Nineteenth-Century Fiction &gt;~~~~K A ZZh&lt;E C t41 LP power of speech," printed a poem, "Lines, 1872," about suffering and faith, which an admiring Lewis Carroll, who found them "so beautiful and touching," distributed among several of his little friends. 14 But "See-Saw" is more than a personal allegory. As both Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, that other admirer of Mrs. Gatty's work, would have understood, the story addresses the need to overcome the gap between the psychological extremes which it first isolates and then tries to recombine: the obsessive and self-conscious melancholy of an aging self approaching death and the unselfcon- sciousness of a childhood self that wishes to remain immune to the sobering aspects of growing up. The snail, who, as Mrs. Gatty would know, is also a hermaphroditic creature combining both male and female genders, manages to bridge the gap which in the first half of the story seemed to be so unsurmountable. As a childlike adult or an adult-seeming child, this creature anticipates similar mediators de- vised by later fantasists, Carroll's Humpty Dumpty and his White Knight, Kipling's White Seal and 'Stute Fish, Nesbit's Psammead and Phoenix. Though cruder certainly than the work of later fan- tasists, though still tilting excessively-despite its attempted balancing-towards the side of experience, Mrs. Gatty's parable nonetheless sets the stage for the more imaginative productions of '4C.

Press, 1979), I, 200 n. 6; I, 200.</page><page sequence="15">Victorian Fantasies for Children 511 her successors. Like Mrs. Gatty, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling tried to renovate and replenish an adult self-consciousness by turn- ing to the wishful magical thinking of an earlier childhood phase. Unlike their predecessor, however, they creatively exploited the im- balance she tried to correct. A brief look at their work thus will permit us to assess the strides they took in handling the selfsame extremes presentecd so diagrammatically in "See-Saw." II When Lewis Carroll sent "Bruno's Revenge" as a contribution to Mrs. Gatty's Aunt Judy's Magazine, she welcomed it for being so "beautiful and fantastic and childlike"; his regressive talent, she felt, "is peculiarly your own, and as an Englishman you are almost unique in possessing it."''5 Nearly any portion of Alice in Wonder- land, which Mrs. Gatty lavishly reviewed and promoted, and Through the Looking-Glass, which appeared two years before her death, is amenable to the same analysis to which "See-Saw" has been exposed. It is the later work, however, that most persistently dwells on the same "extremes" embodied in her parable. The Alice of Through the Looking-Glass, however, is not at all like the unreflecting children in "See-Saw." Quite to the contrary, this older child covets the "steady balance" that Sir Helix equated with a maturity opposed to "high jinks." If, in Wonderland, a younger Alice was forced to go "up and down" in uncontrolled fashion, in Looking-Glass-land she submits to the rules of an adult chess game. Her steady forward progress is towards the goal of queenhood: her crowning comes to signify adult powers she has already tried to adopt in her handling of the childish black kitten. Unlike Mrs. Gatty, however, Carroll is highly ambivalent towards the adult stage that Alice is so eager to embrace. Much more than Sir Helix, the "adult" figures Alice encounters are notable for their childishness and frailty. The miniscule Gnat who warns Alice about the wood where she will lose her name seems "to have sighed itself away" in its melancholy over the notion of a missing "miss" Alice. Yet Alice fearlessly penetrates the wood; though "a little timid about going into it," she makes "up her mind to go on: 'for I certainly "5The Letters of Lewis Carroll, I, 148 n. 1; Maxwell, Mrs. Gatty and Mrs. Ewing, pp. 149-50.</page><page sequence="16">512 Nineteenth-Century Fiction won't go back,' she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square" (ch. 3, p. 135). Alice's determination to proceed towards the Eighth Square in which she expects to come into possession of the powers associated with mature womanhood is repeatedly qualified by her encounters with her presumed superiors. Seeing the Lion and the Unicorn fight for the crown, Alice asks the White King, "Does-the one-that wins -get the crown?" "Dear me, no!" said the King. "What an idea!" "Would you-be good enough-" Alice panted out, after running a little further, "to stop a minute -just to get -one's breath again?" "I'm good enough," the King said, "only I'm not strong enough. You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!" (ch. 7, p. 173) Again and again, the crown of adult power becomes a questionable emblem. Beyond the forward progress to which Alice so readily sub- mits lie dissolution and death. The King is as ineffectual as the silent Hatta, "only just out of prison," who silently weeps Gnat-like tears and tries to find some elementary solace by munching away and drinking tea. The Lion and the Unicorn prove to be as juvenile as that other pair of combatants, Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum. And Humpty Dumpty, despite his Carrollian mastery of language, can- not foresee the "heavy crash" that will mark the fall that Alice, but not he, is able to anticipate. Carroll's reservations about Alice's egress from childhood are evident in Humpty Dumpty's earlier exchange with Alice: "Seven years and six months!" Humpty Dumpty repeated thought- fully. "An uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you'd asked my advice, I'd have said 'Leave off at seven'-but it's too late now." "I never ask advice about growing," Alice said indignantly. "Too proud?" the other enquired. Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. "I mean," she said, "that one ca'n't help growing older." "One ca'n't, perhaps," said Humpty Dumpty; "but two can. With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven." (ch. 6, p. 162) Convinced that they "had had quite enough of the subject of age," Alice is quick to change the subject by assuming control of the con- versation: "if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects," she thinks, "it was her turn now." The seesawing reverts to her.</page><page sequence="17">Victorian Fantasies for Children 513 Neither Alice nor the child reader who may endorse her deter- mination and hunger for grown-up power can entirely fathom the import of Humpty Dumpty's ominous remark. For this childlike adult speaks for a Carroll who had doubts about the stage of experi- ence Alice still covets. Two might indeed have been able to prevent the girl from growing further -a Providence willing to cut short the child's earthly existence or a godlike artist who had already tried to detain Alice in the arrested, infantile world of Wonderland when she was still but seven. But in Through the Looking-Glass, published when the actual Alice Liddell had become a nineteen-year-old woman, Lewis Carroll yields to the inevitable, though not without struggle. As the about-to-be-shattered Humpty Dumpty comes to demonstrate, the realm of innocence cannot be maintained. It is this adult self-consciousness that pierces through, again and again, the defusing humor of Through the Looking-Glass. Still, like the child readers whom Carroll encourages to identify with her resolve, the fictional Alice remains immune to Carroll's intimations of mortality. Shades of the prison house may begin to close upon the growing girl. But the determined child does not regard these omens, heavy as the frost with which the book opens, as oppressive "Fallings from us, vanishings." Only adult readers, from their own "place of thought"'6 in the realm of experience, can sense this counter- balancing presence. Like the White Knight who vainly tries to make Alice linger on the last square before the eighth by reciting his Wordsworthian "song," Carroll temporarily resigns himself to the inevitability of growth. In chapter 8 of Through the Looking-Glass an omniscient nar- rator suddenly intrudes. Rather sentimentally, this narrator insists that in her later life a grown-up Alice will "most clearly" remember the love-offering which the White Knight is about to present just before she crosses the threshold that separates pawn from Queen, and girl from Woman: Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterday-the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knight - the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her -the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet - and the 16" Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood," stanza ix, lines 144, 134, in The Poetical Works of Wordsworth, ed.

(ch. 8, p. 187) In its lyricism and its inordinate length, this sentence contains some of the same cadences - and same affect - produced at the end of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. There, an older dreamer, Alice's sister, also "pictured" how a future Alice, "herself a grown woman," would remember "her own child-life, and the happy sum- mer days" (ch. 12, p. 99). 17 In Through the Looking-Glass, however, this anticipation of an adult's retrospection is ironically undercut. Its sentimentality seems suspect, for it belies Alice's responses, still in her fictional present, to the White Knight's overtures both before and after his song. As the Knight conducts Alice to the "end of the wood," he speaks of fusion and separation: he tells her how the mixed ingredients of one of his concoctions, a pudding, are "nicer" than each ingredient "alone," only to note, "And here I must leave you." Convinced that she is saddened by the necessity of their parting, he offers his song as com- fort. But the Knight is guilty of a misreading: he mistakes her look of puzzlement - for she is still "thinking of the pudding," as the nar- rator informs us-as an expression of sorrow (ch. 8, p. 186). The White Knight is thus guilty of projecting his own feelings on the unsorrowful child. A later Alice, now herself an adult, may be able to lyricize and pick up the note of "melancholy" that overwhelms him; but the child before him, impatient to move on, remains immune. Like the Carroll who bemoans, in his dedicatory poem, that he and Alice Liddell, author and prime reader, "I and thou," have been thrust "half a life asunder," the White Knight tries to assuage his own separation anxieties and self-fragmentation through the "love-gift" of a story. But for all his sentimentality, the Carroll of the opening poem was more of a realist than the fantastical (and fanta- sizing) White Knight. Aware that "No thought of me shall find a place / In thy young life's hereafter-," Carroll remains content to detain his listener for the duration of his story: "Enough that now "7See also the conclusion of Alice's Adventures Underground, introd. Martin Gardner (New York: Dover, 1965), pp. 89-90.</page><page sequence="19">Victorian Fantasies for Children 515 thou wilt not fail / To listen to my fairy-tale" (p. 103). At its best, the storyteller's art can, at a later time, reactivate the youthful imagination of an adult Alice Liddell. As Carroll's defensively parodic self-projection, however, the White Knight remains a solipsist, piti- fully and comically divorced from his fictional interlocutor: "You are sad," the Knight said in an anxious tone: "let me sing you a song to comfort you." "Is it very long?" Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day. "It's long," said the Knight, "but it's very, very beautiful. Everybody that hears me sing it -either it brings the tears into their eyes, or else-" "Or else what?" said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause. "Or else it doesn't, you know." (ch. 8, p. 186) As an adult reader, Alice may falsify the past by choosing to remember the "melancholy music of the song" she is now forced to hear. Within the story, however, she is as little saddened by the Knight's recital of what is after all a comical rendering of unrespon- siveness as the children in Gatty's "See-Saw" were by the adult tree stump's exaggerated lamentations. Indeed, the Knight, for all his self-forgetfulness, seems disappointed by her unemotional reception of his "love-gift." When Alice dutifully feels compelled to thank him and assure him that she "liked it very much," he replies rather "doubtfully": "I hope so, . . . but you didn't cry so much as I thought you would" (ch. 8, pp. 187, 190). She has, in fact, not cried at all. Carroll thus reintroduces his own, infinitely more compli- cated version of the selfsame gap that separated Gatty's aged tree trunk from the uncomprehending seesawers. Like the discarded tree stump, the elderly Knight who has reached the end of his road remains self-involved, swaddled in a self-pity he cannot directly share with a child who firmly insists on her apartness. The song the White Knight produces for Alice reenforces, in elliptical fashion, this emphasis on a psychic separation. Sung, sig- nificantly enough, to the tune of "I give thee all -I can no more," it stresses the incomprehension that isolates two speakers who, like Alice and the Knight himself, remain obsessively locked into their individual mental worlds. Carroll's decision to give the Knight an adaptation of the parody of "Resolution and Independence" he had</page><page sequence="20">516 Nineteenth-Century Fiction previously published in 1856 as "Upon the Lonely Moor" was a care- ful and deliberate act of self-defense. It stemmed from his need to defuse the psychic division he also handled in his introductory poem and in "The Wasp in a Wig" episode he had originally intended to place between Alice's farewell to the Knight and her crowning as Queen. 18 In Carroll's 1856 parody the speaker of the poem is a solipsistic "gentleman" who, in Wordsworthian fashion, appropriates the psyche of the rustic "boor" he encounters in a natural setting (p. 249) (just as, in the suppressed "Wasp in a Wig" episode, a genteel Alice was to encounter, and question, the boorish, lower-class wasp who grumbles about his "old bones").'9 In Through the Looking- Glass, however, this speaker has become a personation of a White Knight who is himself, like Humpty Dumpty or the White King (or the disappearing Gnat and dying Wasp), a personation of the book's implied author. In Tenniel's drawing it is unmistakably the White Knight himself who bodily seizes the aged, aged man. Yet the Knight's interlocutor may no longer be the counterpart of Words- worth's old Leech-gatherer. Instead of being encountered on a moor, as in the original version, he now sits, like Humpty Dumpty, precariously perched on an elevation. The gate he sits on is, like the boundary Alice is about to traverse, a line of demarcation. His face remains curiously concealed in the drawing. His body is slumped backwards. The White Knight who grasps him may indeed be shaking him "from side to side," as Alice will later shake Red Queen into black kitten, dream into reality, child into adolescent. But the drawing remains ambiguous. The Knight may also be holding the gate-sitter to prevent him from tumbling backwards. Or, conversely, he may try to pull him over the gate. At any rate, the teetering figure is as unstable as the plank in Gatty's "See-Saw." Who, then, is this aged, aged man of the second version? Seen from one perspective, he stands for an almost infantile regressive- ness; seen from the other side of the line on which he, like Alice, is perched, he acts as a last memento mori for the girl who is so deter- mined to push on into the realm of experience. Like Alice, the aged "8See The Wasp in a Wig: A "Suppressed" Episode of "Through the Looking- Glass and What Alice Found There, " ed. Edward Guiliano, introd. Martin Gardner (New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1977). '9The Wasp in a Wig, p. 13; whereas Alice was hardly eager to have the White Knight recite poetry to her, she suggests to the Wasp that he cast his narrative in rhyme.</page><page sequence="21">Victorian Fantasies for Children 517 man is deferential to the interlocutor he addresses as "Your Honour"; still, though he acts as a willing pawn who subordinates himself to the White Knight's ruminations, he is also goal-oriented, repeatedly calling attention to his need for money. Like Alice again, he is ob- sessed with food -mutton pies, bread, buttered rolls; but in a fiction in which food and eating have consistently betokened death and strife (the bread-and-butter-fly who "would die" if bereft of weak tea and cream, the little oysters devoured by Walrus and Carpenter, the shattered shell of Humpty Dumpty, the plum cake that fails to prevent further dissolution) his obsession seems ominous. The Knight begins his song, "I'll tell thee everything I can: / There's little to relate." And indeed as a "relation," a narrative, a story, the White Knight's Song exploits unrelatedness, discontinuity. Yet it is through this disjointedness that the Knight, and Carroll behind him, tries to relate adult to child, a divided author to his irreconcilable double readership. The song ends by mocking the same kind of sentimental remembrance with which an older Alice "could bring the whole scene back again"; it handles ironically those tears of nostalgia which the White Knight fails to induce: And now, if e'er by chance I put My fingers into glue, Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot Into a left-hand shoe, Or if I drop upon my toe A very heavy weight,</page><page sequence="22">518 Nineteenth-Century Fiction I weep, for it reminds me so Of that old man I used to know- Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow, Whose hair was whiter than the snow, ******............... . . . . * * **.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Who snorted like a buffalo- That summer evening long ago, A-sitting on a gate. (ch. 8, pp. 189-90) As in the pudding in which "mixing" impossibly isolated ingredients can still make a "difference," Carroll tries to decompound and blend what has been so irrefrangible. The "I" who was so apart from the "aged, aged man" appropriates him through the falsifications of nostalgia and memory; the Alice who was bored by the Knight's song will similarly remember his "mild blue eyes" in later days. In a world of nonrelation, the world to which Carroll would turn in his "Hunting of the Snark," the common experience of pain may lead us to "relate"-through fictions-what was otherwise unrelatable. Alice listens to the White Knight's song, "but no tears came into her eyes." In Sylvie and Bruno, the fairy-child will sob uncontrollably over the reality of death. In Through the Looking-Glass, however, where Wordsworth's Leech-gatherer teeters on a gate, laughter can fend off thoughts that are too deep for tears. The ironies that Carroll exploits in his comic masterpiece proved to be for him the only way to seesaw between the falsehood of extremes. III Rudyard Kipling opened his posthumously published Some- thing of Myself (1937) with an epigraph he had been fond of quoting: "Give me the first six years of a child's life and you can have the rest."20 Very early in his career as a writer, Kipling grasped the importance for his creativity of the special qualities of the privileged "child's life" on which he could draw. Whether written for adults or for a juvenile audience or for a joint readership, his best fables are profitably understood as attempts to recover the imaginative whole- ness of the childhood psyche first threatened in the "House of Deso- 20Something of Myself: For My Friends Known and Unknown (London: Macmil- lan, 1937), p. 1.</page><page sequence="23">Victorian Fantasies for Children 519 lation" at Southsea (the emotional equivalent of Dickens's "blacking warehouse" trauma) and sorely tested again at the United Services College. The nurturance denied to Punch in the semiautobio- graphical "Baa Baa, Black Sheep" (1888) is extended to Mowgli when the foundling boy is given a surplus of mentors and parental surrogates in the animal and village worlds of The Jungle Books (1894, 1895). Yet the bitter adult ironies that undercut the happy ending of Punch's return to his mother are hardly expunged from The Jungle Books. For, as Angus Wilson well puts it, "Kipling . . . knew that to identify with children does not mean losing your adult identity."2' Like Lewis Carroll and Margaret Gatty, Kipling never closed the gap that necessarily separated the two identities. Still, more than Carroll and certainly more than the Mrs. Gatty whose Parables from Nature Kipling claimed to have at one time "imitated,"22 he managed to maintain a highly fluid traffic, inter- change, or "flirtation between the two worlds" of innocence and experience.23 The ghost-child whom the adult narrator encounters at the end of "They" (1904) may well be a fictional incarnation of Kipling's own "best beloved" dead daughter Josephine; but this apparition is also, like Mowgli, Kim, and the little "Best Beloved" so affectionately addressed in theJust So Stories (1902), very much a resurrection of an ever-present child within. If Carroll, in the shape of the White Knight, must say good-bye to the growing Alice, Kip- ling joyously refused to part from this juvenile self. His ability to create flowing narrative modes that could be equally true to adult and child alike makes The Jungle Books andJust So Stories the truly imaginative achievements that they are. Two stories (one from each work), "The White Seal" and "How the Whale Got His Throat," will have to suffice to illustrate this fluidity. Both stories are set in a world of water, the most fluid and 21 The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling, p. 229. 22Something of Myself, p. 33; the book was furnished to Kipling by the "three dear ladies" (Mrs. Winnard and the Misses Craik) whom he periodically visited while at the United Services College. He also held on during his lifetime to "a bound copy of Aunt Judy's Magazine of the early 'seventies," sent to him by his parents (p. 7). Roger Lancelyn Green, Kipling and the Children (London: Elek, 1965), rightly stresses the store of fantasy provided to Kipling the boy by earlier Victorian writers such as George MacDonald, Mary De Morgan, Jean Ingelow, and Lewis Carroll (who, in turn, came to admire Kipling's early poetry). But onlyJ.M.S. Tompkins has seen fit to follow up Kipling's reference to Gatty's Parables by aligning it with some of the animal fables (The Art of Rudyard Kipling [London: Methuen, 1959]). 23Wilson, The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling, p. 229.</page><page sequence="24">520 Nineteenth-Century Fiction primal of elements. Both revel in a kind of infantile freedom of movement that is reflected in the very liberties the narrator allows himself to take. Both are the initial unit in a narrative sequence that moves from simplicity and unrestraint to a more constricted and difficult order of relationships. As the first of the four interpolated animal tales which follow the three Mowgli stories in the firstJungle Book, "The White Seal" permits an escapism that is no longer pos- sible in "Servants of the Queen," the fourth and last unit of the series. Kotick can lead his seal nation away from human predators in "The White Seal"; the animals in "Servants of the Queen" are yoked to humans in a hierarchical order of obligations. Even water has altered its symbolic meaning. The guarantor of freedom in the marine world of "The White Seal" now turns, in "Servants of the Queen," into an unceasing, mud-splattering rain-flood that presages the dis- solution of civilization's attempts to bind man and beast into an alliance against primal chaos. A similar, though less acute, reversal in Just So Stories distances the opening "How the Whale Got His Throat" from the concluding "The Butterfly that Stamped," a story which, the narrator admits, is "quite different from the other stories. "4 The powerful Whale of the first story has turned into a puny, hen- pecked butterfly; the childlike Mariner has become "The Most Wise Sovereign Suleiman-bin-Daoud-Solomon the Son of David," a monarch who, like Victoria in "Servants of the Queen," tries to exert a dubious adult authority over a world of humans and beasts. The perspectives of innocence and experience are again reversed. "The White Seal," however, not only counterbalances the sequence of stories it initiates but also acts as a ballast to the pre- ceding sequence of Mowgli stories. "Tiger! Tiger!" has left the growing Mowgli on the threshold of maturity. He is triumphant, yet also a sadder and wiser man-cub. The killing of Shere Khan has turned out to be a hollow victory. For Mowgli now knows that his child-life among the wolves is over. His maturation as a manling, his very superiority to his animal brethren, now sets him apart from both jungle and village. He angrily refuses to lead the Free People who have degenerated into "lawlessness" and decides to "hunt 24Just So Stories, Vol. 20 of The Writings in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling, 36 vols.

Subsequent references to this edition are cited in the text.</page><page sequence="25">Victorian Fantasies for Children 521 alone."25 The narrator concludes "Tiger! Tiger!" with a guarded concession that softens the impact of Mowgli's self-exile: "But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he became a man and married." He then adds, as if in afterthought, "But that is a story for grown-ups" (p. 72). Thus Mowgli is left wandering between two worlds. He is no longer the childish little frog of "Kaa's Hunting"; nor is he yet the mythical wood-god observed by an awed Englishman in the "adult" story of "In the Rukh" (1893), which Kipling had actually written before The Jungle Books. As his concluding song explains, he re- mains divided, an amphibian creature torn between two contrary states: "These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight / in the spring. The water comes out of my eyes, yet / I laugh while it falls. Why? / I am two Mowglis" (p. 74). Like Carroll's "White Knight's Song," "Mowgli's Song" expresses the writer's own split emotions: it is both a lament and a cry of exultation. But, unlike Carroll, Kipling does not rest content with this expression of ambi- valence. He follows "Tiger! Tiger!," the last Mowgli story of the first book, with "The White Seal," the beginning of a new sequence. The last words of Mowgli's song ("My heart is heavy with the things I do not understand") are followed by the reassuring lines of the "Seal Lullaby" that opens Kotick's story ("Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us, / And black are the waters that sparkled so green"). We have once more retrogressed into the security of a womblike world such as that of the cave in which Mother Wolf had first protected her adopted child. The story of Kotick's election thus acts as a kind of looking-glass pendant to the previous account of Mowgli's own rise from precarious infancy to mastery. Like Mowgli, Kotick is unique, but the significance of his uniqueness is not as readily grasped by the creatures around him as Mowgli's was in his adopted jungle world. Whereas Raksha, the Wolf Mother, can immediately foretell that the bold brown baby who has pushed her cubs aside will develop into Shere Khan's killer, the simpler Mathka merely tells her hus- band, Sea Catch, that "our baby's going to be white!" (p. 77). The 25TheJungle Books (New York: New American Library, 1961), p. 71. This edi- tion, which respects the original arrangement that Kipling later abrogated when he placed all Mowgli stories into a single jungle Book, is cited hereafter in the text.</page><page sequence="26">522 Nineteenth-Century Fiction implications of this anomaly do not greatly disturb her or her mate. She is as placid and accepting as the young seals who blithely toddle into the slaughterhouse. The whiteness of her seal pup, however, sets him as much apart from the others as Mowgli's humanity had distinguished him from his wolf brothers. It is an emblematic token of his superiority, not just over seals "as stupid and unaccommo- dating as men" (p. 76) but also over the dull-witted Aleuts whose superstitious awe (so like Buldeo's in the Indian village) causes them to spare the pale mutant. In a way, however, the Aleuts are correct, for Kotick's extraordinariness does indeed make him seem unnatural. While Mowgli's conversion into the potential leader of the wolf pack is presented as the seemingly logical outgrowth of the combined teachings of Akela, Baloo, Bagheera, as well as of the development of his innately superior human intellect and instincts, Kotick's trans- formation into a kind of Moses who will lead the seal people into a promised land remains lodged in a quasi-evolutionary fairy tale. We are asked to believe that this shrewd observer possesses a near- human intelligence as well as superhuman strengths. Whereas all other seals seem infantile and slow and "need a long time to turn things over in their minds" (p. 92), Kotick alone acts as a respon- sible human adult would. Having reached the threshold of manhood, Mowgli must choose self-exile from the inadequate social organizations of both jungle and village. Immersed as he is in a much simpler primal world, Kotick can use the experience gained during his own self- exile to induce a change in that childish seal world. He, too, has been "lonesome" as an adolescent. But he gathers information during this stage, exploring the North and South Pacific, question- ing other marine mammals, until he at last finds the desired haven for his people. To win them over, he enlists the very "rage" that had confirmed Mowgli as a bitter outcast. Kotick's aggression is in the service of a social ideal. If the killing of Shere Khan remains above all an act of personal revenge that results in Mowgli's isolation from beasts and villagers alike, the epic defeat of "thousands" of rival seals by a bloodied Kotick, "red from head to tail," is undertaken for the benefit of the vanquished. Kotick thus adopts the role of leader rejected by Mowgli. He is, after all, a grown animal, not a growing human being. If Mowgli must hunt apart from man and wolf pack, Kotick conducts his "army" of ten thousand seals into the inland sea "where no man comes" (p. 92).</page><page sequence="27">Victorian Fantasies for Children 523 Both Kotick and Mowgli help dramatize Kipling's lifelong yearning for a social organism that might offer on an adult level the same sense of wholeness he had enjoyed during his early Indian childhood. But Kotick's satisfaction of this yearning is cast as a wish- ful fable, a fantasy that younger readers may want to embrace but which older readers must recognize as being wrought by "fancy." In its narrative mode "The White Seal" differs sharply from the three Mowgli stories that precede it. Despite surface similarities- the continued reliance on talking animals, the common thematic em- phasis on election, growth, and mastery-its texture is calculatedly antithetical. If the anthropomorphism of the Mowgli stories is deftly con- cealed by a veneer of naturalism, it is blatantly exposed in "The White Seal." Before we hear Father Wolf speak in a human lan- guage, we are conditioned to observe his animal behavior: we see him wake up, scratch himself, yawn, and spread his paws. In "The White Seal," however, there is no such suspension of disbelief. Human talk and a human self-consciousness immediately set the tone. Realism is deliberately subverted. We must rely on a narrator who asks us to believe that the ensuing tale has been transmitted by "a very quaint little bird" (p. 75), Limmershin the Winter Wren, providentially blown onto the rigging of his Japan-bound steamship. And, instead of observing credible animal actions, we are made to overhear Matkah's slow-witted fighter-mate rebuking her in tones that are unmistakably parodic of human conversations: "Late as usual. Where have you been?" (p. 76). When Sea Catch proudly dis- plays his wounds and "ribbons" to his spouse, she impatiently ex- claims, "Oh, you men, you men!" (p. 77). Nor are the creatures whom Kotick will later encounter ever as realistically or lyrically pre- sented as a Kaa or a Bagheera. Instead, like Tenniel drawings or Disney caricatures (or like the cartoons which John Lockwood Kip- ling drew for his little son), they are persistently rendered as humans in animal attire. The walruses whom Kotick meets look at him "as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy" (p. 84). And the sea cows who go on "schlooping and grazing and chomping" as Kotick politely addresses them as "gentle- men," answer him "by bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog-Footman" in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (p. 88). The literary cross-reference is clearly made with tongue-in-cheek by the playful narrator; we are dependent throughout on his intrusive</page><page sequence="28">524 Nineteenth-Century Fiction point of view and cannot directly recover the perspectives of either his presumed informant ("Limmershin told me that") or of his pre- sumed seal-hero ("'By the Great Combers of Magellan!' he said, beneath his moustache"). In "The White Seal" Kipling thus deliberately invokes the comic conventions of earlier Victorian children's classics: Limmer- shin resembles those other tiny animal guides found in Gatty, Carroll, or Molesworth; the Walrus is a cousin of the oyster-eater in Through the Looking-Glass. The introduction of this frame of refer- ence may please the small child as well as the adult. But it also makes it more difficult for either implied reader to extend to Kotick the same empathy we are encouraged to feel when we observe Mowgli's acute growing pains and uncompleted identity. The adolescent Mowgli who at the end of "Tiger! Tiger!" cannot yet marry or "become a man" acts as the fulcrum that draws the sym- pathies of both the forward-looking child and the backward-looking adult. Kotick, however, cannot bring about such a fusion in per- spectives. He may delay his mother's exhortations that he "marry and settle down" or his father's advice that "he grow up and be a big seal like your father" (pp. 87, 85), but when he finally does fight the recusant seal tribe, he is aided by that selfsame father and admir- ingly observed by both Matkah and the "seal that he was going to marry." The juvenile reader, especially if he is still a powerless "little boy" rather than a little girl, may find such prowess intensely grati- fying: Kotick has after all now excelled his father's might and gained the admiration of his "cowered down" mother (p. 91). The adult reader, however, more attuned to the story's burlesque elements, is likelier to regard the extraordinary white seal as a mere agent for the narrator's own superior stance towards the marine world he so comically animates. When Kotick brands the speechless sea cows as "idiots" (p. 88) or when he contemptuously tells his immovable brethren, "I'm going to teach you now" (p. 91), he earns a far more elevated status than Mrs. Gatty's sententious garden snail. Kotick's ironic distance from the childish behavior of the subhuman sea creatures (and human Aleuts) he outwits and defeats and, what is more, his selfless concern for the survival of his species have the effect of making him seem a fellow grown-up to readers eager to regard their own competitiveness and aggression as serving some</page><page sequence="29">Victorian Fantasies for Children 525 social superego. Child reader and adult reader alike may thus wel- come this fable as a parable of nature that endorses instinct and socialization. But the pleasure each takes in its texture is achieved at quite different, possibly even antithetical, levels of identification. A different blend of innocence and experience operates in "How the Whale Got His Throat" in a collection of stories addressed to an audience of even younger children. Here too the treatment is comical. And, once again, the emphasis falls on survival, adapta- tion, self-reliance. But the elements of implausibility, here as well as in the otherJust So Stories, can be shared by child and grown-up. Whereas the adult reader of "The White Seal" is encouraged to maintain a detached superiority over the materials in the story, that reader now becomes the narrator's collaborator in a playful suspen- sion of disbelief enacted in a game both can share with the small child-auditor. Like the otherJust So Stories, "How the Whale Got His Throat" is what Roger Lancelyn Green calls an "unnatural his- tory," a parable of anti-Nature.26 For it sets out to dissolve the anti- thetical states of being of adult and child. And it does so by dissi- pating as well the fear of death experienced in Gatty's and Carroll's work, as well as in Kipling's own "White Seal." If Kotick's cleverness permits him to lead his tribe away from the bloody slaughter of the Aleut killing-pens, it is the alliance of two puny creatures that will prevent the monstrous Whale from vo- raciously decimating all inhabitants of the sea. To protect itself from the Whale's hunger, the lonely "small 'Stute Fish" who speaks in "a small 'stute voice" leads the sea monster to consider a tastier morsel: "Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?" (p. 3). Like the Bagheera who knew that the puny Mowgli could, as a human being, defeat the gluttonous Shere Khan, so does the 'Stute Fish anticipate the Whale's comeuppance. The shipwrecked Mariner, armed only with his suspenders and a jackknife, seems negligible as the Whale's opponent. Still, the 'Stute Fish warns the Whale that this creature is "a man-of-infinite-resource-and-sagacity" (p. 4). Although the Whale fails to heed the warning, its repetition is not wasted on the reader. An alliance is formed, not just between 26Kipling and the Children, p. 181; Green might have recalled Gatty's work, however, before baldly stating thatJust So Stories is a work with "no real literary ancestors" (p. 178).</page><page sequence="30">526 Nineteenth-Century Fiction 'Stute Fish and the Mariner but also between the narrator and his double readership. For if the child may empathize with the 'Stute Fish, both child and adult can identify with the "man-of-infinite- resource-and-sagacity" who, in Kipling's first illustration, is similarly dwarfed by the mighty whale. Once "inside the Whale's warm, dark, inside cupboards," the Mariner behaves like an insouciant fetus: "he stumped and he jumped and he thumped and he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and he prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he cried and he sighed, and he crawled and he bawled" (p. 5). But though deliciously childish, his behavior is calculated. He may be infantile (he has, after all, "his mummy's leave to paddle" in the ocean; p. 4), but he is not content with making the hiccoughing Whale gladly spew him back out again THIS is the picture of the Whale swallowing the Mariner with his infinite-resource- and-sagacity, and the raft and the jack-knife and his suspenders, which you must not forget. The buttony-things are the Mariner's suspenders, and you can see the knife close by them. He is sitting on the raft, but it has tilted up sideways, so you don't see much of it. The whity-thing by the Mariner's left hand is a piece of wood that he was trying to row the raft with when the Whale came along. The piece of wood is called the jaws-of-a-gaff. The Mariner left it outside when he went in. The Whale's name was Smiler, and the Mariner was called Mr. Henry Albert Bivvens, A.B. The little 'Stute Fish is hiding under the Whale's tummy, or else I would have drawn him. The reason that the sea looks so ooshy-skooshy is because the Whale is sucking it all into his mouth so as to suck in Mr. Henry Albert Bivvens and the raft and the jack-knife and the suspenders. You must never forget the suspenders.</page><page sequence="31">Victorian Fantasies for Children 527 at his "natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion" (p. 5). The Mariner has yet to justify his election by the 'Stute Fish as one who, like Kotick and Mowgli, is capable of a higher form of mastery. In- deed, his infinite-resource-and-sagacity permits him to induce an evolutionary change that will hereafter save future victims from the Whale's appetite. For the Mariner is a tool-wielding creature, a man. His jackknife, however, will not be used as the Indian dagger with which Mowgli slashes off Shere Khan's hide or the skinning tools with which the Aleuts rip off the furs of bludgeoned seals. It is not a weapon of aggression but a tool that enables him to perform a feat of prosthetic dentistry: the Mariner cuts up the raft "into a little square grating all running criss-cross," ties it "firm with his suspen- ders," and lodges it "good and tight into the Whale's throat" (p. 9). The death-inflicting gullet of the Whale is forever closed. 'Stute Fish and Mariner alike are safe. The adult anxieties that make their way into the works of Mrs. Gatty and Carroll and that also infiltrate The Jungle Book stories are neatly defused in this comic parable. The reconciliation of extremes, not possible in "Tiger! Tiger!" and achieved only on separate levels in "The White Seal," is effected with seeming effort- lessness through a regressive blending acceptable to both child and adult. The captions Kipling provided for his illustrations help fur- ther this harmonizing. The Whale, the first caption informs us, bears the name of Smiler. Though still mighty, the second caption notes, it was unable to revenge itself on the 'Stute Fish "till he got over his temper, and then they became good friends again." Equilibrium is conveyed by Kipling's almost Blakean second drawing. The Whale, its mouth now firmly shut, cannot reach the little 'Stute Fish, safely concealed in a womblike sack "among the roots" that grow "in front of the Doors of the Equator." The draw- ing's composition balances the 'Stute Fish of Innocence with the Whale, who has been modified by Experience. The horizontal Equator is kept "in order" by two mythical guardians. These arti- ficers guard the gates to an unknown higher reality, "kept shut, because a door ought always to be kept shut" (p. 10). Yet that higher reality is implied by the double consciousness of a Kipling eager to blend, as Blake had done, the two contrary states of perception into a third realm that might guarantee the inviolability of both child and adult.</page><page sequence="32">528 Nineteenth-Century Fiction HERE is the Whale looking for the little 'Stute Fish, who is hiding under the Door- sills of the Equator. The little 'Stute Fish's name was Pingle. He is hiding among the roots of the big seaweed that grows in front of the Doors of the Equator. I have drawn the Doors of the Equator. They are shut. They are always kept shut, because a door ought always to be kept shut. The ropy-thing right across is the Equator itself; and the things that look like rocks are the two giants Moar and Koar, that keep the Equator in order. They drew the shadow-pictures on the Doors of the Equator, and they carved all those twisty fishes under the Doors. The beaky-fish are called beaked Dolphins, and the other fish with the queer heads are called Hammer- headed Sharks. The Whale never found the little 'Stute Fish till he got over his temper, and then they became good friends again. IV The intense consciousness of a double readership of child and adult that I have tried to trace in the work of Gatty, Carroll, and Kipling carries certain implications that I should very succinctly like to rehearse. These implications are both theoretical and historical. Recent critical theory has valuably insisted that the meaning of a text resides above all in the reader's experience of that text. That experience, all are agreed, is hardly uniform. And yet the ideal reader posited by critics such as Wayne Booth, Wolfgang Iser, and Stanley Fish inevitably remains an "informed" reader who, though capable of a sophisticated balancing of alternative meanings, none- theless remains a single entity- an adult, in other words, far</page><page sequence="33">Victorian Fantasies for Children 529 removed from those "immature readers" whom Booth dismisses for failing to achieve an ironic distance from Emma Woodhouse. Fan- tasies written for children, however, especially when as complex as the Alice or the Jungle books, do remind us that the innocent or immature reader's responses cannot be disregarded - that in fact such responses were courted and expected by authors similarly divided into mature and immature (or regressive) selves. Art the- oreticians concerned with form and color in painting are highly interested in the creativity of the child. Literary theorists, on the other hand, as Felicity A. Hughes has pointed out, are notably unin- terested in children's literature even though a child reader's per- spective remains imbedded in the responses of every "informed" adult reader.27 This segregation has a historical origin. The double audience to whom Victorian fantasists appealed began to break down precisely when aesthetic theorists of the novel like George Moore and Henry James bemoaned the demands placed on the "serious" novelist by such a multileveled public. In 1885 Moore proclaimed: "Let us renounce the effort to reconcile these two irreconcilable things -art and young girls"; in 1899 James, somewhat more long-windedly, derogated the "literature, as it may be called for convenience, of children" for illustrating, as far as he was concerned, "the demoral- isation, the vulgarisation of literature in general, the increasing familiarity of all such methods of communication, the making itself supremely felt, as it were, of the presence of the ladies and children - by whom I mean, in other words, the reader irreflective and uncritical. "128 It seems time to reinstate that maligned "irreflective" reader, not only in our assessment of works expressly written for children but also of those mid-Victorian novelists whom James found similarly clumsy in their handling of their readership. For if, as I have tried to show, the Victorian fantasists who wrote for children inevitably in- corporated an adult point of view into their fables of innocence, the reverse holds true for "adult" Victorian fiction, in which a regressive suspension of disbelief is persistently invoked to counter the 27"Children's Literature: Theory and Practice," ELH, 45 (1978), 542-61. 28Quoted by Hughes in "Children's Literature: Theory and Practice," pp. 547, 546; the excerpts are from George Moore's Literature at Nurse, or Circulating Morals, ed.

Mr. Pickwick's inviolable innocence offsets the "chicanery" and "imposture" of the adult world through which he wanders;29 nourished by the old fairy tales told to her as a child by her nurse Bessie, Jane Eyre can find in Rochester a fellow believer in goblins and "men in green"; the "dreaming" narrator who stands on the stone bridge in the opening of The Mill on the Floss recognizes her former shape in the "little girl" who stands perilously poised at "the edge of the water."30 Even in Middlemarch, that novel for grown-ups, as Virginia Woolf called it, Ladislaw and Dorothea become "like two children," with their hands clasped, as the angry lightning-storm hammers on the windowpanes. Child- hood, invoked even in the most "adult" of Victorian fictions, re- mained a ballast that might insure author and reader against the dangers of succumbing to the "falsehood of extremes."
