Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. . . . They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden (Genesis 3: 6-8) Then the Lord God said, "See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil (Genesis 3: 22) MZJV125 (2010): 1050-1074 © 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MLN 1051 Introduction: An Other Bible On the question of religion in Derrida, John Caputo has remarked that "Jacques Derrida has religion, a certain religion, his religion, and he speaks of God all the time. The point of view of Derrida's work as an author is religious—but without religion and without religion's God" (xviii). Perhaps the same could be said of Cixous. The religious is never absent in Cixous's works. As Hugh Pyper has observed, "the range of [Cixous's] engagement with the Bible is considerable," and that "scattered throughout her writings are . . . often quite sustained engagements with particular biblical texts" (83). Or as Sal Renshaw has put it, "it would be hard to find a Cixousian text that does not in some way refer to the religious" (173). And yet, as in Derrida, one would not find in Cixous "religion's God." In the words of Charlotte Berkowitz, "For Helene Cixous, . . . God embodies the sacred. But in Cixous's lexicon, God is not the Father" (176). Doing "without religion's God" however, especially in Cixous's early works, is not just refusing to acknowledge God as "the Father." Like many Cixous scholars, Berkowitz will point out that Cixous "disdains those parts of the Bible that represent Paternal Law," and explicitly challenges "religion's God," or the masculine, prohibitive law that it has come to represent (177).1 Claude Cohen-Safir goes further to suggest that Cixous as such inscribes a "counter-Bible" [contre-Bible], where "the known metaphors: the tree, virile elevation, and the fall, are subtly hijacked of their original meaning into a resolutely humanistic and feminine perspective" (361, my translation). For Cohen-Safir also, the consequence of Eve eating from the tree of knowledge in Cixous is no longer the apocalyptic "millennial deprivation of knowledge," but something creative, whose "conquering" and "exploratory" spirit ought to be celebrated (361). The affirmation of such "humanistic and feminine" transgression against "religion's God" has also been noted by Susan Sellers. Reading Cixous's Lajeune nee (1973), Sellers notes a "feminine willingness to risk [God's] prohibition" (3). "Eve," Sellers continues, "follows her desire and defies God's incomprehen sible prohibition not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Eve's refusal, Cixous writes, creates for herself and the world the opportunity for knowledge, innovation and uncensored choice" (3). This present essay seeks to continue the project, initiated by the aforementioned Cixous scholars, of pursuing the question of religion in Cixous.2 I am particularly interested in the works of Cixous that appeared in the 90s, and I pose the question if they are as forcefully</page><page sequence="3">1052 IRVING GOH "without religion and without religion's God" as the earlier texts. I will argue that they remain no doubt "without religion's God." However, it cannot be said unequivocally that they are "without religion." In fact, it can even be said—especially if one follows Verena Conley's observation, if not prophecy, that Cixous's works of the 90s would bear "messianic tones"—that the point of view there takes on a religious turn, a turn from "without religion" to within religion (Helene 130). Several of Cixous's texts of the 90s will indeed be traced by a messi anic trajectory rather than religious defiance. Texts such as Beethoven a jamais (1993), Messie (1996), Savoir (1997/1998), and "Conversation avec l'ane" (1997) will even suggest a slight religious shift or conver sion in Cixous's writing. To be sure, this conversion is not one that acquiesces or abdicates to "religion's God" or to dogmatic religion or religious dogmas. As Cixous says elsewhere, there is "no Christian repentance" ("Without End" 29). In this particular conversion, Cixous's writing does not abandon the endeavor to undo or go beyond the masculine and prohibitive biblical law. That endeavor remains, except, unlike in the early works, there is no outright celebration of religious transgression, no explicit renunciation of religion, no open declara tion of being "without religion." A subtler strategy is adopted here instead, which involves remaining, as suggested above, within religion. And this is because there is the realization—and the characters in Cixous's narratives would come to display this—that it is from within religion that one can sidestep or surpass the masculine, prohibitive biblical law and its apocalyptic effects. It is a strategy that perhaps recalls Derrida's endeavor to think beyond metaphysics in the 1967 essay, "La structure, le signe et le jeu," where Derrida argues that "to have done with metaphysics, there is no sense in doing without the concepts of metaphysics," or that "the passage beyond philosophy does not consist in turning the page of philosophy . . . but to continue to read philosophers in a certain mannera particular manner not bound by the need to absolutely negate the thing that one seeks to go beyond (412; 421-22, my translation). Such a strategy is indeed deployed in Cixous's "messianic" works of the 90s. They certainly do not seek to do "without religion," or to inscribe a radical "counter-Bible" as Cohen-Safir argues (361). Instead, they remain within the pages of the Bible, even within the pages where the Paternal Law is at work. In other words, just as Derrida does not turn the pages of metaphysics or philosophy, Cixous's "messianic" works do not turn the pages of religion either, but read them "in a certain manner," such that what can perhaps be called an other Bible—Cixous after all speaks of an</page><page sequence="4">MLN 1053 "other book" [autre livre] or "the Bible that is mine" [la Bible a moi] that writes itself from within "Conversation avec l'ane"—unfolds from within those pages (95; 104, my translation). If this other Bible is to be "without religion's God," sidestepping the prohibitions and apocalyptic effects of biblical law, and yet not "without religion" perse, it would need to be structured around a particular point of view. It would need a point of view radically different from those that have determined every authoritative (and masculine) reading of the Bible, but which nevertheless remains within religion's Genesis. As the abovementioned "messianic" texts of Cixous will suggest, the unfolding of an other Bible is not hinged upon any anthropocentric or anthropomorphic point of view, not even the "resolutely humanistic and feminine perspective" of the earlier works as Cohen-Safir has noted, but an animal point of view (361). An animal point of view can be considered to be within religion and "without religion's God" at the same time because it is a point of view that accompanies the human at the moment of his and her transgression of religious law. But it remains free from the malediction of the knowledge of shame of nakedness, indifferent to that death by knowledge from which Adam and Eve suffer after eating from the tree of knowledge. In other words, the animal point of view sidesteps divine prohibitions and the damning consequences when divine commandments are transgressed. (One notes from the Genesis story that animals after all were never given the commandment to not eat from the tree of knowledge; and whether the human eats from the tree of knowledge or not, the animal is that which never knows the divine damnation of "religion's God," it never knows shame nor knows how to have shame.)3 The animal point of view can be further said to be within religion in the sense that even though the animal follows the human in his and her subsequent Fall from Eden, it has never in effect been ban ished from Paradise. Perhaps the animal has never known the loss of Paradise, and remains to keep sight of it. Without this sense of loss, an other Bible with an animal point of view may even be said to be free from a certain work of mourning that bears on the human point of view. Having eaten from the tree of knowledge, death by knowledge of shame and nakedness is what human vision sees or what their eyes are opened to. In other words, as long as the human sees, every living moment is a work of mourning with regard to that death by knowl edge. To exacerbate the problem of human vision, one notes from Genesis 3 that the human, after his or her eyes are opened, does not however see everything, despite his or her vision of good and evil,</page><page sequence="5">1054 IRVING GOH a vision that places the human in a parallel position with the godly. According to the narrative of Genesis 3, there remains a blinding effect to this human vision, which comes from the humans' anxiety to conceal themselves from God, as if wanting to blind themselves from the presence of God. In that sense, humans have opened their eyes only to lose sight of divine presence. The animal, on the other hand, not only has no cause to mourn for any death by knowledge of shame, but has never needed to blind itself to divine presence either, and hence also no cause to mourn for the lost vision of divine pres ence. The animal point of view therefore, with regard to the question of religion, is essentially indifferent to the human work of mourning; and an other Bible with an animal point of view will be one that is done with mourning the fall of Man, the loss of sight of God or the divine, the loss of Eden, and the damnation of Eve.4 Free from the preoccupation with such human work of mourning, the animal might even be said to veritably inhabit every instant of living. Every instant for the animal is a moment of intense living, going into the very heart of living or the interiority of life. As such, this other Bible might even accomplish Cixous's project of writing without mourning, as declared in her essay "De la scene de l'lnconscient a la scene de l'Histoire," where she articulates her wish "to arrive at an epoch where one will write not to mourn the past, but to become the prophet of the pres ent" (22, my translation). An animal point of view therefore plays a critical role in the unfold ing or inscription of an other Bible that remains within religion but is "without religion's God" and without mourning. Unfortunately, the animal point of view, as Cixous notes, is not something valued but oftentimes ignored or forgotten. In Messie and "Conversation avec l'ane," Cixous observes that the animal perspective has hardly been taken into account by the Bible. Instead, it is always abandoned at the margins as the narratives proceed to make manifest divine law and power, and male obeisance to divine commandment.5 However, in order to allow an other Bible to unfold, one must follow the ani mal, one must write with, or towards, an animal point of view, rather than to marginalize or denigrate it. That is what Cixous's "messianic" texts do. The question that remains then is how Cixous's texts arrive at that animal point of view. Among the "messianic" texts of the 90s, "Conversation avec l'ane," in my view, provides comprehensive steps towards such a point of view. To elucidate those steps, the rest of the essay proposes a close reading of "Conversation."</page><page sequence="6">MLN 1055 Blindness, or the Rejection of Human Vision What I love is: the proximity of the invisible (Cixous, "Bathsheba" 14) An animal point of view is not an immediate given. As "Conversation" demonstrates, the passage towards an animal point of view, which is also the passage towards an other Bible, first requires the rejection of human vision, and that is precisely what "Conversation" puts to work before it moves into or attains an animal point of view.6 I have suggested above that human vision after the Fall is always a work of mourning, and so this move to reject human vision in order to arrive at a writing that is done with mourning does not really come as a surprise. However, the rejection of sight, at first glance, seems to contradict the beginning of "Conversation," since it opens with an apparent jubilation of recovering from a myopic malediction. The experience of gaining uninterrupted vision in fact parallels the nar rative of Cixous's "Savoir," which is precisely about being able to see with the naked eye following a laser surgery to rectify a myopic condi tion. The jubilant proclamation to see is even executed in a similar rhetoric of unveiling deployed in "Savoir": "I lift the visor from my eyes, I turn my naked eyes towards the world. And I see. I am seeing! With the naked eye, and this is exaltation itself. I pass from non-seeing to seeing-the-world" (82). As in "Savoir" too, the sensation of seeing the world with the naked eye in "Conversation" is likened to receiving a miraculous gift.7 And yet this gift seems to be ultimately refused. This is because, even though one has gained the ability to see with the naked eye, the myopic condition remains to be articulated in the present, as if the ability to see with the naked eye is at the end of it all denounced or disdained. Shortly after the beginning of "Conversa tion," the narrator writes, "By misfortune or secret chance I am born very myopic," and that "before being a woman I am myopic" (81, my italics). In other words, if "Conversation," as in "Savoir," is written after the surgical operation to correct the myopic condition (given the passage of exalted seeing that echoes "Savoir"), myopia then seems to be affirmed and reinstated here instead. This is reinforced towards the end of "Conversation," where the narrator calls for the removal of any shame in inscribing literary heroes who are myopic or who wear glasses, no matter how ridiculous that image may seem. By the end of "Conversation" then, the text's opening passage of exalted seeing is no doubt problematized, and it is clear that Cixous here inclines towards non-seeing if not blindness, rather than vision.</page><page sequence="7">1056 IRVING GOH But the rejection of human vision here goes further than simply sidestepping or merely renouncing the work of mourning that post Fall human vision bears. It in fact plays a critical role in the com mencement of writing an other Bible, and in order to "see" that, it is necessary to return to the passage of exalted seeing. That passage ends with the narrator stating that vision is a gift given to her by the world. What follows is a space or gap in the text. As I read it, this spacing is deliberate, or strategically placed, as if to suggest that there is nothing more to be said or written with the return of sight, as if the narrator has no desire to say or write anything else after possessing vision. If this spacing seems to suggest an implicit disdain for seeing, this hypothesis can be confirmed by the passage that follows the spacing, which begins, "Now I write" (83). It is important to note that vision is not in play in this writing here, for an earlier passage in "Conversa tion" will have already stated that when the narrator writes, writing takes place not in the realm of sight or vision, but in darkness or in the blindness of night. According to the narrator there, "I write the night. I write: the Night [ J'ecris la nuit. J'ecris: la Nuit]" (80). She turns to night because the immediacy of the world brought about by seeing in the light of day, which swarms vision with a hurtling "appearance ing [I'apparitionnement]" or "abrupt appearance [brusque apparition]" according to "Savoir," only interrupts and obstructs writing (16, my translation). Under the capture [captation] of such immediacy in the world of sight, writing becomes impossible. As it is said at the begin ning of "Conversation," daylight vision blinds instead, and there is no knowledge to be gained from such an illuminated world, and hence there is nothing to write about under such optical condition: What we call day prevents me from seeing. The solar day [lejour solaire\ blinds me to the visionary day. The glaring day prevents me from hear ing [entendre] ,a From seeing-hearing [voirentendre]. From hearing myself [ m 'entendre]. With me. With you. With the mysteries. For me to go towards writing, I must escape from the broad daylight that catches (me by) my eyes [j'echappe au gros jour qui me prend (par) les yeux] and fills it with crude grand visions. I do not want to see what is shown. I want to see what is secret. What is hidden among the visible. I want to see the skin of light. (79) Once again, whatever joy in seeing the world or in touching the world through vision in "Conversation" is more or less renounced here. Instead, what is affirmed is to disappear from the light of day that enables vision, or to seek the unseen or "what is hidden among the visible."9 To write, one must not only "slip away from the world</page><page sequence="8">MLN 1057 and from diurnal sociality," but one must also slip into the night. And one slips into this night—and one can do this in spite of the glaring day, by shutting one's eyes: "I close my eyes," and "behind my eyelids I am elsewhere" (79; 80). It is as such that writing begins, not with vision but with blindness: "I write without seeing that I am writing and what I write" (99). The desire for blindness will be further affirmed when the narrator even regrets that myopia is not adequate to the blindness of the night of writing: "myopia is not sufficient to make night" (81). Thus, when the narrator begins again to say that writing resumes after the passage of exalted seeing, it will not be writing with vision but "writing blind" [ecrire aveugle] according to the sub-title of "Conversation." "Now she writes," the narrator says, and "in my dark interior softness, the rapid steps of a book that arrives imprint them selves" (83, my italics). Writing the Passage of Instants, or Writing Beyond Mourning But what takes place in a writing that proceeds in the night or in the blindness of night, such that an other Bible "without religion's God" and beyond mourning begins to imprint itself? According to the narrator, writing as such passes into the very interior of the body of words (cf. "Conversation" 81). It is a writing that traces the birth of words, at the very moment of their genesis, engendered by other existing words in a phrase. This will be a writing that inscribes the temporal "before" or I'avant before things manifest themselves. As the narrator says in "Conversation," "je veux ecrire, avant, au temps encore en fusion d'avant le temps refroidi du recit" 'I want to write, before, at a time still in fusion before the frozen time of the narrative' (84). As such, "I write the genesis that befalls [survient] before [avant] the author" (86). And to ensure that this avant is not a nostalgic investment in the past, for example, a seeking to return to the moment before the Fall, the text will quickly state that a certain instantaneity or now-ness instead is at stake in this avant. This is articulated in "Conversation" when it states that writing the "before" is a question of living, which "takes place like life arriving to us," and which in this case is "to take the living instant with the closest and most delicate words" (86, 93).10 Writing as such would also mean to write with a certain speed—"I write to touch the body of the instant with the ends of words" (94).11 It is "all now," with no time for knowledge acquisition: "this is an attempt [essai] to write down what goes quicker than my consciousness and my hand. But—the passage, by chance, leaves traces. One must act</page><page sequence="9">1058 IRVING GOH quickly. And no time to learn" (85, 88). There is no time to master the knowledge transpiring at any passing instant—"I do not order, I do not conceptualize, I pursue what has overtaken me" (88). Inscribing such instants is a delicate, if not paradoxical negotiation, however. That is because these instants cannot be inscribed with an immediacy that recalls the violent immediacy that characterizes vision or seeing-with-the-naked-eye. Rather, it is a question of inscribing a passage, the passage of one instant unfolding to another. Specifically, it is the inscription of the passage "between night and day" (82) at the moment when one writes in the darkness or blindness of night. In the context of the beginning of "Conversation," this passage is expe rienced in a state of myopia. And myopia, as one understands from "Savoir," is no less an experience of a passage, akin to "swimming across the channel between the blind continent and the seeing continent" (18). Vision, or seeing with the naked eye, on the other hand, lacks this sense of passage. Vision, as noted earlier from "Savoir," implies instead an "abrupt appearance." As such, seeing in "Conversation" is never associated with the word passage: the closest it gets—and this is strictly speaking in orthographic terms only—is paysage, which is landscape, and does not suggest any sense of passage (83).12 For the narrator of "Conversation" however, "What is important to me is not appearance, it is the passage. I like the word Passage. All the words of passage or passing [passe], all the passing and traversing words [ les mots passants etpasseurs]" (81). Devoid of any sense of passage, seeing serves little to grasp the unfolding of one instant into another. It does not help writing move towards an animal point of view and therefore an other Bible. According to "Conversation," a mode of writing that inscribes a passage, particularly the passage of unfolding instants, following the renunciation of human vision and knowledge, is critical in bringing one closer to a writing that is done with mourning (and hence closer to an other Bible). In "Conversation," to be done with mourning is after all to accept the fact that everything is passage or that everything passes (on), and that there is no future, no new instant without the passing of a previous one: "what just arrived will perish. Strange and exalting meeting of the quick [le vif] and its end. One advances in leaving behind oneself. Human destiny: to be of the flesh of forgetfulness [etre de la chair a oubli]" (93). Once that fact is accepted, the "combat with mourning" can begin, and one can begin anew without the past (e.g. the Fall, the damnation of Eve, the loss of Eden, etc.) haunt</page><page sequence="10">MLN 1059 ing or violently supplementing the present (93). That re-beginning is a question of letting go, if not a question of forgetting: "one must forget in order to re-present oneself virginal [se re-presenter vierge], to offer oneself virginal [s'offrir vierge] to the new year" (93).13 Writing the passage, or writing without mourning, is then a question of writ ing without holding on to things obsessively: "I do not write to keep" (93) .H But as it is hinted in "Conversation," this will require something other than human spirit: writing beyond the work of mourning must be taken up outside of "human destiny." Animots In "Conversation," it is the animal condition that facilitates writing the passage, and that is why "Conversation" in general can be said to be preoccupied with sliding into an animal perspective. I note that when the text insists that one approaches the passage by not tarrying with a word, by not seeking "to learn" or "conceptualize" it, it is pre ceded by the passage where the narrator speaks of Abraham's donkey. In conventional wisdom, the donkey is hardly an intelligent animal (88). However, in "Conversation," both the donkey and its apparent ignorance are not to be slighted. Placing the image of a donkey before the passage on the insistence not to tarry with words in fact suggests that the animal, without the human desire to conceptually master or comprehend every word that arrives, hears [entendre] and receives every word. It is the animal condition of being apparently ignorant, of being without human learning and intelligence, that will precisely facilitate a writing that registers every word of every instant, facilitating, in other words, writing's approach towards the passage. Such understanding of the animal is no doubt grasped by the narrator when she compares herself to a donkey as she undertakes the writing of the passage: "I am only an ideal donkey, I bear and I hear, I admit it [je I'avoue], my work is of acceptation [mon travail est d'acceptation]" (85). To write the passage of the instant without stopping to learn or conceptualize, one must abandon the human condition and follow the animal, or pass into an animal point of view or condition instead. As the text says, "with the donkey, one goes immediately to the essential" (88). The proximity, if not non-distinction, between writing and the animal or animal condition can be further established in the following phrase, where the narrator writes, "J'ecris sur l'ane" 'I write on the donkey' (88). When one recalls that the narrator, some moments before, had</page><page sequence="11">1060 IRVING GOH written, in a similar sentence structure, that "J'ecris sur ecrire" 'I write on writing' (86), there can be no doubt of the link between writing and the animal or donkey in this case. To use a term from "Conversation," writing for Cixous here, which is writing the passage or writing which unfolds an other Bible, is a mat ter of animots15 or "animal-words" as Eric Prenowitz translates it (140). It is a matter of following or chasing after the animal, of assuming an animal perspective. Or else, to use a word akin to the word "pas sage," it is a matter of smuggling oneself into an animal point of view or condition (I note here that the word passeur, one of the "passage" words or les mots passants et passeurs that the narrator likes, can also have the sense of a smuggler or smuggling).16 It is as such that the book to be actualized, according to "Conversation," is not only "an anarchic thing" but also "an untamed animal" (100). It is as such too that the narrator, in response to her own question as to "how does a book arrive," will say, "like a cat" (103). At this point, the rejection of human sight in the writing of an other Bible is no less forgotten, for these animots are inscribed under the cloak of nocturnal or myopic blindness. As the narrator says, "when I am in pursuit of a thought that runs away before me like a wonderful game [gibier], my eyes no longer see" (80). Vice versa, the experience of writing in blindness or darkness is no less an animal condition. According to the narrator, it is an experience that takes place "barely at the break of dawn . . . still on all fours" (82). With animots, and that is to say, with the renunciation of human sight and human savoir, and with the passage towards the passing moments where words are engendered, one can perhaps finally speak more affirmatively of a mode of writing which unfolds an other Bible beyond or done with mourning. I stress again that this other Bible remains within the pages of the religious Bible; elements of the latter, like the Fall, are neither repressed nor denied here. With regard to the Fall, the narrator in "Conversation" does not fail to write that she has been "driven out of paradise" (104). And yet the Fall is accepted almost indifferently, without bitterness, guilt, or remorse. Instead, in the writing of "Conversation," there will in fact be joy or even jouissance (85). But I argue that there can be such indifference and jouissance only because one has smuggled oneself from the human subject to the animal point of view, which, as noted, does not see what humans see, does not know what humans know, and therefore does not mourn that death by human knowledge. This point is no doubt well-grasped by the narrator, and the understanding of the animal as</page><page sequence="12">MLN 1061 being free from the work of mourning can even be said to form the underlying motivation of "Conversation." This is because the smuggling into an animal condition can in fact be elicited right at the begin ning of "Conversation." I bring to mind again that writing there is a question of writing in the realm of night, of writing with eyes shut, with myopia, or which in short rejects human vision. I now add the observation of something like a Fall that accompanies this rejection of human sight there, although it is not a Fall that seeks to play out the biblical Fall, which could serve to expiate the latter, but one that is a passage towards the animal condition: "When I close my eyes, the passage is opened, the dark gorge, I descend. Or rather it [the passage] descends: I trust myself to the primitive space, I do not resist the forces that overwhelms me. There is no more gender [II n'y a plus de genre]. I become a thing with raised ears" (80, my italics). Having already mentioned the donkey in "Conversation," I do not think it unreasonable to say that the "thing with raised ears" that one becomes in this Fall is in the image of that animal.17 But to explicate how the animal condition opens the way towards an other Bible where the Fall is received and accepted with indifference or jouissance, it is necessary to explicate the phrase il n'y a plus de genre. I have translated il n'y a plus de genre as there is no more gender. Certainly, genre can be translated as "genus," or "genre" in the sense associated with types of writing, like the essay genre or the genre of the novel. The French genre can also mean gender though, and I tend to see it as the case here. I would argue that gender here also refers to human gender or sexual difference, or if one prefers, the genre of gender differ ence that befalls and afflicts humans in Genesis after eating from the tree of knowledge. I am certainly not saying that the notion of gender does not exist for animals, but gender for animals certainly does not bear the accompanying human vision and knowledge of shame when one animal sees another animal naked, or when one is seen naked by another animal. In short, gender in animal is not supplemented by the human knowledge of shame in the face of gender difference. In "Conversation," il n'y a plus de genre can be translated as no more (human) gender because a shift towards animal gender can be said to be occurring there, a shift that wants to renounce human gender difference. Here, I note that the question of writing in "Conversa tion" is also a question of "receiving the message," the message that is "paradisiacal nudity" and "without censure" (82). The narrator further elaborates that to receive that message, "one can only receive it nude [nue\. No, not undressed. The nudity of before all clothing [La nudite</page><page sequence="13">1062 IRVING GOH d'avant tout vetement]" (82). Such that "Conversation" does not regress to a work of mourning sustained by a post-Fall human sense of shame, "paradisiacal nudity" cannot be nostalgic of human nakedness before the Fall. Cixous ensures this by saying that "paradisiacal nudity" is to be with "neither pride nor shame" (104). A "paradisiacal nudity" that is with "neither pride nor shame," that is to say, without the human pride of defying divine commandment to eat from the tree of knowl edge, and without the sense of human shame that comes after that defiance, is more an animal point of view rather than a human con dition.18 "Paradisiacal nudity" therefore cannot be human nakedness here. Instead, it inclines towards animal nakedness where a human perspective of gender does not come into play. It is only as animal nakedness, or via an animal perspective, that "paradisiacal nudity" can participate freely—"knowing neither limit nor hesitation" (82)—in the jouissance, guided by a "law of life," which enables an "erotic and fertile genius" to see to the "couplings," "hybridizations," or "crossings" of words (96). In this jouissance, there is no human shame of nakedness, no mourning for the Fall through the human knowledge of shame and nakedness. And to be sure that this other garden of "paradisiacal nudity" is strictly of animal nakedness and perspective, the Adamic or human act of naming will neither be in play here (96, 84). In this other garden or other Bible, only words are received, just as how the animal, like the animals that accompany humans in the Bible, receives every word that is said, muttered, and even unsaid. Here, there will only be the witnessing of the birth of words, witnessing every living instant of the birth of every word. Now, the jouissance in "Conversation," which is without denial nor bitterness of the biblical Fall of Man, and which immerses itself within the instants of living by not seeking to conceptualize or retain what passes, might seem to echo what Cixous has called "second innocence" in one of her seminars, "Grace and Innocence," given in the 80s.19 According to Cixous there, "second innocence" has nothing to do with that "pregiven [and] paradisiacal" Edenic innocence (31). In other words, it does not yearn to regain or return to the latter. It keeps the biblical Fall well in mind, but at the same time, it also understands that if the guilt inherited from that Fall is pursued to its extreme limit, by developing a discourse that incessantly plays out this guilt, projecting it ad infinitum, there will reach a point where this guilt becomes almost meaningless and is transformed into innocence. As Cixous puts it, "at the end of infinite guilt, one can become innocent" (68). One must therefore work towards this "second innocence": it</page><page sequence="14">MLN 1063 is "to be earned" and "should be our goal, our ambition" (70). But this work is nothing but a question of living, a living that is "a very delicate movement of detachment" where "we know something but we do not hold on to it," that is to say, a living that does not hold on to any particular knowledge, especially that knowledge of shame or guilt (67). Such living is also called "grace" in Cixous's terms, and it is through such grace that one achieves "second innocence" since, according to Cixous, "second innocence is precisely the grace one gives to onself" (67). As will be seen later, there is also something of grace in the jouis sance in "Conversation," which further gives the impression of its close proximity to "second innocence." However, I am inclined to think that this jouissance is more, if not less, than the "second innocence" that Cixous speaks of in her seminar. As I have been arguing in this paper, Cixous's "messianic" works of the 90s such as "Conversation" move away from outright religious defiance and make a turn towards being within religion. Jouissance in "Conversation," as said, involves such a turn. "Second innocence" however, consistent with the trajec tories of Cixous's works before the 90s in relation to the question of religion, retains a tinge of religious contestation. The contestation of Man's condemnation through the biblical Fall is almost evident when Cixous writes in "Grace and Innocence," "We are not free fall ing because we do not want to fall" (37). And the quest for "second innocence," which deploys no doubt a rhetoric that advocates "femi nine curiousity," since it is predicated on Clarice Lispector's notion of "wanting" or "thirst," seems to be another defiant celebration of Eve as the creative seeker of knowledge ("Writing the Law" 23; "Grace and Innocence" 35, 37). To add to the "humanistic and feminine"—or in a word, anthropomorphic—"second innocence," Cixous also makes a distinction between humans and animals in this innocence. Through a reading of Heinrich von Kleist's "Marionette Theater," particularly with reference to the figure of the bear there, Cixous makes a marked separation between humans and animals such as the bear, stating that animals continue to possess a "status of purity" while post-Fall humans have lost theirs (57). Jouissance in "Conversation" however, as discussed, does not make that demarcation between humans and animals. In fact, for there to be a veritable indifference to the biblical Fall and jouissance in "Conversation," it has been shown that there is a smuggling of oneself to the animal point of view. And with this passage to the animal condition, it would seem that one leaves the terrain of an anthropomorphic "second innocence" and enters perhaps what</page><page sequence="15">1064 IRVING GOH may be called instead a "third innocence," an innocence not foreign to the animal. Conclusion: From Jouissance to Messianicite sans messianisme The jouissance of experiencing the passage where every engendered word is received, the jouissance in other words of writing in "paradi siacal nudity," without shame, and therefore beyond mourning that death by human savoir, may be articulated as the passion of the animal.20 Passion, according to Derrida in Demeure, is not only "the experience of love," but also "witnessing" or "testimony" [ temoignage] (26; 28, my translation). Derrida's understanding of "passion" can be applied to the animal condition in "Conversation," since love, and complete receiving or acceptation (of the engendering of words), and therefore testimony too, are at play with regard to the animal there. One example of the passion of the animal in terms of bearing witness in "Conversation" is perhaps the untold dialogue Cixous believes to take place between Abraham and his donkey on their way up to Mount Moria. It would be the dialogue in which, one might presume, Abraham confides to his donkey his despair at obeying God's commandment to put Isaac up for sacrifice, the dialogue without which, Cixous believes, the journey would be unbearably "infernal" (87). In terms of the loving passion of the animal in "Conversation," there is no less the loving touch between oneself and the animal. This touch does more than establish a physical connection between the narrator and the animal, for the touch or passion of a cat is in fact instrumental in giving the narrator access to "touch the body of the instant" in her writing of the passage (94). The latter is after all preceded by a passage on the touch of an animal: "I touch the soft and wild touch of my cat, my female cat [ma chatte\, my female cat that I follow and am [la chatte dontje suis la chatte], and nothing of appropriation between us except moments of grace, without guarantee, without security, without a glance [sans regard] thrown to the following moment" (84, 85).21 With regard to the word passion, I do not ignore the fact that it has borne overtly religious senses in the history of its usage. With that in mind, and having stated that "Conversation" is traced by a passion of the animal, perhaps the discussion can return to the question that has been posed at the beginning of this essay, which is if "Conversation" is "without religion and without religion's God." At first glance, "religion's God" still seems to figure in "Conversation," especially when the nar rator says, "I have never written without God" (101). And yet it has to</page><page sequence="16">MLN 1065 be noted that when the narrator speaks about God, she is not speaking about God per se but "the word God [le mot Dieu]" (100). From this marked distinction between word and concept or thing, perhaps it is not difficult to discern a distancing from "religion's God," a distanc ing that manifests itself further when the narrator lets reverberate the word(s) d'yeux ["of eyes"], which is a homophone of Dieu ["God"], in the proximity of the latter: "Le mot Dieu: le mot d'yeux" 'The word God: the word of eyes' (100). As discussed already, things regarding eyes that see are generally renounced in "Conversation," and so if God is the word of eyes, it will not be surprising that "religion's God" is similarly set up only to be undone.22 The renunciation of "religion's God" in "Conversation" in fact takes place quickly when the narrator proclaims that "God is not that of religions" (100). Instead, God is but a word or another word in the process or passage of writing, a word that articulates and temporarily provides hospitality to all the future words that will arrive: "God is the name of everything that has not yet been said," and "the word God [functions] to give lodging to the infinite multiplicity of everything that would be said" (101). Further, not only will God in "Conversation" be "not the Father" (as Charlotte Berkowitz has noted), but even the monotheistic dimension of "religion's [Christian] God" will be done away with, as the narrator goes on to say that the unfolding of an other Bible will reveal that there are gods rather than a single god: "This page writes itself [s'ecrit] all by itself, this is the proof of the existence of gods" (100, my emphasis). That "Conversation" is "without religion's God" can be established then. But is it absolutely "without religion"? I bring to mind that I have suggested that an other Bible is not inscribed outside of religion's Bible, but within it. The endeavor to create an outside does not lead one beyond the work of mourning. Instead, with the outside, there is in fact no "forgetting" or no letting-go of the trauma suffered on the other side of the boundaries of the outside: the outside itself will always mark the work of mourning with regard to that trauma. (I also bring to mind again Derrida's point that to get beyond metaphysics is not to do without metaphysics but to remain within it and (re) read it "in a certain manner.") In my reading of "Conversation" above, I have tried to demonstrate that to get round the problem of the outside is to smuggle or slide into an animal point of view or condition. Now, the animal may be considered to be "without religion" since, receiving no injunction against eating from the tree of knowledge, it was never sub ject to divine law and commandment, and hence it is beyond religion in this sense. However, in another sense, the animal is not absolutely</page><page sequence="17">1066 IRVING GOH outside of religion, for it has never been in fact banished from Eden, and therefore remains within religion. The animal then occupies an equivocal region where all the turns of being without religion and being within religion are at play. It is the limit, the frontier, the pas sage between within-religion and without-religion, or better, the point where one is beyond (and not outside) religion but remains within religion. Perhaps Derrida's notion of "messanicity without messianism" may be useful to better express this animal perspective or condition of being beyond/within religion. "Messiancity without messianism," according to Derrida in Spectres de Marx, is a question of allowing the future to arrive in its full surprise as a true event, in other words, a condition that does not exclude opening oneself to the complete risk of what arrives from the future (148). In a way, this "emancipatory [emancipatoire] affirmation" can also be said to be an intense living-in the-instant, akin to Cixous's notion of a passage, because it does not cast any headlong vision in order to anticipate what is to come (146). Derrida will argue that such a "structure of experience" is a secular one, "a certain experience of the promise that one can attempt to liberate from all dogmatic and even metaphysical-religious determina tion, from all messianism" (266,147). For that reason, Derrida chooses to underscore the adjective "messianic, . . . rather than messiansim, in order to designate a structure of experience rather than a religion" (266). However, Derrida makes clear that this "messianicity without messianism," despite being without, or beyond, religion, does not absolutely exclude the religious. As Derrida argues, the religious, along with the messianic, will form the "injunction" for us to affirm and respond to the emancipatory "messianic spirit" (264, 148).23 The critical point is to not let "messianicity without messianism" be guided or (pre)determined by any religious figure or commandment. It is only in that sense that "messiancity without messianism" is "without religion," or as Derrida says in Foi et savoir, that "in itself, [messianicity without messianism] does not belong to any Abrahamic religion," or that it is "older than every religion" (37, 72, my translation). Such "messianicity without messianism" presents itself in "Conversa tion." There is after all no lack of a messianic force in inscribing the passage that welcomes the "infinite multiplicity" of instants to-come. Accompanying the narrator is "the always unforeseen Messiah," which she avows as "the force that makes me write" (101). Like Derrida's "messianicity without messianism," which detaches itself from all appur tenances to any religion, the messianic force in "Conversation" has nothing do to with a religious messiah or religious messianism. The</page><page sequence="18">MLN 1067 narrator in "Conversation" refers to "the always unforeseen Messiah" as "you," a "you" which comes and goes freely, and which leaves the narrator no certitude as to whether it will return or not, but none theless gives the narrator an unwavering belief that it will (101). This "you," however, unlike all religious messiahs or messianism, is not a human messiah. Instead, this "you" points to an animal, if not a cat, to be specific. This postulation of a messianic cat in "Conversation" can be derived via a reference to Cixous's Messie. The messianic figure in Messie is indeed none other than a cat, which the narrator there will say not only accompanies the trajectory of the text, but also the characters in the text. This cat nonetheless remains free to come and go as it wishes, but always returns miraculously. Such characterization of the messianic cat in Messie surely foreshadows the description of the messianic "you" in "Conversation" as shown above, and brings the two messianic figures into an uncanny proximity, not to mention that the narrator in Messie also addresses the cat as "you." The messianic "you" in "Conversation" is no less a cat than the messianic cat in Messie then. And if the messianic cat in Messie is always that which leads one to the future, the cat in "Conversation" plays a similar critical role. In "Conversation," the question of the future is no less at stake with the "female cat" that the narrator follows, as she undertakes to inscribe the passage. It is with the "female cat" that "moments of grace, without guarantee, without security, without a glance thrown to the following moment" arise. Such rhetoric, which resonates rather clearly with the Derridean rhetoric of the "to-come" or the "eventness" of the future, surely places the "female cat" in "Conversation" (and Messie) within Derrida's "messianicity without messianism" in terms of its "structure of experience" which, being absolutely invested in the instant, allows the future to arrive in its "absolute surprise" (Foi et Savoir 30) ,24 In this case, it would even seem that "Conversation" (and Messie), more than the works of Derrida perhaps, demonstrate how, by recognizing the messianic force in the passion of the animal or an animal condition or perspective, one succeeds in approaching that "messianicity with out messianism" where there "would be the opening to the to-come [I'avenir] . . . without prophetic prefiguration" (30). The "messianicity without messianism" in "Conversation," borne by the passion of the animal, or by the animal point of view or condi tion, then consolidates the unfolding of an other Bible that is "without religion's God," without mourning, and without appurtenance to any religion, while not needing to be outside of religion. I would now like to conclude with a very short note on the stakes of the text's</page><page sequence="19">1068 IRVING GOH "messianicity without messianism" for what has come to be known as the "post-secular" in contemporary intellectual discourse.25 "Post secular" thought, while still lacking definition, can be described as the attempt to recognize the trace of the religious in our contemporary world despite our belief that we have been living through secular times. It also seeks to acknowledge the rise of local religions without laying claim to any existing dominant or primary religion (e.g. Christianity) to which the former must defer. As such, "post-secular" thought can be said to have similar horizons as Cixous's "messianic" other Bible. At present, "post-secular" thought remains largely anthropocentric and anthropomorphic, which risks privileging, or inclining towards, the perspective of a certain group of people or human community. Actual "post-secular" violence, such as the militant assertion of a local religion in opposition to its being appropriated or homogenized by a dominant religion, has already shown us the precarious outcome of such anthropocentric or anthropomorphic "post-secular" thought. If "post-secular" thought is sincere about welcoming the articulations of a multiplicity of religions where no one religion dominates another, it should take a page from Cixous's "messianic" texts. In other words, it would be in need of an other Bible similar to that which unfolds in Cixous's "messianic" works. It is in need of an other Bible that opens a space of thought not predicated on any religious law or dogma, or any prohibitive law of any "religion's God." As I have demonstrated in this essay through a reading of "Conversation," such an other Bible for "post-secular" thought can be attainable not by a limited "humanistic and feminine" perspective as advocated by Cohen-Safir, nor by any hubristic human vision, but by a turn towards an animal point of view. Cornell University NOTES 1 For example, in the almost blasphemous "The Whale ofjonas" in LePrenom deDieu, there is not only the (feminine) disdain and doubt of the power and existence of a hidden god, but also the narrator's quest to place himself in the position of the "me" [ mot] of the hidden god. 2 I do not presume that the term "religion" itself is unproblematic in Cixous. I rec ognize that "religion" is an equivocal, if not difficult terrain in Cixous's works. In fact, Cixous herself will say, "The word religion doesn't work, I don't know how it's said" ("Strangejew" 70). I am not particularly interested in defining "religion" in Cixous here per se. What I want to highlight in this paper instead, as I will soon state in the essay proper, is the apparent shift from being "without religion and</page><page sequence="20">MLN 1069 without religion's God" in Cixous's early works to something like being "without religion's God" but now remaining within religion in the works of the 90s. 3 As Derrida has noted in L'animal que doncje suis, the "peculiarity of animals [. . .] is to be naked without knowing it," and the animal "does not feel itself nor see itself nude [ni se sent ni se voit nu]" (19; 20, my translation). 4 And in that sense, one may postulate that in this other Bible, there is no longer an Eve who defends and lays claim to her right to desire knowledge. Neither is there an Eve who justifies her eating from the tree of knowledge as an ultimately creative act that paves the way for humankind's wondrous discovery of knowledge. There is also no longer the desire to construct another Garden of Eden as is the case of Le vrai jardin, in explicit opposition to the Garden of Eden in Genesis. But it is important to state that there is no supplication to return to the original garden here, as if remorseful for one's previous rebellious or transgressive gestures. One keeps in mind that there is "no Christian repentance" ("Without End" 29). 5 In Messie, Cixous will speak of the dog Uzi, which will guide, alongside the angel Raphael, Tobias to Media. But, as Cixous points out, "having made its appearance at the beginning of chapter six, one sees that the narrative will no longer give it attention" (12, my translation). And in "Conversation avec l'ane," Cixous will speak of Abraham's donkey, without which, Cixous argues, Abraham's journey up to Mount Moria in order to carry out God's commandment to sacrifice his son Isaac would have been "infernal." However, as Cixous chides, "The Bible does not recount the conversation Abraham had with the donkey" (87, my translation). 6 If, as I am arguing, an other Bible that is "without religion's God" and yet remains within religion, and also beyond any work of mourning, can be attained only via the movement from the rejection of human sight to an animal point of view, this movement is singularly found or completed in "Conversation" and not in "Savoir," Messie, or Beethoven a jamais, and hence my focus on "Conversation" here. 7 Cf. "Conversation": "a gift of the world . . . which is given to me" (83). 8 I follow Eric Prenowitz here to translate entendre as hearing. 9 This seeking to see "what is hidden among the visible" can be compared with the notion of I'invu or the unseen in "Savoir" (in Voiles). L'invu, as the narrator in "Savoir" will slowly come to recognize, is the miracle given to the myopic, the creative privilege of the myopic, which is the privilege of seeing "the not yet [fe pas encore]"There had never been the unseen. It was an invention" (18). She will also realize that she was an "unseen" herself in her previous myopic state, since her inability to see properly everything around her also entails an inability to see herself being seen by others. And she will understand that being an invu herself has in fact been a blissful condition: "Not seeing, she did not see herself being seen, this was her lightness of blindness that was given to her, the great freedom of the effacement of the self' (18). This is a clear contrast to the chaotic "war of faces" (18) she confronts in the world when she sees with the naked eye after the laser surgery. This yearning for the l'invu or "the nostalgia of the secret non seeing" (19), that is to say, the "unexpected mourning" (17) for "her 'my-myopia' [sa 'ma-myopie'Y' (18), will suggest that, like "Conversation," the myopic condition, if not blindness, will be affirmed in "Savoir," rather than the attainment of vision. My reading of "Savoir" certainly runs counter to Frederic Regard's "Faite d'yeux: genese sans genealogie." It would be interesting to take onboard Regard's argu ment, since he not only argues that "Savoir" is an unequivocal celebration of vision, but that as such, it also inscribes something like an other Bible, "another story or history [histoire], another genesis" (216, my translation) in explicit opposition to the apocalyptic narrative of sight in Genesis 3. I disagree with Regard's reading,</page><page sequence="21">1070 IRVING GOH but my disagreement is peripheral to the context of this paper, and hence I leave it as an occasion for another paper. 10 Here, one can refer to "Savoir" once again. The "before" or I'avant in "Conversa tion" surely resonates with the myopic experience of the "not yet" in "Savoir" (see note 9). The latter is a mode of seeing where "everything was perhaps," but it is precisely because of this that living becomes more intense or urgent (14). With regard to living as a myopic, the narrator in "Savoir" would say that "to live was in a state of alert" (14). 11 Besides an other Bible that is in the process of being inscribed here, perhaps what emerges in this traversing towards "the very interior of the body of words" is also what Cixous calls an "interior Bible." Cixous has regarded the "interior Bible" as a world where one disappears to by turning away from looking (as in the process of night-writing in "Conversation"). But this turning away from looking is put in place only in order to be attentive to living, and because of that, the "interior Bible" is a world of "immense limitless life" ("Bathsheba" 18). 12 I refer to "Bathsheba or the interior Bible" again to note that landscape is not something Cixous favors. Of her notion of "interior Bible," she will say, "it is a land without landscape, without monuments. But not without form and without inhabit ants" (5, my emphasis). As to what these "inhabitants" would be in this "interior Bible," I will soon argue that they are something other than human subjects. 13 Ian Blyth and Susan Sellers have noted that Cixous's early theoretical trajectory "stresses the need for writing to 'let go'" in order for the text to have "a sense of ease, assurance and open-handedness" (Helme Cixous: Live Theory 113; 114). As I will soon point out in the main body of the essay, I agree with Blyth and Sellers that letting-go is "to make room for the other" (113). But I am suggesting here too that letting-go in the inscription of the other Bible or "interior Bible" would mean an indifference to Man's Fallen state, an indifference to the anxious need to defend, justify, and even glorify Eve's eating from the tree of knowledge. 14 The question of forgetting or not holding on in "Conversation" provides an interesting counter-point to "From the Scene of the Unconscious to the Scene of History." In the latter, there is the similar project of "Conversation" to write a Paradise of the passage of living instants ("Paradise is this, it is to arrive at living the present. It is to accept the present that occurs [advient\, in its mystery, in its fragility. It is to know that the present passes, and to accept not mastering it" (22, my translation)). And yet it will be said there too that writing at bottom is an "anti-forgetfulness" [anti-oubli\ (22). 15 Cf. "Conversation" 81. Perhaps the term animot is more recognizable in Derrida's L'animal que done je suis. The first time the term appears in Derrida's writing is in the summer of 1997—the same year when Cixous's Conversation was published— when Derrida presented his paper of the same title as the abovementioned book at the Cerisy-la-Salle colloquium on "Animal Autobiography." The published col lection of papers from that colloquium does not feature any contribution from Cixous, and there is no certainty that she was present at Derrida's talk. On the term animot, Derrida does not make reference to Cixous, and neither does Cixous in "Conversation" make reference to Derrida. Based on the above information, it is difficult to attribute the first usage of animot to either Derrida or Cixous. In a 2000 colloquium, "Judeities: Questions for Jacques Derrida," Cixous's contribution, "Le corps etranjuif," interestingly would point to a knowledge of L'animal que done je suis, when she writes of a scene of conversation with a cat, a clear reference to the opening of Derrida's text of 1997, where he speaks of the displacing situation where he sees himself being seen naked by his (naked) cat. This of course still does not resolve the problem as to whom the first use of animot can be attributed. In any case, Derrida's animot has a very different sense from Cixous's. For Derrida in</page><page sequence="22">MLN 1071 L'animal que doncje suis, animal is deployed to counteract the phrase "the animal," which tends to reduce the multiplicity of animals into the singular. As Derrida will say, "there is no the Animal in the general singular, separated from Man by a sole indivisible limit" (73, this translation and subsequent ones are mine). Animot, which is homophonous to animaux (the French word for animals in the plural), must then be resounded, not only to (re)affirm "the plurality of animals in the singular," but also to undo the false anthropocentric and anthropomorphic op position between humans and animals (73). In fact, as Derrida will continue to say, "the plurality [of the "living" (des « vivants »)] does not let itself be gathered into the sole figure of animality simply opposed to humanity" (73). Animot, for Derrida then, is "neither a species, neither a genre, neither an individual: it is an irreducible living multiplicity of mortals [ line irreductible multiplicity vivante de mcrrtels]" (65). 16 Le Grand Robert de la langue fran(aise records that passeur can mean "a person who illegally crosses a frontier or a prohibited zone in order to get to someone or something." 17 1 note that the passage here leads towards an animal condition as much as the animal condition, as discussed earlier, will later in (re) turn facilitate the movement towards the passage. 18 With reference to an earlier work of Cixous, "Le dernier tableau ou le portrait de Dieu," this "paradisiacal nudity" can be said to be a post-Fall jouissance. In that earlier piece, Cixous speaks of a "second innocence," which is "the force of sim plicity or of nudity," and which is also "that which no longer knows, that which knows not to know" (182, my translation). I will discuss "second innocence" in the essay proper soon. I will also argue that this "second innocence" is somewhat attained in "Conversation," when writing makes the passage towards the animal, and which takes nakedness simply, that is to say, without the human knowledge of shame. It is through the passage to the animal that one arrives at the condition of no longer knowing the human knowledge of shame, and of knowing better to renounce such human knowledge. 19 On the question of innocence, it would also be interesting to look at Cixous's With, ou, I'art de I'innocence. However, since innocence is not a primary focus of this paper, and the main concern is Cixous's works of the 90s, I will leave any discussion of this text for another occasion. 20 I note that Derrida also uses the phrase "passion of the animal" in L'animal que done je suis, which he uses to describe the "naked passivity" (29, my translation) of an unclothed human standing before the gaze of the animal. As it will be ex plicated in the text proper, I am certainly not using "the passion of the animal" in this sense here. 21 This is where grace is also at work in the jouissance of the passage to the animal condition in Conversation. In contrast to "Grace and Innocence," grace here is not something to be worked for by the human alone. Instead, it is shared between humans and animals. This is another reason why I think jouissance in Conversation is beyond the "second innocence" Cixous talks about in "Grace and Innocence." 22 The negative association between God and the power of seeing is also evident in Cixous's Beethoven a jamais: ou I'existence de Dieu. Right at the beginning of that text, the narrator compares the respective points of view of mortals and of God on living. Mortals "live in the midst [au milieu] of life," while God looks at life from the sides (11, my translation). In terms of the mortal's point of view of life, "life appears to us without end and hence it is that" (11). From God's point of view however, a point of view akin to being "perched very high up on an ancient tree of the earth," life is not only chaotic strife but deathly too (11). And this will lead</page><page sequence="23">1072 IRVING GOH the narrator to say it is "better to never arrive at the side" where God sees. But if it happens that one does arrive at such an apparently vantage point, it is "better to not look, better to close one's eyes" (11). To have had access to such a point of view, the text suggests that it would be better, to borrow a phrase that occurs just a while later in the text, to blind oneself by having an "arrow in the eye" (15). Like "Conversation" then, the act of seeing, particularly the divine power of seeing, is renounced here. This motif of the arrow is worth taking up a little further here, since it turns up in "Conversation" too. In "Conversation," the passage towards writing the "interior body of words" will bear the image of the trajectory of an arrow, a sacred arrow, a "pfeilige" [a word which combines the German word for arrow, Pfeil, and the German word for the sacred, heilig], "an arrow . . . [that] is going to plant itself at the heart of internity [I'internite]" (96, 94). To relate to what I have been trying to argue in the section on "Conversation," I would say that this "pfeilige" is shot through with the trajectory that first blinds human vision, which then traverses towards an animal vision whose perspective bears no traces of the "ancient tree" of knowledge, and which has its eyes closed to human knowledge and therefore is blind to a life that mourns the human death by knowledge. 23 The link between the messianic and religion will not be denied too when Derrida further writes that the "quasi atheistic dryness [secheresse\ of the messianic can be taken to be the condition of religions of the Book," or that one can "always recognize [in the messianic] the dry ground on which the living figures of every messiah, be they announced, recognized, or always expected, have emerged and passed" (267). 24 In Foi et savoir, Derrida would also say that the messianic is what makes such a fu ture possible: "No to-come [a-venir] without. . . some messianic promise" (72). 25 See for example Jose Casanova's Public Religions in the Modem World, the works of Hent de Vries, especially the volume he edited, Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World, or more recently, Jiirgen Habermas's "Notes on Post-Secular Society" and Ananda Abeysekara's Politics of Postsecular Religion: Mourning Secular Futures.
