<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Mark di Suvero: Sculpture Outside Walls BARBARA ROSE The six steel works executed by the American sculptor Mark di Suvero in the factories of Chalon-sur-Saone during 1972- 73 and exhibited in public outdoor areas of Chalon in 1973-74 constituted a unique event in the history of modern sculp- ture. In many respects the fulfillment of the aspirations of generations of avant-garde artists who desired to escape the confining context of the museum, they reclaim their function as public symbols within a social context. Special circum- stances prevailed in Chalon to make possible di Suvero's realization of these monumental, Herculean sculptures: the belief in di Suvero's vision on the part of Marcel Evrard, director of the CRACAP in Le Creusot, as well as the enthusi- asm and support of the staff of the Maison de la Culture in Chalon, together with the generosity of local industry, the participation of local workers, and the interest of the people of Chalon-all were necessary to the fruition of this unusual cooperative venture. Already the accomplishment in Chalon, the creation of a major body of sculpture involving the partici- pation of diverse segments of local populations, is being studied by other communities as a test of whether monumen- tal public sculpture, which compromises neither the ideals of the artist nor those of the community, can be made within the context of an industrial democratic society. For if a solu- tion to the problems which blocked not only the further development of di Suvero's own art, but also that of any modern sculpture that aspires to speak to the totality of a community, can be demonstrated to have worked in one place, then Chalon may serve as a model for future projects of a similar nature. Di Suvero's art requires the viewer to alter his conception of what constitutes a work of art. Presumably this modifica- tion of the viewer's consciousness will in turn lead to the questioning of other accepted modes of thought and re- ceived ideas so ingrained by the culture that they are seldom challenged. The opening up of the viewer's consciousness to new ideas is surely one of di Suvero's main objectives in making so strong, assertive, and in some respects, unpalata- ble a statement. A clue to his intention is the title of the large sculpture exhibited in front of the Maison de la Culture in Chalon. If La Petite Cle (the little key) is to be used to unlock something, perhaps we may asssume that what it meant to unlock is the viewer's consciousness, opening the mind to unfamiliar concepts. The difficulty of di Suvero's work for the ordinary spectator is that it is not meant to "beautify" the existing industrial environment to make it more acceptable. On the contrary, the reason di Suvero uses the materials of industry itself to create his works is to force the viewer into a direct, intimate encounter with the contemporary environment. Because of di Suvero's insistence that his works are a series of confronta- tions with reality rather than a means of escape from the brutality and problems of industrial society, they were partic- ularly appropriate, as well as particularly difficult to appreci- ate in a factory town like Chalon, whose worker population is especially familiar with the materials and techniques of indus- try. (Perhaps the greatest test for di Suvero's work is whether it can be acceptable to a factory worker. These enormous steel constructions, welded and cut with the same torches ART JOURNAL, XXXV/2 118</page><page sequence="2">Mark di Suvero, La Petite C1e, in the chantier where it was fabricated.

Many distinguished American and European critics of course have answered in the affirmative. Yet the individual viewer must arrive at the conclusion that these works are art, at the how and why they are art, out of his own process of self-education; if not, he is merely accepting, perhaps be- grudgingly, the judgment of authorities. This is precisely the passive acceptance di Suvero abhors. This is why he spent many months in Chalon, discussing his work and attempting to communicate his meaning with those who came to be involved with it. And this process of education, of the artist integrating himself into a community, was essential to the success of the Chalon experiment. The problem, however, is that art for di Suvero is a symbolic structure with a multitude of ambiguous and complex meanings; consequently it is impossible to fully translate his forms into words. Though we are becoming a more visual culture, we are still ignorant of the meaning of the language of visual forms. Obviously we need a gradual process of mass education to learn to under- stand the language of vision; and this, it seems to me, is an important part of the process that was initiated in Chalon-sur- Saone.

During the Middle Ages, a common language united soci- ety: this language was the belief in the values, functions, and structures of the Christian Church as an institutional order which took precedence over any individual experience. Mod- ern society, while losing contact with traditional values, has not yet reconstructed a general value system equally intelligi- ble to all men. For this reason, modern art remains a secret language, comprehensible only to the initiated. Di Suvero has always set himself against the hermeticism of the eso- teric. His wish to create public sculpture for public places represents, on the contrary, an attempt to communicate with all segments of society, not just the elite who visit museums. The title Sculpture in Liberty chosen by the Maison de la Culture for the di Suvero exhibition was appropriate. The museum by definition is a confining context. It limits not only the scale the artist can work on, but also the nature of the relationship between viewer and art object. Indeed there are many reasons to believe, as some theoreticians have sug- gested, that the museum is a place for alienated leisure, just as the factory and the office are places for alienated work. In the museum, activity is structured; emotional-esthetic re- sponses are adjusted to a preconceived scale of response. But to come upon one of di Suvero's towering structures in the open air, to have vistas of a piece like Ave from across the Saone river, to be able to see from multiple vantage points of a much greater variety than any possible in a museum situa- tion, is the novel experience of seeing sculpture in accessible open space. Sculpture free from the restraint of confining museum walls thus becomes a metaphor for human liberty of thought and action. That the works are made with industrial materials and techniques is an essential part of their meaning. Di Suvero deliberately uses technology, not as an end in itself, but as a means of realizing his own will as a lesson to society. His aim is to demonstrate that if the artist can dominate technology and direct it to serve his own ends rather than Mark di Suvero at work in the chantier at Chalon. ART JOURNAL, XXXV12 120</page><page sequence="4">vice versa, then humanity in general can control its great and dangerous technological apparatus, and rationally determine the goals for which it will be used. The triumph of the constructive, creative imagination of man over the destruc- tive forces of the technology man has created-this is central to di Suvero's message. Di Suvero clearly means his work to be a moral example: his feats of engineering, his ability to bend steel to take his form, are meant to demonstrate that man is not condemned to impotence, any more than sculpture is condemned to please established taste, or accommodate itself to existing categories. Coming to Chalon, working in the precarious conditions available, meant for di Suvero taking considerable risks, since he was not directly paid for his work, nor was he ever sure of its outcome or eventual disposition. But risk-taking has been part of di Suvero's life; apparently he feels keenly alive only in extreme situations, or situations of risk. The second son of an Italian naval officer, Marco Polo di Suvero was born in Shanghai, China in 1933. Although his family had lived in Venice since the 14th century when they escaped the Spanish Inquisition, and members of the family had been aristocrats and scholars, di Suvero's father was Jewish and the family feared returning to Mussolini's Italy. Instead they emigrated to California in 1941. Di Suvero eventually studied philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley, switch- ing to art in his last year. He arrived in New York in 1957, and the following year showed modeled plaster works at the March Gallery on East Tenth Street, the center for rebellious anti-Establishment artists in the late '50s. It is not surprising that an artist as dedicated to independ- ence as di Suvero should begin his career assembling found objects picked up off the streets of New York, fragments discovered in the decaying market area where he lived in the late '50s and early '60s, and where he still maintains a squalid loft. Ladders, barrels, charred planks and beams from a burned factory are held together by ropes, and rusty nails, and chains in di Suvero's early works. These sprawling, exu- berant pieces were, compared with the lucid, focused steel works produced by di Suvero in Europe in the '70s, relatively undisciplined, informal, and crude. Because di Suvero is, despite the external chaos he has often created, an extremely coherent personality whose goals and values have not al- tered, these early works possess many of the essential charac- teristics of di Suvero's mature style. Already present in the group of works exhibited at the Green Gallery in 1960 (di Suvero's only one-man gallery show in New York) were the open form system of cantilevered balances, jutting diagonals, suggestion of strain and tension implicit in thrust-counter- thrust movements, and dynamic, restless elements that stretched out, reached into, and grabbed space, still charac- teristic of recent works as well. These early assembled wood constructions used the same junk materials and assemblage techniques as the sculpture of Richard Stankiewicz, Jean Follett, John Chamberlain, and Robert Rauschenberg. Di Suvero's work differed from theirs mainly in its architectural use of linear elements to span and extend into space, which was embraced, penetrated, or oth- erwise activated by di Suvero's outward angled beams, pipes, and cables, which proclaim a full three-dimensionality un- known to constructed sculpture descended from Cubist col- lage. It was not by accident that di Suvero chose the materials and techniques of assemblage as a point of departure. For the meaning of assemblage is more complex than the exclu- sively formal interpretations supplied by historians of mod- ern art. More than a translation of the cutting and pasting technique of Cubist collage into three dimensions initiated by Picasso, assemblage was the means by which sculpture freed itself from the demands of official patronage. Assem- blage permitted sculpture to become a form of personal, subjective expression as opposed to the celebration of an official event, a state function, an ideological message, or memorial to the status of a given patron. Because assemblage requires no expensive materials like marble and bronze or difficult processes like casting or carving, it liberated the sculptor from economic dependence on patrons, a matter of great significance because the sculptor, even more than the painter, is the victim of the economic system within which he works, due to the greater expense of making sculpture. Since the invention of assemblage as a technique, the sculptor has at least been able to operate at the level of bricolage, making his art of the waste products of our industrial civilization. Appropriating the used and worn detritus collected from city streets before the garbage trucks arrive, the sculptor could follow his own subjective values and personal inclinations in assembling these bits of found junk. This is the way di Suvero began. Di Suvero did not remain a bricldeur, however. The diver- sity of materials, and the obvioL Jy contrived balances that were not truly expressive of actual stress or real structural needs characteristic of assemblage, detracted from the unity of di Suvero's work. We cannot know what direction his work might have taken were it not for a decisive, nearly fatal accident that occurred shortly before his Green gallery exhibi- tion in 1960. Delivering some lumber that was too big to fit inside an elevator, di Suvero mounted the elevator cab with the lumber-an example of his predilection for situations either psychologically or physically dangerous. The elevator never stopped, and di Suvero was pinned between the eleva- tor and the shaft ceiling, crushed by thousands of pounds of steel. That he survived was a miracle; that he ever walked again is no less miraculous. The accident and its consequences radically altered di Su- vero's way of working. Confined to a wheelchair, he could no longer perform the heavy physical labor of hauling and ham- mering mammoth pieces of wood. He was also forced to work with others as a result of his physical disability. His idealistic inclination toward cooperative effort was translated by fate into a necessity. One thing he could do alone, how- ever, was weld. His first metal pieces were made sitting in a wheelchair, an asbestos apron in his lap. The urge to make everything himself, to leave the mark of his own hand, over- came the need to involve others in his work. This incident points up a certain contradiction in di Suvero's thought con- cerning communal efforts. For, while he is ideologically com- mitted to the idea of collaboration, in fact, he feels impelled to make everything himself. In this, he differs from the "Minimal" sculptors of his generation such as Don Judd and Robert Morris who send their work out to be industrially fabricated. Their art has a mechanical precision that is the opposite of the rough, irregular hand-made look of a di Suvero, who seems intent on preserving all the marks of human error in his work. WINTER 1975/76 121</page><page sequence="5">The conceptual basis of Minimal art is also antithetical to di Suvero's trial-and-error improvisational method. In his way of working as well as in his rebellious attitudes, romantic postures, and passionate idealism, di Suvero is much closer to Abstract Expressionism than to the art of his own genera- tion. More interested in the actual execution of a piece, in progressive modifications that could take place in situ as a work organically developed, than in preconceived systems, theories, or concepts, he continued to preach traditional humanistic values at a time when these values were widely assaulted by American artists. The use of the industrial technique of welding permitted the further development of di Suvero's work. Metal could be bent, twisted, and suspended in space in ways wood could not. Of the works of the early '60s still extant (a great deal of di Suvero's work has been lost or destroyed) Prison Dream occupies an important position in the artist's career. A dis- turbing, tortured work of mangled steel "limbs" and twisted reaching and grasping appendages, the work has a powerful psychological content that suggests analogies with the frustra- tion of all who feel physically or mentally imprisoned. In this sense the work is a comprehensive analogue-a complete symbolic projection-of the artist's psychological and physi- cal state. By the time Prison Dream was completed in 1962, di Suvero had renounced the obvious pathos of the Expression- ist upward grasping Hands pierced with nails or of a menac- ing rod that he had modeled two years earlier. However, the twisted hands already contain di Suvero's essential form: the core or trunk (in this case the palm) from which upward spreading members grasp and grip space in a gesture of desperate aspiration. The fingers that claw the air, the up- ward spreading hand, are metaphors for a powerful resurrec- tion. The relationship between di Suvero's sculptural form and personal body imagery is so strong that one way to study the evolution of his form is in relationship to his physical recov- ery. This recovery in turn brought with it an extraordinary confidence because of the degree to which the artist became aware of the strength of his own will, which permitted him to gradually recover from the paralysis of a broken back. This self-confidence is reflected in the progressively larger scale of the work. By the time Abstract Expressionism faded from the scene around 1960, the rhetoric of "struggle" was worn thin. Artists were talking about struggling with their canvases and drink- ing champagne with their collectors. This did not often pro- duce convincing work, and most of di Suvero's contemporar- ies reacted against the existential esthetic of Abstract Expres- sionism as a result. Di Suvero, however, was engaged throughout this time with a real, concrete, literal struggle: the battle to walk again. The pieces document his progress: Prison Dream is partially a horizontal piece; its claw-like appendages reach forward, like a reclining man trying to rise. Balancing the reclining horizontal element, however, is a striding, vertical form that beckons, which, if we wish to literally interpret it, may be the premonition of di Suvero's mobile, upright self. For, by 1963, di Suvero could walk again. That year he helped found the Park Place gallery with fellow sculptors Forrest (Frostie) Myers, Chuck Ginnever, and Rob- ert Grosvenor, and returned for a visit to California. In 1962, he had begun experimenting with moving elements in works like Love Makes the World Go Round, a miniature carrousel with seats made of tires. The idea of kinetic elements, of the 122 opposition of a static constant core to a swinging or fluctuat- ing element, was explored in other works made with and for children. It was during this period that di Suvero began conceiving of sculpture in terms of giant toys, or rides that invited spectator participation. In 1964 di Suvero was living in Los Angeles and working on the beach. The move to the West Coast meant an increase in scale. In California di Suvero could work out of doors as he could not in New York, where he was frustrated by the limitations of loft and gallery space. From 1964 on, his major works have been over 20 feet high, and he has needed a crane to lift elements into place. These large-scale works combined wood and steel, and in some cases occasional found objects. Two works of this period, A-Train and Nova Albion, were especially important for his future develop- ment. When A-Train (honoring the jazz classic titled after a particularly disagreeable New York elevated subway) was shown at the Park Place gallery in 1965, it was in two parts. The top part, made of wood beams joined by steel rods, had a ladder suspended from it, and was hung like a "mobile" on a chain from the ceiling. Reconstructed outdoors, the piece was substantially changed; the two segments were con- nected by a strict vertical interior pole, which acted as the fulcrum for a pivoting kinetic overhead structure. It is impor- tant to mention in this connection that di Suvero's works consist of interlocking parts; after they are dismantled, they may be changed when they are bolted or welded back into place. Sometimes di Suvero will use parts of one piece in another; sometimes he will leave fragments around until he has the proper structure in mind in which to combine them. This was the case of Lover, which existed as a fragment until di Suvero had the existing section transported from Duis- berg, Germany to Chalon, where the piece was completed. A-Train was the first large-scale work with a kinetic ele- ment. Nova Albion, a work of the same period, the mid-'60s, also exists in two versions. Titled for a poem by William Blake, Nova Albion is significant because it is the first exam- ple of the tripod structure that characterizes many of di Suvero's recent pieces such as La Petite C/e, Ave, and Etoile Polaire. It is also the first work in which the balances are strictly engineered. In Nova Albion, appearance and reality coincide: the cables and chains that hold the piece together are necessary to the ability of the work to stand on the floor without a base. In earlier works such as the masterful, assem- bled construction of 1960, Hankchampion (named for di Su- vero's brother Henry, nicknamed Hank), di Suvero had al- ready successfully dispensed with the base, the pedestal that traditionally isolated art work from the viewer and the space in which he moved by setting sculpture in the official space of "art" as opposed to the actual space of real objects. The early constructions like Hankchampion, however, did not yet depend on the principle of mutual support or engi- neered balance to stand; they were nailed and bolted to- gether, which gave the impression that the chains and ropes functioned decoratively as opposed to structurally. Com- pared with Hankchampion, Nova Albion has a formal simplic- ity and clarity. It emphasizes slender, linear elements rather than massive blocks of wood. The cables and chains function as a graphic subtheme. Based on a triangular module, this antiphonal form is played against the typee-tripod structure of the body of the work in the manner of theme and variation in a fugue. Both the typee and the tripod are elementary structures.

They provided a simple basic form that di Suvero could elaborate in many different ways, making possible both great vertical projection as well as considerable horizontal span. The structure of Nova Albion, among the prototypes of the tripod form in di Suvero's work, is once again an analogue for the artist's physical projection of his own body image. (The extremities to which this empathic projection of the body image was taken in recent American art has been commented on by J-P. Lebenstejn in his study of Frank Stella, "L'Etoile," published in Critique, by Max Kozloff in his articles on Jasper Johns and Robert Morris, and by myself in my monograph on Claes Oldenburg.) I have suggested that di Suvero's stylistic development is tied to his own changing body imagery. Within this context, the two wooden "legs" and the steel rod that support Nova Albion, and the forward crouch position, may be seen as visual analogues of the stances of a man using a cane to support himself-as di Suvero indeed did until very recently. The last phase of di Suvero's physical recovery coincides with the period spent in Chalon. He no longer needed the cane to walk, a fact reflected in the increasing uprightness and verticality of recent works. Planted in the earth, many of the new pieces reach explicitly toward the sky in a symbolic gesture of aspiration. Their uprightness and verticality are not strictly speaking anthropomorphic; rather they are meta- phors for the erect dignity of man still capable of assuming an aggressive stance in a world in which the individual's will to action is constantly reduced to impotence. Metaphors of defiance are an important part of di Suvero's content: the enormous horizontal elements suspended at great heights in Ik Ook, a kinetic work executed in Eind- hoven, Holland in 1972, as well as in Ange des Orages and La Petite Cle executed in Chalon, challenge gravity. The ability to suspend tons of metal in the air took di Suvero some time to master. The visual drama created by the opposition of huge girders and beams swinging freely in the air is an essential part of-the excitement of his recent works, and sets them apart from both kinetic and Constructivist precedents. Both in their potential movement as well as in their splayed embrace, the v-shaped joined girders of Ik Ook and La Petite CIl suggest an erotic play element that asserts itself in opposi- tion to the rigid industrial materials and geometric structures of the works. Like the gestures of defiance and aspiration, the erotic metaphor is implicit and suggested rather than explicit and illustrated. The intrusion of the erotic metaphor into the unlikely context of sculpture industrially fabricated and architecturally engineered is once again deliberate on di Suvero's part. Theoretically, it relates to neo-Freudian and neo-Marxist ideas of thinkers such as Norman O. Brown and Herbert Marcuse, both of whom have suggested the poten- tial erotization of the contemporary environment and the importance of play as a means of humanizing industrial soci- ety. In his insistence on sculpture, not only as a type of struc- WINTER 1975/76 123</page><page sequence="7">One arm of Etoile Polaire being lowered into place by crane. ture utilizing the processes and materials of the machine age, but also as an expressive form and symbolic metaphor for a range of human value, di Suvero departs from his predeces- sors, the Cubo-Constructivists. Indeed his work may be seen ultimately as a critique of that very Constructivism from which it derives. The Italian Futurists, the first to seek new forms equal to the spirit of the Machine Age, never realized the demands of their own manifestos. The Russian Construc- tivists, on the other hand, less burdened by a great historical tradition of bronze and marble statuary, felt free to invent new techniques, using the materials and processes of indus- try itself. The failure of Constructivism is one of the crucial intellectual defeats of the 20th century; for the idealistic Constructivists did not adequately consider two essential factors regarding the reception of their art: one was the role of esoteric content in abstract art and the other-and per- haps more essential misunderstanding-was the failure to adequately deal with the enormous gap between the expecta- tions of the public, and the goals of the non-objective artist. Despite the educational program undertaken by the Con- structivists, their art was never accepted by the Russian masses. Once divorced from its context of revolution, it quickly became museum art, an indication that it was, finally, not very radical. Few of the projects conceived for public spaces were ever executed; the most celebrated, Tatlin's architectural-kinetic Monument to the III International is known to us only in a photograph of a maquette. Di Suvero's work differs from that of the Constructivists in its fundamentally humanistic orientation. Human gesture is 124 Mark di Suvero, Etoile Polaire, approximately 40'h.

The viewer finds himself included and embraced within, as opposed to outside of, the sculp- ture, which is no longer distanced object, but intimate experi- ence. The shift from museum object to environmental experi- ence is a central fact of ambitious sculpture of the '60s. It represents a realization on the part of sculptors like di Suvero that the public needs to be included within the work, to experience the kind of dramatic spectacle provided by look- ing up from under the Eiffel Tower, which looking upward through the massive baroque joint of Etoile Polaire also pro- vides. Although modern sculpture would hardly exist without the achievement of the Constructivists, artists like Tatlin, Rod- chenko, and Moholy-Nagy were so awed by the power of industry to change the world, they ended by idealizing the machine through making art in its image. Paradoxically, when the art of America, the world's most mechanized country, came of age, it was violently opposed to machine imagery. Abstract Expressionism, di Suvero's other direct source, em- phasized the physical human gesture, and autobiographical improvisation in opposition to the non-objective geometry of Cubo-Constructivism against which it rebelled. In many re- spects, di Suvero's art represents a synthesis of Constructivist logic and utopian ideology and Abstract Expressionist human- istic existentialism. Despite his formal and structural innova- tions, his links remain with a historical tradition of sculpture, with the traditional expressive vocabulary of sculpture, in- cluding contrapposto, expressed as abstract torsion, as a means of activating three-dimensional space. However, di Suvero has extended the vocabulary of sculpture by expand- ing its scale through daring feats of engineered balance, and by developing a personal imagery tied to direct physical experience rather than to an intellectual concept like pure geometry. During the '60s, it was mistakenly presumed that the great- est art was the most extreme, the most innovative. Today it seems obvious that the greatest art is that which represents the most complete synthesis and assimilation of all that has preceded it. To extend the past into the future means to preserve historical memory-apparently man's most difficult task in a period of rapid change. In this connection it is ironic, although perhaps inevitable, that the dream of Rus- sian artists of a new art should be realized by an American on French soil.
