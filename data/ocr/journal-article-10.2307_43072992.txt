<plain_text><page sequence="1">443 NUNTII PERSONARUM ET RERUM A Lesson in Early History: Tepe Gawra E. Douglas Van Büren - Rome Each new site as it is excavated teaches us something more about the early inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Now a leap forward has been made by the publication of the excavation at Tepe Gawra of levels IX to XX (l). To uncover such a long series of inhabited levels, to differentiate them and determine the salient characteristics of each successive settlement, was no mean achievement. In this admirably produced volume the record of the extremely difficult task that has been accomplished at Gawra is unfolded by one who himself took part in the work of excavation, and is well qualified to describe the important results obtained, and to inter- pret the significance of what was discovered. As it is easier for most read- ers to form a mental picture of development from primitive to later times the architectural remains will here be discussed in that order, in- stead of in the order in which the levels were uncovered as Dr. Tobler does. Test soundings in the plain at two points, one on each side of the mound at its base, termed respectively Area A and the North-East Base, produced evidence of civilization earlier than any traceable in the sec- tion of the mound stratigraphically investigated. It consisted of a deep layer of debris lying on virgin soil composed entirely of potsherds and a few small objects. The excavators opine that it had been formed by the dwellers on the mound who used the uninhabited area at the mound's base as a dumping ground for their refuse. In that case it seems strange that not a single fragment of fine Halaf ware came to light in any stra- tum of the excavated sector of the mound, for all the Halaf pottery there found was late and almost decadent in style. The only trace of construc- tions revealed by the soundings was a pit dug down into virgin soil to a depth of 5 m. Originally used as a well it was later abandoned and, when partly filled with sand, had served at intervals as a burial pit; the repeat- ed burials and the objects found with the skeletons supplied valuable information concerning the early settlers in the Gawra district.

Douglas Van Buren cannot be termed primitive, for the bulk of the debris consisted of ceramic fragments of the choicest Halaf ware, beautifully made, fired, and decorated with painted pDly chrome designs. Owing to the great depth at which the work had to be carried out the only building of Stratum XX which it was possible to uncover was a tholos which demonstrated that Halaf cultural influences predomin- ated in the settlement, a supposition corroborated by the pottery dis- covered in the stratum which was almost exclusively Halaf polychrome ware. The more extensive area of XIX was heavily occupied. The north- ern sector contained secular buildings only, while the southern part was occupied by a temple. Small rooms flanked both sides of a long sanc- tum, on the floor of which was a rectangular podium of pisé. Partly super- posed above the ruins of this sacred edifice was the temple of XVIII which could not be fully uncovered, but apparently an entrance on the short eastern side gave access to a long central chamber with smaller auxiliary rooms on each side; a rectangular podium was located at the rear of the sanctum. Three simple piers or buttresses on the face of the north wal seem structural rather than ornamental. Three groups of houses and room-complexes were disclosed in XVII and two tholoi. One was incomplete; the unique feature of the other, which was irregularly circular in ground-plan, was the doorway, an opening about 30 cm. wide flanked on the outside by a wall about 50 cm. long on each side. The excavators point out that the southern tholos of XVII and the temples of XVIII and XIX successively overlaid the tholos of XX, but tholoi and formal temples have not been found side by side in any level. Therefore, they argue, as tholoi and conventional temples occupied identical locations in their respective levels it proves that the south-western portion of the area, and notably Square 5-J, was regard- ed as sacred ground in the four earliest strata, and that consequently " the sacred character of the tholoi and their dedication to chthonic gods is firmly established " by the fact that graves were associated with both the tholoi of XVII as they were with most of the temples of more orthodox type. The theory is interesting, but it must be noted that: 1) in every one of the four earliest strata the area covered by the settlement was only partly excavated, so it is not certain that tholoi and temples did not exist simultaneously; 2) nothing whatsoever was discovered on the floors of the tholoi at Gawra or at Arpachiyah, so there is no indication as to the purpose they served; 3) the doorway of the Northern Tholos, " narrow to the point of impracticality ", seems a curious means of ac- cess to a sanctuary, the interior of which would, moreover, have been completely dark if the theoretical reconstruction made of those at Arpachiyah is correct, although they may not have been roofed. The improbability of the theory that the tholoi at Arpachiyah were connected with the cult of the Mother-goddess because clay feminine figurines were found in the rubbish adjacent to one of them (l) has already been (*) Mallowan, Excavations at Tall Arpachiyah, /'Kiì : Iraq II, 1935, pp. 27,34; Moortgat, Die Entstehung der sumer. Hochkultur, p. 27.</page><page sequence="3">A Lesson in Early History : Tepe Gawra 445 pointed out (*). The fact that the tholoi, the foundations of which were always respected, were rebuilt at intervals on almost, if not exactly, the same spot suggests that they may have been places where offerings were deposited and consumed by fire, the prototype of the " Opferstätten " discovered at Uruk and at Ur which were usually circular in shape. That would account for the peculiar type of entrance and why nothing was found on the floors, for they were always swept out after use. Secular buildings only were uncovered in XVI, XV, and XV- A. In a building of XVI the walls of one room were decorated with white plas- ter on which were painted rows of connected lozenges, alternately red and black. All that remains of XIV were the stone foundations of a large structure which was razed to the ground to provide the foundations upon which the Eastern Temple of XIII was partly based. In contrast to the preceding levels XIII was entirely devoted to religious architecture, an acropolis formed of a large court round which three temples were group- ed, the earliest, biggest, and least complete being the Eastern Temple which differed radically in plan from the other two. The walls were deco- rated on the exterior with double pilasters and double-recessed niches, and four doorways break the front wall, two on each side of the build- ing. In the Northern Temple architectural decoration in the form of reces- sed niches is encountered for the first time on both the exterior and in- terior wall surfaces, but that it was purely ornamental and served no structural purpose is indicated by its absence on the rear façade. The only entrance lay to left of the deep, elaborately decorated niche in the long south-eastern wall of the edifice. A well, discovered beneath the floor of the cella, must have been already abandoned and filled in at the time the Northern Temple was constructed. The well, it is explained, did not belong to XIV but to XIII, " where an easily available supply of water would have been a happy feature, if not actually necessary to an acropolis which undoubtedly attracted pilgrims ". If the water was essential, it is strange that the well was filled in at the very time when the religious life of the community flourished in fullest measure. The Central Temple lay between, and at right angles to the other two tem- ples, so that its forepart abutted against the corners of the adjacent structures. The rear portion was destroyed by erosion or by the collapse of a supporting earth platform. It is unique at Gawra in having at least three entrances to the cult chamber instead of the usual single doorway at one end of the chamber. All the temples were constructed entirely of sun-dried bricks. In the Eastern Temple ninety-nine model full, half, and quarter bricks were discovered which apparently served to deter- mine the most satisfactory method of bonding and building the compli- cated recessed piers. The limited secular re-occupation of Gawra in XII-A soon developed into the thickly populated township of XII, the outstanding product of which was the distinctive monochrome decorated pottery which came to Í1) Perkins, The Comparative Archeology of Early Mesopotamia, pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="4">446 E. Douglas Van Buren an end with the sudden destruction of XII. Perhaps it was this violent extermination which caused the settlement of XI-A to assume the char- acter of a fortified town, the gates of which were protected by watch- towers to guard the vulnerable approaches up the northern and eastern slopes of the mound. The only temple was small and unadorned, but its sanctity may be inferred from the numerous graves beneath and around it. The whole township was dominated by the massive Round House, a building believed to have been a fortified citadel. The interior was divided into seventeen rooms, of which the central Room N was the largest. It, with the antechamber I and the rear Room B, has been thought to have formed a sanctuary. It seems incredible that in a fortress, where avail- able space was limited, the whole of the central area should be reserved as a sanctuary, the widely opening doorway to which would have been di- rectly accessible from the only entrance to the whole building. If there was a shrine in the building it might be sought in Room E, described merely as " interesting because its secondary walls, erected against and exactly duplicating the earlier ones, blocked the doorway which originally led to Room F ". Instead of covering the small niche cut into the centre of the original north-western wall the secondary walls simulated a series of piers, thus enhancing the importance of the central niche. The changed conditions prevailing in XI-A are accounted for as follows : migrating peoples attempted to introduce new ideas, products, and cultural innova- tions, such as the tomb type of burial, and to amalgamate them with some elements of the older civilization. These innovations wTere resisted, and the ensuing period of conflict was thus reflected in the defensive construc- tions of XI-A. On the other hand, it is stated that as the temple of XI-A resembled those of XI- VIII, those levels, together with XI-A, must be regarded as representing a single cultural period. The temple, however, had also affinities with the temple of XVIII, and was thus a link in a long chain of tradition. The altered conditions manifested in XI-A are, indeed, less startling than the abrupt transition from a prosperous com- munity which could conceive and erect the splendid religious edifices of XIII to the scantily inhabited " secular " hamlet of XII-A. Perhaps the defensive constructions at Gawra in the time of XI-A were evidence of temporarily unsettled conditions rather than of a radical ethnical change. This point of view is not contradicted by the contrastingly peaceful aspect of XI, which possessed a temple sufficiently well preserved to per- mit reconstruction of the ground-plan which fundamentally resembles those of the temple of IX and the Western and Eastern Temples of VIII. Here as there, a podium lay close to the entrance which was shielded by a three-sided court formed by the wide recess occurring in the exterior face of the rear wall, but that was the only architectural decoration. The central chamber extended from the entrance to the rear wall which was featured by a shallow niche set into the wall about 30 cm. above the floor and entirely covered with white plaster which contrasted with the red surfaces of the wall projections. The sanctum was flanked on each side by two rooms of disparate sizes which communicated with one another, a feature duplicated only in the Eastern Temple of VIII. The massively</page><page sequence="5">A Lesson in Early History: Tepe Gawra 447 built, well-planned building on the northern edge of the mound lay di- rectly above the XI-A temple, but nothing about it suggests that it had a religious function. Gawra was once more reduced to a poverty-stricken village in X-A, but recovered in the extensive settlement of X which pos- sessed both a temple and a shrine, although the occupation seems to have been mainly secular. The occupation of IX was restricted to a little more than half of the habitable area of the mound, in which the large, well-planned temple occupied a central position. It can be identified as a religious edifice by its corners orientated to the points of the compass, by its ground-plan, by the double-recessed niches which decorated the exterior faces of the walls, and by the podium in the central chamber which bore a roughly anthropomorphic representation incised upon it. It resembles the West- ern Temple of VIII, but differs from that building in certain particulars, such as its reversed position, and in having on its west side a large cham- ber or wing, Room 904, the secondary nature of which is illustrated by its thinner walls, irregular outlines, and simpler architectural decoration. A podium made of hard clay, located in a corner, had, like the one in the sanctum, an anthropomorphically-shaped depression on its upper sur- face. The opposite corner of the chamber had been converted into a bath- room, the pavement of which was coated with bitumen to render it waterproof; in one corner a large pot was sunk so that its rim was flush with the pavement. No explanation of this puzzling juxtaposition of podium and bathroom is offered. Is it possible that the temple was dedicated to a healing divinity, and that in Room 904 priests treated patients who came seeking a cure ? Dr. Tobler ably sums up what can be learnt concerning the traditions of religious architecture in the earlier strata at Gawra. The temple of XIX had a plan repeated almost exactly by the temple of XVIII which close- ly resembled the sanctuaries of XI-A through VIII. Such fundamental architectural features as long axes, central sancta flanked by smaller rooms on both sides, and entrances through the short sides, are shared by all of them. The podium of XVIII finds analogies in the temples of XI, IX, and VIII, while the elaborate decorative piers of later structures may have developed from the simpler structural piers of XVIII. None of these basic architectural elements are embodied in the units of XIII where access to the temples was obtained through the long sides of the struct- ures; the sanctum was at the rear; no podia were found; there was greater dependence on wall decoration on the exterior and also on the interior. The temples of XIII represent fully developed types which cannot be traced back to earlier Gawra structures, and must therefore have been an iconoclastic foreign importation, almost immediately superseded in XI-A by the bearers of a new culture who, however, in spite of such sudden and violent ethnic and cultural changes, restored the architectural forms of XIX-XVIII, and steadfastly maintained them to the end of VIII. He concludes his ingenious theory by saying that the explanation of the paradox is a task which cannot now be ventured upon. At Gawra burial in graves and also in tombs was practised. Graves</page><page sequence="6">448 E. Douglas Van Buren contemporaneous with all strata from XVIII to VIII were discovered, but they were few in comparison with what must have been the popula- tion of Gawra at the period. It is therefore suggested that the graves, usually clustered round or beneath a sacred edifice, were used primarily to inter infants and children, and that the majority of the dead were bur- ied in necropolises in the plain. The graves were of four types: 1) inhuma- tion, found in every stratum and in Area A; 2) urn burials, which appear to have been wholly unknown in Halaf times, and rare in the early Obeid period; 3) side- wall graves, characterized by a single wall, which had no practical function, extending along one side of the skeleton; the fifteen examples found were all contemporaneous with XI-A through IX; 4) pisé graves, characterized by very low walls which completely enclosed the burial, appeared first in XIII and XII, and may have evolved into the tomb type of burial of XI-A through VIII. Tombs were of three contemporaneously employed types: mud- brick; mud-brick and stone; entirely of stone. Tomb furnishings included painted and unpainted pottery, and vessels of stone. It is an odd fact that no stone vessels were found in the building remains of any strata later than XI, while they were unknown in tombs having their origin earlier than X. This is explained as a change in function of the stone vessels. In the earlier strata stone vessels were common household utensils, lack- ing any high degree of craftsmanship; beginning with X, however, they may have been made only for aesthetic purposes and, as objets d'art, found a place among the tomb furnishings. Among the objects in Tomb 31 of VIII-C were two stone "hut symbols". They appear to represent the latest examples of their type, for only two other symbols were discovered, and they, together with twenty-eight terra-cotta specimens of analo- gous type which are explained as loom- weights, were all from XI-A through IX. Six bone or ivory combs came to light, as well as hair-pins, spatulae, and, most abundantly of all, beads. Pendants were not uncom- mon, whereas seals, numerous in almost all strata of the mound, were rare in tombs from which came beads, pendants, rosettes, and studs of gold, and a tiny electron wolf's head. It is stated that the religious character of a building is indicated by the graves and tombs associated with it. Yet it is also noted that graves were associated with secular buildings in all strata, and particularly in XII-XI when " almost every building had a burial, usually of an infant or child, beneath its floors or walls with the added comment: " the rea- son for the increased importance of the mound as a necropolis in these strata is obscure ". Yet if at the time represented by Strata XII-XI con- ditions were unsettled, it may have been considered too dangerous to descend to the plain to perform the funerary rites, and impossible to pro- tect graves thus isolated from violation. Therefore it may be said that at Gawra, with the exception of the Central Temple of XIII and the Northern Shrine of VIII, burials were associated with all temples, as they were with important secular buildings. Dr. Tobler thinks that the temples around which numerous graves were grouped were the seats of chthonic deities who demanded human sacrifices (although the skeletons show</page><page sequence="7">A Lesson in Early History : Tepe Gawra 449 no traces of violence). As the graves located outside these temples were usually those of infants or children (because adults were presumably in- terred in the plain), he suggests that there may have been an underlying fertility idea which caused childless women to resort to those shrines. Conversely, the absence or isolated occurrence of burials around other sacred edifices would suggest that the divinities worshipped in them pos- sessed different natures, and that their functions were with the living. Such surmises must necessarily be hypothetical because there are no ma- terial indications as to the nature of the divinities worshipped at Gawra. The pottery from this accurately stratified site is illuminatingly dis- cussed by Dr. Tobler, and will henceforth be of inestimable value in deter- mining the sequence and interrelation of the various early fabrics. Four vessels, one with a chocolate-brown wash on both surfaces, were extracted from the bottom of the well sunk into virgin soil in Area A; one specimen seems later, for it was decorated with a wave pattern in red paint on a cream slip, and had four pierced lugs on the shoulder. Pottery from the soundings of Area A and the North-East Base all belongs to a single va- riety typical of the Halaf culture, some of the specimens being extremely fine. Most of the designs were geometric, but in a few cases geometric and naturalistic designs of birds are alternately disposed in triangular panels. Wares of three main types came to light in XX-XVII: 1) poly- chrome decorated wares of Halaf type predominated in XX, but were inferior in style and technique to those found in Area A; 2) coarse undec- orated pottery which was plentiful in XX-XIX, but was almost com- pletely superseded in XVIII-XVII; 3) a variety of monochrome-painted pottery which may be classed as Obeid ware which quickly became pre- ponderant in XIX, and was thenceforth found in ten consecutive strata. It is possible to study the development of this pottery from stage to stage, from few and simple shapes to more evolved forms, from lugs to handles, from an opening pierced in the shoulder of a pot to skilfully contrived spouts. The repertory of patterns was composed mainly of linear and curvilinear forms, but geometric designs were not infrequent. Naturalis- tic motives were limited to the exceptional portrayal of birds, fish, and human figures. From XVII came a fragment of a bell-shaped bowl which bore what is said to be the earliest painted representation of the human figure found at Gawra. The scene is explained as a ritual dance, for a man advances holding upright what looks like a trident on a long shaft. The object resembles to some degree the one carried by the third man in the solemn procession represented on a seal of Uruk III believed to be from Abu Hatab (*). Perhaps it is not too fanciful to suggest that the " standards " carried by these figures were torches used to make light signals from one liill-top settlement to another, as Professor Dossin has proved was the practice in later ages (2). The few sherds of Halaf ware which occurred sporadically in XVI-XV may be intrusions; they mark the definite end Í1) Moortgat, Vorderasiatische Rollsiegel, Pl. 6, No. 33.

The Obeid ware of the same strata reveals a decline in quality and the painted decoration becomes simplified and stereotyped. A revival occurred in XIII when more varied shapes were introduced and an influx of new patterns, some of them strikingly effective, as well as new decorative techniques, ribbed, incised, and appliqué. In XII the amount of pottery found and the variety of shapes in use increased abun- dantly. On ring-based bowls interior decoration is found for the first time on Obeid pottery, but decoration on painted ware consisted mainly of repetitious geometric and linear designs. Certain bowls, distinctive on account of their shape, small size, the quality of their clay, and the black painted decoration which is always in a " sprig pattern ", are thought to have been importations. A fragment depicting swimming ducks is one of the very few examples of naturalistic designs. The painted decoration of two U-bowls is described as heterodox. The first (Fig. 280) consists of a frieze picturing long-legged birds and an animal against a star-stud- ded background. The decoration of the second (Fig. 309) was composed of twelve triangular panels, ten containing linear and geometric patterns, and two which are believed to be the earliest attempt at landscape paint- ing. The incomplete panel depicts two horned animals facing away from a straight thick line explained as a river. The long sides of the second panel are adorned with irregular triangles to indicate mountains. Be- tween the two mountain ranges a river, delineated as before, follows a tortuous course. A man stands on the left looking across the river at a horned animal and a smaller creature with curved tail (dog ?). It Is claim- ed that the straight course of one river, whereas the other meanders, and the hunting scene amidst mountains of varying heights, cannot be imaginary details, and must reproduce actual geographical features. This landscape may therefore be regarded as a kind of map and, furthermore, as the first halting step towards pictographs and the invention of writing. XI-A was the first occupational layer at Gawra to produce predomin- atingly undecorated wares. The pottery of XI-IX corroborates the homo- geneity of the architectural evidence. Incised, impressed, punctured, and appliqué decoration was employed. Painting was re-introduced in XI and continued through IX; it consisted for the most part of repetitious pat- terns. One beaker (Fig. 398), however, was painted with figures of men and animals near " huts " and foliage; the delineation of associated huts and trees is so closely akin to the representation of the same subject paint- ed on a " Samarra " fragment found at Arpachiyah (*) that it may be considered to determine the ceramic category to which the Arpachiyah potsherd really belongs. In IX wheel-made vessels appear for the first time. Among terra-cotta objects are human figurines which occur plenti- fully in the lower levels of the mound and in the soundings at its base; they become progressively less numerous until they disappear at the end of XIII. In contrast to human figures painted on pottery or engraved on seals which are generally male and are invariably depicted in action, the (*) Mallowan, Excavations at Tall Arpachiyah, 1913: Iraq II, 1935, p. 32, Fig. 20.</page><page sequence="9">A Lesson in Early History: Tepe Gawra 451 figurines represent the quiescent female figure typical of Halaf culture, seated with sharply bent knees. Contemporaneously with this naturalis- tic type a violin-shaped type existed, and in XVII an armless type lack- ing the pointed knees makes its appearance. The single figurine identified as male was found in X. Animal figurines were generally crudely made and their species is mostly unidentifiable, which is thought to prove that they were made as playthings and not for any religious purpose. It is noteworthy that in the earliest deposits, where human figurines were common, animal figur- ines are extremely rare, for the first animal model, which may have been part of a zoomorphic vase, was yielded by XVIII. They were most popu- lar in XIII through IX The animals reproduced were sheep and dogs; single dubious examples of the wild ass, gazelle, leopard, and bird were forthcoming. No terra-cotta models of boars, pigs, cows, or bulls were found in any strata, which suggests that the inhabitants of Gawra were not interested in breeding stock other than sheep. This supposition seems confirmed by glyptic evidence, for, with the exception of dogs, no domes- ticated animals appear on seals or seal impressions. In support of the contention that the animal figurines were toys it is stated that the occur- rence of the figurine of a mouflon, together with a rattle, in an infant's grave in XVII " proves that it had been used as a toy ".It might, however, be argued that the mouflon with its sharply pointed horns was an unsuit- able plaything for an infant; it might have been placed near the body to commemorate a sacrifice offered at the grave, and even the rattle may not have been a toy but a bull-roarer included to avert evil spirits from the grave. Moreover, a notable increase in the number of animal models occurred in XIII, a stratum wholly religious in character. Stone pendants with circular or oval bodies and characterized by a tang through which a hole for suspension was bored, were found in Area A and the North-East Base, and in all strata from XX through XI; their distribution seems to show that they were more closely identified with Halaf culture than with any other. The designs engraved on them are mostly linear and rectilinear, but three bore representations of ani- mals. From these tanged pendants Dr. Tobler believes stamp seals were evolved, instead of from the stone back-looped buttons used on clothing in Elam and elsewhere, from which it has been proposed to trace their evolution. He argues that the discovery of seal impressions bearing animal designs in the Halaf deposits at the foot of the mound proves that stamp seals were known in Halaf times. The typical Halaf tanged pendants are sometimes adorned with representations of animals, where- as at Gawra back-looped buttons always bore linear patterns and were not found until early Obeid times. They " thus became one of the distin- guishing elements of an early phase of the Obeid culture at Gawra, and, with the majority of the monochrome-painted designs found on pottery, indicate the Elamite source of that culture. Stamp seals, however, to- gether with tanged pendants, a few painted designs on pottery, and the Halafian tholoi of Stratum XVII, represent some of the elements surviv- ing from Halaf culture into its eclectic successor</page><page sequence="10">452 E. Douglas Van Buren Most seals produced at Gawra were hemispherical. An impression from Area A and one from the North-East Base were on lumps of clay which bore rope marks. They convincingly establish two facts: the pres- ence of stamp seals in the Halaf period, and the proof, provided by the rope marks, that even thus early the stamp seal functioned as a symbol of ownership to some article of property, rather than as a decorative bead or amulet. A quantity of stamp seals and seal impressions were discovered in the various strata from XIX onwards. There was a remark- able expansion of glyptic industry in XIII, and this is accounted for by saying that XIII was a level occupied solely by temple buildings, consequently seal impressions on temple property may well account for the increase noted in the stratum. This explanation is unsatisfactory; even if it might be thought to account for the seal impressions, it would not account for the numerous seals, because all the property of a temple was stamped with the seal of that particular temple. Therefore as there were three temples in XIII all the impressions found would have been produced by one or the other of three seals. Another more plausible sug- gestion is offered, namely, that in XIII an expanded production of seals first became possible with the opening of new trade relationships with the eastern mountainous regions, permitting the importation of desir- able varieties of stone not hitherto available. The reason for their subse- quent decline in popularity was the breaking off of those relationships owing to war or some other factor, and the fact that previously existing cultural influences from the Bast were superseded in X-A through IX by influences from another direction, resulting in a shift in technological emphasis rather than cultural decline. In XII the previously popular linear and geometric designs decreased in number, and naturalistic designs became preponderant, among which animal designs formed the largest group in almost all levels. The ibex was the animal most frequently repre- sented; the only domesticated animals introduced are the dogs known by their modern name of salukis. Scorpions are few in number, and snakes are usually in pairs or entwined. Representations of the human figure are unknown before XV. Among bone objects the most remarkable were playing pipes. The three examples found in XVII and XVI were simple pipes or whistles; the four later specimens all had holes or stops, and may be describes as flutes. The report on the excavations at Tepe Gawra is so replete with in- terest that in this discussion it has been possible to touch upon a few sali- ent points -only. Any student who wishes to profit to the full by the les- son imparted in the admirable presentation of the work done at Tepe Gawra must read and study the volume so that he may appreciate as they deserve the outstanding merits of the book and the importance of the results obtained by the investigation of the earlier strata at Tepe Gawra.</page></plain_text>
