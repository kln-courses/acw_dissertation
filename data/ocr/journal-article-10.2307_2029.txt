<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARACHNIDS AND OTHERS J. L. Cloudsley-Thompson (1958). Spiders, Scorpions, Centipedes and Mites. Pp. xiv+228; 16 plates; 40 text-figures. London; Pergamon. Price 50s. The title of this book is somewhat misleading; its eleven chapters deal with woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, other myriopods, scorpions, solifugids, false-scorpions, whip- scorpions and others, harvest spiders, spiders, mites and ticks. The chapters are sub- divided into sections on classification and distribution, general behaviour, food and feed- ing habits, enemies, reproduction and life cycle, a choice of topics which indicates the author's intention of interesting natural history workers and providing them with a guide to the taxonomic literature a guide which, however, is more economically provided by Smart and Taylor's Bibliography of Key Works for the Identification of the British Fauna and Flora. The book has some of the qualities of the older natural histories: a love of facts for their own sake; an entertaining discursiveness unhampered by the systematic divisions of the chapters; a tendency towards anthropomorphism (some hunting spiders 'spend the night under any suitable rock or stone they come across'; and mites led 'a blameless existence' before becoming parasitic); an occasional quaintness of expression ('in the silence of the night, the desert solifuga e race about, conduct their amours and glut themselves on innumerable insects to supply their requirements during the winter sleep'). However, Dr Cloudsley-Thompson has set himself the difficult task of combining the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 167 diversity of a natural history with the integrating principles of zoological science, and reference is made to such problems of current interest as the properties of arthropod cuticle, diurnal rhythm, arachnid proprioception, and the role of density-dependent factors in population control. The treatment of these matters is necessarily brief-for instance density-dependent factors in population control occupies a paragraph in the section on the enemies of harvest-spiders. This is likely to prove too brief for the natural historian and too superficial for the academic zoologist. However, there is a short biblio- graphy at the end of each chapter with references to some of the more detailed literature. One outstanding quality pervades the book: its author's enthusiasm for the animals with which he deals and about which he possesses much first-hand knowledge. This will stimulate interest among natural historians and academic zoologists alike in groups of arthropods which have lain for too long under the shadow of the insects. The book is well produced, illustrated and indexed; and contains a useful glossary of the scientific terms used in the text. D. A. PARRY</page></plain_text>
