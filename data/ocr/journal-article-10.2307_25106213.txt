<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EDITOR'S DIARY. A Decalogue for Women? Few women, we suspect, appreciate the magnitude of the sacri fice they would be required to make to be placed upon a plane of absolute equality with men. They cannot hope to acquire equal rights and privileges without assuming simultaneously equal obligations under religious as well as under secular law. To those who are unacquainted with the inestimable boon which they now possess in being exempt from the prohibitions imposed by the Decalogue upon men in respect of certain specified acts, the acceptance of full responsibility signifies little, if any, addition to the burdens now borne. Wiser ones doubtless appreciate the extent of the immunity which they now enjoy, and they may well hesitate for a long time to forsake, for mere temporary advan tages, a position likely to prove so serviceable in the hereafter. Whether feminine opposition to the attempt to establish equal rights on earth is based, in part, upon intelligent realization of the accompanying necessity of waiving this precious privilege, we cannot say; but it is clear that no woman should be permitted, through ignorance or misapprehension, to adopt a course which might tend to her undying regret in the world to come. The fact, of course, is that women are not only not bound by, but are freed, at least by inference, from any obligation to observe the requirements of our fundamental religious law. The Ten Commandments were written for men and apply to men ex clusively, except in so far as indirectly, through the agency of men, certain minor duties are imposed upon members of their households, and even here the full responsibility devolves upon the head of the tribe or family. The Fourth Commandment, providing for a proper yet prac ticable observance of the Sabbath, directs that " in it thou shalt</page><page sequence="2">476 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." All members of the household are comprised within the prohibition except one. " Nor thy wife " does not appear, and some have been led to suppose that the significant omission means that " thou " includes both husband and wife. The true explana tion is quite different, as we immediately perceive upon comparing this with the Tenth Commandment. " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant^ nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's." Clearly here "thou" does not include the wife with the hus band; the injunction is addressed explicitly and exclusively to the head of the household, who is very properly forbidden to covet any of his neighbor's properties, some of which are speci fied in the order of their value. Two omissions from this Com mandment as contrasted with the Fourth possess peculiar sig nificance. The head of the family must not permit his son or daughter to work on the Sabbath, but he is not forbidden to covet the children of his neighbor. The reason for this differentiation is plain. Any except necessary toil on the seventh day would be unseemly in the one case, and, in the other, there was no need to forbid the coveting of the privilege of supporting non-pro ducing young persons. Only the wives and servants and oxen and asses possessed actual value in common with inanimate pos sessions. The reason for the omission of " thy wife " from the Fourth Commandment now becomes manifest. Nature required that sustenance should be supplied to the human body even on the seventh day, and it had, of course, to be prepared and served by some person. The injunction against work being performed by any member of the household except the wife leaves no room for doubt as to who that person was. Moreover, the custom of the Jews at that period and to a much later day confirms the theory that on this day even the servants were to remain idle, "that they," in the amplified Deuteronomy version, " may rest as thou " ?i. e., the head of the house?and that the wives should perform the necessary services. The careful phrasing in both forms of the Fourth and Tenth Commandments definitely disposes of any idea that the laws were</page><page sequence="3">THE EDITOR'S DIARY. 477 meant to apply equally to husband and wife, and that "thou" comprises both. If such had been the intent, clearly " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife " would have read, " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's consort," or some like compre hensive term. Besides, upon the fallacious assumption noted, the deliberate failure to forbid the coveting of husbands implies positive permission to do so, thus creating a distinction which would be most unfair. Further proof of the fact that "thou" refers exclusively to the head of the family is hardly required. It follows necessarily that none of the other Commandments, in which no distinction in respect to sex appears, such as " Thou shalt not steal," applies to women, since none was addressed to them but all were directed exclusively to the men, who were held, and are of course to-day, strictly speaking, ac countable under our fundamental religious law for the earthly conduct and heavenly prospects of their wives. The fact that men have imposed restrictions upon women during the ages of their control since the Decalogue was promulgated is wholly immaterial, and need be considered only in a diplomatic, not at all in a moral, sense. Of the two versions of the Decalogue, that in Exodus is regard ed by the majority of scholars as the older, although even in this, as well as in the version presented in Deuteronomy, ampli fications have been introduced which did not exist in the original form, and traces of one yet older appear in the thirty-fifth chap ter of Exodus. Both Philo and Maimonides, in order to re move all anthropomorphic conceptions, insist that the Ten Words were not spoken by God's voice, but by an impersonal voice created especially for the enunciation; and both the Jews and Karaites hold that the writing on the tables was likewise a "creation," although, of course, the direct divine origin of both the spoken and written words is unquestioned. Nor is there any doubt that Moses was the intermediary and expositor, but there is only very general ground for the belief that his many amplifications were fully inspired. It is well, therefore, in trying to reach the true meaning of expressions pertaining to the point in issue, to consider the environment and attendant circum stances which may have influenced the prophet's mind. What, then, was the personal attitude of Moses toward women ? That he possessed peculiar powers of attraction for them there</page><page sequence="4">478 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. can be little doubt. It was because he was so beautiful as a babe that Amram and Jochebed determined, at no small risk to themselves, to preserve his life, and that the gentle heart of Thermutis went out to him. " God did also give him that tall ness, when he was but three years old, as was wonderful," writes Josephus ; " and as for his beauty, there was nobody so impolite as, when they saw Moses, they were not greatly surprised at the beauty of his countenance; nay, it happened frequently that those that met him as he was carried along the road were obliged to turn upon seeing the child, that they left what they were about and stood still a great while to look on him; for the beauty of the child was so remarkable and natural to him on many accounts, that it detained the spectators, and made them stay longer to look upon him." This pretty description we may well consider to be the product of a vivid imagination, but Josephus's detailed account of how Moses, while a young man, utilized his personal attractiveness to great advantage cannot be ignored, since it is confirmed by the more painstaking Irenaeus. According to this tale, while at the head of an Egyptian army besieging the Ethiopian city of Saba, Moses was seen by Tharbis, the daughter of the king, who forth with became enamoured of him, and sent a message to him say ing that she would procure the delivering up of the city if he would take an oath to marry her. Although dusky, Tharbis was a Princess and good to look upon, and the youthful Moses accepted the proposition. Thereupon his army was admitted through the wall and took the city, and the Princess dropped her title to become plain Mrs. Moses. What became of her subsequently nobody knows. The record merely states that Moses led his victorious army back to Egypt, and remained there until Pharaoh threatened to kill him. Then, as all will recall, he ran away and drew water from a wayside well for the seven daughters of Eeuel, who was so grateful that he gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage. One would suspect that Moses was obliged to accept whichever of the seven was offered to him, because it seems incredible that a young man of his discernment would not have selected one more amiable. Zipporah, despite the fact that her name signifies " a bird," must have been a very peevish young lady. It is quite possible, too, that, being a daughter of a high priest, she felt</page><page sequence="5">THE EDITOR'S DIARY. 479 that her social position was better than that of her husband. In any case, she behaved so badly and scolded so loudly that she disturbed the patrons of the inn at which they were tarrying while on their way to Egypt, and Moses, finding that he could abide her no longer, packed her and her children upon the back of an ass and sent them home to her father. The significant point in this incident, of course, is that so meek a man would not have treated a high-born, high-spirited lady in such a manner, even under so severe provocation, if he had not shared the com mon opinion of his day which classed married women with slaves and beasts of burden, as live personal properties. Years afterward, when her father, the high priest, brought Zipporah to her husband, then become a great man, Moses received her kindly, but no further word of either her or her sons appears in the record. Many careless writers refer to Zipporah as an Ethiopian, be cause Miriam and Aaron complained of Moses for .having brought disgrace upon their family by marrying a member of that dusky tribe; but there is no real basis for such a belief. Eeuel was a noble as well as a high priest, and originated the plan of organization of the tribes adopted by Moses, thus indicating the possession of a stronger intellectuality than was common among the Cushites. Josephus, as we have seen, accounts for the cause of the accusation in a romantic but probably fanciful manner. Many years elapsed after the marriage with Zipporah and the reported marriage with Tharbis before Miriam complained, and it is most unlikely that the proud and sharp-tongued prophetess would have waited so long. We are driven, then, to the learned Doctor Fausset's conclusion that the Ethiopian referred to was a lady whom Moses espoused after the death or departure of Zipporah. We must not assume, however, that the Almighty indicated His approval of miscegenation by rebuking Aaron and Miriam for murmuring over their brother's choice of a helpmeet, because the words " ethiopian " and " cushite " were often used as synonymous with "beautiful," and it is altogether probable that the jealous prophetess cried out in resentment at the impair ment of her own influence over Moses. On the whole, therefore, it seems reasonably certain that the great lawgiver's domestic life was praiseworthy in view of the fact that his first wife proved to be a shrew, and that in expounding the laws he was influenced</page><page sequence="6">480 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. by no consideration that could conflict in any way with the ac cepted doctrine of the time that man is and ought to be the head of a tribe or family and personally responsible for the acts of all members thereof. The real question, as we stated it at the beginning, is whether the waiving of exemption from the prohibitions prescribed for men by the religious law can be counterbalanced by pure ly mundane gain such as would be derived from universal suffrage. Clearly that is a point which should be determined by women themselves. If they should see fit to waive their ob vious prerogative for the common good, the decision would re dound greatly to their credit, but it is one which, frankly, we, if in their place, should make only after most careful consideration. But we feel satisfied that men now possessing authority will make no further marked concessions in respect to the governing power unless and until women voluntarily place themselves under equal moral limitations. Whether, in the event of their deciding to do so, an attempt should be made to revise the Commandments to conform to modern conditions, or to compose a special Deca logue for Women, is a question for the theologians, and one which, at the moment, we do not feel called upon to discuss.</page></plain_text>
