<plain_text><page sequence="1">Was There an Early Polynesian "Sky Father?* JEFF MARCK A ndyet it is somewhat surprising that the grand old epic of the New Zealand Maoris relating the birth of the gods as the offspring of the Sky father (Rangi) and the Earth-mother (Papa), does not seem to have held the same important place in the beliefs of the Rarotongans. . . This is a question that might well occupy the attention of the younger generation of Polynesian scholars now gradually coming to the fore. . . There can be little doubt that the belief in the origin of all living things originatingfrom the Sky father and Earth-mother, was the primary belief of the Aryan-speaking people of India, dating probably from times antecedent to their migration into India. . . S.Percy Smith1 IN THE MAIN, POLYNESIAN COSMOGONIES2 ATTRIBUTE THE END OF THE PRIMORDIAL period and the beginning of the world as we know it to the union of what I shall call a Primordial Pair, one male and one female. This is true of Tongan, Samoan, Marquesan, New Zealand Maori, and some Cook Island Maori traditions. Tra ditions which differ, such as Tahitian, Tuamotuan, other Cook Islands and Hawai'ian, would seem to have developed out of the basic pattern seen in those mentioned before. Little is known of Rapanui (Easter Island) or Polynesian Outlier cosmogonic traditions and it is the traditions of the previously named groups with which we will be most concerned. Specifically I will address the question of how old may be the New Zealand Maori concept of a Primordial Pair involving Sky Father or Father Sky (Rangi) and Earth Mother or Mother Earth (Papa). E.S.C. Handy viewed the New Zealand Maori cosmology in general as somewhat archetypal, truer to the past than others, and held that the Sky Father concept seemed to be of great antiquity and a pattern from which other Polynesian cosmogonies emerged.3 Here I will suggest that it was not, at least in linguistically reconstructable patterns of naming. This work was done at the Dept of Linguistics, Research School of Pacificand Asian Studies, Australian National University. The author wishes to express gratitude for the institutional support and to Andrew Pawley who made extensive comments on an earlier draft. An earlier version was presented at the conference on 'Deconstructing the Island Group' in Dec. 1994, Division of Pacific and Asian History, RSPAS. i S.

It is with Handy that such attempts appear to have begun and ended. While R.W. Williamson soon produced a broader comparative work than Handy on these and related matters and speculated about the past, he was not so specifically preoccupied with reconstruction. Robert Craig, whose Dictionary of Polynesian Mythology is the only work since Williamson's to present extensive comparative materials on Polynesian pan theons and cosmogonic traditions for all the major groups, did not attempt reconstruction. Te Rangi Hiroa compared Central Eastern Polynesian memories of'Hawaiki' but he did not consider that aspect of cosmogony presently under discussion: the conceptualisation of the Primordial Pair.4 Whether for lack of interest or lack of an acceptable method, further attempts at reconstruction seem entirely lacking in the literature. What follows is a linguist's look at the matter and a linguist's suggestion as to what would be an appropriate methodological point of departure for reconstruction. I shall suggest a method, apply it, and compare the conclusions to those reached by Handy most of 70 years ago. I am well versed in neither Polynesian creation traditions nor any theory of how such traditions ought formally to be compared and reconstructed. Nevertheless, in an initial incursion into the materials I have found it quite remarkable that certain traditions occur only within specific linguistic subgroups. Here I present one of two works based on the premise that there may be a phylogeny of creation traditions that developed and differentiated much along the lines of the linguistic phylogeny for the area.5 It seemed logical to start at the beginning and the Primordial Pair seems a beginning common to much of Polynesia so I began by applying the method I am about to suggest to this reconstruction problem. The linguistic phylogeny mentioned is given in Figure 1. There is nothing in the comparative linguistics literature that gives one per mission to proceed exactly along the lines I shall suggest. As W.H. Goodenough puts it: Nothing as neat as the Grimm's law kind of correspondence has been worked out for cultural forms other than linguistic ones. The closest anthropologists have come to a comparable degree of precision in establishing cognate forms has been in technology.. . But attempts to do this with other sectors of culture have been much less precise and often unconvincing. . . 4 R.W.

Goodenough goes on to suggest a method for comparing certain cultural traits but in that work he was speaking of traits as they are examined in functional interpretations.6 The present work makes no claims about function or evol utionary tendencies. Rather it is a simple examination of distributions of names and concepts surrounding the Primordial Pair as compared to the linguistic phylogeny of Polynesia.7 We take note that borrowing ideas might occur more readily than borrowing words and as linguists we cannot state precisely what cultural traits are most likely to be borrowed. Linguists know that borrowing of words occurs readily in the instance of borrowed material culture but the question of borrowing named 6 W.H.

We have no method at all for evaluating whether borrowing ideas has occurred when the names associ ated with those ideas have not been borrowed. Convergence is another issue that must be addressed and linguists have no method for recognising convergence except with our own materials. The possibility of borrowing can reasonably be ruled out in many Polynesian instances by the great distances involved. If, for instance, a belief is universal within Polynesia, it becomes very complex to explain its distribution by bor rowing. Economy of explanation lies with the inference that the belief existed in the common ancestral community. On the other hand, if a trait is known only from Tonga and Samoa we would be quite happy to entertain the possibility of borrowing as we know there were regular contacts in pre-European times. But, for instance, a highly specific agreement of an idea and its name between Samoa and Marquesas would suggest that the belief and name for it existed in the common ancestral community because borrowing over such a distance would be difficult and convergence unlikely in a named detail of structure where the names were cognate. Convergence, the independent development of common characteristics, is unlikely in the instance of shared cosmogonic identities who have linguistically cognate names and highly specific identical deeds. But convergence is more difficult to dismiss in the instance of structured beliefs which have no particular name to test for cognation and may be similar due to universal tendencies in the transformation of cosmogonic beliefs. It is especially at this point that we leave the methods of comparative linguistics behind and must state our assumptions and methods explicitly. What follow are proposed criteria for the task at hand. These cannot be claimed to have the support of comparative linguists in general. They do, how ever, resemble Ross Clark's 'distributional method' for reconstructing gram matical components of Polynesian languages.8 The following simple rules or guidelines are the basis for the suggestions in the main section and conclusions: 1. If a feature of the cosmogonies is universal or occurs in Tonga and Eastern Polynesia the feature will be suggested to have occurred amongst the beliefs of the Proto Polynesian speakers. (Agreements between Tongan and Samoan will be considered possible borrowings unless there is agreement from Eastern Polynesia as well). An example of a Tongan-Samoan-Eastern Polynesian agreement that we will see is the belief that the sky was close to the earth at the time of creation and that this caused great inconvenience to early anthropo morphic gods and people and that an early act of these gods was to raise the 8 Ross Clark, Aspects of Proto-Polynesian Syntax (Auckland 1976).</page><page sequence="5">12 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY sky. This would seem to have been a belief of the Proto Polynesian speakers. 2. Similarly, if a feature occurs in two widely separated groups not otherwise known to have borrowed from each other, the feature will be suggested to have occurred in the community of speakers of their common proto language rather than to be borrowed. An example that we will see is the naming of the male of the Primordial Pair as Papa-a.&amp;\. in both Samoa and the Marquesas. With these two criteria in mind, suggestions are made about the possible names and beliefs amongst the speakers of Polynesian proto languages as regards the Primordial Pair, the male and female entities that bring the world as we know it out of the primordial condition. The method may be in error. It assumes that cosmogonies were transmitted and differentiated amongst pre historic communities in the same general way as languages. This may not have been commonly or generally true. Still, it seems to produce a more plausible result than seen in Handy and provides a different point of departure that some students of the situation might find more appealing. The Primordial Condition, the Primordial Pair and Creation in Polynesian Cosmogonies In the main, Polynesians conceived of the primordial condition as one in which the sky was a stratum hugging close to the earth. The Primordial Pair gave rise to first order anthropomorphic gods. An early act of the first order anthropo morphic gods or their offspring was to raise the sky to make the earth more habitable in the sense of such modern conveniences as being able to walk upright, living in an earth bathed in sunlight and starlight, and being able to see to the horizon as it is known today. These beliefs are common in varying degrees to Tongan, Samoan, Marquesan, New Zealand Maori, Tahitian, Cook Island, Tuamotuan and Hawai'ian traditions.9 Thus, by our present method, we would suggest that these were beliefs of Proto Polynesian (PPN), Proto Nuclear Polynesian (PNP), Proto Eastern Poly nesian (PEP), Proto Central Eastern (PCE), Proto Marquesic (PMQ) and Proto Tahitic (PTA) speakers. In Tongan and Samoan traditions the primordial condition was interrupted by the union of a Primordial Pair, male and female, who gave birth to cosmic beings who in turn gave birth to the first order anthropomorphic gods. New Zealand Maori traditions have the cosmic beings giving rise to the Primordial Pair whose direct offspring were the first order anthropomorphic gods. Mar quesan traditions do not seem to remember a period of cosmic beings and have 9 Martha Beckwith, Hawaiian Mythology (Honolulu 1970), 230, 379; Abraham Fornander, Collection of Hawaiian A ntiquities and Folk Lore (Honolulu 1916-17), 18; William W.

Tahitian traditions and those of Hawai'i diverge in various ways from this pattern as do some Tuamotuan and Southern Cook Island traditions. There the Primordial Pair are found in different roles but are recog nisable as they retain their old names and sometimes issue forth the same first order anthropomorphic gods. Other Cook Island traditions follow more the New Zealand Maori and Marquesan pattern.

This is due to the absence of agreement between Tongan and Nuclear Polynesian. While there is the partial agreement of Tongan Kele with Samoan Papa-'Ele this could be a borrowing. The Tongan Primordial Pair, Limu and Kele, translate as 'Seaweed (male)' and 'Sediment (female)'. The second has traditionally been translated as 'Slime' 10 but Tongan kele refers to water borne or water deposited soil and not to Cf Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, and Craig, Dictionary.</page><page sequence="7">14 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY the particular state that it is in. *] In Tongan traditions Limu and Kele become the parents of a rock in one version or simply pass by it in the water in another and the rock begins to spew forth cosmic beings from whom ultimately descend the first order anthropomorphic gods, the half-brothers Tangaloa, Maui and Hiku-Leqo. Proto Nuclear Polynesian Nuclear Polynesian traditions (Samoan and Central Eastern) are quite distinct from Tongan and differ in that the Primordial Pair are conceived of as lower earthly geological strata or the earth itself in the case of the female and upper earthly geological strata, the sky (which was a stratum hugging the earth), or the stratum of space between the sky and the earth in the case of the male. PNP *Papa, as a common noun, goes back some thousands of years to, at least, Proto Austronesian for which *papan 'board, plank' is reconstructed. It came into Proto Polynesian regularly by way of Proto Oceanic for which *baban (^mpam pan) 'board, plank' is reconstructed.12 Biggs reconstructs PPN *papa 'flat hard surface'.13 This is a cautious, minimal semantic reconstruction but the word means 'board' in several Polynesian languages (e.g. East Futunan, Hawai'ian, Samoan and Tongan), as it did in PAN and POC so it probably had that meaning in PPN as well. It seems possible *papa had a 'stratum' sense in PNP or at least PCE and that this is the sense in which it was used to name the Primordial Pair, Papa-Tuu 'Standing Stratum, male' and Papa-'Ele 'Earth Stratum, female' in the case of Samoan and Papa-'Unal'Uka 'Upper Stratum, male' and Papa-'A'o 'Lower Stratum, female' in the case of the Marquesas. 'Stratum' is not such a different concept from 'board' or 'flat surface' if we think of them as being capable of being stacked. Neither Samoan nor Marquesan dictionaries give a 'stratum' meaning for papa so this is largely conjecture. But linguists would be inclined to search for some commonality as the words are presently identical but are said to mean somewhat different things to the Samoans and the Marquesans in their naming of the Pri mordial Pair. The traditional translation of the Samoan meanings is 'Great Rocks' or 'Standing Rocks' for the male and 'Earthy Rocks' or 'Earth Rock' for the female.14 Several Samoans living in Canberra in 1995 agree that this is what the names mean to them: papa is 'rock', tuu is 'standing' and Jele is 'dirt, soil'. Papa-'Ele means, to them, 'Earth Rock' and Papa-Tuu means 'Standing Rock' such as might be found in the mountains. These speakers state specifically that there is li Cf C Maxwell Churchward, Tongan Dictionary (Tonga 1959), 260. 12 Andrew Pawley, Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond, Comparative Oceanic lexicon, computer file, Dept of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, 1995. is Biggs, POLLEX, 1994. M Cf Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, 3-4, 6.</page><page sequence="8">WAS THERE AN EARLY POLYNESIAN *SKY FATHER'?* 15 no notion familiar to them ofPapa-Tuu being the sky. They think of it as a part of the earth. On the other hand, in the Marquesas there is the question of whether Papa 'Una/'Uka represents the sky itself and Papa-'A'o the earth itself. Williamson, citing F.W.Christian, states that the Marquesan Papa-'Una/"Uka and Papa-'A'o were believed to be the sky and the earth, respectively. However, Christian actually translates them as 'World Above' and 'World Below' so the equation of these names with 'sky' and 'earth' is uncertain on the basis of Christian alone.15 Handy speaks to this issue stating that Papa-'Una was sometimes referred to as 'Ani-Motua which is literally 'Sky Father'.16 In addition to this difference in the conceptualisation of their male Papa, there is a basic difference in the sky raising story between Samoa and the Marquesas. In Samoa it was the sky itself that was hugging the earth and it was called by the sky name in the sky raising stories rather than Papa-Tuu.11 In the Marquesan traditions it was specifically Papa-'Una/'Uka which was hugging close to Papa-'A'o and had to be lifted,18 so Marquesan Papa-'Una/'Uka was the sky even though it was not called by that name in the formal recitation of the main traditions. Proto Central Eastern Polynesian The outstanding feature of Central Eastern Polynesian speaking groups is the common naming of the Primordial Female as *Papa and the belief that she was the earth itself. Her children would seem to have been at least *TaX\aroa, *Taane, *Tuu, *RoT\o and perhaps * Aatea, *(H)aumia, *ToT\a-Fiti, and *Mauri.19 Only Tahi tian, certain Tuamotuan and Tongarevan traditions name the Primordial Female something different than by a reflex of *Papa and all of these name her by reflexes of *Faka-Hotu. This seems a recent innovation around the Tahiti area, one that extended somehow to Tongareva. It is not possible to support the reconstruction of PCE, PMQ/Pajba-adj. 'male of Primordial Pair' with MQor CE evidence other than MQA. The reconstruction is made on the basis of Samoan and Marquesan. Marquesic For Mangareva there is no pair like the Primordial Pair reported for the locality.20 Hawai'ian traditions may be a mixture of Marquesan and Tahitian traditions. Hawai'ian Papa was wedded to Waakea (PCE *Waatea or *Avatea) which is true elsewhere only in some Tahitic groups. The pronunciation of Hawai'ian kahuna 15 Ibid., 26; F.W.

Possibly there are additional borrowings of religious terms from Tahitic but I have not examined those materials.22 The absence of a Primordial Pair in Mangareva traditions and the possible borrowing of Tahitic elements into Hawai'i do not allow for what linguists call 'internal reconstruction' of names for the Primordial Pair for Proto Marquesic. Reconstruction is dependent upon agreement of the one reliable witness (Mar quesan) with some language or group outside Marquesic. As Marquesan agrees with Samoan in the noun portion of their terms for both members of the Pri mordial Pair, the linguist's inclination is to reconstruct the noun with indeter minate adjectives. The suggestion being made is that this terminology existed in PNP and that it continued into SAM, PEP, PCE and PMQ. It is true that either SAM or MQA or both could have extended the relatively constant female name to the male (with a different adjective) but there is the question of why MQA would do this when the entity involved seems to have been the sky itself. The reconstruction in Table 1 suggests that while the Mar quesans thought of Papa-'Unal'Uka as being the sky, they retained an older name. By this solution Tahitic and Hawai'ian are seen as changing the name to higher elements of the primordial universe as they conceptualised it. That is, the * Aatea suggested for PTA in Table 1 meant 'Space Deified/Personified' and refers to the space between the earth and the sky. In one Marquesas tradition Aatea was the first order anthropomorphic god (offspring of the Primordial Pair) that first succeeded in breaking out into open space from the cavern in which he and his siblings dwelt.23 Although another Marquesan tradition attributes this to Taane,24 the Aatea tradition seems more in line with Aatea's name, as it refers to the open space onto which they burst. After these heroic events Aatea was the 'progenitor of all natives with Atanua his wife'.25 Handy names him first when recounting the offspring of the Primordial Pair but does not state specifically that he was most senior.26 In the suggested PMQ/econstruction, I have set aside the partial agreement of the alternate Marquesan name, 'Ani-Motua with N.Z. Maori Rangi. Similar logic 21 ppn *tufuT\a meant 'craftsman, expert' as it did in PCE where *tuhtiX\a is reconstructed but it had also come to mean 'priest' in PCE. There is an irregular change of the first vowel in all Tahitic and their pronun ciations reconstruct to PTA *tahuT\a. HAW shows the TA vowel change and is best explained as a borrowing from TA as such changes are very rare in EP. The specific change of a *CuCu- form to CaCu- seems entirely unique. 22 Although it is natural to think of cosmogony and religion as intimately connected, Polynesian religious practices usually had little to do with the Primoraial Pair or early anthropomorphic gods and the matters of religion and cosmogony are generally studied, described and compared as rather distinct realms of tradition. 23 Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, 25-6; Marta Langridge and Jennifer Terrell (trans, and ed.), Von den Steinen's Marquesan Myths (Canberra 1988), 66. 24 Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, 26. 25 Handy, The Native Culture, 245; cf also Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, 68. 26 Handy, The Native Culture, 244.</page><page sequence="10">WAS THERE AN EARLY POLYNESIAN *SKY FATHER?* 1 7 would seem to suggest a competing PMQjeconstruction *RaT)i and attribute this to PCE and PTA as well. However, the evidence internal to Tahitic seems not to favour this solution. Proto Tahitic The recurrent male partner of the female Papa in Tahitic groups is Aatea, Waatea, Avatea, Vatea and the like, including that found in the N.Z. Maori variant Rangi Aatea and the possible Tahitic loan in Hawai'ian: Waakea. As Dorothy Barrere says in reference to Tahitic groups: 'Tane, Tu, Tangaroa, and Rongo, present in most cosmogonies as children of the 'Sky Father' (Atea) and the 'Earth Mother' (Papa)'.27 But the situation is varied and complex, as seen in Table 1, and our main criteria in searching out remnants of the Primordial Pair tradition in much of Tahitic and Hawai'i involve asking: 1. Was the female called *Papa or the male called *Aatea and 2. were their offspring such first order Central Eastern Polynesian anthropo morphic gods as *TaX\aroa, *Taane, *Tu and *RoT\o? While Tumu is paired with Papa in some highly transformed Tahitian, Tuamo tuan and some Southern Cook Island traditions, there is also a pairing of a female Aatea with a different Papa in Tahiti, then a change in gender of Aatea and a new spouse, HaJa-Hotu,2S who is also the (female) spouse of Aatea (male) in some Tuamotuan traditions 29 and the main Tongarevan (Penrhyn) tradition known.30 It seems there was a great deal of change centred in and emanating from the Tahiti area, the first the pairing of * Aatea with *Fa'a-Hotu rather than *Papa and the second the pairing of the main *Papa figure with *Tumu. But for Tahitian, the anthropomorphic siblings are generally the children of * Aatea, variously by his wife *Papa or *Fa'a-Hotu. We will consider the traditions of the various Tahitic localities and summarise at the end. New Zealand Maori It is interesting to note that, while Atea as a proper name does not appear to have been known in New Zealand, the Sky Father was sometimes called Rangi-atea (Hongi 20:25).31 In such compounding of names in Polynesian languages it is often a parent that is named in the second word. Thus, New Zealand Maori Rangi-Aatea32 may 27 Dorothy Barrere, 'Revisions and adulterations in Polynesian creation myths', in G.A.

S2 The cosmogonic sources rarely indicate the vowel length in reflexes of * Aatea but the dictionaries of the individual languages and Biggs (POLLEX 1994) normally do.</page><page sequence="11">18 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY have meant 'Rangi son of Aatea'. One of the islands in the Societies is named Ra'iatea (PTA *RaT\i-Aatea) and Bruce Biggs notes the same compounded place name in New Zealand and Hawai'i,ss so the name seems old around Tahitic. Another New Zealand Maori tradition identifies Rangi-Awatea as a woman but the adjectives are formally different and the Tregear tradition refers to actants and events some time later in the course of creation.34 There seems therefore to have been both Rangi-Aatea and Rangi-Awatea, the former a member of the Pri mordial Pair and the latter not. There is one reference that I know of that contradicts Handy's statement that Awatea or Aatea did not occur independently in New Zealand Maori. This comes from Johannes Andersen who states that 'Awatea or Atea takes the place of Whaitua as the eighteenth age'.35 The Whaitua age was the final age of cosmic beings or ages which gave rise to Rangi and Papa so this tradition supports the notion of Aatea as a parent or ancestor of Rangi in New Zealand Maori tra ditions. In any event, the New Zealand Maori absence of * Aatea as the spouse of Papa as in other Tahitic or as a first order anthropomorphic god (child of the Primordial Pair) as in Marquesan is quite remarkable and some kind of explanation is called for. The solution suggested here is that * Aatea was lost from New Zealand Maori, or relegated to a distant memory as a cosmic being ancestral to Rangi and Papa because he was replaced by Rangi. There is rather a hierarchy of what Polynesians remember about and attribute to beings involved in creation. They remember a great deal about the first order anthropomorphic gods and attribute many deeds to them and there are many cognate names.36 They usually remember a Primordial Pair and some names are cognate but deeds, other than union and procreation leading to the first order anthropomorphic gods, are not generally attributed to them. Cosmic beings in the traditions of the main groups for which they are reported (Tonga, Samoa and New Zealand Maori) have not yet been shown to have cognate names37 and deeds other than procreation are not attributed to them. Thus if * Aatea was elevated to a cosmic being by New Zealand Maori or some early Tahitic group with which they share a history, it is not surprising that deeds ceased to be attributed to him and his name was all but forgotten. ss Biggs, POLLEX, 1994.

This was the belief current in Mangaia when Europeans first recorded such things.38 In that tradition the ori gin of the Primordial Pair [Vaatea and Papa) are conceptualised differently than among the New Zealand Maori, the Marquesans or Tongans and Samoans but they are the direct parents of the first order anthropomorphic gods as the Pri mordial Pair are in the Marquesas and amongst the New Zealand Maori. Vaatea and Papa are not pre-existing primordial entities in this Mangaian tradition or the offspring of cosmic beings. But the names of their children find many cognates in the first order anthropomorphic gods from around New Zealand, the Marquesas, Tonga and Samoa. William W. Gill relates a Rarotongan tradition where Aatea was the creator of all things, his wife was Papa-Roa-I-Te-Itinga (Papa-Roa of the sunrise) and their child was Te Tumu who married Papa-Roa-I-Te-Opunga (Papa-Roa of the sunset).39 In a Rarotongan tradition, Tumu and Papa are said to have dwelt in *Avaiki ('Hawaiki') where Tumu was an ariki (chief, royal). Their children were numer ous and among them were many of the standard first order anthropomorphic gods seen in Central Eastern Polynesia groups, Rongo, Taane, Tu, Tangaroa, Aatea and others. Percy Smith calls this same Rarotongan Tumu the 'Sky Father'40 but tumu in Tahitic generally means 'origin, base, trunk'. The 'Sky Father' rendering is neither literal nor is it explained. 'Atea' in this tradition is not expanded upon except to mention him as a child of Tumu and Papa. Amongst the New Zealand Maori traditions the name Tumu-ad}. was carried by several ancestors from Hawaiki,41 while in the Tuamotus Tumu-adj. was the name for several regions of the sky,42 and the Tuamotuan name Tumu without adjectives named 'the Tuamotuan god of life who rewards spirits according to their earthly deeds'.43 Tuamotuan Tumu-Ruuia was 'supreme lord of the sky world',44 but many gods became lord of various skies around Polynesia45 and this Tuamotuan Tumu-adj. was apparently not the spouse of Papa. The Primordial Pair in Tongareva were Aatea and Haka-Hotu.^ They were the parents of the first order anthropomorphic gods, Taane, Tangaroa, Rongo-Nui, and ss Gill, Myths and Songs, 7-11.

Haka-Hotu seems a Tahitian or Tuamotuan influence given the Papa of New Zealand and the Southern Cooks. The Tuamotus The Tuamotus cover a vast area and many creations traditions are reported from various islands. I will first mention one from Eugene Caillot because it seems more complete and to involve older notions that those mentioned by Williamson, J.F. Stimson or Teuira Henry who were Craig's sources.47 By Caillot's account Vaatea and Hotu, whose origins are not mentioned, sleep together with the result being a number of children: 'Ru, Pigao, Tope, Tane, Tagaroa, Titi, Tiki, Ruanuku, Maui, Gaohe, Vaerua'. Clearly Vaatea and Hotu are the Primordial Pair in this tradition by our present definition and criteria. Williamson relates a few paragraphs about 'Paumotu' (now an exclusively French appellation for 'Tuamotus') from Albert Montiton (1874) corning from the islands Fangatau and Takoto. It began with a reference to the original close embrace of sky and earth with a race of giants living within or between them, and went on to tell of fighting between two of these children, Oatea [Atea] and Tane, in which Tangaroa also took part, and of Tane's raising of the sky.48 These elements seem broadly consistent with Central Eastern Polynesian tra ditions from pre-Christian times. This particular Tuamotuan tradition has a Marquesan flavour in the sense that Aatea is said to have anthropomorphic characteristics and actions. Names for the Primordial Pair, however, cannot be clearly established from this tradition. Tumu-Henua is the earliest entity in one tradition giving birth to Tumu-Nui (male) and Tumu-Iti (female) who have a child Tangaroa, amongst others not named. Then the islands of Fiji, Samoa, Tonga tapu, Vava'u, Tahiti, others and numerous of the Tuamotus appear.49 Tumu is a name or place in many creation traditions around the Tahiti area all the way down to New Zealand but there are usually other candidates for the Primordial Pair or remnant memories thereof. The largest collection of Tuamotuan creation traditions are those recorded by Stimson, were taken down after many generations of Christianity, and centre around Kiho, the supreme being that Barrere suggests may be a post-European contact development around New Zealand, the Societies and areas immediately adjacent to the Societies.50 Thus in Stimson's collections we are looking for what 47 Caillot, Histoire, 50-1; Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, I, 15-16; J. Frank Stimson, Tuamotuan Religion (Honolulu 1933), 9-69; Henry, Ancient Tahiti, 347-9. 48 Williamson, loc. cit. 49 Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs, 16. Note that there are memories throughout the Cooks and Societies all the way over to the Marquesas of having come from the Samoa, Tonga, Fiji area. The names of specific islands in Fiji, Tonga and Samoa are remembered in genealogies, chants and other oral history. Easter Islanders, Hawai'ians and possibly the NZ Maori seem not to have such memories. 50 Stimson, Tuamotuan Religion, 9-69; Barrere, 'Revisions and adulterations'.</page><page sequence="14">WAS THERE AN EARLY POLYNESIAN 'SKY FATHER'?* 21 remnants of the Primordial Pair might be found in highly transformed traditions. The first major god made and empowered by Stimson's Kiho is Aatea ('Atea' or 'Atea-Rangi'). Three heavenly spheres emerge, Kiho reigned over the night sphere, Aatea over the day sphere and Taane ('Tane') over the sky sphere. Taane is later said to be the son of Aatea. Aatea is a great creator god and is specifically credited with bringing Tangaroa, Rongo-Nui, Tiki and the clan of Ru into exist ence.51 But he does this without a spouse and his creation of Taane, Tangaroa and Rongo-Nui 52 is our main evidence from this tradition for believing he may have once been the Tuamotuan male of the Primordial Pair. This is not too disturbing since a central part of the transformation of traditions that Barrere reviews is the replacement of a cosmogonic tradition that has creation commencing with the sexual union of primordial physical elements with one in which creation com mences with deeds of primordial (pre-existing) anthropomorphic male creator beings. Tahiti As mentioned previously, Tahitian traditions differ most markedly from other Polynesian traditions. Therefore they are presented penultimately, traditions of Hawai'i being last of all because they may be a mix of Marquesic and Tahitic. There are three possible remnants of a Primordial Pair of the PNP, PCE and PTA type in the main Tahitic traditions from Henry. 53 The pairs are Tumu and Papa Raha-Raha, Papa-Tuu-'Oi and Aatea, and Aatea and Ha'a-Hotu. Papa-Tuu-'Oi is a possible cognate of Samoan Papa-Tuu but it is also possible that it is a local Tahitian innovation. As will be seen below, these are highly transformed tra ditions and the main agreement in naming with other Tahitic is the Aatea/Ha'a Hotu pair. I will begin by outlining what is know of Tahitian traditions. In two Tahitian traditions related by Henry Ta'aroa (PPN *TaX\aloa) was a pre existing being rather than a first order anthropomorphic god.54 He existed since primordial times in a shell like that of an egg which revolved in primal darkness. Ultimately he broke out of his shell and in one of the traditions Tumu-Iti is mentioned and translated as 'little-foundation' which is a locality within his broken shell that existed in a primordial world that included sky, ocean, land and fresh water. In the longer of the two traditions, Ta'aroa takes another Tumu, Tumu-Nui, translated as 'The great foundation of the earth' and makes him the husband of Papa-Raha-Raha which Henry renders as 'Stratum-rock' (Tahitian raha means 'flat, broad'). That longer tradition ends with mention of Tumu-Ra'i Fenua ('Foundation-of-earthly-heaven'), an octopus that held the sky down close to the earth. We will note, for the moment, that Tumu is the first party in creation 51 Stimson, Tuamotuan Religion, 13, 23, 21. 52 First order anthropomorphic gods amongst NZ Maori and in the Marquesas. 53 Henry, Ancient Tahiti, 336-40. 54 Ibid., 338.</page><page sequence="15">22 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY to be espoused to any Papa, that Papa meant 'earth, the Earth' and that Tumu meant 'foundation', but did not seem to be associated with deified chiefs, as in New Zealand, or sky gods, as in the Tuamotus. Henry then relates a tradition of a chaotic period during which time Ta'aroa creates (calls forth) Tuu, 55 plants took root, and Ta'aroa fixed the sky (part of his egg shell) on pillars which Tumu-Nui and Papa-Raha-Raha helped him obtain. The space created was Aatea and Ta'aroa invoked a spirit to fill it. Aatea is wedded to Papa-Tuu-'Oi 'Basaltic-peak' in a following tradition and they have a child Ra'i-Tupua-Nui-Te-Fanau-'Eve ('Great-sky-developer-born-in-Commotion') who caused 'the laying out of the world'. 56 In these traditions Aatea is female and Papa-Tuu-'Oi a male. In a following tradition Aatea and Papa-Tuu-'Oi have another child, Taane.51 But Aatea and Papa-Tuu-'Oi apparently sire no more of what are otherwise first order anthropomorphic gods in Marquesan and other Tahitic traditions and there are various other gods and craftsmen in existence by this time. These seem highly transformed traditions, compared to the Marquesas, New Zealand Maori, and even the Cooks and Tuamotus. There is then a tradition of Aatea trading her feminine nature with Fa'a-Hotu who was female but had a masculine nature. 58 Aatea then goes on to father children with Fa'a-Hotu while Ta'aroa and Papa-Raha-Raha had numerous daughters. Other gods are conjured forth at this time. None of the children of Aatea or Ta'aroa have names cognate with first order anthropomorphic gods of the Marquesas, the Southern Cooks, the Tuamotus or New Zealand except Taane and Ro'o, respectively. Henry's traditions were collected after some years of regular European con tact and those with which we are presently concerned were collected in 1822 by John Orsmond, the year William Ellis left the island. Ellis was in Tahiti for a number of years and was interested in what he said was a Hindu notion that the world began as an egg. Try as he might he could not find anyone to relate a similar notion in Tahiti.59 Yet traditions of creation beginning with an egg were the mainstay of Orsmond's sources.60 Thus there is some basis to wonder if the often retold Tahitian creation tradition of the world beginning as an egg devel oped under the stimulus of Ellis's questioning. Otherwise Ellis relates bits of cosmogonic traditions where Ta'aroa is a pre-existing creator god, somewhat in the fashion of Henry's sources.61 PTA *Aatea 'Primordial Male' is reconstructed in Table 1 on the basis of New Zealand Maori, Mangaian, Tongarevan, certain Rarotongan and certain 55 A first order anthropomorphic god and child of the Primordial Pair in Tahitic and Marquesic traditions other than Hawai'ian. 56 Henry, Ancient Tahiti, 356. 57 Ibid., 364. 58 Ibid., 372-4. 59 William Ellis, Polynesian Researches (London 1967), II, 42-3. 60 Henry, Ancient Tahiti, 336-464. 61 Ellis, Polynesian Researches, vols I, II.</page><page sequence="16">WAS THERE AN EARLY POLYNESIAN 'SKY FATHER'?* 23 Tuamotuan traditions. PTA *Papa 'Primordial Female' is reconstructed in Table 1 on the basis of New Zealand Maori, Mangaian and Rarotongan traditions, which is a limited geographical area but one which agrees with external evidence from the Marquesas and Samoa and with the ambiguous (Tahitic or Marquesic) evidence from Hawai'i. Hawai'i The local transformations of Hawai'ian creation traditions are well known from the work of Martha Beckwith.62 The outstanding characteristic is a trilogy con sisting of Kaane, Kuu and Lono (PCE *Taane, *Tuu and *RoT)o) in which Kaane was supreme. Craig has Kaane emerging directly from 'the eternal poo (darkness)' as does Beckwith, his source, but both ignore a passage in Abraham Fornander's Hawaiian Antiquities more in keeping with the general Central Polynesian pattern that specifically has Kaane and Kanaloa (PCE *TaT\aroa) as the offspring of Waakea and Papa.6* Due to this neglected passage, I think we can dismiss much of what has passed for Hawai'ian tradition in Craig and Beckwith. Rather we see in the passage from Fornander cited above the last dying gasp of an aboriginal pattern which cascaded towards a Christian model soon after the arrival of Europeans.64 To ask whether this small bit of unblemished tradition is more Tahitic or more Marquesic is probably not very meaningful. The Hawai'ian Primordial Pair is more in keeping with Tahitic and the Hawai'ian memory is one of Waakea and Papa coming from Tahiti, Kaane and Kanaloa being born in Hawai'i. The memory of Kanaloa being a child of the Primordial Pair does not have a counterpart in the Marquesas but it does in Mangareva so the Mangarevan evidence leans towards a Proto Marquesic first order anthropomorphic god *TaT[aroa and Hawai'ian Kana loa may come from that tradition, the Tahitic tradition, or both (because they did not conflict). There is no linguistic method for suggesting whether the Hawai'ian tradition of Waakea and Papa is a transformation of an inherited Marquesic tra dition or a borrowing from Tahitic. Since the Hawai'ians specify that those gods or godly people came from Tahiti, it is tempting to favour the Tahitic loan possibility. the element of the cosmogony most clearly reconstructable to the beliefs of the Proto Polynesian speaking community was the notion that the primordial con dition involved a sky that was hugging close to the earth. The sky raising story is part of this general complex of reconstructable beliefs. While the Primordial Pair 62 Beckwith, Hawaiian Mythology. 65 Craig, Dictionary, 101; Beckwith, op. cit.; Fornander, Hawaiian Antiquities and Folklore, 17-18. 64 Hawai'ian Kanaloa is often seen as a demoted god, a fallen god, or a god of the underworld but this may be a Christian influence as well (Marck, 'The first order anthropomorphic gods', 1).</page><page sequence="17">24 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY was named as being the sky and earth in New Zealand Maori, this is unique in Polynesia and seems the end of a long progression, within Maori's line in Nuclear Polynesian, of naming the male after first terrestrial, then atmospheric, then heavenly entities and strata. The male of the Primordial Pair may have been thought of as the sky itself as early as Proto Central Eastern times, but he seems to have been called by older names. Samoans specifically do not think of their Papa-Tuu as being the sky. In Tonga the Primordial Pair are minor earthly elements and the 'union of strata' theme of Nuclear Polynesian cannot be recon structed to Proto Polynesian. Handy looks for the New Zealand Maori Sky Father elsewhere and when he is not found, assumes a direct equivalence must exist: 'In begetting the islands Waakea's part corresponds to that of Taaroa and Tangaloa (who played the part of Sky Father in Tahiti and Samoa)'.65 But Handy's work was done at a time when the dispersal of people into the far corners of the earth was presumed to be fairly recent and Polynesian mythology was hoped to connect somehow to that of the Indus and areas further west as the quote from Smith at the beginning of this paper indicates. The comparative method of social anthropology, as employed in Handy's generation,66 may have favoured a unilineal interpretation moving from simplicity of the Primordial Pair notion, such as in Tonga, to grander notions such as ultimately achieved in New Zealand Maori. But Handy took the position that the Sky Father notion was the original and other groups had somehow lost it or retained it with a different terminology. If Polynesian creation traditions differentiated according to a phylogeny simi lar to that of Polynesian linguistic traditions, our present method suggests that * Aatea 'Primordial Male' and *Papa 'Primordial Female' were the parents of the first order anthropomorphic gods in the beliefs of the Proto Tahitic speakers and New Zealand Maori Rangi-Aatea was a local development. Tahitian traditions reflect major transformations out of what we would expect for Proto Tahitic on the basis of comparison of New Zealand Maori to Marque san. Some of these transformations appear to have emanated into the Tuamotus and some of the Southern Cooks. Some aspects of these transformations may have been pre-European. Others are clearly influenced by Christianity and there may even be a 'Hindu' influence in the possibility of the Tahitian egg notion developing under the influence of Ellis's questioning after such beliefs. Hawai'ian traditions may be directly inherited from Marquesic or indirectly inherited (borrowed) from Tahitic. Our method cannot distinguish as the vocabulary concerned would be pronounced in the same manner in historic Hawai'ian in either event. The Hawai'ians have only memories of corning from 65 Handy, Polynesian Religion, 104. 66 And so eloquently dismissed by E.E. Evans-Pritchard: 'The comparative method in social anthropology', L.T. Hobhouse Memorial Trust Lecture, University of London, 14 May 1963.</page><page sequence="18">WAS THERE AN EARLY POLYNESIAN 'SKY FATHER'?* 25 Tahiti and this is intimately tied to their cosmogony so there are reasons beyond our method for suspecting a Tahitian element. The naming of the Hawai'ian Primordial Pair is shared with Tahitic rather than Marquesic. But it is also possible that some reconstructions in Table 1 are in error. In the first instance, * Aatea might have been the male of the Primordial Pair as early as Proto Central Eastern times. There are some advantages to this solution. It would mean that Hawai'ian could have inherited that belief from Proto Mar quesic speakers rather than borrowing from Tahitic and it would support the Proto Tahitic * Aatea reconstruction. But there are two disadvantages to this sol ution. One is that it would require the demotion of the Primordial Male to a first order anthropomorphic god in Marquesan and Mangarevan and we have no other example of a male of the Primordial Pair being replaced (more often they are simply forgotten). The other is that it requires the independent naming of the Primordial Male as Papa in Marquesic and Samoan. In the first instance we have no precedence and in the second we cannot suggest a motive. Secondly, we must consider the possibility that language traditions and cre ation traditions did not differentiate along similar phylogentic paths. If not this paper need not have been written. But we have asked what a linguist might say if they did and the result seems more plausible, at least, than the notion that the most ancient beliefs involved a Sky Father who somehow came to take different names everywhere but amongst the New Zealand Maori. Our result suggests no reconstruction of names for the Primordial Pair in Proto Polynesian as the Tongan and Nuclear Polynesian conceptualisations of the Primordial Pair and their names for them are so different. But for Nuclear Polynesian there may have been a situation in which constituents of the earth comprised the Primordial Pair. By Proto Central Eastern Polynesian times the female seems to have been conceived of as the earth itself although it was still called Papa 'rock, stratum'. If the male was thought of as the sky he did not seem to have had the 'Sky' name in PCE, PMQ^or PTA. PCE * Aatea was the deification of the space between the earth and the sky and seems to have been the Primordial Male in PTA. If so, there was a kind of pro gression of naming the male after higher and higher physical elements in the prehistory of New Zealand Maori. Something that was not clearly thought of as a non-terrestrial stratum (PNP *Pajt?a-adj.) came to be thought of as an atmos pheric or celestial stratum but was still named in the old way (PCE *_Pa/w_-adj.) then took on the name of a non-terrestrial stratum (PTA * Aatea) and then took on the name of the sky itself (New Zealand Maori Rangi). Perhaps this is the prehistory of the New Zealand Maori Sky Father Rangi.</page><page sequence="19">26 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY ABSTRACT There is a recurring Polynesian cosmogonic tradition whereby the primordial world was trans formed into the modern world by a series of events often consisting first of vague cosmic beings (whose names and nature are not generally cognate) giving rise to a Primordial Pair who then gave rise to first order anthropomorphic gods. The Primordial Pair in Tonga were 'Seaweed' and 'Sediment/Slime' while in Nuclear Polynesian we find the female named Papa-aA]. and evidence for the male being named Pa/wz-adj. in Proto Nuclear Polynesian and Proto Central Eastern Polynesian as well. These are thought of as physical strata or rock in Samoa while in Central Eastern Polynesia there was commonly the notion that Papa (the female) was the earth itself and that her mate was the sky or the space between the sky and the earth. It was, however, only amongst New Zealand Maori that the male was specifically given the name 'Sky' although an alternative name for the male in the Marquesas is 'Sky Parent' but seems a (lexical) development independent of the N.Z. Maori. SUBSCRIPTION TO JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY IN 1997 With regret the Editors and Board have found it necessary to make some changes to the subscription to The Journal of Pacific History in 1997.
