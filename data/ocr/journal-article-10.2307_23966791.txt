By Albrecht Scriba. Pp. 274. (Forschungen zur Religion und Literatur des Alten und Neuen Testaments, 167.) Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1995. ISBN 3 525 53850 2. DM 98. This work, marginally revised from a 1992 dissertation produced under Egon Brandenburger at the University of Mainz, presents</page><page sequence="2">210 REVIEWS a developmental history of the idea of theophany in ancient Judaism and early Christianity. The author spends virtually no time on the definition of his chosen 'complex of ideas' (Vorstellungskomplex):(Vorstellungskomplex): he identifies the notion of theophany as 'the coming of God or of his appointed representative (e.g. Jesus) from the heavenly world, accompanied by powerful phenomena which lead to reactions of terror on earth or in the cosmos' (p. 9). Chapter two presents a detailed discussion of the component features of this 'complex', with a technical and highly detailed textual discussion of various attendant circumstances and phen omena in what the author considers to be the c. 170 relevant texts (cf. p. 13). The list includes thunderstorms, light, fire, and heav enly armies; the theophany's place of origin and destination; the divine appearance; and celestial and cosmic reactions. Scriba's discussion carefully traces these motifs in their various text forms, paying due attention to any perceptible changes of perspective in the course of transmission. While the texts rarely indicate the origin and purpose of a given theophany tradition, Scriba isolates as primary factors the themes of God's wrath, the demonstration of his superior power, and God's declaration of holy war, and (especially in later texts) judge mentment against his enemies. Acknowledging the difficulties of a form critical study of theophany texts, the author nevertheless proceeds to identify key thematic functions of the basic motif: God's coming involves his intervention in human history; its universally visible cosmic manifestations entail consequences for whole groups, serve to demonstrate God's reality and sovereign power in creation and evoke reactions of fear. Chapter five examines the handling of theophany motifs in the ancient Jewish textual transmission and interpretation of Scripture in the ancient versions. The analysis covers such interpretative phenomena as the removal or re-interpretation of anthropomorph isms and the general trend towards a concentration of the theo phany motif in relation to the revelation at Sinai (to which chapter six devotes special attention) and in the eschaton. Turning to early Christian theophany texts, Scriba first addresses a series of theological motifs and textual techniques. In particular, he notes the influence of John the Baptist's message as well as a number of pre-Pauline traditions about the parousia and final judgement. The same theophanic function is affirmed for the resurrection and eschatological texts in the Fourth Gospel, while the New Testament's 'Maranatha' formula is seen to bear theo phanic significance in a liturgical and eucharistic context. Similar</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 211 connotations, finally, are found in the eschatological interpretation of Scriptural texts such as those used in Mark 13. In the concluding chapter eight, Scriba addresses the fact that early Christian literature uniquely, and almost without exception, replaces the predominant Jewish notion of God's eschatological theophany with the coming of Christ. Several apparent exceptions (i.e., Jewish texts seeming to associate theophanic motifs with the coming of a mediator) are discussed and then dismissed. In the synoptic reference to the Son of Man as God's eschatological representative, Scriba therefore sees a secondary construct formed against the background of the Similitudes of Enoch and possibly 4 Ezra 13. (Jesus, according to this argument, never spoke of the Son of Man: pp. 216 if.) Undeterred even by the acknowledgement that the notion of Christ's parousia is already taken for granted in the letters of Paul, Scriba concludes that the construction of a theophanic Christ in some early Christian circles was the psycho logical result of wanting to maintain, despite the failure of Jesus' mission, that he continued to occupy an instrumental role in God's eschatological plan. The great strength of this volume is its painstaking and lmguis tically competent analysis of texts and versions, and it is for this that scholars will want to turn to it. Scriba has provided a useful and wide-ranging historical compilation of the development of certain theophanic motifs in a range of biblical, intertestamental, and early Christian texts. Unfortunately, however, this work is flawed in a number of respects, regarding both form and substance. Despite claims in the preface that the layout and presentation have been improved, it remains true that Scriba's style seems dense and complex even by German standards. This effect is exacerbated by an outline that to this reviewer seems illogical and poorly constructed, and which the author in any case never justifies or explains to his readers. Over half of the work is in the form of footnotes and excursuses in small print. Instead of a well-shaped overall argu ment, the reader is in some chapters left with a collection of text critical and exegetical scraps (an impression curiously enhanced in being told, e.g., that the summary at the end of chapter five covers only chapters two to four and six: see p. 174, n. 194). The book's accessibility is further impeded by the absence of author or subject indexes (though there is an index of ancient sources). Bibliographical lacunae include the works of R. K. Gnuse and A. Weiser (in the Festschrift for A. Bertholet); one might also have expected to find a representative selection of titles on the subject</page><page sequence="4">212 REVIEWS of divine revelation in the Jewish and Christian literature under review. Scriba skips lightly over the question of definition in the first few pages, and never returns to it: introductory reflections on method and approach might have helped to streamline and give sharper formal definition to what has in some ways turned out a somewhat cluttered study. As it happens, the author concedes on a number of occasions that his detailed formal analysis of texts does not always relate easily to the definitional categories of 'theo phany' (see e.g. pp. ιοί, 106, 122). In the end, he is certainly right to acknowledge the inappropriateness of a form critical approach (pace Jorg Jeremias); but this reviewer, for one, is then left to wonder whether the remaining conclusions really amount to much of particular substance or significance. Unless of course one could agree with the author (and with certain Californians) on the need to rescue Jesus from the parousia of the Son of Man. But it would be unfair to expect of a published dissertation more than what it is supposed to offer: viz., an original piece of research that demonstrates the author's competent handling of the tools of his trade. Seen in these terms, Scriba has certainly succeeded; and his careful textual studies will prove useful to specialists working in related areas. Μ. Bockmuehl</page></plain_text>
