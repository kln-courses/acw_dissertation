<plain_text><page sequence="1">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher BY NICK LYONS M y first publishing interview was with the editor of a skin maga- zine. I got the man's name from my stepfather, from whom I had been estranged for ten years; he had swiped my mother's little insurance brokerage and I remembered, from summer work there, that he had a few clients with the words publisher or publication in their corpo- rate name. I knew no one else who had any connection to that world. The editor's office walls were papered with overlapping photographs of women who lacked clothes and preferred contortionist positions. The man himself weighed at least four hundred pounds, had thin hair greased and flat against his skull, and dressed like a thrift shop with an unsnugged tie; as I entered, he deftly putted a golf ball thirty feet across his office rug and into a device shaped like a vagina. I thought of my four infant children and all the unpaid bills and dunning threats, and of Austin Warren, the great ascetic scholar un- der whom I had written my doctoral dissertation on an obscure New England poet who believed that his poems had been dictated to him by the Holy Spirit. So committed was Jones Very to this belief that when R. W. Emerson-who edited the first collection of Very's po- ems -wanted to change a letter here, a comma there, Very refused to let him do so. The poems were not his to change. This led the great dry Transcendentalist to utter one of his rare witticisms: "Cannot the Spirit parse and spell?" Since my dissertation was an edition of Very's poems, I had wrestled for many months with the same errant dictation from the Divine Afflatus. I was thirty-two, I had been a full-time professor of English at Hunter College for three years, starting at $100 per week, and I needed a second job. I was mad for literature and lit by the prospect of sharing</page><page sequence="2">754 The Antioch Review my passion with the young for the rest of my life; I did not consider giving up the classroom-nor did I for twenty-odd more years. But I was desperate. Jones Very might think that "The hand and foot that stir not, they shall find / Sooner than all the rightful place to go," but I needed a job sooner than that and a more aggressive approach to salvation. But the skin route just seemed too bumpy for me. I could not do it. Randomly, I decided that regular trade-book publishing -if I could squeeze open a door- was probably a wiser compromise. I had no book or editing experience, and no knowledge of who published what, so I simply made a list of 103 book publishers in the Hunter College library and wrote to them all. Only Herbert Mi- chelman, editor-in-chief at Crown Publishers, responded. He told me I could start the next day on a two-week trial. On the third Wednesday, a few days beyond the trial period, I met him in the men's room, asked if I were supposed to stay on, he nodded, and I did, for sixteen years. The first thing I noted about this book publishing was that Rebel Rook- ie and The Negligent Doctor were not Melville. I felt like an outsider then and still had a touch of that feeling when I left the publishing world. Though I have a degree from the Wharton School, I am not a natural businessman; my shape shift to literature, and ten years of obsessive reading, may have fixed that. And my critical affections lie with older work; frankly, I never grew comfortable with that odd tug between author and editor, across the range of talent. At Crown I was assigned a manuscript by a famous general's son who would not change one of a hundred lines like his unforgettable "And then they began the foreplay." He was the supreme example of absolute artistic integrity without a trace of talent, almost as if he (like Jones Very) believed someone else had dictated the book. Crown was a freewheeling arena and I tried to make a place for myself in it, and within the industry, rewriting a lot of the mediocre books that came their way in those days, trying to learn this new trade, find worthwhile books from the unsolicited piles and from agents, edit with the hand of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, save authors from themselves and maximize their strengths and find the best way of bringing them into the world; I also wanted a list all mine and chose the little specialized world of fly-fishing, about which I was passion- ate. Every afternoon at 5:10, so I could get to my 5:40 class, I'd race up to Hunter, though once a term, as if I was in a Kafka parable, the</page><page sequence="3">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 755 Lexington Avenue subway skipped Sixty-eighth and Seventy-seventh streets and ended on Eighty-sixth, and my classroom would be empty by the time I got there. I held both jobs full time for sixteen years, became full professor and executive editor, and managed to write fif- teen books of my own and several hundred articles during that period. What energy I had then! II Crown was run by Nat Wartels, the founder, who had a cherubic face, white hair, and a desk notorious for its piles of papers on which he left old checks, contracts, orders, legal briefs, lit cigarettes, and what-not else. He could pluck what he needed from the pile without hesitation; the pile, several feet high, was pock-marked with cigarette burms. He had begun as Outlet Books, buying remainder stock from other pub- lishers, and when the remaindered books sold well at the lower prices, he reprinted them as Bonanza, promotional books in hardcover. Then he began original publishing, Crown, with the fail-safe back-up of be- ing able to remainder a book to himself for two dollars that had cost him one dollar to produce. The editor David McDowell remarked one day at an editorial meeting, in his great Southern drawl, when some- one said a book would eventually make a terrific promotional reprint, that "Crown still sucks the hind teat of Bonanza Books." Nat would buy up failed or failing small presses over lunch, use them for tax write-offs, sell off a few titles, remainder a lot, put a few into the Crown line. In the bowels of one Crown warehouse were the residues of some of the great moribund small publishers, Covici Frede, How- ell &amp; Soskin, Derrydale, and many others. Clark Potter's company, Clarkson N. Potter, he kept, and it eventually flourished and is now a strong, distinct part of Random House; Clark once told me that with all else he had lost-his inheritance, the family's salt farm in Rhode Island -he'd also lost the use of his name for the rest of his life. When I started my own house, I always had that graveyard in mind as a des- tiny to avoid like a swamp. Nat was a hard negotiator, quietly ruthless with innocent authors, and I once had to tell the teenage Leonard Mal- tin to get a good lawyer; the tough lawyer-agent Mort Janklow called Nat one of the nicest, fairest guys in book publishing, but that's like asking a wolf to comment on another wolf, and not asking the opinion of the rabbit. When I became executive editor, jacket copy for a new Robin</page><page sequence="4">756 The Antioch Review Moore book came across my desk and I saw this phrase on the back ad: "People are saying . . ." and then a series of short modest com- ments, like "The best war novel since War and Peace," "No one since Hemingway understands courage better," "Robin Moore cap- tures the emotions so well he reminds me of William Shakespeare." I went into Nat's office and said I didn't think we should put the jacket through. He frowned. Could he at least give me some sources that I could check? He said I should put it through as typeset. He said: "I'm a people, aren't I?" A "word of mouth book" was one of his favor- ite marketing campaign slogans. An author who had published half a dozen books with Crown told me: "By this he means: an underling takes a copy of the book out the back door of the Avenel warehouse, waves it around for thirty seconds, and if no one starts talking puts it back on the shelf." I'd edited a fishing book by Robert Traver, a.k.a. John Voelker, the great judge who wrote Anatomy of a Murder, and when he told me that Hemingway's sister Sunny was a friend and that she had a manuscript about her brother but hated New York and would not send it to me, Nat said, "Fly out and grab it." The old judge, already pickled in bourbon at noon, drove us from Petoskey to the famous Hemingway family cottage on Walloon Lake, near which all the Nick Adams stories are centered. It was a clear, sharp October day, with the poplars bright yel- low, and I recognized the place at once; I even saw the initials "EH" carved into the outhouse door. No more than a minute after I met her, Sunny said, "John, I want to speak to you!" They went outside togeth- er and I heard Sunny's brash cold voice say, "He's a Jew," and then the good liberal judge's quiet reassuring tones. She was a deliciously awful person -large, mannish, with big breasts, a straight back, and over-active arrogant glands -and she kept, as the unifying design in her house, hundreds of plastic and porcelain fornicating frogs. In mid-afternoon she grabbed a shotgun and fired point blank at a fellow running his motorboat too fast, too near the dock. She had typed A Farewell to Arms but was not shy of admitting that she had not read it or anything else by her brother except "Soldier's Home," in which she was the good sister. She had written only three or four pages of the alleged book (mostly arguing that Ernest had not slept with Prudence, the Ojibway girl, based on the irrefutable evidence that Pru would have told her), and toward the end of that long day she made a point of showing me a row of trees planted by the mother, Grace, at the birth of each of her six children. Two of them were now stumps. "Dutch elm?"</page><page sequence="5">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 757 I asked. "No," she said, "they were Ursula's and Marceline's trees. We had a fight and I cut them down." The stumps, I think, were warnings. I can still see them, breaking the neat row, screaming. Nat worked late; I called him that evening and said, "There's nothing there. And she's a flaming anti-Semite." Nat asked: "Does she have pictures?" When I told him that she had all the family pho- tograph albums, including Ernest's, he said, "Get the photos, we'll make a book." Ernie-a name Hemingway despised-came out nine months later, and Crown got the new author an interview with Gene Shallit on The Today Show. Sunny waited until the camera panned to her, then extracted from a large knitting bag a pair of scissors the size of pruning sheers and advanced on Shallit, who lurched backward. She insisted on cutting off a lock of his curly hair for her friends back in Michigan before she'd say a word. The book proved Nat's theory that anything whatsoever about Van Gogh, sex, or Hemingway would make money: the dreadful little thing sold 18,000 copies. III And then a press of my own. Twenty years ago, Timothy Benn, a British publisher, came to me and asked if I'd start a subsidiary for him in the colonies, to be called Nick Lyons Books. I was still teaching full time at Hunter, which had lately demanded that I go to consulting status with Crown. I began, with the British funding, on my dining-room table, and called myself a consultant to myself. I signed a ten-book contract to produce books for Doubleday -as a packager, a word I'd never heard before and did not much like. The books would all be in the field of outdoor-leisure sport, primarily fly-fishing. I used freelancers for production matters and did everything else myself. I rarely met schedules, the books sold far fewer copies than the Doubleday computers had predicted they would sell, and four years later, when I had produced some fifty books for them, Winchester, Norton, and Schocken, I was about to quit, out of frustration with myself, the companies, the whole set-up. Then Timothy Benn, chairman of the hundred-year-old Benn Group, was summarily discharged and I was advised that the subsidiary would be sold. I told them flatly that there was nothing to sell. The books had all been placed with publishers, I was the only asset, and I didn't put much value on myself and would not be sold. Malcolm Lowe, a lay preacher in the Church of England, came to negotiate with me; he</page><page sequence="6">758 The Antioch Review had instigated Timothy's dismissal. He was a tall, starchy man, darkly dressed, and put two small Bibles on the table when we began to ne- gotiate. For support, I kept trotting out phantom accountants and law- yers who would not let me do this or that. In the end I bought myself cheap, which was what I was worth, along with two used desks and the rights to a lot of books owned by others. I raised $100,000 from seven trusting friends with whom I fished and they signed documents that they had a whole lot of money and were prepared to lose all they'd invested. At the end of that first year they nearly had. I had sent out a release after I became independent, quoting Jim in Huckleberry Finn: "Ah owns myself -and ah's wo'th $900." By the end of that year the figure was less than zero. Welcome to independent publishing. All the old support systems from my Crown and Benn days were gone-receptionists, first read- ers, editorial committees, copy-editors, designers, production wizards, marketing teams, salesmen, billers, a rights department, people to col- lect money and compute royalties and pay them, accountants, and a host of other experts. There was no one to tell me what to do, or how; there was no one to blame. What to do? My friend Garth Battista, who runs Breakaway Books out of his home in Halcottsville, New York, does it all him- self-editing, composition, design, all sales except trade distribution. I could not. I was over fifty and technologically a dinosaur. I had taken a junior partner, Peter Burford, and now hired an entry-level young turk to do everything that we did not want to do; I "unpackaged" my- self by raising more money from some of those same trusting friends (one sent a check for $25,000 on his way to South America, with the note, "If you need more, call Joan"); and I bought back the fifty books I'd sold to other publishers- something few if any former packagers have done. I hired an outside sales consultant, who attached us to five sales rep groups, instead of using a distribution company, so we could control all sales; I built a team of freelancers to copy-edit, proofread, design, and got full-time employees for these positions as we could afford them. My daughter Jenny helped collect money and sold rights part time. My sons Paul, Charles, and Tony helped as they could, usu- ally arranging the endless index cards I obsessively kept of potential accounts for fifteen years. I didn't learn to use a computer until years later. I saw at once that a small independent press was not just a small version of a big house but an entity all its own, and that all small</page><page sequence="7">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 759 presses are -or should be -sui generis. What, exactly, should Nick Lyons Books be? I kept the focus on outdoor leisure sport, building what I thought was the country's finest fly-fishing list, partly on the assumption that I wanted to be better than the big houses in at least one area. When a fishing friend put me in touch with Rita Gam, the actress with the great name, I thought we might have a chance to spread our wings, become general trade publishers. Rita was in her late fifties, had acted only sporadically in recent years, and several times I made the mistake of introducing her as the star of The Thief with Ray Milland-"You know, that silent movie." She was a great blast of fresh air after all those Quill Gordons and No-Hackle duns. We were able to get her onto The Today Show not long after her former roommate, Grace Kelly, was killed; she had a chapter on Grace in her book, Actress to Actress. Jane Pauley had agreed not to ask Rita about Grace, but the third question was the big sandbag-who did Grace sleep with? Rita said politely that she would not comment about that. "Oh, come on," Pauley persisted, but Rita just smiled and steadfastly said no, winning my undying admiration. So thirty seconds into the interview, from the wings, I saw Pauley call for a break and then motion with her hand to have Rita hauled off with a crooked cane. One of our first books was Uneeda Review with the subtitle "Like a Hole in the Head," a parody of a literary magazine. It featured an article by "Otis Sistrunk," the football player, called "The Poem as an Action of Field," and a poem by Emily Dickinson in the Noron Reader section that began, "The soul selects her own Sorority - / Then - shuts the Dorm -" Every graduate student in the country was sure to buy a copy. The back ad, for a writer's conference, proclaimed, "Work Under a Writer of Your Own Choice," and listed in bold type twenty famous literary figures who (as the footnote confessed in seven-point type) had been invited. "No hassles. No tension. No bad criticism," the ad continued. How could the book fail? We put a full-page adver- tisement in the Publication of the Modern Language Association and got precisely one order- from (bless her) Margaret Atwood. Despite a glowing Publishers Weekly review, the book got two miniscule notices nationwide and sold only 527 copies for an awful lot of work. One of the sales reps told me that the world did not need another small general trade publisher, that we should stick to our niche; but we thought there was a way to segue into deeper waters and did so by seeking the lit'ry edges of the niche, where it bled into natural</page><page sequence="8">760 The Antioch Review history, adventure, and personal memoir. It was exciting to find a dozen fine new -or almost new -young writers. We published David Quammen's Natural Acts, his first collection of natural history essays; Verlyn Klinkenborg's first book, Making Hay; W. D. Wetherell's Ver- mont River, which had been rejected by half a dozen publishers; Jon Krakauer's first book, Eiger Dreams; Janet Lembke's brilliant River Time; Eddy L. Harris's edgy Mississippi Solo -the memoir of a young black man who (to paraphrase a friend of his) canoed the Mississippi from Minnesota, where no one had seen anyone who looked like him, through the South, where they wouldn't much like him. It was exhilarating, and we found unique ways to sell so many copies of such books that, in our third year, we got a front-page write- up in the Wall Street Journal, noting that no other publisher the writer had ever heard of could have sold a couple of dozen copies of a liter- ary book called Making Hay through the Napa auto parts store in Wy- zata, Minnesota. Bill Wolfsthal, our brash young sales manager, had even gotten a Scribner's window display on Fifth Avenue, using four bales of hay he had bought upcountry. He waited with a camera for something to happen and, when a Hasid with a black hat and ringlets paused, puzzled, he got a photograph of the scene and sent it across country with the caption, "Oy, hay." The release and photograph were picked up by thirty-two newspapers. Since I was the only person in the little house who knew that Paraleptophlebia was not a foot fungus, I read every manuscript even faintly connected to fly-fishing that came in. Sometimes there were as many as a thousand a year; you would have thought that everyone who ever cast a line had a book in his creel. I once even had a fellow wade out to me in the middle of the Yellowstone River with a telltale manila envelope in his hands and have long regretted that I didn't just say, "Oops," and drop it in the drink. My daughter, who became a literary agent, was once given an opportunity to look at a manuscript for a seven-hundred-page novel by her dentist, who had a nasty little power tool in his hand at the time; her mouth wide open, she could only nod painfully that it was an offer she could not refuse. Once I said, in a long front-page article I wrote for the New York Times Book Review, that I read everything that came my way, myself, and always tried to make a helpful comment or two. What a dumbbell! I traced 1,064 manuscripts to that article, from which I was unable to accept one. Though we paid minute advances, a number of agents came to us with books they couldn't place elsewhere. I remember the late John</page><page sequence="9">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 761 Cushman apologizing profusely for sending me Bear Attacks by Ste- phen Herrero, a friend of one of his best authors, a man with a dying son. No one would have it. We were his last hope. It was a splendid book on the subject and the press eventually sold more copies of it than there are bears in the universe. IV The essential ingredient for a small house to flourish is the books it chooses to publish, and the strength of NLB, which became Lyons &amp; Burford and then The Lyons Press, was always the particular mix of books we pub lished. Part of our strategy had always been to republish older books, in a mulch with the best new practical and literary books we could find. Our accountant recommended a 1950s book, long out of print, called The Long Walk by Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish lieutenant who escaped from a Soviet gulag with six others and walked across the Gobi desert and over the Himalayas. At last count The Lyons Press had sold 275,000 copies of the old book and it had been optioned for the movies twice. We republished six flagrantly anthropomorphic 1950s books by the naturalist John Crompton, long forgotten by the world, got major reviews, and went through five or six printings of each. Half a dozen old fly-fishing authors got new lives when we published their books after they had been remaindered decades earlier, which made me feel we could do that uniquely: conserve good books, rarely remainder any, keep them in print until the next flood. We learned dozens of strategies for resurrecting such books and for keeping them in print, at a time when larger houses were told by accountants to clean the bins every six months. Suddenly we were a business with fifteen or sixteen employees, who depended upon us for a paycheck, and-except for that first year, miraculously-we were always profitable. Our accountant-an old roommate of mine who flew in seven times a year from California to handle our financial matters-explained cash flow to this aging Eng- lish professor, and the need for inventory control, and taxes, telling me why you could have a profit and no money in the bank to pay the IRS, who would not accept their cut in copies of Uneeda Review. He explained why a great small press like North Point, which had two best-sellers (West with the Night and Son of the Morning Star) could lose more than $1 million a year on gross sales of only several million, and eventually be unsaleable; how expanding on the assumption that</page><page sequence="10">762 The Antioch Review these best-sellers could fund future growth, then not having additional best-sellers to take their place, and, with a double-whammy, getting the great tide of returns, was fatal. "But they do wonderful books," I protested, and he merely smiled an accountant's knowing smile. Outdoor leisure sport expanded for us to include all sports and natural history and then literary essays faintly related to natural his- tory and sport, which led to books on all upcountry matters and cook- ing, gardening, crafts, adventure, climbing, camping, military matters, horses, dogs, collecting, fitness, art, homesteading, Western affairs, and much else, in a kind of constellation of loose niches that had some unity, at least to me, even with the inclusion of three books of poetry and a growing number of novels. I did not do another book by an actress, nor another literary parody, but by the time a big-time agent snubbed me by referring to another house as being real publishers, we were publishing eighty books a year, had four or five hundred in print, and most niches blurred into general trade. We kept refining our host of cheap, pin-pointed, aggressive, ob- sessive marketing techniques, and they worked-most of the time. I wrote thousands of personal letters on my Underwood standard type- writer, to reviewers and dealers and wholesalers and columnists and auto parts stores. I decided to do more books at a time when most houses were doing fewer- to develop new areas, spread our risk, have more books that earned a little money and the chance that a few might earn a lot. It was not a tight, uniformly distinguished list, but every list had a few fine new authors, and we became solidly profitable; at a time when the major publishers were earning one or two percent net profit, if any, we regularly earned fifteen to twenty-six percent. The problem with fine new authors, of course, whose stock you have pushed so high, is that they are often ambitious fine new authors. It is gut-wrenching, after writing endless letters to the world, "We're pub- lishing this brilliant young author. You don't know him yet but he is the most ... and the ... and is sure to be the next... ." and then to get good sales and have the prominent reviews come in-earned by the book itself, but perhaps not overlooked because of your letters -and you get a bit jittery but remain confident that face to face and in a dozen letters these folks have promised to stand with you until they drop: and then, poof, they're gone. One agent said they were going to hold out paperback rights to her young genius's next book. After a day</page><page sequence="11">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 763 or so I decided, well at least we have the hardcover of this bright fel- low we've urged from obscurity, and I called to say, "Okay, it's a lousy thing but . . ." and she said that she and her boy had decided to pull the hardcover, too. I never heard from the man again. He was a great writer he might at least have written me a brief note. Several went to Knopf; Jon Krakauer went on to much higher things; several never looked back; a few did; "out of courtesy," one had his new agent send me his proposal after the auction for his sec- ond book was over. Friends said I should be proud of my eye; I should understand. And I did. But it hurt like hell being merely the first-book publisher, the perpetual stepping-stone, the Danny Rose. Years later an editor at a large house told my daughter that he always watched our list carefully for authors to swipe, and he in fact poached two. Young employees we'd trained from their first days in publishing left, too, for the big places, the bigger game. Against all that, we found many prominent authors, mature and at the height of their fame, who were happy to publish with us -not their primary work, perhaps, but smaller books about their passions. Tom McGuane did a wonderful book for us on horses, Jay Mclnnerny one on his passion for wine; we republished Le Anne Schreiber's haunting Midstream and her original Light Years; we published Ted Hoagland's Tigers &amp; Ice and a spate of his older essay collections. We did fifty or sixty of these, including old and new books by Annick Smith, John Graves, Joy Williams, Rick Bass, Gavin Maxwell, George Plimpton, Niko Tinbergen, S. J. Perelman, Richard Ellis, and a host of others. Some, like the McGuane, sold exceptionally well, and all brought us a kind of broad serious attention of which a small publisher can never get enough. V And then suddenly I was sixty-five, with two brand-new titanium hips, spooked by an exploded gall bladder, my young partner announcing that he'd like to start his own house, and my memory beginning to slip. I told an old friend to write me a severe letter about the ship- ping problems he'd had with us, and I'd circulate it to the appropriate people. Nothing happened, I completely forgot our conversation, and then, a month or so later, I got a savage letter from him complaining of this and that shipping mishap. I got livid. I dashed off a more sav- age letter to him, asking him how he got off, after our long and cordial</page><page sequence="12">764 The Antioch Review friendship, writing me a letter like that. He did not respond. Then, a full week or so later, I vaguely remembered. When one author, after three years of delays, during which time he'd written a couple of books for other publishers, submitted a book called Life List, about all the birds he'd seen in his lifetime, and there were only a couple of dozen birds treated, I blew up. "Well, let's say it's half a book," he quipped, "so I'll only take half the advance." My nerves had frayed and I was increasingly ill-tempered and caustic, and I shouted back that he'd better get a lawyer: I wouldn't buy half a bridge. Our art director came in one day and blithely told me, "The bad news is that we've lost two sheets of original slides from a stock photo house and they've billed us for $86,000. But the good news," she said brightly, "is that we have five years to pay." My solution to that prob- lem at that time would have been to go out for a second lunch. But I had brought my youngest son, Tony, into the business and Tony was a lawyer. So I turned the problem over to him. Two days later he told me it was all resolved; it was their fault; and he had found a way to bill them for several thousand dollars. I quickly calculated that the difference between us was $88,000 plus the cost of a second lunch. And regularly he saved me from my greatest nemesis: one too many authors with an ego as big as the Ritz, writers who would never die of unrequited self love. So I turned the business over to him and crossed my fingers. I did so even after a dozen friends sternly warned me to re-read King Lear carefully before I made my decision final. Tony was differ- ent and forceful and sales driven, and I knew I would have to let him have his head. After a few feeble efforts to do otherwise, I sat back and rooted for him and the company-and like a good old father, didn't speak unless spoken to. The rest of the Lyons Press story is his to tell someday, but, after a couple of years I felt less like Lear than Anchises, carried from the sacked city of Troy on the shoulders of his son Aeneas. Tony published two hundred books a year, tripled the size of the business in three years, increased its profitability, and then, a few years ago, negotiated a decent sale. Some months after the sale I called Bruce Harris, an old friend from Crown days and then president of Workman Publishing, and he said: "Ah, it's Nick Lyons, the man who did everything wrong and came up with the roses."</page><page sequence="13">Confessions of a Reluctant Publisher 765 And so, forty years have passed since I brooded about a poorly schooled Holy Spirit and whether my fate had to include all those nude young women in erotic poses. I was a reluctant publisher to the end but was always intrigued by the parliament of skills needed for the task. It was exciting and freewheeling, as far from academia as you could get, nerve-wracking, earthy, and robust. It also required a good measure of luck. Much of the time I seriously doubted I could survive. So many small independent book publishers don't, though I am convinced that they are the hope of the industry. The most exciting part of it all, always, was discovering in a just-opened envelope some words that danced and wisdom I could bet would last. Never a Melville, but some of it has.</page></plain_text>
