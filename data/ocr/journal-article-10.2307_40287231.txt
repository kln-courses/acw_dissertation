<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moulding and casting Aboriginal carved trees Gordon Grimwade1, Karen Mickan2 and Alison Darroch3 The documentation, conservation and interpretation of isolated cultural heritage sites present diverse challenges. In the wet tropics of northeast Australia (Fig. 1) these challenges are exacerbated by adverse climatic conditions. Organic materials suffer severely in such conditions. Abor- iginal carved trees of the wet tropics are little known re- sources of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area extending north from Townsville to just south of Cooktown. Their documentation and research has been minimal. Forestry officers and site recorders have provided brief descriptions of such trees over the past forty or so years. In 1988 a report was commissioned by the (then) Depart- 1 Cultural Heritage Consultant, PO Box 9, Yungaburra, QLD 4872, Australia. 2 Preparator, Queensland Museum, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia. 3 Archaeologist, Cairns, QLD 4870, Australia.

The need for, and the difficulties of devising, suitable manage- ment strategies was discussed in that report. In 1991 the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage commissioned a series of further studies (Grim- wade 1992a and 1992b). One of die aims was to develop a process of detailed site recording using appropriate repli- cation methods. Initial enquiries indicated latex moulds would probably be most suitable. Resource Consulting Services Pty Ltd, in conjunction with the Queensland Museum, subsequently used a process for casting replicas of tree carvings which are either in ex- cellent condition or suffering minimal surface decay. Carv- ings on rotting timber are not recommended for such a process unless the Aboriginal owners expressly request replication to be undertaken and the consent of the appro- priate authorities is obtained. The recording process can be reasonably successful but is likely to remove loose bark and mosses which are later transferred to the first cast Soft bark and decomposed areas are most likely to be re- moved in the case of treatment of specimens in poor con- dition. Damage is likely. Although costly consolidation methods may be possible the risk remains high. The technical process is necessarily allied with various social and management requirements. Traditional owner and government approvals are essential. While it is now widely accepted Aboriginal traditional owners must be con- sulted on such issues, there is the additional requirement to obtain government approval where cultural sites are in- volved. Depending on location this may involve several departments or authorities. In the Wet Tropics of Queens- land World Heritage Area, for example, we required a Cul- tural Heritage Branch permit for research and a Queens- land Forestry Service permit to enter a state forest or a National Parks Research Permit for studies within Nation- al Parks. In addition we advised the Wet Tropics Man- agement Agency of the proposed work: at the time they relied on the permit systems imposed by other agencies. It will be shown that provided each step is taken with due regard to administrative, environmental, social, logis- tical and technical constraints the result can be highly re- warding. Importantly the site remains virtually unscathed and in situ while a replica is available for further research and/or display. In this paper those issues are discussed and a methodology presented to assist others who may see opportunity to apply a similar approach to their particular recording needs. Geering et al. (1991:42) have pointed out the problems of loss of carved trees in New South Wales. Of the 'thou- sands of carved trees extant inl918 only seventy eight re- mained by 1980* (Geering: pers. comm.) of which less than a third are still living1 (Geering et al. 1991:42). In the Wet Tropics of Queensland the problem is even greater. In 1989 analysis of records identified seventeen sites com- prising twenty one carved trees (Resource Consulting Ser- vices 1990:13). Of these trees ten were located; one had been felled and the carving (in sections) deposited with the Queensland Museum; five have yet to be re-discovered and five have probably been destroyed through natural decay or by cyclonic activity. Finding a specific tree in dense rainforest with few vis- ible reference points offers challenges in itself. Locational data are generally fairly inaccurate. Trials were conducted using small portable Global Positioning System (GPS) re- corders. These proved unsuitable in dense rainforest as they were unable to receive strong enough satellite signals to provide readings. The sites located were generally found to have deterio- rated markedly since they had last been viewed: in some cases amateur photographic evidence provided endorse- ment. Carved tree loss in the wet tropics can generally be attributed to cyclone damage, natural decay, scar tissue healing, insect attack and clearing. While the Queensland Forestry Service has adopted a positive attitude towards leaving carved trees in situ there were undoubtedly many other trees lost when widespread clearance occurred on the Atherton Tableland early in the twentieth century. Two trees were selected for further recording and con- servation. Their selection was unashamedly based upon: 1. accessibility, 2. designs, 3. willingness by Aboriginal groups to have the work undertaken, 16 Australian Archaeology, Number 41 , 1995</page><page sequence="3">Grimwade et al. 4. diversity of tree morphology, and 5. minimal decay/disease. A Ravenshoe base enabled the field team to spend four days in the field working on a site (site A) IS kms south of the town and a second site (site B) SO kms further south. Vehicle access was within 30 m of site A and, by Forestry road, to within 600 m of site B. Accordingly portability of equipment was only a concern at site B where access was along a steep winding, often obscure, route in dense rain- forest Site A, a black walnut (Endiandra palmerstonii) com- prised a large 1.1 m by 0.33 m abstract geometric design carved into the bark of a buttress root some 2.S m high and 1.5 m long at the base (Fig. 2). In contrast site B was in the bark of the tree trunk of a northern silky oak (Card- wellia sublimis) and extended 1 m vertically from a point 0.9 m above ground level. It was a distinctive zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figure (either a lizard or, more likely, a male human) (Fig. 3). Two meetings were held with Ravenshoe Aboriginal com- munity representatives. They gave their whole-hearted Figure 2 An abstract design carved into the buttress of a black wal- nut (Endiandra palmerstonii) in the Wet Tropics of Queens- land World Heritage Area south of Ravenshoe, northeast Queensland. The carving stands 1.1 m high and was the subject of a National Estate Grant Program grant to docu- ment such sites using latex and fibreglass moulding and casting techniques. (Photo: R.

Cooper) support for the project although, unfortunately, none were available to participate in the actual moulding. At our initial meeting we outlined our earlier research and iden- tified the sites on which we preferred to work for various reasons. Only a couple of former forestry workers woe aware of any carved trees within clan territory. This was unfortunate from an ethnographic point of view as it af- forded limited opportunity to fit these fascinating cultural symbols in their social context. At that meeting we were given in principle approval to proceed. We chose how- ever, to leave the idea with the group to discuss privately before a return visit a couple of weeks later. At that meet- ing we were given the necessary consent The majority of extant carvings examined in the wet tropics are carved on the trunks of trees. As noted above our selected samples comprised one such tree and one with buttress roots. The former, a northern silky oak (Cord- wellia sublimis), and the latter, a black walnut (Endiandra palmerstonii) provided examples of both different form and different flora covering them. The Cardwellia sub- limis was covered in thick moss on its eastern side while the Endiandra palmerstonii was coated in lichens. Both had small areas of disease which not only made their recording by this method all the more pressing but pro- vided practical opportunities to devise methodologies to minimise damage. Australian Archaeology, Number 41,1 995 1 7</page><page sequence="4">Moulding and Casting Aboriginal Carved Trees Latex moulding techniques are widely used in museum preparation, taxidermy and display work (Cappel 1974). Their application in field conditions is not as widely prac- ticed but the Queensland Museum gained significant ex- perience in this area during preparation of their diorama on rainforest Aboriginal traditional life. It was on this experience we proposed to build. Moulding Moulding equipment Field application of this particular moulding technique requires the following equipment: Respirators or dust masks, approximately 10 cheap paint brushes 25-50 mm, cheesecloth, rubber gloves, gardening/ industrial gloves, water drum (20 It) and small S It con- tainers, plastic sheeting, packing tape, overalls/protective clothing, latex, PVA, resin, hardener, acetone, fibreglass mat, hand brush, measuring cup (graduated in ces), wooden board approximately 40x40 cm, plastic containers (old ice-cream containers are ideal). Safety Rubber gloves should be worn when handling chemi- cals. Gardening or welding gloves are advised for han- dling cured moulds. Respirators or face masks should be worn when working with resin and fibreglass mat. Fumes, fine dust and fibre are, respectively, problems when using these materials. Safety glasses or goggles should be used when handling hardener. Long sleeved clothing or over- alls and suitable headgear should be worn when applying latex and resin soaked fibre glass mats. Uncured latex is washable in water. Cured latex is particularly difficult to remove from hair! Ensure containers are firmly closed when not in use to avoid spillage or the risk of local fauna sampling the contents. Moulding process Preparation: Chemicals are best transferred to S It contain- ers for ease of use on site. They should be capable of seal- ing tightly to prevent spillage and inadvertent drying of the contents. Motor oil style containers are suitable but must be scrupulously clean if they are being recycled. Fibreglass mat should be cut into useable pieces before sitework commences. Pieces about A4 size (30 x 20 cm) are ideal. Smaller mats are mere accurately spread on rough or indented surfaces. Tools and other equipment are readily transportable in rucksacks if the site is remote from vehicle access. Water should be included if there is no readily available water nearby. DO NOT wash out brushes, containers etc. in creeks. Sitework: An initial photograph should be taken before any sitework commences. On completion the carving should again be photographed, preferably from a similar location on each occasion, to document the inevitable, but minor, changes to the surface as a result of the moulding process. Usually this will involve removal of some of the lichens and flakes of bark. A clear working area is required on any site. Plastic sheeting may be used to protect the understorey vegetation. Leaf litter and loose soil should be swept from the foot of the area to be cast. A test strip should be applied initially on an unobtru- sive part of the tree. At least three coats of latex and cheesecloth should be applied for the test strip. The amount of organic material removed should be appraised. Work on the main area should only proceed if there is minimal risk of damage. Thorough examination of the carving and the adjacent area to be moulded should then proceed. Identify vulner- able areas which are loose, decayed or otherwise damaged. Latex is liable to remove such areas unless they are suita- bly protected. Methods to provide adequate protection in- clude cotton wool padding or leaving the area clear of la- tex. Thin plastic film (e.g. GLAD® Wrap) may be spread over these areas before fibreglass matting is applied. In determining the area to be moulded consider not only sensitive areas but the potential for display and the need to adequately reflect the setting. That is, if the carv- ing is on the trunk ensure there is sufficient area covered to identify this element in a display setting. Likewise, if the carving is on a buttress root, it is important that enough of the root is moulded to adequately demonstrate this feature. Consider too the overall dimensions of the finished product: transport is an important consideration. Latex is applied by brush, or compressor if available, to the selected area. Brushes should be kept in water when not in use. Ensure latex is continuous across the area. Latex dries from a milky colour to almost translucent. An area of 3 m2 can take about IS minutes to cover. Second and third coats should be applied once the earlier coat is dry. Temperature and, particularly, humidity affect drying time. In die rainforest a drying time of at least an hour is not unusual. Once the third coat is tacky, cheesecloth should be pressed over the latex. The most suitable is available in rolls from leading manchester and haberdashery stores. It is normally available in 'tubular* form. A single thickness is all that is required to reinforce most moulds. A liberal fourth coat of latex should be worked into the cloth and allowed to dry, preferably overnight A layer of PVA is then applied to avoid bonding of the latex to the fibreglass. This should be allowed to dry for 2- 3 hours. The resin, with added hardener, is then applied to the previously prepared pieces of fibreglass mat. It is prefer- able if one person in suitable protective clothing coats each mat. The dry pieces of fibreglass should be placed on the wooden board and the resin worked gently into them using a paint brush. Saturated mats can be piled on top of each other until used. The amount of hardener mixed with the resin determines the drying period; to expedite drying time use a greater proportion of hardener. Remember the cur- ing process will generate substantial amounts of heat. Resin soaked pieces of mat are progressively applied over the PVA coated latex by one or more operators (Fig. 4). These mats should be pressed on to the surface with the brush bristles and, if necessary, with the handle to ensure they adequately contour the latex. Mats should overlap each other for maximum strength. 18 Australian Archaeology , Number 41 , 1995</page><page sequence="5">Grimwade et al. Figura 4 After the Iberal coatings with latex which have cured overnight a fibreglass outer case is applied. Note the use of face masks and rubber gloves. (Photo: R. Cooper) Large flatter areas may need reinforcement. This can be done by applying rolls of impregnated mat over the basic mat or by encasing saplings or flexible metal strips in fibreglass wrappings and pasting these to the basic mat with more fibreglass and resin. As fibreglass flexes slightly it is necessary to ensure several reference points are marked and the width of the Figure 5 Rudimentary callipers were developed 'on-site' using a pair of ranging poles bound in the middle. Spot marks on the fibreglass outer coat ensured the final cast was of similar physical shape to the original. (Photo: R. Cooper) mould at those points recorded before removal from the tree. Large callipers may be suitable in some situations. A reasonably accurate alternative is to tie two ranging poles together at their centrepoints. In our fieldwork we tied two 2 m long ranging poles at the 1 m mark (Fig. 5). When the tips were placed against the fibreglass the space between the other ends was measured, a felt pen was used to mark the relevant reference points and the distance noted alongside those marks. Once back in the laboratory it was a simple matter of setting up the mould and measur- ing the internal space to ensure an accurate shape was reflected in the casts. The fibreglass outer wrap can be removed after a few hours. It should be carefully eased away from the latex. Provided there are no excessive undercuts little difficulty should be experienced with this task. Gently peel the latex mould off the tree from top to bottom ensuring it comes off evenly and without tearing (Fig. 6). The latex mould may shrink after curing. To reduce this risk, and until it can be properly secured inside the fibreglass outer wrap for casting, avoid prolonged expo- sure to direct sunlight or heat The latex may be lightly folded but not creased during transport to the workshop. Fibreglass is fairly stable but care is needed to avoid excessive pressure. Figure 6 The latex mould is carefuly peeled from the tree. Particular attention was paid to minimising the risk of damage to the tree and of tearing the cheesecloth reinforced mould. (Photo: R. Cooper) Transportation Shifting the finished mould from site to base camp can be challenging. Carting bulky objects in the rainforest requires not only sufficient carriers but someone moving ahead to hold vines out of the way and to assist on steep pitches. For long distance vehicular transportation it is desirable to crate the mould in a wooden box. It should be supported internally with shock resistant packaging: shredded paper is cheap and ideal but should be contained within plastic bags rather than applied loose. The fine paper dusts and paper shreds may adhere to the latex presenting a minor but irritating problem when a cast is to be taken.

Safety Dust masks, rubber gloves and protective clothing (pref- erably disposable aprons or overalls) are recommended when cutting the fibreglass mat. Respirators should be worn when working with poly- ester resin. It is advisable to wear safety glasses or goggles when dispensing the catalyst and to have an eyebath within reach for emergencies. Uncured resin is soluble in acetone. Casting process Preparation: Firstly position the latex mould in the fibre- glass support jacket making sure to realign the reference marks. The latex mould is then spot-glued to the fibre- glass jacket using hot melt adhesive or contact adhesive and working in sections from the centre outwards. To ensure accurate representation of the tree shape and dimensions fibreglass rod props are cut to correspond with the reference mark measurements and spot-glued into the mould at the appropriate marks. Any loose material is then blown from the mould taking care not to dislodge any bark, lichen etc. Casting: When employing this method it is not necessary to use a separator or release agent as it is desirable to transfer any surface material picked up on the latex mould to the surface of the fibreglass cast. However, if multiple copies are to be made a separator such as Gensil Relea- spray 60S is required for the production of the subsequent casts. The release agent prolongs the life span of the latex mould and lessens the chance of the latex adhering to the cast Two coots of catalysed coloured gelcoat are brushed onto the latex mould. The gelcoat is colour-matched to photo- graphs with the addition of oxide powders or polyester pig- ments. When the gelcoat has cured catalysed resin, mixed to a putty-like consistency with Q-Cel inorganic microspheres, is smoothed over any irregularities. The thickened resin is levelled with an acetone soaked brush. The application of thickened resin facilitates smooth application of the fibre- glass mat which lessens the chance of air bubbles which may cause imperfections in the finished cast Once the thickened resin has cured 225 g fibreglass mat cut to approximately A4 size is brushed with catalysed resin and applied to the surface, ensuring the pieces over- lap well for maximum strength. When cured this is fol- lowed by 300 g fibreglass mat pieces brushed with lightly pigmented catalysed resin so as to clearly show whether the entire surface has received a second layer of fibreglass mat The props are removed when the cast has cured and the patches which are devoid of gelcoat are touched up and reinforced with fibreglass mat. The finished cast is left overnight to cure then removed from the fibreglass support jacket. Finally the latex skin is peeled from the cast. Finishing: The rough cast is now ready to be trimmed. An electric jigsaw is suitable for this task, though a com- pressed air-driven cutting wheel is far superior as a 'wet' cut can be made by dribbling water onto the area as it is cut. This eliminates the dust that is created by making a 'dry' cut Painting: An accurate representation of the tree can be achieved with a minimal amount of painting. The surface will not require priming and undercoating as pigment was incorporated into the gelcoat layer. Also priming and undercoating is un desirable as the surface material on the cast such as bark and lichens will be covered and look unnatural. Details such as colour variation in the bark, moss and lichens are hand painted in oils over the base of pigmented gelcoat Costings Material costs are estimated (at 1994 prices) to be $50 per mould. High additional costs are encountered in ac- cessing remote sites and in transport of moulds if the casting is not undertaken locally. Additional costs are in- curred with salaries for personnel. The preparation of the two moulds from sites near Ra- venshoe involved three personnel over three days; that is nine working days. A professional photographer provided additional help as required but his primary role was to document the work in progress. A considerable amount of time is necessarily spent waiting for latex and fibreglass to cure. The selection of two or more sites in close proximity to one another can be advan- tageous in that both sites can be worked simultaneously. Casts involved one person and necessitated four (average) working days to produce one cast of each carving. Cost was calculated at $140 per cast. Painting the cast to re- create a realistic surface is a further charge and is related to the size of the cast and its complexity. Conclusion The process described above is an effective method of providing a three dimensional record of important cultural material. It has the advantage of : 1. leaving the original object in its context of site and setting, 2. being non-destructive, 3. providing opportunity for public viewing of a culturally important feature, 4. ensuring optimum opportunity for long term research, 5. minimising the risk of total loss of non-renewable resource, and 6. being consistent with the Burra Charter of Australia ICOMOS. Care needs to be taken to ensure: 1. Aboriginal owners fully endorse such documentation, 2. appropriate legislative requirements are met, 3. the process is field tested to minimise risk of inadver- tent damage before the actual moulding process com- mences, and 4. transportation can be effected easily and economically. 20 A ustralian Archaeology, Number 41,1 995</page><page sequence="7">Grimwade et al. For most work of this nature a team of at least three people is desirable. Two people would be hard pressed at times to work on the moulding process. Extra personnel are invaluable where a detailed photographic record is be- ing made or where the site is remote from vehicle access.
