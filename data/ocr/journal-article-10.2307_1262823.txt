<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of American Linguistics Volume I May, 1918 Number 2 TEPECANO PRAYERS By J. ALDEN MASON INTRODUCTION T HE following prayers or perdones as they are locally termed were collected during the months of December, 191I, to March, 1912, and from November of the latter year to Jan- uary, I913, while I was enjoying the facil- ities for field work afforded me as representa- tive from the University of Pennsylvania to the International School of Mexican Ethnol- ogy and Archeology. They were secured in AzqueltAn, a little pueblo in the northeastern corner of the state of Jalisco, some hundred miles west of Zacatecas and nearly the same distance north of Guadalajara. Here live the remainder of the Tepecanos, at present the southernmost people speaking a language of the Piman group. A brief sketch of their life and customs and collections of their folk- tales 2 have been published as well as a short account of one of the religious fiestas.3 The principal results of the residence in Azquelt,n, in addition to the above-mentioned sketches, were studies of the language and of the religion of this group. An exposition of the language is being published by the New York Academy of Sciences.4 To the same Academy is due no little credit for the appear- ance of the present paper, since it supplied 1 The Tepehuan Indians of Azqueltan, Proceedings of the XVIII International Congress of Americanists, London, 1912, p. 344- 2 Four Mexican-Spanish Fairy-Tales from Azqueltan, Jalisco, J.

The appearance of this article is delayed on account of the war. the needed funds for its preparation. The present collection of prayers is presented partly as illustrative material for the afore- said linguistic sketch and partly as basic ma- terial for the study of the religion which is to be prepared. For this reason the prayers are presented with little introduction and no attempt has been made to explain the cere- monial allusions. Footnotes have been ap- pended only to elucidate grammatical points. The greater number of the prayers were given me by my principal informant, Eleno Aguilar. A few were given by the Cantador Mayor or High Priest, Rito de la Cruz, and one was secured from Francisco Aguilar. But all were revised and corrected by Eleno. The religion of the Tepecanos appears to be very similar to those of the other neighboring peoples of the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Huichol, Cora, Tepehuane and Tarahumare. Preuss has published a voluminous account of the religion of the Cora and Lumholtz more or less detailed accounts of those of the other groups,6 particularly the Huichol.7 The religion of the latter appears to be somewhat specialized but those of the other groups are doubtless basically the same. Preuss gives many songs and prayers very similar in form and concept to those given here and Lum- holtz mentions the same among other groups. 5 K. T.

I The old Tepecano religion is now practically abandoned in favor of Catholicism and the Christian influence may be traced in several of the prayers. Fortunately it is slight. But it must be borne in mind that the prayers are traditional material and many have not been recited for years. Probably a large number have been lost beyond possibility of record. The possibility of inaccuracy is therefore con- siderable. In many cases, the exact meaning of esoteric phrases has been forgotten or they are interpreted differently by different infor- mants. In other cases the purpose of the prayer itself is disputed by various author- ities or changes suggested in the final revision. It is with a full realization of these possible inaccuracies that the collection is presented. For the greater part, the texts have been printed exactly as written down even in cases where cumulative evidence of many records of the same word indicates that a certain instance was incorrectly recorded. In addition to cer- tain regular changes to conform with the orthography now in standard usage,' the prin- cipal change in preparation of manuscript has been in the cases of the complexes pb, td, and kg where the initial surd is not released, to B', D', and G', respectively. For a complete account of the phonetics and morphology of the language the reader is referred to the before-mentioned linguistic paper.

TO PREPARE THE PATIO FOR THE FIESTA OF THE RAIN adiu's.um2 naparin.Q'G3 naparinda-'D4 To God,2 thou who art my Father,3 who art my, Mother,4 2 Adios is the most frequent beginning for most of the prayers and is, of course, a Christian influence. It is a question whether it represents a dedication to the Christian God or merely an exclamation of greeting, in which sense it is frequent in Spanish usage. It has been most frequently translated as "Hail!" The particle um here is of doubtful nature. 3 The stem means FATHER; it has frequently been translated as "Lord." 4The stem means MOTHER; it has frequently been translated as "Lady."</page><page sequence="3">NO. 2 TEPECANO PRAYERS 93 ganavarci'vgok o'hi t6'tvag.w6t'a piho' they which are seven beautiful skies beneath, where navarict6'doG6 which is green6 am.ai'niG.ddm7 your petate7 on. kutsapica'tivb6'hi'moD We say we hither came ha'gicdara pardon, para in order nantu.i'ntamtuha 'na1 nanpu.i'ni.ci'a.da'rsa that I here may meddle, 1 that I here them may place, hidi nampurict6ko"dam these which are powerful cidu'Dkam2 fetishes2 nampumt6't6k aniho' nampu.a'r'gidic3 that they are named hereabouts, that they are- formed,3 hacnaci'dfidu4 kuha'pu.pi'c.o'B nica'm'a'tuD thus that hoards.4 Then likewise also I give you- to know kupimitunha'gicda hidi h6'maD go'k that ye me will pardon these one two va"'ik ni"o-khokot three word with. nicput6'mai.amta'n I continually you beg ha'gicdara5 kupiminma'kia pardon5 that ye me will give lise'nsia permission napuixi'kmaD napuivo'pmiG ganavaramhi'- that it clouds up that arises that which is your- koma navarica'pma'citk 't na.icva"ut'ak8 cloud which is well appearing, spread out which, drizzles8 navaricto'Dgitk' t pih6' napum.a'r'giD which is very green, spread out.

They are commonly known by their native name but are translated on demand as IDOLS. They are small objects of stone, bone, etc. 3 This stem has given great trouble as it seems to be used in a passive sense either with or without the passive particle. 4 This is a word of esoteric meaning which has prac- tically been forgotten. My informant translated it by different phrases until at last he settled on como per- tinece a los cuatro vientos. It seems to contain the same stem as cidukam, TO GUARD AND CHERISH. The phrase "to beg pardon" seems to carry both the idea of craving forgiveness and beseeching favor. 6 Always translated "green" but probably signifies "blue" as well. natpub6'.ini6'3 am6h6dor natpua'.vo'm that spokel3 down hither.

The guia is interpreted as a small star which rises immediately before the Morning Star. 1 Evidently related to cic, ELDER BROTHER. 12 Reference doubtful. 13 The thunder is conceived as a voice, the Word. In many of the prayers the Word seems to be con- ceived as an entity, arising, being formed, speaking and performing other anthropomorphic functions. This concept has rendered certain translations very equivocal. napimpuma'r'giD that ye are formed. amta'nim begging you piho'dor Where from</page><page sequence="4">94 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL.

This is done in the late afternoon. After reciting this, the Cantador, or Chief Singer, sweeps the dance patio, lights the fire and decorates the altar with the necessary cere- monial objects. TRANSLATION Oh ye who are my Lord and my Lady who were created beneath the seven beautiful heavens! Hither have we come to ask your forgiveness so that I may here prepare and may place here these powerful Cidudkam, as they are called hereabouts where they are formed and cherished. Also do I say unto you that ye must forgive me these few words. Continually do I implore you that ye give me leave to work here and to pass the night here that I may kindle fire on this your green carpet. Thence the heaven becometh overcast and your cloud ariseth, beautifully outspread, which drizzleth and is very green. There is formed the Word of Him who is my Guide, my Morning Star and my Lord, who cometh teaching unto us his hand that we, gathering ourselves into it, may go beholding in all hours. There beneath the east is it formed whence he hath sent his lightning and spoken. From afar it hath arisen; he hath spoken to them of the north, the west and the south, telling to all parts. Thus did they know it; they have seated themselves and have reached unto us their hand that we, wrapping our- selves in it, may go observing. They will repel the heat with their arrows; with their chimales will they cast it aside. hexagon of yarn, the "God's eye" of the Huichol.

Ye will pardon me for meddling here in this your court. Here will I place your white cloth on your carpet where ye are formed in all hours. Continually do I implore you. May God bless you. 2.

After the patio has been prepared, the altar arranged and the fire lighted, the communi- cants arrive. Then, after darkness has set in, the Chief Singer takes his seat facing the altar to the east and recites the prayer. This prayer must also be recited by one desiring to become a shaman in order to prove his knowledge and ability. TRANSLATION Oh my Lord, my Lady, my Morning Star! Hither have we come. Ye are my spirits who are seated there in the five heavens beneath the green east. From there will ye bring health. With thy arrows thou wilt purify us; thou wilt quit from us the pestilence which sur- roundeth us beneath thy heavens. From there thou wilt lead thy path. Thou wilt cleanse us with the cold which is thy hand, with which thou wilt intensify for us thy spirit. Thou wilt lengthen for us thy way which thou wilt now cause us to tread, which is between thy altar. With these few fragments which I have recited unto thee thou wilt pardon me, God, my Lord, my Lady, my Morning Star, for they are thy Word which is health. With this formula thou wilt pardon me for I may not fulfill thy commandment, thy course which hither leadeth, for it is very far; it is health and treasure. There- fore I never may behold thee. So with this formula Hail! my Lord, my Lady, my Morn- ing Star. There are ye seated, my spirits, beneath the green east, on the beautiful green bead which is your throne, whence come health and the clouds, lightning and drizzle. There will it be created of the beautiful green cloud between the great beautiful clouds. Forward will it proceed, observing beneath the beautiful gray heavens. Hence will go speaking the beautiful gray Bead-man who sitteth there beneath the gray heaven, the guardian of thy beautiful gray lakes. Then from there will it arise and go observing within the beautiful great gray cloud. Far away will it arrive where it will be formed within the great cloud. There wilt thou purify it with thy tears, which are health. Thence will it look to both sides, within the great gray clouds. Thou wilt weep and purify it with thy arrows which are the cold. Thou wilt quit from us the pestilence round about beneath thy heavens with the cold of thy chimal which is thy countenance. Here will it go about observing beneath thy heavens where it will be formed of the cold with thy many-colored cloud. Then will it go about observing beneath thy beautiful black heavens where thou wilt cleanse it with the cold of thy arrows. Hither will come speaking and reciting the Woman who is my Lady. Beneath the beautiful black heaven is she sitting, guarding thy lakes whence thou drawest health, thy plumes. From them cometh beauty. Thou wilt cleanse us who are thy sons who wander here beneath thy healthful shadow. Thou wilt purify us with thy health-giving tears. Thou wilt in- crease for us thy succor. Thence will it arise from out thy black cloud and will go behold- ing within the beautiful great cloud. It will be created with thy healthful cloud whence come the lightning and the drizzle. From there he speaketh, answering thee within thy cloud, alone. Then will it look to both sides and thou wilt cleanse it with the cold of thy arrows. Round about beneath thy heavens will it gaze and thou wilt purify it with the cold of thy tears, round about in thy paths. From it thou sendeth the clouds and, within the cloud, thy lightning which appeareth in thy paths. From there will it go beholding beneath thy beautiful white heaven where it will be formed of the beautiful white cloud. Hence will go speaking the beautiful white Bead-</page><page sequence="10">I00 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I man who sitteth beneath thy beautiful white heaven on the beautiful white bead which is thy throne, guarding thy lakes. From these wilt thou raise thy beautiful white plumes whence come beauty and health. From thy beautiful white plumes cometh the rain; from them come the clouds andwithin the cloud thou sendest lightnings which flash on thy beauti- ful white carpet. From there will it look to both sides, gazing within the beautiful white cloud where it will be formed of the white cloud. From it thou wilt bring health and wilt cleanse with thy arrows, round about beneath thy heavens. It will go about gazing beneath the five green heavens where it will be formed of thy five beautiful clouds. From there will it arise with thy five Words and will go about observing in the seven beautiful heavens. There will arrive speaking our Lord, the Sun, the Cloud, the Plume, the Cidukam from which cometh health in the many-colored cloud. With thy beautiful gray arrows wilt thou cleanse it. Thou art seated on thy seven beautiful thrones guarding thy seven beautiful lakes whence thou wilt raise thy health-giving plumes which appear round about beneath the east, the north, the west and the south. From there afar the lightnings flash through the seven clouds. From there thou wilt speak and they will reply unto thee from all around beneath the heavens, from north, west and south within the seven clouds. So wilt thou end thy five beautiful Words. With this formula thou wilt forgive me. Hail! my Lord, my Lady, my Morning Star. 3.

Beneath the seven beautiful heav- ens thou wast created. Continually do we implore you to forgive us and to give us leave to pass the night here, to array your court for you, to make you plumes of our Corn, and to place here the powerful cidudkam, as they are called, on their white cloth beneath their white carpet. We will play for them in worship, that we may be enabled to eat. Also will we make plumes for you with your seven words, that we may teach you the Word of our spirits who have gone before. They come reaching unto us their hand that we, enfolding our- selves in it, may go beholding in all hours. Likewise do we beg forgiveness first of Him who is our Morning Star. He will come to watch over us where we perform, where we pass the night and rise with the dawn, so that no ill may befall us and we may arise with strength. Our spirits will come to watch over us. Only this fragment do we say unto you, for we may not teach you more of your Word, which is your Way, for we are confused by our sinfulness. This, no more. Hear us! May God bless you. 5.

NOTE The Fiesta of the Milpa Cuata, celebrated on the fifth of March, is rather variant from 1 The flesh of our bodies. the other three fiestas. It is held in a cave or rock shelter and is quite different from the others in type. As before, the Chief Singer arrives early in the evening before the others and recites this prayer to the divinities to beg permission to prepare the dance patio for the celebration of the fiesta. The Milpa Cuata is any corn plant which grows with a forked stalk and an ear on either branch. It probably has an intimate con- nection with the horns of the deer. At harvest time the forked stalks are garnered with a special prayer (no. 29). They are then bound in a sheaf and preserved until this fiesta. TRANSLATION Hail! my Guide, my Morning Star, my Father and my Mother, seated round about on your green throne. Ye will give us leave to work here, to adorn this your court that we may hear the words of the stranger who from afar cometh counselling from beneath the east. Here will we await him in this cave among the dark forests where the neigh- bors will not behold us, that we may hear his word. He cometh counselling from afar whence his Father and his Mother did send him mournfully to appear here among us and accompany us. Already he cometh; he hath spoken in the lightnings with all his adornment, with all his plumes. He cometh arrayed in his glorious green garb with which he was created, counselling on every side. Therefore will we adorn ourselves to wait for him in this his court. Here he will arrive that we may hear his word, that we may behold him, that we may repeat his words and that we may cry unto him. We will say unto Him who is his Father and his Mother that he did send him to this world to be our flesh, that we might go beholding in this world. Thus shall they know it. May my spirits who have gone before give ear unto me. Like- wise do I beseech them. May God bless you.</page><page sequence="21">NO. 2 TEPECANO PRAYERS III ii.

Several times during the night's ceremony, at the end of every song, the Master of the Fiesta, the man who has brought the sheaf of Milpa Cuata and supplied the other paraphernalia for the celebration, advances to the four quarters of the dance circle, east, north, west and south in turn, in company with a small boy dressed to represent the Morning Star. Both carry stalks of the forked twin corn and raise these on high, while the Master, in a loud, joyful voice, shouts out the prayer over the hillside. TRANSLATION Come, brethren! Come cleansed and with your sandals tied! Let us go to hear the stranger who cometh hither! He cometh run- ning from out the yellow broom-grass. He cometh speaking from the slopes of the dark hills. Beautifully arrayed with his plumes he cometh. His bow he carrieth ready, his arrows and likewise his wrist-guard. Then, having given ear to him who cometh running and speaking from afar, let us go hence. Yea! 13.

The patient is laid on his back, the doctor standing at his feet. He blows tobacco smoke to the four winds and recites one of several prayers in a low voice. Five puffs of smoke are then blown on the invalid's hands, feet and fore- head. The body is then stroked vigorously from the extremities to the center of pain and the latter is subjected to a vigorous suction. Thick spittle, blood, or a tangible object is extracted. The first is proof of affliction by a chan, a mythical water-serpent, the second of affliction by the spirits of the dead, the last of witchcraft. The object 2 Undoubtedly error for icxo'pitkam, THE COLD.</page><page sequence="30">I20 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I extracted is then rubbed and palmed until it disappears. Smoke is then blown five times on the affected part and the cure is effected. The shaman rinses his mouth well and recites the prayer again to the west, whence the evil spirits flee. If the individual is very sick, a different prayer is repeated every third day. The following prayer is of doubtful value. Together with no. 26 it was given to me to show the lack of antagonism between the old Tepecano and the Catholic religions, and was termed the "Our Father." The informant constantly compared the Christian prayer while giving it. It was originally claimed to be a prayer to beg permission to enter a sacred place. TRANSLATION Hail! my Father who art in the seven beautiful heavens. Thou art dear. From there where thou wast named, thou didst come to this thy carpet. Thou didst thy will here on this earth as in the heavens. Thou givest us thy succor daily. Thou wilt give it us now. Thou wilt pardon me; before thee will we dance.

When the priest- doctor's diagnosis showed sickness caused by the spirits of the dead, this being determined by the extraction of blood in the sucking ex- amination, the following prayer was recited to cause the spirit to quit the body it was afflicting. The same prayer was also spoken to drive away a persistent haunting spirit. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art Death. Thou belongest beneath the ground, beneath thy green carpet. And ye who are the Dead in your white fields where ye belong, I beg your forgiveness. Ye must not sicken me, neither myself nor my family. With all manner of cold will ye purify me; to one side will ye cast the sick- ness, that no ill may befall me. Ye must not afflict me. From the great heavens where he who is our Father and our Mother holdeth you, he reacheth unto us his hand that we may be gathered into it. With all the cold will he, our Father, cleanse us, that we may go be- holding in this world. Then will no evil befall us. Ye must take yourselves hence to your crosses, your shadows, where ye were created, beneath your green carpet where ye belong. There within your cloud are ye held by our spirits who have gone before. From the seven beautiful heavens where they are seated in their pleasant broad court our spirits stretch unto us their forms in which they were created. Likewise do we beg forgiveness of the Dead who are seated round about on their accustom- ed paths. They must take themselves hence. Thus will they forgive me; I warn them that they must forgive me. May God have pity on you. 22.

They decide that the Death Goddess has been too active and must be sent hence. They therefore undergo an ablutionary fast of five days. At midnight on the fifth day they meet in the graveyard and together recite in a low voice the fol- lowing prayer, begging permission of the higher Gods to seize the Death Goddess and send her away. They all carry their bows and arrows. One remains in the town while the other four seek to the four winds. One of them encounters the Death Goddess in</page><page sequence="35">NO. 2 TEPECANO PRAYERS I25 the form of a mortal woman and bids her begone and not molest them more. The information volunteered to the effect that each person has a lighted candle in heaven, representing his spirit, and that the Death Goddess goes about snuffing them out, is probably of Christian origin. TRANSLATION Hail, O God, thou that art my Father and Mother, my Guide, and Morning Star! I beseech thee, stretch forth thy hand that it lay hold upon us. Then will the Goddess Death herself appear before us that we may seize her as she walketh about on her ac- customed paths. She belongeth beneath the east whence our Father has sent her to carry us hence, so that we may give report to Him, our God and Father, of how we have acted in this world. Likewise do we beseech of our Father that he give us leave to seize the Death Goddess, she who cometh whispering, stalking about and carrying off his children. We ask that she shall not harm us as already she has harmed so many. Likewise do we beg of our Lord and Lady that he stretch forth his hand and his foot so that we may be upheld and not be sick- ened. He will give us his word that she shall not carry us away. We will send her where she belongeth where she guardeth the torches of our spirits who watch us through all hours. Then will we be well here where we wander on the green carpet. Then will we never be decreased. Also do we beg forgiveness of our Lord and Lady seated in the seven beautiful heavens. We will let the Death Goddess know that nothing shall harm us who are the children of the Father. May God bless you. 23.

They always travel in pairs, male and female, and love to stretch themselves through the clouds in rainy weather, head in one spring and tail in another, visiting. In this form they appear as rainbows. They are called the "winds of the water." The chanes are vicious and will sting those who have not placated them. For this reason a native will never put his mouth to a spring while drinking; the water is dashed into the mouth with the hand. When thus bitten, malaria, fever, headache and many other ills result. When a man decides to build a house and make his home on a new site it is necessary for him to placate the chanes of the spring whence he draws his water supply. To this end he prepares a jlcara decorated with transparent small glass beads (water beads) and fills it with a gruel of pinole and water. This is scattered to the four winds at the spring while the following prayer is recited. The jicara is then left there as an offering. TRANSLATION Hail! ye who are called Chanes, who are seated hereabouts in the waters, guarding the cloud of the spirits of those who have gone before and are seated round about us. We come to beg forgiveness. Know ye that it is so. Ye must not ignore me nor my family who walk about here. Sadly do they appear beneath your crystal carpet where ye are seated. Thus do I give you to know, for already have I begun to walk about here and to meddle with your lucid carpet. So be it!

Then they will not sicken us, they who are called Chanes who are seated hereabouts in the waters guarding those that are called the rainbows. Thus do I give you to know, my spirits.

NOTE When the priest-doctor has determined by the extraction of thick spittle from the patient in the sucking examination, that he is afflicted by a chan, he makes a chimal and a baston with feathers of the heron and cleanses the invalid by waving the latter over him. He then deposits it at the spring whence the water is brought. The balance of the treatment is as before but the following prayer is recited. TRANSLATION Hail! ye who are called Chanes who are seated round about, guarding the cloud of our spirits. It is their transparent carpet, their limpid chimal with which they do shield them- selves. Round about are ye seated, guard- ing the cloud of our Gods. We beseech you, put away your saucers, your jars, your griddles and your pitchers. Hide them within your transparent gourd.

Thus do I say unto you for already do my family walk about here and mayhap will meddle. This do I ask of you, for if I tell him who is my Protector and my Morning Star, he will then afflict you.

NOTE This prayer is merely one of several modes of casting spells of witchery, the others not entailing the use of any set prayer and savor- ing more of European custom. Even this, however, is of dubious authenticity as its resemblance to Christian philosophy is only too evident. In fact it was given in order to prove to me the lack of antagonism between the old Tepecano religion and Catholicism and was entitled the "Creed." I have great suspicion that it was created to suit the occasion, like no. 18. It was originally said to be a prayer to beg permission to enter a sacred spot but my principal informant pronounced it to be a prayer to bewitch. It is recited at midnight when the one whom it is desired to bewitch is asleep, and is addressed to the pagan idols (cidudkam) and the Christian cross. A fast is likewise enjoined. Then the supplicant goes to the cemetery and lights a wax candle and buries there a figure he has made in representation of the hated one. It is buried at the foot of the cross and a prayer said entreating the death of the individual. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art my Father, my Mother, and my Morning Star who art seated afar in the heavens. Here on thy earth thou art powerful, art dear. We are thy children. From afar where alone thou wast formed thou didst come to cleanse us. Here thou didst choose Mary, the Mother of us who suffer here beneath thee. Thou didst purify us. From hence thou didst arise alone, thou didst lay thyself on thy cross and die. There thou didst descend into thy grave, into the darkness for three days. Afar thou didst appear among the dead. From here thou didst behold Him who is in heaven. Thou art seated with the chosen, God, who art my Father, which is thy thought. From there thou wilt send purification to us who also journey through this world, and give us succor. Thou wilt come to cleanse us with the health which is beneath thy shadow; thou wilt send us the cold which is in thy hand that we may lay hold upon it. With this thou wilt pardon us, for we are vile. With this formula thou wilt send us thy succor. Amen. 27.

The latter bathes and fasts seven days. It is revealed to him in his dreams and later veri- fied by examination of the patient whether he is sickened by will of God, by a chan, by disembodied spirits, or by witchcraft. Knead- ing and squeezing the joints is one of the cri- teria, sucking being another, the drawing of blood being a certain sign of witchcraft. Having assured himself of the cause, the doctor brings his ceremonial arrows and other paraphernalia. First three arrows are placed around the patient's head and another at his feet, stuck in the ground. The one to the left of the head is then raised and carried to the foot and these two are lifted, one in either hand, and pointed in turn to the east, north, west, south and zenith, the prayer being repeated five times, once to each direc- tion. Then the five ceremonial circuits are performed around the sick man and he is sucked vigorously. The arrows are then re- placed, two at the head and two at the feet. The doctor stands at the foot, then goes to the right and performs the sucking operation again. He then goes to the patient's head and spits in his hand to note the result of the sucking treatment. This is repeated five times on different parts of the body, each time returning to the sick man's head by a counter-clockwise direction. Usually some tangible object is extracted by these means. To finish the treatment the doctor seizes all four arrows, two in either hand, and circles them over the patient to purify him. The treatment is repeated every three days for five times and is said to be generally effica- cious. TRANSLATION Hail! my Mother, my Morning Star. I be- seech thee that this heat may take itself hence. My Morning Star must stretch unto me his hand from beneath the east where he be- longeth. Then shall this invalid recover. Mayhap something is lacking that thus they bewitch him. But it must not be so. Thou wilt cleanse him with the cold and with thy ar- rows; with your white chimal will ye cast aside the pestilence. Therefore do I implore you, my Lord and my Lady. I must have more power than even he who is bewitching. Ye will not allow him to molest us with this heat. Our Morning Star will come to cleanse me that this heat may not return unto me. With my arrows will I shield myself, that no ill may befall me. So be it! Know ye it and hear me!

NOTE After the first heavy rain in June the corn is planted. A fast of five days and a purify- ing bath are the primary requisites. After this has been undergone small beads and a jicara of pinole mixed with water are prepared. The beads are placed in the four corners and in the center of the field to prevent injury by crows and other animals. The pinole water is then sprinkled to the four cardinal points and the prayer is recited while facing east. The pinole serves to prepare the soil for the reception of the kernels. The corn may then be planted but the kernels taken from the twin ears, the Milpa Cuata, must be planted first. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art my Lord, my Guide and my Morning Star.

Therefore did she depart; she returned unto her Father and arrived there afar where he is seated in the seven beautiful heavens.' Thus do we pray. We give thee our word that we will not mistreat her, that we will guard her well. Thou nqedst not feel offended. Nor look askance, Milpa Cuata, as thou art called, maiden.

When a man desires to hunt deer, which is a requisite for certain ceremonies, he com- mences a fast of seven days. On the first 1 Cf. Lumholtz, Symbolism, p. 22. 2 Nahua otlatl, the base of a reed with branching roots which are trimmed and decorated to represent the head of a deer. Cf. Lumholtz, Symbolism, p. 51. day he goes to the Cerro del Cintaro with an otate 2 decorated with beads, to resemble the head of a deer, a jicara decorated with beads, and a chimal of pure white cotton. The otates have the same name and spirit as a deer and are made with green beads for the eyes. But if no otate is available a figure of a deer may be made of clay or wax and used instead. At the Cerro del Cantaro the supplicant leaves his offerings and recites the prayer. The following day he hunts to the east, the third day to the north, the fourth to the west and the fifth to the south. Thereafter he may hunt where he wishes as long as he desires. But the first deer secured must be entirely distributed among the others; he may not touch it. Candles must be made of the fat and he must light one and put it in his house before setting forth again. This is for the spirits.3 For the Fiesta of the Milpa Cuata the deer of which the chuales 4 are made must be caught in a snare and cooked whole, head and all. TRANSLATION Unbidden have I come hither, craving your pets which wander about in the dark hills, the deer as they are called hereabouts on your green carpet where they belong. I ask that ye lend me one of these which wander in the seven beautiful clouds. Like- wise do I beg your forgiveness. Ye should know that they may hear me in the winds, running about on their green carpet where mournfully they appear. Their Master is my Lord, my Guide, my Morning Star. I will speak unto him the one word with which were created these which are called your pets. Know it; hear me and pardon me. 3 Uncertain whether the spirits of the deer or whether disembodied or unembodied anthropomorphic spirits. 4 Nahua chualli, a mush made of pinole and finely chopped meat, cooked in corn husk; practically equiva- lent to tamale. . . . c</page><page sequence="46">136 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL.

NOTE This prayer is recited by a man when he goes to a new locality to build his house and make his home. It has the power to drive away the scorpions, snakes, spiders, and other poisonous insects and animals. He must first fast for five days and prepare a jicara of pinole mixed in water or of holy water. This jicara is decorated with small beads. At the end of the fast it is placed in the center of the holding and the water sprinkled to the four cardinal points while the prayer is recited. The latter is addressed to the Morning Star, the arch-enemy of the scorpions who are the cattle of the Devil. The principal scorpion is in the sky;' those on earth are smaller copies of it. The prayer must be repeated every year if the scorpions are to be kept under control. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art my Morning Star.

Also do I give them to know, formed as they are beneath the seven beautiful heavens, that they must take themselves hence, for if I behold them hereabouts I will sicken them. Also do I beseech my Morning Star that he reach unto me his hand to shield me through all hours. Then will these poisonous ones not sicken me. Therefore do I beseech him, my Morning Star, that he restrain them who live in this hill, the scorpions, the spiders, the serpents, and all those who here dwell. They must take themselves beneath the green carpet, for I do not wish to behold them. Thus do I say unto my Morning Star. Forgive me, my Morning Star, my Lord and my Lady. 32.

NOTE Large constrictor serpents are said to live in the forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental above Azqueltan and these are claimed to make excellent pets and house guardians.1 If properly approached they will accompany the finder to his house and guard it for him. They give notice of danger by striking the ground with the tail and bind and hold any one who may come with intent to rob. If the owner is asleep they strike him in the face with the tail to awaken him. But they must be given bread to eat every Thursday if they are to remain content. When a man wishes to secure one of them he first buys a candle and begs permission of Maria Santisima in the church. Then he takes a white cloth with which to bind the snake and hunts to the four cardinal points. When he has found it he recites this prayer. TRANSLATION Hail! my Father and my Mother. For- give me if I carry hence this serpent which I have found here. I will carry him to my house that he may be my guard. On this your green carpet where he belongeth was formed he who lieth here. He must go with me to where I rest, my home as it is called, to keep watch for me over anything which I may leave wherever I do mournfully appear in this world. Thus do I pray here where I do sadly appear on this green carpet beneath the seven beautiful heavens. This serpent must not frighten me. I beg that he may stay hidden wherever I may put him. He must 1 Cf. Lumholtz, Unknown Mexico, II, p. I24. not allow my neighbors to meddle anywhere nor to steal from me. He must wrap himself around them if they come to rob me of any- thing. He shall not permit them. Therefore do I ask the favor that he accompany me to my home. Likewise do I say unto my Father and my Mother who have given me leave to go be- holding in this world these few days which have dawned, that they shall still allow me yet a few days which shall yet come to a close. Know it to be thus and hear me! May God bless thee. 33.

NOTE The toloache is a plant of great power, being the son-in-law of the Father Sun. He attained this by reason of his marriage to the Corn Daughter. But he mistreated her by having two mistresses, Crow and Map- uache, and was fastened head-downward in the ground, his limbs outstretched and was commanded to give mortals whatever they might beg of him.' It is said to have a thick trunk of nine inches diameter and no roots, growing on the bare rock. Its five branches extend to the cardinal points and to heaven. It is made of money and each one has a jicara full of coin in front of it. One may borrow this money and return it in five years time. But having done so, he may not attend confession. Or he may beg fortune which will later be vouchsafed to him. Needless to say, the toloache is an extremely rare plant in the Tepecano country. To beg fortune of the toloache one must first fast seven days for Maria Santisima and 1 Cf. JAFL, xxvII, I60. o'hi beautiful ha'stu- anything;</page><page sequence="50">I40 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I go to church and recite this prayer to her to beg her permission. Then he fasts forty days for the toloache. He goes to the river and finds a black stone which has a child, a smaller black stone, beside it. These two he takes away, the smaller one for Maria Santisima, the larger one to pay the toloache. He also carries a baston decorated with cotton and a jicara decorated with beads. Going to the toloache, he recites this prayer and leaves the offerings there. Soon thereafter he attains great wealth. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art my Father and Mother. Thou wilt forgive me for I am about to give myself unto the Toloaches who are seated round about among the great rocks. I will beg fortune of one of them, if perchance he may succor me and lend me riches. Therefore do I beg your forgiveness, my spirits who have gone before. And likewise do I beg forgiveness of the Toloache; ye shall give me leave to do so. Round about are they seated in their places beneath the east, the north, the west and the south. There did their father-in-law who is above us put them that they should render unto us whatever we might crave, who are the children of the Father. They must give us whatever we ask. Round about are they seated on the verdant carpet. Within their drizzly cloud, beautifully o'ercast, were they formed, from whence they returned hither to the great rocky slopes to north, west and south. So doth ascend unto the blue heavens these few words with which he was created in this world. So do we bow our heads be- neath the seven beautiful heavens from whence our Mother sent us to beg of the Toloache whatever we might crave. He must grant us, the children of the Father, whatever we may wish, wherever we may appear. Likewise do we beg forgiveness of my Lord and my Lady, my Guide and Morning Star there where they are seated in the seven beautiful heavens. Know it to be thus and hear me! May God bless thee. 34.

Gods NOTE The surrounding hills or cerros are elements of the greatest importance in the religion of this region and the more important ones have their particular habitant spirits. These can grant wealth to mortals if properly ap- proached. The method displays a strange mixture of Christian and pagan philosophy but the prayer is purely aboriginal. When one has determined to sell himself to the hills in return for fortune he first fasts seven days for Maria Santisima. At midnight on the seventh day he goes to the church carrying a lighted twenty-five cent candle and says this prayer to sever his con- nection with the church. Then he rests several days, bathes himself and then fasts forty days. At the end of this fast he goes to one of the principal hills carrying a jicara decorated with small beads (chaquira) and many larger beads for payment. There he says the prayer again and leaves the offering. I</page><page sequence="52">142 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I From a neighboring spring he takes a gourd of water and carries it to his cornfield (codmil). Here he sprinkles it to the four corners and in the middle while reciting the prayer for the third time. After he has sown and reapt his crop he becomes very wealthy. He may not go to confession thenceforth and every fifth of May he must go to the hill to repeat his vows. Every fifth year he must repeat the fast and the visit to church. TRANSLATION Hail! my Father and my Mother, seated somewhere on your pleasant throne, o'er- spread with drizzly clouds. From there where ye are seated do ye gaze upon us with your countenances, which are your chimales. From your arrows ariseth the cloud from beneath the seven beautiful heavens. We beg your forgiveness. From there did ye speak your seven words and they replied unto you with the same words. They besought you that they might grant us anything which we might crave of them, that they might succor us with anything we might wish upon this your green carpet where mournfully we appear. We also beg your forgiveness, my spirits. And ye will forgive us. Continually do we cry unto you, my spirits, seated there be- neath the east, the north, the west and the south, where ye do sadly appear. Likewise do I beseech you that ye grant me leave to give myself unto them who live hereabouts in the beautiful dark hill. They must not refuse me; they must give me whatever I may ask of them. Hereabouts do they dwell beneath the seven beautiful heavens whence ye did reach unto us your hand into which we were gathered when we begged succor. So with this fragment do we beseech you that no evil may come upon us and that we may not be sickened. With all the cold will ye cleanse us; with your arrows, your chimales and your plumes whence spring the clouds. Thus do I give ye to know. Hear me, 0 my spirits! So be it. May God bless you. 35.

NOTE This prayer is the native's substitute for the love potions of the European necromancer. When a boy desires the love of a girl who has given him no encouragement he must first fast five days. Then if he does not know the prayer he must secure the services of one who does, paying him for the labor. He has first stealthily secured some article of apparel worn by the girl. A figure or "doll" is made from this and another from one of his gar- ments. The latter is decorated with the flowers of five narcotic plants, guizache, palo mulato, garambullo, rosa maria and toloache. 3 Cannabis indica, "Indian hemp," "hashish " mari- guana. 4 Nahua toloatzin, Datura stramonium. di than hio'cgi flower kuvi'cpuh6'gia.h6gacapn Then she only that well shall I h6ga that pwico'p also hio'cgi.h6ok flower with a"rak form</page><page sequence="54">144 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I At midnight, when the girl is asleep, a candle is lighted and the two figures placed in a jicara or bowl of water where they float. The prayer is then recited and a ceremonial song sung five times to the accompaniment of the musical bow. Five ceremonial circuits of the bowl are then made and the charm is complete. If the figures have floated to- gether, the prayer will be answered; if they have parted, the case is hopeless. The prayer is replete with allegory and ceremonial allusions. TRANSLATION Hail! thou who art called the Intoxicated Woman who wast created beneath the east, intoxicated. We beg thy forgiveness, thou that belongest beneath the seven beautiful heavens. Thou shalt return, formed as thou art with thy beauteous figure. I ask that thou wilt intoxicate the woman whom I crave, who am arrayed with pretty flowers. Likewise do I beseech the Flower Man. For I am arrayed with the pretty flower of guizache. She must look upon me, this woman whom I covet; I ask that she look upon me, that no other flower shall please her but the one with which I am arrayed, sadly appearing here. She must not crave another flower but that with which I am arrayed, the flower of palo mulato. This only shall she like. And likewise the flowers of rosa maria and garambullo of which I am made. I wish that she shall want me, this woman whom I crave, who was created be- neath the seven beautiful heavens. Beneath the east did she appear, arrayed with pretty flowers. Thence did her father and her mother send her, arrayed with her beauteous form. Likewise do I beseech her father and her mother that they forgive me. She must give herself unto me, this woman whom I covet. For I am arrayed with the flower of toloache. Therefore do I ask that this woman shall want me, and also she who is called the Intoxicated Woman who belongeth beneath the seven beautiful heavens. Thus do I beseech the Flower Man who dwelleth on the great rocky slopes. So be it. May God bless you. 36.

NOTE This long and involved prayer is spoken to the father of a girl desired in marriage.2 Marriage generally takes place at about the age of eighteen. The details having been arranged informally, the husband-to-be and his father appear at the house of the girl on a Wednesday night. It happens that at present only two Tepecanos know this long prayer and one of them must be engaged at a fee of a peso per night to accompany the supplicants and recite the prayer. It must be recited five times on successive evenings, Wednesday, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday and Wednesday. On the final night the father makes his reply. Since the affair is always prearranged, the reply is never negative. Then a white cloth is spread out and the clothes and other property of the girl and the wedding gifts placed upon it. The bride and groom and their fathers each seize a corner and raise the cloth and the ceremony is complete. After this they are married. The boy gives a present to his parents-in-law and goes to live with them for a short period, six months or a year before setting up a separate home. Two wedding feasts and dances are held, one in the house of each parent. The prayer is extremely long and involved and so full of ceremonial and esoteric allusions as to be very difficult of proper translation. In many cases the exact meaning is very doubtful and obscure. TRANSLATION Hither have I come. Do not wonder that I have come here to speak unto thee unbidden. Thou wilt forgive me, for I behold that thou 2 Cf. Lumholtz, Unknown Mexico, II, p. 93. p( ii</page><page sequence="61">NO. 2 TEPECANO PRAYERS 151 art sad. Therefore do I thus unbidden speak unto thee. From afar God speaketh from his seven beautiful heavens. There did her father and her mother create her within the seven clouds; within the beautiful green jicara where she was formed did she carry her hidden, until at last she appeared between the limbs, sor- rowfully weeping. Then she arose and trod on the beautiful green carpet where she was formed in the image of her father and her mother. From there she arose and went observing within the five clouds, where she was formed of his beautiful green cloud. Then she arose, gaz- ing within the many-colored cloud and wept, cleansing it with her tears. Within the cloud will she run about, being formed of the five plumes of her Father from which spring the clouds and the rain. From within that cloud he speaketh and within the healthful cloud is answered. From there will she look in two directions, observing. From within the beautiful green broom-grass she cometh run- ning, being formed of the green cloud. She looketh down upon his green carpet, beauti- fully outspread with fog and drizzly rains. His carpet is verdantly spread out. From there he will draw his welcome drizzle with which he will purify his child. Thence will she arise and be formed of the great beauti- ful broom-grass. Within the green lake which she watcheth will she gaze. There will she be formed of the beautiful green cloud. She will gaze all around on the shores of the spark- ling lake, beautifully outspread, whence rise the clouds. From within these clouds flash the lightnings. There will she be formed of the healthful drizzle with which he will purify his little one. There she goeth about weep- ing, seeking her sorrow within the green lake. She will depart and will gaze about beneath the heavens. Here will she come to tread just as have her father and her mother walked. In the same likeness as were her parents created, so did they form their child, with sad tears. There will she appear, walking within the beautiful green cloud where will be formed the beautiful green bead which is the garment of the Father. From there will she go beholding on his beau- tiful golden gray carpet beneath the beautiful gray heaven. There she arriveth where she will be formed with her beautiful gray plumes. Within the beautiful gray broom-grass will she gaze, purifying herself with her beauti- ful gray plumes, with which she came. Thus did she resemble her father and her mother. In the same likeness as were they formed, so also did they form their child. Then did she go beholding within the five beautiful clouds; there was she formed of the beautiful gray cloud. Thence did she look to both sides round about beneath his heavens. She began to weep, running about amidst sad tears. With many forms of cloud is she created. Round about doth she gaze upon his carpet, looking to the west where she will be formed of his beautiful black cloud. As were formed her father and her mother, so with the same like- ness do they create her. Thence did he lift his graceful cloud with which he did purify her form. He sent succor and health in his cloud, thereby augmenting his spirit. So also doth he now send succor to him who will tread between this his altar. There will she gaze into the beautiful black lake where are seated her father and her mother. With his health will he purify and with his arrows will he cast out sickness and heat. Here, running sadly about, did she seek her sorrow. Thence will she arise with his five clouds and depart. She will gaze within the lake, beautifully spread out with rain and fog. From there ariseth the cloud within which flash the light- nings. Thence will she look upon his paths where she treadeth. With his health-giving cloud is she formed. All around doth she go wandering and weeping. Round about it raineth and showereth and cloudeth up and within the cloud flash the lightnings.</page><page sequence="62">152 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL. I From his paths cometh the drizzle. From afar cometh the drizzle on his pleasant green carpet. From there above where she was placed did he send hither his child. Then did she arise within the many-colored cloud, gazing beneath the beautiful white heaven. On his beautiful white carpet did she arrive and was formed of his beautiful white cloud. She gazed within the five many-colored clouds. Thence did she go gazing within the beautiful white broom-grass where she was running. With his beautiful white arrows is she formed. Thence did she glance to both sides, gazing into the beautiful white lake where she now arriveth. From within the lakes she goeth running along the shore, pitifully weeping and speaking through her tears, seeking her father and her mother in her sadness. There was she formed with her health-giving tears. Thus did he raise his plumes unto the end round about beneath the heavens to east, north, west and south. Lifting from there his child he will purify her with the cold, the health. He will give her sight and raise her unto the beautiful green bead which is on his throne. THE REPLY OF THE FATHER OF THE GIRL With this thought have ye come. But my child knoweth nothing. She cannot grind corn; she is lazy. But if ye so desire, so must ye endure. May no ill ensue. Here have ye stopped; ye have tired yourselves, ye have stumbled and hurt yourselves. But do not think of that. Neither weep; it is the will of our spirits. I also beseech our spirits who have gone before from both sides. Ye are the children of our Lord, our Lady, our Morning Star. From afar will they come to purify you with their healthful cloud, and will give you sight. They will bring health and with their arrows will they repel the pestilence round about beneath the heavens. From them will they draw their cloud of many colors with which they will be formed. Thence will they look to both sides within the many-colored cloud. Thence will they cleanse with their cloud and their health-giving drizzle. Ye will forgive me because I have recited unto you only a few words. For I cannot repeat to you the formulas of our spirits as they appear. For they are rare and are cherished; they depart from me to the winds, for I am vile. Therefore I cannot imitate their formula, for it appeareth afar. You desired that I should hear your word clearly. But if my child so wishes, God willing, I will teach you. But nevertheless ye must forgive me these few fragments. Then will ye be enabled to say anything. With this formula, God, my Lord, my Lady, my Morning Star. With this he will give you sight, ye who will tread thus his carpet, pleasantly outspread. From his cloud above come the rains and fogs from which he raiseth his plumes which appear all about beneath the east, the north, the west and the south. There in the seven beautiful heavens sit- teth the healthful Green Woman who is our Lady who reacheth unto us her hand that we may be gathered into it. So with this formula forgive me God, thou who holdest no malice. 37. TO BEG PARDON WHEN ANGRY WITH ANOTHER adiosum anicbo'himdat to"nimor.- To God.

NOTE When one person is angry with another or on bad terms with him and wishes to resume amicable relations, he goes to the other's house and recites to him the follow- ing prayer. The influence of Christian theology is un- usually evident. TRANSLATION Greetings! Unbidden have I come hither to speak unto thee. Thou must not feel angry; I come to beg forgiveness. Neither look askance. Thou must be possessed of the spirits of those who have gone before. Thou must be possessed likewise of our Father who reacheth unto us his hand that we may go beholding throughout all hours. With their arrows do they protect us from the heat and with their chimales, which are their faces, they cast from us the plague. She who is our Lady, our Mother of Guadalupe, is watching us that we beg forgiveness. And He who is our Father, San Anton Tierra, will guard us throughout all hours that no evil may be- fall us. This only do I say unto thee. Thou needst not feel angry at me. Thou must be pos- sessed of my Lord, my Guide and Morning Star. Thus be thy thought.
