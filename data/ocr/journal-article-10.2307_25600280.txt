<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID P. HANEY The Emergence of the Autobiographical Figure in The Prelude, Book i IN analyzing the difficulty of beginning an autobiography, Louis Marin discusses the need for a "ruse of writing" to bridge the gap caused by the impossibility of representing oneself as a narrated entity.1 Because the genre of autobiography paradoxically demands the expres sion of those two experiences, one's birth and death, to which the autobiographer does not have access, autobiographical narrative must be a machination of writing in order to say either expression. Even before I have begun to write, at the beginning and at the end of the text, the impossibility of these expressions interrupts the writing of my life. To tell my life would entail taking up again this interruption, would consist of a reprise of this interruption. This reprise can never be complete, however, since it merely forces the problem of birth and death onto another plane: "This ruse of writing I. Most recent studies of The Prelude have been concerned, at least peripherally, with the rhetorical problems posed by the opening book. Herbert Lindenberger, in On Word sworth's Prelude (Princeton: Princeton U. Press, 1963) sees in Book 1 evidence of "a conflict . . . between the traditional ambitions of the epic poet and the failure of the Romantic imagination to provide both the inspiration and staying power for his appointed task" (p. 109). Geoffrey Hartman, in Wordsworth's Poetry 1787-1814 (New Haven: Yale U. Press, 1971) notes the elusiveness of Wordsworth's theme as it is initially presented by this poet "who confronts heuristically maze within maze" (p. 209). Frank D. McConnell, in The Confessional Imagination (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins U. Press, 1974) discusses the "imaginative failure" to which Wordsworth's "radical Protestantism" leads him in Book 1 (pp. 138-39). Frances Ferguson, in Wordsworth: Language as Counter-Spirit (New Haven: Yale U. Press, 1977) is concerned with the emergence in The Prelude's early stages of "the difficulty of branding one's time, words, and plans as 'my own'" (p. 126). Important articles which emphasize the problematic rhetoric of Book 1 include John Finch, "Word sworth's Two Handed Engine, in Jonathan Wordsworth, ed., Bicentenary Wordsworth Studies in Memory of John Alban Finch (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell U. Press, 1970) pp. 1-13; John F. McCarthy, "The Conflict in Books 1-11 o?The Prelude," Modern Language Quarterly, SiR, 20 (Spring 1981) 33</page><page sequence="2">34 DAVID P. HANEY would itself be made of micro-births and micro-deaths." The autobio graphical narrative, "a tissue perforated by these interruptions, all the while being taken up again in order to constitute itself into text," is thus a multi-leveled structure of interruptions and reprises.2 This representational problem is largely a function of autobiography's situation midway between the dialogical presence of "discourse," and the past, written otherness of "narrative":3 the contradiction between "auto" and "graphic." Marin discusses this problem as a puzzle within the genre of autobiography, a puzzle which requires a "ruse of writing" for its provisional solution. However, this problem first appears in The Prelude in more general terms, and in this case autobiography is not the puzzle, but rather its solution. At the beginning of The Prelude, we are forced to expand our percep tion of the role of autobiographical reprise. Our consideration of the poem's initial rhetoric must encompass the genres which, in terms of the relation between narrative and discourse, lie on either side of auto biography. These genres are the epic and the lyric, both of which resolve autobiography's ambiguity, but in opposite directions. If the story of one's own life involves a problematic intersection of narrative and dis course, then the epic's narration of events which are absolutely removed in both time and magnitude from the discursive relationship of the writer and reader or hearer (Homer's heroes and gods, or Milton's first people and angels) moves away from that ambiguity toward pure nar rative; the writing "I" is distanced from the "other" narration.4 Con 30 (1969), 370-85; Paul D.

[T]he epic past eludes identi fication with any possible present, and when we try to get back to it by means of recollection it gallops away from us like Diomedes' horses, forever at the same distance ahead of us" (p. 118).</page><page sequence="3">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 35 versely, the "presence" of a lyric utterance is as close as poetry can come to the unwritten fluidity of pure discourse, in which the "I" is not stabilized in a definite relation to a narrative, but traced along the con stantly disappearing path of the discourse itself. Wordsworth's magnification ofthe problems of autobiography can be appreciated by imagining the necessarily hypothetical attempt of a naive reader to categorize the poem on the basis of its first 300 lines: what begins as a lyric utterance which seems to be a preparation for an epic narrative suddenly resolves itself into an autobiography. The song of "present joy" gives way to the search for an epic or grandly philosophic theme, and out of the failure of that search emerges the narrative of the poet's childhood. All the problems of interruption and reprise in auto biographical writing are present in The Prelude, qua autobiography, but Wordsworth initially presents the autobiographical enterprise itself as a "reprise," a figure which constitutes the reprise of an interruption in something larger than autobiography. Autobiography is in this stage a "ruse of writing" which allows the poet to "take up again" what had been interrupted by the failure of the initial lyric outburst to resolve itself into a sustained poetic narrative. Thus, Wordsworth's autobiography must be examined from two perspectives. From one point of view, the autobiographical figure is an other-excluding unity, a whole which in carving out its space in the vacillation of experience stabilizes and simplifies experience: "a theme / Single and of determined bounds" (1, 668-69),5 whose intelligibility allows the poet to begin a coherent narrative. Such is the status of the autobiographical narrative if seen as a necessary but merely preparatory part of Wordsworth's major poetic enterprise. On its own terms, how ever, the autobiographical enterprise is a complication of experience, fraught with the problems described by Marin. In the course of The Prelude (the history of its writing as presented in the "finished" poem's rhetoric, not as reconstituted by manuscript evidence), the autobio graphical figure begins at the first of these positions, as a unifying simplication of experience which provides the poet with a beginning foothold. As The Prelude looms larger and larger as a major poem in itself instead of a mere preparation, the autobiographical figure assumes a much more complex status. Within this general movement, however, the problems of autobiographical writing itself exist side by side with the problems encountered when autobiography is placed into a figural 5.

The fol lowing selective description of Book i's rhetoric will focus the textual problems in relation to which the autobiographical figure emerges as a "solution," and will clarify my proposal that autobiography functions here in a way that is precisely "figural." In Book i, the narrative of the poet's childhood surreptitiously emerges as a unitary figure which will stabilize the vacillations of the text by inserting a realm of atemporal purity into the temporal inability of the poem to begin itself. A paradox presents itself immediately: how can the beginning of an autobiographical narrative be called "atem poral," since time is the essential medium of the autobiographer? Fur thermore, how can autobiography function as a "unitary" figure, since the discourse of autobiography is at least doubly figural, what Paul de Man calls a specular reflection of an author "of" and "in" a text?6 I will suggest that this paradox is essential to the development of the autobio graphical figure, which begins as an atemporal solution to a temporal problem, and gradually unfolds into its own complex temporality and figurality. The first 54 lines attempt a lyric purity of expression which combines narrative and discourse in a unified whole; the events described are supposedly almost coexistent with the words describing them. The interplay between words and events is like the interplay between the correspondent heavenly and subjective breezes. This necessarily tem porary unity is sustained by the exclusion of that which opposes it. For example, a "way" is established which exists independently of the sig nifying marks which would threaten its autonomy if they succeeded in involving the pure "way" in a web of signification which connected it to the outside world. should the guide I chuse Be nothing better than a wandering cloud I cannot miss my way. . . . Or shall a twig or any floating thing Upon the river point me out my course? Enough that I am free. (1, 17-33) The purity of this "way," described with a strange combination of initiative and passivity, depends on the way's ability to transcend the arbitrary markers which would otherwise be problematic to its course. 6. "Autobiography as De-facement," MLN, 94 (1979), 923.</page><page sequence="5">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 37 That is to say, the signs along the way, which may or may not be decipherable and correct (here, the clouds and twigs), can afford to be arbitrary in their signification because they are only accidental to the pure, autonomous "way" itself. In temporal terms, involvement with the past and future is rejected in favor of a present of pure intention. The immediate past is important in enabling the present freedom?the Calvert legacy has permitted Wordsworth to be "free, enfranchised and at large" (i, 9)?but in all other respects it is miraculously excluded as other in its unnaturalness: It is shaken off, As by miraculous gift 'tis shaken off, That burthen of my own unnatural self, The heavy weight of many a weary day Not mine, and such as were not made for me. (1, 21-25) The future exists only as an extension of the present's freedom: "Long months of ease and undisturbed delight / Are mine in prospect" (1, 28 29). This attempt to isolate a moment of pure kairos7 by stripping away all otherness until only pure presence remains is a recurrent element of The Prelude's rhetoric. Such a moment, to the extent that it can be achieved at all, is necessarily temporary, because that which is excluded is too essentially related to the moment to remain excluded. It is clear that if the past is partly an "enfranchisement" for the poet in these initial lines (and his financial debt to Calvert corresponds to his poetic debt to Milton for the actual statement of intentional freedom in "the earth is all before me" [1, 15]), then the "many a weary day" ofthe past cannot simply be "shaken off." Furthermore, as the subsequent lines will show, the demands of the future demonstrate that it is not really enough that he is free. Even before the subsequent text of the poem problematizes this initial freedom, the "correspondent breeze" image presents a provisionally autonomous moment of rhetorical suspension which already involves the reader in the problems inherent in that suspension. Not only do the two opposing breezes erupt in a "tempest, a redundant energy / Vexing its own creation" (1, 46-47), but the poetic convention of "inspiration" is involved in a baffling reciprocity of metaphorical reference. On one level, the succession of authority is clear: the original "sweet breath of 7. See Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (1966; rpt. London: Oxford U. Press, J973)&gt; PP- 46-47, for a discussion of the significant "moment" of kairos, which transcends the chronological/historical time ofchronos.</page><page sequence="6">38 DAVID P. HANEY heaven" (41) elicits a response from "a corresponding mild creative breeze" (43), which secondary, subjective breeze becomes "a redundant energy / Vexing its own creation" (46-47). But if to our perception of this particular interplay of the inner and outer breezes we add the met aphoric relation between internal and external breezes in general?breath and wind?the situation becomes more complicated. In this metaphoric structure involving wind, poetic inspiration, and the breath of life, the "original," suprahuman breeze is named only by an anthropomorphic metaphor as "the sweet breath of Heaven": its primacy is dependent on the secondary, subjective source of the human "breeze." That secondary breeze, in turn, is named as a "mild creative breeze"?a breeze which is creative poetic "inspiration" in its etymological sense of "breathing in"?only by means of a metaphoric link to the external wind of nature, and at a further remove to a transcendental breeze, the original "creative breeze" of God breathing life into man.8 The external breeze is named as an internal "breath," and the corresponding internal phe nomenon is named via an external "breeze." Behind the exchange of breezes which rises to an autonomous creative power, bringing with it "the holy life of music and of verse" (54), and which appears to be rooted in a transcendental source, is a metaphorical reciprocity in which the mutual dependence of the figures mitigates against the desired estab lishment of a "literal," transcendental source for the figures. One could say of Wordsworth's breezes what Jacques Derrida says of the need to name theological writing by the metaphor of human writing: "It is not, therefore, a matter of inverting the literal meaning and the figurative meaning, but of determining the 'literal' meaning of writing as meta phoricity itself."9 In Wordsworth, the proliferating reciprocity which begins in the need to name an external, supra-human breeze by the word "breath" shows a similar reduction of the origin to "metaphoricity itself." On the one hand this is a freeing, a suspension of the image in "midair" (between the two breezes, and between the "literal" and "fig urative" poles of a metaphor), akin to the positing of an autonomously free "way." On the other hand it indicates the problems involved in attempting to raise such freedom to a transcendental level by giving it a "literal" divine source. Despite all these suggestions of difficulties to come, The Prelude's initial lyric outburst presents itself as a uniquely autonomous unity of narrative and discourse. With line 55, however, we enter the world of 8. Cf. this latter use of "breeze" in ii, 244-25, and in MS JJ, 11. 110-14 (Norton Prelude P- 489). 9. Of Grammatology, trans.

Press, 1976), p. 15.</page><page sequence="7">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 39 narrative, in which the speaking poet's words have a necessarily prob lematic relation to the "other" self who is described in the narrative. As he describes the spontaneous autonomy of the initial outburst? poetic numbers came Spontaneously, and clothed in priestly robe My spirit, thus singled out, as it might seem, For holy services (i, 60^63) ?the speaking poet distances himself from that autonomy by noting the unity of song and event as an aberration in his poetic life; he is not used to making "a present joy the matter of my song" (56). By enshrining lines 1-54 within the clearly delimited boundaries of narrative, objecti fying them in the past, the poet reinforces the unity of narrative and discourse within those first lines, but only at the expense of a new split between the now "other" narrative of that unity and the present dis course of the poet, for whom that unity is an irretrievable, unique past event which exists only in the otherness of narrative. This shift in the status of the discursive voice is emphasized by the difference between the "friend" of line 5?the gentle breeze of the lyric outburst?and the "friend" of line 55: Coleridge, as the addressee of the new discursive dialogue. The structure of the poem demands, of course, such a differ entiation between the present of the writing poet and a narrative past, between the poet's writing consciousness and an "other" series of events or even states of mind which are susceptible to written articulation. The very act of writing entails a state of being "always already" in the past10?a contingency of which Wordsworth is acutely aware?and the structure of any work more extensive than a lyric seems to depend for its intelligibility on such a distinction between the present of the writer and the temporal otherness of his text. Once the preamble is established in a narrative context, its delicate lyric balance as a "way" with no goal outside itself, and as a fusion of "song" and "present joy," no longer needs to be supported entirely from within. Its lyric purity is now that of a museum piece, guaranteed by its enshrinement in the inviolable, but by the same token nonpresent, space of retrospective narrative. The poet is thus able to take some liberties with the idyllic opening scene when he returns to it in line 68. In the first place, what in lines 1-54 was a freedom of pure, non-directed io. For a contemporary philosophical statement of this notion, see Hegel's discussion of the inevitable pastness of "Now," as demonstrated by the fact that the referent of a written "Now" will always be in the past. Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. A.V. Miller (London: Oxford U. Press, 1977), p. 60.</page><page sequence="8">40 DAVID P. HANEY intentional possibility is now given the explicit form of an intention whose end is imagined: I made a choice Of one sweet vale whither my steps should turn And saw, methought, the very house and fields Present before my eyes. (i, 81-84) In the second place, the poet is able to describe his partial loss of consciousness as he achieves a mild form of that "serene and blessed mood" in which, as described in "Tintern Abbey," "we are laid asleep / In body, and become a living soul" (45-6): soothed by a sense of touch From the warm ground, that balanced me, else lost Entirely, seeing nought, nought hearing. (1, 89-91) While the poet's idyllic mood seems relatively unchanged from that of lines 1-54, it is rhetorically significant that only here, when the scene is placed in a narrative past, is he able 1) to add to the picture a future object of desire (the chosen vale) which would have interfered with the pure, internally-sustained "presence" of lines 1-54, and 2) to describe a state of half-consciousness in which the conscious narrator must have some distance from the half-conscious object of narration. The atemporal, autonomous moment of discursive and narrative unity can only be preserved in a differentiated structure which divides narrative from dis course, a structure which preserves but also distances that moment; the poet can add future events and half-conscious states to the moment without endangering its purity, but his verse can no longer participate in the moment. Despite the division of the verse into a past "that day" and a time of writing about "that day," in a larger sense narrative and discourse are still closely allied. The poet is writing his way toward the establishment of a theme for his poem, and the path he follows in writing of his poetic difficulties problematically intersects the difficulties themselves. This complex relationship can be traced in the series of discursive and nar rative divisions which follows the preamble. The separation of the present, discursive voice into discourse and narrative after the initial lyric outburst (a kind of divisive degeneration from the perspective of that initial freedom and autonomy) is followed very shortly by a parallel falling off on the level of the now "past" events, in the narration of the disappearing Eolian visitations:</page><page sequence="9">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 41 the banded host Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds, And lastly utter silence. (i, 105^07) First the discursive text loses impetus and becomes a museum piece preserved as other to the discourse of the poem (the initial outburst becomes a past event), then a division occurs within that "preserved" space of narrative itself. Thus the initial idyllic union of event and song is perceived as a narrative past not only from the perspective of the writer's discursive present, but also from the perspective of the now inspirationless narrated poet. This second division, threatening to halt the poem in "utter silence," is countered by a further division: the poet whose journey is being narrated suddenly adopts the guise of a "peas ant," in an attempt to recapture the presence and autonomous joy ofthe opening lyric outburst. 'be it so, It is an injury', said I, 'to this day To think of any thing but present joy.' So, like a peasant, I pursued my road Beneath the evening sun, nor had one wish Again to bend the sabbath of that time To a servile yoke. (1, 107-13) The poetic voice is still Wordsworth's, of course, and the "peasant" is created out of poetic allusions, but a division appears between the poetic voice and the precisely non-poetic aspirations of the traveller who has become "like a peasant." This non-poetic point of view is actually anti poetic; the Eolian visitations are now seen as enslavement to a "servile yoke." The soul's frustrated search for a spiritual plenitude, suggested by the angelic "banded host of harmony," gives way to the passive acceptance of a material plenitude, an "endless store of things" (118; emphasis added). This abandonment to the "presence" ofthe peasant life is non-poetic in rhetorical ways as well. It does not, as the poem's opening lines do, bring together the time of events and the time of poetic expression. Rather, the "peasant" mode refuses to appropriate time to poetry; to "bend the sabbath of that time / To a servile yoke" would be an injurious enslavement. The opening lines attempted to present poetic expression and narrative time as effortlessly united, while the peasant-poet conversely strives for a unitary presence by emanci pating time's events from poetry's expression. Appropriately, the writ</page><page sequence="10">42 DAVID P. HANEY ing poet refrains from even narrating this non-poetic joy?"what need of many words?" (113)?as if to reinforce the "peasant's" desire not to enslave time to poetry. This new "present joy" is an inadequate solution to the developing textual problem of proliferating divisions in what began as an autono mous unity of narrative and discourse. In order to avoid silence, the poet (the narrated, not the writing poet) adopts the mask of a peasant, but this mask literally writes him out of the poem. The progress of the poem has been preserved insofar as the discourse has established an unproblematic relation to an "other" narrative (the poet writes of the journey of the "peasant"), but a serious problem afflicting this rhetorical move is that the peasant is not, by the narrator's own admission, a fit subject for an extended narrative. The guise of the peasant is soon put off, however, and the ambitious "poet" reappears: "But speedily a longing in me rose, / To brace myself to some determin'd aim" (123-24). At this point the relation between discourse and narrative takes a new turn. The "hopes" of the poet are described in the past: I had hopes Still higher, that with a frame of outward life, I might endue, might fix in a visible home Some portion of those phantoms of conceit That had been floating loose about so long, And to such beings temperately deal forth The many feelings that oppressed my heart. (1, 127-33) However, the separation between discourse and narrative is here ex tremely tenuous, because the narrative past in these lines is linked, in its content as well as its form, to the discursive present in such a way as to threaten the very structure of the poem's articulation. For these recol lected difficulties to be firmly established in a past, they would need to have been solved at some time prior to the writing present; according to the rhetoric of the narrative voice at this point, such is not yet the case. Just as the "phantoms of conceit" are still "floating loose" at the time of the writing of their having been floating loose, the narrative structure in which these thoughts are articulated is not anchored in a distinction between narrative and discourse, and is itself "floating loose," not yet "fix[ed] in a visible home." Precisely at this point, the distinction between narrative and discourse, already tenuous, collapses entirely in</page><page sequence="11">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 43 a change of tense from present perfect to present;11 at line 134, the poet suddenly switches from past ambition to present disappointment: But I have been discouraged: gleams of light Flash often from the east, then disappear, And mock me with a sky that ripens not Into a steady morning. (1, 134-37; emphasis added) While a few lines earlier the need to sustain a narrative-discourse struc ture resulted in the adoption of a fictional and inadequate object of narration (the poet became a peasant), now a more authentic narrative discourse structure (the poet is writing about himself as a poet) collapses into the confessional mode, in which the distinction between narrative and discourse disappears for all practical purposes. The past is reduced to the status of a "sweet promise"; the ongoing discursive present, unsupported by a meaningful relation to the past, is nothing but a series of repeated impediments: if my mind, Remembering the sweet promise of the past, Would gladly grapple with some noble theme, Vain is her wish?where'er she turns she finds Impediments from day to day renewed. (1, 137-41) The next 109 lines engage in speculation on possible poetic themes. Having temporarily stepped out of the narrative-discourse structure which the beginning of this book problematically established and un dercut, the poet simply desires those structures and laments their ab sence, instead of attempting to erect them. He wishes to place his poetic consciousness, from its "vital soul" (161) to "external things" (165), into a relation with an "other" theme: "Time, place, and manners, these I seek" (169). The catalogue of possible themes is epic in proportion and allusion, but ironic in function, because it is an enumeration of what the poet is presently unable to write. The naked discursive present of these lines is ironically reinforced by this catalogue of non-existent narratives. In contrast with the pure present ofthe opening lines, which combined discourse and narrative by attempting to "narrate" "present" events, these lines manifest a negative present: a present whose primary content is its lack of narrative past. 11. For a useful discussion of the ambiguous temporality implied by Wordsworth's frequent use of the present perfect tense, see Julian Boyd and Zelda Boyd, "The Perfect of Experience," SiR, 16 (1977), 3-13.</page><page sequence="12">44 DAVID P. HANEY No narrative tale is found for the poet to "summon back from lone some banishment" (174), and the "philosophic song" (230) is put off in trust "that mellower years will bring a riper mind" (237). Sandwiched between these rejections is the famous description of the autobiograph ical theme. It is given less space than the other two themes, but its rejection is of a different order. Both the epic and the philosophical themes are rejected for external reasons, the former because no appro priate tale comes to hand, and the latter because it is better reserved for the future. The autobiographical theme, however, is rejected because of its internally problematic nature. Sometimes it suits me better to invent A tale from my own heart, more near akin To my own passions and habitual thoughts; Some variegated story, in the main Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts Before the very sun that brightens it, Mist into air dissolving! (1850, 1, 221-27) Frances Ferguson rightly points to the sun and mist image here as central to the problems of The Prelude. In addition, it is worth noting that the image does not appear until the second correction of MS D. This places it, according to de Selincourt's and Darbishire's evidence, in the 1830's, and encourages us to read this image as a retrospective comment on the problems which Wordsworth sees in his autobiography as a reader of the poem more than 25 years after its initial completion. I propose, however, to invert Ms. Ferguson's particular interpretation, according to which The sun which has been gradually projected from within becomes a counteragent, an intransigent other which dissolves structure into mist into air. This curious drifting of the sun itself becomes em blematic of an analogous movement which Wordsworth discerns in language?its tendency to convert itself into a counter-spirit which seems always to threaten the possibility of the poet's chang ing his internal story into an external story.12 The sun's dissolving/illuminating action may be emblematic of a lin guistic otherness which prohibits successful exteriorization of the self, but the "drifting of the sun itself" is at best only implicit in these lines. 12. Ferguson, pp. 129-30.</page><page sequence="13">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 45 The only exteriorization undergone by the sun in this passage consists in the difference between the metaphor's interior tenor (the self) and exterior vehicle (the sun). This relationship is no more characterized by "drifting" than in any other necessarily "exterior" metaphor for the self, and is in fact firmly established in the philosophical and literary tradition which links the sun's illumination to the process of intellection and perception. The image suggests more clearly the inability of the autobiographical object (the past self) to maintain an otherness in narrative which can both withstand the illumination of the poet's discourse, and sustain its necessary link with the self of that discourse. Just as the sun dissolves what it illuminates, the light thrown on his own past by the autobio graphical poet tends to dissolve that past "I" by implicating it in the present "I" which the speaking discourse is unable to signify. According to Marin, this ego produced by speech has a present presence which is only implicitly present in its discourse. No signifier marks it in its own right. The discursive process alone traces it and traces it only be cause discourse exists instead of silence.13 Insofar as his poetic object is the poet's own self, as in "a tale from my own heart," it will fade into the undescribable subjectivity of the dis cursive poetic voice, the "I" which can produce and trace, but not signify itself in its own discourse. The sun and mist image is an appropriately complex vehicle for this perception of self-writing as self-dissolving. As Derrida points out in "White Mythology," the sun is an important intersection between the sensible and the metaphorical: "it is the paradigm of what is sensible and of what is metaphorical. . . . [T]he orbit of the sun is the trajectory of metaphor."14 This intersection is illustrated at the edge ofthe dissolving mist in Wordsworth's image: the constantly disappearing line between the sensible "I" of the poet and the "I" emerging from the poem's extended metaphor for that sensible self. An important element of this connection is the metaphorical relation ship, also studied by Derrida, between the sun and the perceiving mind, between sensible light and perceptual enlightenment. This metaphor occupies an important place in the metaphorical and dialectical relation between mind and nature in Wordsworth; at the end of the "Immortal ity" ode, 13- Marin, pp. 602-03. 14. Trans. F.C T. Moore, New Literary History, 6 (1974), 52.</page><page sequence="14">46 DAVID P. HANEY The Clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality. Earlier in Book I of The Prelude, frustrated inspiration is seen as a false sunrise: gleams of light Flash often from the east, then disappear, And mock me with a sky that ripens not Into a steady morning. (i, 134-37) Paul de Man suggests the relevance of the connection between the sun and the mind in terms of reading: Knowledge and mind imply language and account for the relation set up between the sun and the text of the epitaph: the epitaph, says Wordsworth, "is open to the day; the sun looks down upon the stone, and the rains of heaven beat against it." The sun becomes the eye that reads the text of the epitaph.15 The eye, according to Hegel, has power not to consume what it perceives,"16 but the Wordsworthian sun/eye shines upon the mist of the autobiographical image, dissolving as it illuminates, preventing the "I" (or "eye") of present poetic perception from holding the image of its past at an illuminated distance. The conflict, implicit in this metaphor, between the sun's power to dissolve and the eye's power to perceive, is at least temporarily reconciled at the end of Book 1, when "our infancy itself" will have "almost" become "a visible scene on which the sun is shining" (662-63; emphasis added). This tendency for the discursive "I's" reading of its past, other self to absorb and dissolve that self is mirrored by the discursive "I's" tendency, because it cannot be signified, to fade into its other objectification. In one sense, an autobiographical text presents us with nothing but an objectification whose originating "I" is by definition absent, or which can be located only in what de Man calls the specular structure of the autobiographical moment, which "happens as an alignment between the two subjects involved in the process of reading in which they determine each other by mutual reflexive substitution."17 However, autobiogra phy must posit a writing "I" who is situated "before" the text we read 15- De Man, p. 926. 16. Derrida, "White Mythology," p. 56. 17. De Man, p. 921.</page><page sequence="15">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 47 but "after" the events recorded in that text. Borges describes the ephem eral existence of this pretextual "I" as it disappears into the objective otherness of "Borges": I am destined to perish, definitively, and only some instant of myself can survive in him [Borges]. Little by little, I am giving over everything to him, though I am quite aware of his perverse custom of falsifying and magnifying things. ... I shall remain in Borges, not in myself (if it is true that I am someone), but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others. . . . Thus my life is a flight and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion, or to him. I do not know which of us has written this page.18 The discursive "I's" tendency to absorb or be absorbed by its narrative objectification accounts for the state of frustration which precedes the "Was it for this . . .?" passage and the subsequent commitment to autobiography. We saw that the discursive voice could not stand alone; the opening lyric quickly divided into a structure of discourse and narrative. That structure vacillated between the discourse's potential collapse into the almost total otherness of the "peasant" guise at one extreme, and the fading of the narrative into discursive confession (in the "I have been discouraged" passage of 134-37) at the other extreme. The inability to stabilize the relation between discourse and narrative finally expresses itself as an inability to write at all: I recoil and droop, and seek repose In indolence from vain perplexity, Unprofitably travelling toward the grave, Like a false steward who hath much received And renders nothing back. (1, 267-71) This guilty indolence is grounded in the poet's dissatisfaction with both the narrative object?"for either still I find / Some imperfection in the chosen theme" (263-64)?and his own discursive powers: "I see of absolute accomplishment / Much wanting ... in myself" (266-67). He can not even write true autobiography, which demands a carefully balanced discursive and narrative structure; all he can do is chronicle his frustration. Text and life are locked into an unprofitable symbiosis in which the despair in life is fed by the unhappy state of the text, while the text can do nothing but chronicle that despair. 18.

HANEY Out of this problematic set of relationships emerges the figure of the poet's life as a solution, a "ruse of writing" which alters the course of the poet's graveward journey in a complex network of rhetorical moves. Was it for this That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song, And from his alder shades and rocky falls, And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice That flowed along my dreams? For this didst thou, O Derwent, travelling over the green plains Near my 'sweet birthplace', didst thou, beauteous stream, Make ceaseless music through the night and day, Which with its steady cadence tempering Our human waywardness, composed my thoughts To more than infant softness, giving me Among the fretful dwellings of mankind, A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm Which Nature breathes among the hills and groves? When, having left his mountains, to the towers Of Cockermouth that beauteous river came, Behind my father's house he passed, close by, Along the margin of our terrace walk. He was a playmate whom we dearly loved: Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child, A naked boy, in one delightful rill, A little mill-race severed from his stream, Made one long bathing of a summer's day, Basked in the sun, and plunged, and basked again, Alternate, all a summer's day, or coursed Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves Of yellow grunsel; or, when crag and hill, The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height, Were bronzed with a deep radiance, stood alone Beneath the sky, as if I had been born On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut Had run abroad in wantonness to sport, A naked savage, in the thunder-shower. (i, 271-304) We know that earlier manuscripts of The Prelude began with the half line, "Was it for this . . .?". Thus it is clear that the establishment of a continuity between the poet's present disappointment and the beginning</page><page sequence="17">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 49 of his early life's narrative?the dovetailing of the previously written autobiographical beginning into the problematic discourse of the fore going lines?is a carefully planned rhetorical move. Whatever the orig inal antecedent for "this,"19 the division between the two sections is partially erased by the import ofthe question, "Was it for this . . .?" which in the completed versions continues the theme of despair by treating the past as a mere preparation for the present mood. The two sections are also joined by the syntax of the question, in which the pronoun "this" depends on the previous passage for its meaning. At the same time, we perceive a break in continuity in the shift from present despair to childhood peace. The musical term, "syncopation" (one of Marin's metaphors for the "autobiographical interruption") perhaps best describes this bridging of a rhetorical gap. Marin describes syncopation as the liaison of the last note of a measure with the first of the following measure, giving the appearance of one single note, so that the end of a note in one section is heard at the same time as the beginning of a note belonging to the following section.20 The term "syncopation" emphasizes the curious relation between the "gap" and the "bridge" in this situation. It is not as if a pre-existent gap is suddenly bridged; rather, the same gesture is both an interruption of continuity and a synchronization of discontinuity. Just as the link be tween musical sections effected by syncopation is heard as an interruption in the continuity of non-syncopated measures, the question "Was it for this . . .?" links the two sections of the poem with a gesture which interrupts the poem as it meshes the two sections into a single syntactic unit. This "syncopation" in The Prelude allows the past self to interrupt the poem as something other to its present discourse, capable of being narrated, but in a gesture which also affirms an identity between that narrated self and the discursive present. By allowing the past, narrated self to make its appearance along the contours of a discursive question, the poet portrays that self as something which is in part coexistent with an ongoing, living discourse, and is not simply a signified, and therefore 19- See Stephen Parrish, ed., The Prelude, 1798-99 (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell U. Press, 1977). Parrish suggests that, because the earliest drafts of the preamble "express in images of wind and storm the turbulence of feeling that marked a surge of creative energy . . . 'this' seems here to have been the powerful disturbance of mind occasioned by a supera bundant flow of inspiration?not incapacity, or guilt, or self-reproach of the type that later entered the 'post-preamble'" (p. 6). 20. Marin, p. 598.</page><page sequence="18">50 DAVID P. HANEY other, object in narrative. Thus the childhood's necessary connection to the writing present is maintained; a self emerges, not fully weaned from the discouse which, because it emanates from (a later manifestation of) that self, traces but does not signify the self. On the other hand, that happy childhood is specifically different from the depressing present, and thus has sufficient "otherness" to be signified without "melt[ing] / before the very sun that brightens it." A question such as "Was it for this . . . ?" can permit this transition to be suspended between the equally unsatisfactory alternatives of iden tity and otherness because it allows for two contrary answers. An affir mative answer ("Yes, this despair is the only end of childhood joy") gives the past a direct causal relation to the present, thus identifying past and present selves, but this negative identity makes the autobiographical enterprise not only pointless, but also impossible, since the present?the effect of childhood causes?is constituted by an inability to write, to "render back." A negative answer ("No, this despair is not the only end of childhood joy") suggests the possibility that the childhood joy might lead in a direction other than the present despair; but such an answer at this point would, by negating a causal link between past and present, make the child totally other to the essentially despairing discursive poet, and the narration of that youth an exercise in fiction, not autobiography. From the perspective of The Prelude as a whole, the question is rhetor ical?the positive ending of the poem demands a negative answer to the question?but this beginning gesture of the poet's autobiography, with its need to balance or "syncopate" the identity and otherness of the past self in relation to present self, requires a suspension of that decision. To give a "right" answer would presume a knowledge not only of the past, but also of the present "for" which that past existed. Such an answer could only come from an "I" for whom both the narrative past and the discursive present were in the other, narrative realm of that which can be known from the outside. Such an "I" would eclipse the present discourse/narrative structure, transforming both into the narrative past of its new viewpoint. Wordsworth will attempt to present such knowl edge in Book xm as he rises above his life atop Mount Snowdon. Until that point, however, the poem's rhetoric depends on the active engage ment of the discoursing poet in his narrative, an involvement which precludes objective knowledge of the continuously fluctuating discursive present. Another way in which this beginning question suspends the poet's authority over his text can be seen in this question's role in the epic tradition. The most relevant instance of the question, usually addressed to his Muse, with which the epic poet begins the main body of his narrative, is of course in Paradise Lost:</page><page sequence="19">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 51 Say first, for heaven hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep tract of hell, say first what cause Moved our grandparents in that happy state, Favoured of heaven so highly, to fall off From their creator, and transgress his will For one restraint, lords ofthe world besides? Who first seduced them, to that foul revolt? The infernal serpent; he it was. (i, 27-34) The traditional epic question confirms the stability of the poet's relation to his subject: the bard asks the muse for information, and his poetic authority is asserted by the muse's prompt answer. Wordsworth's use of the convention is ironic in the sense that his question, because it is unanswered and it marks a syncopation in the narrative, suspends the possibility of an authoritative relation between the poet and his narrative. Before examining in detail the precise nature of the autobiographic figure as it suddenly appears in Book 1, I should justify my use of the word "figure." The autobiographical narrative appears as a "figure" first of all in the sense of a trope of substitution. For the diffuse, problematic combination of genres and rhetorical relationships leading up to "Was it for this . . . ?" is substituted the concrete image of a narrated life. This is specifically a synecdochal substitution, since autobiography was one ofthe possible themes in the matrix of indecision in the earlier lines, a part which is now substituted for that whole. From the broader perspective of the end of Book 1, the autobiographical narrative is seen as the substitution of "a theme / Single and of determined bounds," not simply for the chaos of indecision, but for the potential "work / Of ampler or more varied argument" (668-71) which was thus to be de layed. As a "figure," however, the autobiographical narrative not only dis places, but also refers to and shows forth a larger philosophical argu ment. In a complex way, Wordsworth participates in what, according to John N. Morris, is the tendency of an autobiography's narrative continuity to function as an emblem of a philosophical statement about the self.21 In The Prelude, this figural structure consists of, on the one hand, a discursive "argument" (both in the sense of a dialogical debate and the presentation of a statement) dealing with the being of a poet, and on the other hand a semi-continuous line of narration which figures that argument. That relationship combines the continuity between the narrative and the poet's present with the otherness of that past narrative 2i. John N. Morris, Versions of the Self: Studies in English Autobiography from John Bunyan to John Stuart Mill (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), p. 12.</page><page sequence="20">52 DAVID P. HANEY to the discursive present. This combination is analogous to metaphor's combination of identity and difference in the relation between tenor and vehicle: the autobiographical "vehicle" must resemble the "tenor" con stituted by the discursive argument in order to show it forth, but the vehicle must also be an other entity. The autobiographical narrative appears in a figural relation to the discursive argument not only as a synchronic trope of substitution, but also in the diachronic sense outlined by Erich Auerbach. In Mimesis, he quotes and elaborates his own earlier definition of "figural interpreta tion": Figural interpretation "establishes a connection between two events or persons in such a way that the first signifies not only itself but also the second, while the second involves or fulfills the first. The two poles of a figure are separate in time, but both, being real events or persons, are within temporality. They are both contained within the flowing stream which is historical life, and only the comprehension, the intellectus spiritualis, of their interdependence is a spiritual act."22 By linking the joy of youth with the despair of the present in the question "Was it for this . . . ?" Wordsworth suggests precisely this relation. The present state of despair, he fears, might be a fulfillment of the childhood which signifies the present by prefiguring it, existing "for" it. Thus the narrative of the past, at this point consisting of the joy of childhood, is in a diachronically figural relation to the discursive present. The relationship is complicated by the poet's fear that the figural mechanism is ironic, that the figure of joyful childhood is "fulfilled" by its opposite, despair. According to Auerbach, figural interpretation depends for its intelli gibility on a higher power which guarantees the connection between the figural poles, a connection which "can be established only if both occur rences are vertically linked to Divine Providence, which alone is able to devise such a plan of history and supply the key to its understanding."23 Wordsworth's beginning question similarly implies the existence of a higher, in his case unknown, Providence at whose command his joyful youth was "for" nothing besides the present despair. Because his life appears discontinuous here, his personal identity (in Locke's sense of a continuous consciousness)24 is insufficient to guarantee a meaningful connection between past and present, the "promise" and "fulfillment" 22. Trans. Willard D. Trask (1953, rpt. Princeton: Princeton U. Press, 1973), p. 74. 23. Ibid., p. 74. 24. See An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Book n, Chapter xxvn, par. 10.</page><page sequence="21">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 53 aspects of the figure. One effect of Wordsworth's suggestion that an ironic figural relationship obtains between past and present selves (a Humean critique ofthe "continuous consciousness" theory of personal identity)25 is to place into question the "vertical link" to a creator and interpreter of the figural relationship, thereby initiating a search for a guarantor within, rather than above the figural relation. The uneasy relationship between the poles of the Wordsworthian fgura is also apparent in the figural relation between The Prelude and The Recluse. In the relation between the past and present selves of the poet there is a fear that the relation may be only ironically figural; in the relation between the two poems, the effective substitution of The Prelude for The Recluse defers the figural "fulfillment" of The Prelude indefinitely. The presentation of the poet's youthful self as a "figure" in all these senses is mediated by another figure, that of the river Derwent. It is significant that the emergence of The Prelude's major structural figure (autobiographical narration) coincides with the first fully developed in stance of one ofthe poem's primary images, the river. The joyful unity of boyhood presents itself as an alternative to and unitary figure "for" the convoluted, diffracted consciousness of the preceding lines and of the adult poet, but that autonomous unity is maintained by its own special type of figure: the relationship between the river and the boy. The river's course, parallel to the boy's, is both an image for and a constitutive part of his youthful joy. The river functions rhetorically as a metonym; in the question, "Was it for this / That one, the fairest of all rivers . . . sent a voice / That flow'd along my dreams?", the river, contiguous to the boy in nature, is substituted for the boy in his rela tionship to the adult poet. At the same time, this metonymic river actually helps to effect the youthful joy it represents; its music, says the poet, "compos'd my thoughts / To more than infant softness." The emblematically unitary figural relationship between the boy and the river is guaranteed by their contiguous presence in nature, and by the river's ability to aid in effecting that which it represents. That the child of Book i is characterized by an autonomy based on the exclusion of that which is other to him is emphasized by the content and rhetoric of his initial description. The image of the river itself stresses this other-excluding autonomy: Oh! many a time have I, a five years' child, A naked boy, in one delightful rill, A little mill-race severed from his stream, Made one long bathing of a summer's day. 2$. See David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Part iv, Section vi.</page><page sequence="22">54 DAVID P. HANEY The boy exists in the enclosed space of a mill-race which is specifically separated from the main stream. The self-contained unity of the expe rience is emphasized in the repeated "ones": one rill, one long bathing. The boy is naked, removed even from the otherness of clothing. The rhetoric of the developing river image similarly suggests an ex cluding, narrowing focus which severs the youth from his problematic relations to the otherness of the writing present. What begins as a question about the river's significance for the discursive present gradually becomes a collection of statements about the river itself. The future which the river and the boy figure in the question, "Was it for this . . . ?" is gradually forgotten and excluded as first the river, and then the boy emerge as independent topics of discussion. In revising these lines, Wordsworth emphasized this exclusion. In MS JJ, the phrase "Was it for this," linking the child to the gloomy present, occurs twice after its initial appearance, once in the above-quoted passage, whose first line initially read "Was it for this, that I, a four years Child," and once a few lines earlier. Later versions exclude these repetitions, emphasizing the autonomy of the narrative of childhood joy by omitting the rhetor ical links between these lines and the "present" state of despair preceding line 271. This image of childhood autonomy and, as we shall see, atemporality, is precariously balanced in relation to nature, whose temporal, differ entiated otherness to the child both threatens and maintains his atem poral, unified identity. Equally precarious is the autonomous child's relation to itself, since the narrated child will eventually become the very substance of problematic autobiographical temporality. This precarious balance is intimated at the outset: although the child first appears sur round by a paradisal, Combray-like atmosphere of timeless originality, that atmosphere veils a rhetorical infrastructure which suggests the nec essarily fictional, secondary status of the poet's childhood paradise. The initial description of the child culminates in the image of the "naked savage": as if I had been born On Indian Plains, and from my mother's hut Had run abroad in wantonness to sport, A naked savage, in the thunder-shower. (1, 301-04) The boy appears as an "original" human, both tied to the purity of his own origin in his mother's hut, and possessed of an original, naturally wanton energy in himself, specifically distinguished from that maternal hut from which he had "run abroad." Already, however, the problems</page><page sequence="23">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 55 of an "original" child begin to appear: the savage boy's aboriginal purity requires a paradoxical link to and severance from his maternal origin. More importantly, this aboriginal state can be expressed only as some thing necessarily other to the youth who is nominally its referent: the "as if" in line 301 emphasizes the fact that the savage is merely a simile, and the scene is set in the unknown foreignness of the American wil derness. In contrast to this simile of originality, the "real" description of the boy immediately following "was it for this . . . ?" uses the mediatory river image to emphasize his non-originality. The interdependence of the boy and the river suggests that his autonomy is relative to nature; his beginning is not autonomous, but rather a baptism in nature. Fur thermore, the mother is absent. The fact that she has been replaced at the very beginning by a secondary nurse is more than just biographical accuracy; it suggests the already secondary beginning of the boy as he exists in The Prelude. A final indication of the secondary status of the boy's beginning is evident in the poet's description of his own birthplace, the one explicit reference to his own real origin, when he borrows and specifically quotes a phrase from Coleridge's "Frost at Midnight." Thus, on the one hand the level of factual description provides only secondary traces of an original state (the nurse and the river), and on the other hand, originality itself is expressible only in explicitly borrowed and therefore non-original language (whether from Coleridge or the Indian plains).26 In either case, the autonomy ofthe child is qualified by the fact that, within the poem written by his later self (who has not expe rienced his own origin), the child, beginning his life, will always be secondary, linked to an anterior but inaccessible origin.27 The necessarily secondary nature of the child's "original" purity in timates the autobiographical difficulties which will come as the figure of the child develops, but the rhetoric of Book 1 suggests at least a desire for a distinction between the atemporal unity of the child, and the temporality and differentiation of the surrounding nature. The ice skat ing episode (11. 452-89) presents one of the most suggestive versions of this situation. 26. The problem of depicting one's "original" self was even more explicit for Rousseau; Juliet Flower MacCannell has examined Rousseau's use of self-portraiture to "portray, not the life of the self, but that hiatus which is its primitive state." "History and Self-Portrait in Rousseau's Autobiography," SiR, 13 (1974), p. 288. 27. The discontinuity between passively posited "origins" and "beginnings" is exhaus tively studied by Edward Said in Beginnings: Intention and Method (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1975). See esp. pp. 32-33, 44-46, 143, 174-75. Said's discussion of the problematic structures of textual authority entailed by "beginnings" has been generally helpful in my attempt to understand the rhetorical problem of The Prelude's beginnings.</page><page sequence="24">56 DAVID P. HANEY Like the "naked savage" above, the boy has again "run abroad in wantonness," but this time to participate in a social imitation of "nat ural" activities, not to exist in a solitary, semi-original state. The skaters initially appear in a world which is free and self-contained, cut off from "home"?the boy acts "like an untired horse / That cares not for its home" (459-60)?and home's call to return: "I heeded not the sum mons" (455). Temporally, the skaters experience the freedom of the threshold, the "happy time" of twilight, which belongs neither to night nor to day, but which, because of its pure liminality, has a heightened glory of its own:28 "visible for many a mile / The cottage windows through the twilight blazed" (453-54). The freedom of this state, how ever, is obtained at the expense of a direct accord with nature, because the skaters' games are imitations of the hunt: We hissed along the polished ice in games Confederate, imitative of the chace And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, The pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. (1, 461-64) The activity is free and self-contained, but also secondary and mimetic, involving imitation rather than direct experience of hunting's pleasures. This is typical ofthe Wordsworthian threshold scene, in which a space that is ambiguously non-existent and intensely existent?the intensity of the no-man's land of twilight?is curiously mimetic, and in this case metaphoric (the skaters metaphorically identify themselves with hunt ers), perhaps because, as Angus Fletcher says, "Metaphor is a semantic process of balancing at the threshold . . . metaphor provides the freedom . . . of momentary masking."29 This state of metaphorical liminality is necessarily momentary, and owes its existence to the imminent threat from the outside. This is suggested when ministering Nature transforms the echo of the skaters' shouts of freedom into "an alien sound / Of melancholy, not unnoticed" (470-71). When the skaters' "din" reaches outside the boundaries of their enclosed, mimetic world, it returns transformed into a reminder of Nature's essential otherness. The same sound that expresses the joy 28. See Angus Fletcher, "'Positive Negation': Threshold, Sequence, and Personification in Coleridge," in Geoffrey Hartman, ed., New Perspectives on Coleridge and Wordsworth: Selected Papers From the English Institute (N.Y.: Columbia U. Press, 1972): "though the threshold is temporally rion-existent, a phantom-place, the passage across this no-man's land seems to be more intense, experientially, than life either inside or outside the temple, inside or outside the labyrinth. The threshold unmakes the dialectic of inside and outside, replacing it by an unmediating passage between" (p. 140). 29. Ibid., p. 161.</page><page sequence="25">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 57 of their free, atemporal twilight world is reflected back to them, "into the tumult sent" (470), as if directly from Nature. That sound functions as a sign of their world's horizon: it expresses the space of autonomous liminality, but doubles back as a sign of the imminent return of Nature's otherness, the otherness whose exclusion from the twilight world had been a constitutive part of that world's autonomy. It is appropriate that this "alien sound," announcing the encroaching otherness of Nature, occurs at twilight: while the distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed; while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. (1, 469-73) The alien sound is accompanied by night's encroachment on the pure liminality of twilight, and the verse itself is usurped by the alien sound of an extra foot in line 471.30 The events described next place the child at "the still point of the turning world" (to borrow Eliot's phrase)31 in an emblem of his relation to Nature at this point in The Prelude. These events involve an inter change between motion and stillness on both the objective and the subjective levels. First the "shadowy banks" are perceived "spinning still / The rapid line of motion" (481-82). The perceived motion of the banks reaches the point of stillness, with the ambiguity of "still" (mean ing both "motionless" and "yet") maintaining the delicate tension be tween motion and its opposite which constitutes the experienced still ness. When the boy ceases his own motion, objective Nature takes it on; the cliffs continue to wheel by, and he feels as if he, in his stillness, is experiencing the turning of the earth itself. Thus he induces in himself a magnified version of his role in Book 1, as an autonomous, as yet atemporal entity, motionless in relation to a turning world, to a chang ing, differentiated Nature which he experiences as other to himself. This presentation of herself in relation to the boy is in essence Nature's "lesson"; the "presences of Nature" (490) thus did make The surface of the universal earth With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, Work like a sea. (1, 498-soi) 30. Norton Prelude, p. 52n. 31. "Burnt Norton," 1. 62.</page><page sequence="26">58 DAVID P. HANEY An important question arises here, however, in regard to the role of the will in this paradigm of a changing, temporal Nature in opposition to a motionless, atemporal boy. In the skating episode, the boy's stillness in relation to the turning world is an illusion generated by his own motion. The boy's willed activity, both in breaking away from the crowd and in stopping short, generates the entire sequence of events, including the illusion that he feels the world rotating as he remains still. Similarly, the alien voice of Nature which threatens the autonomous world ofthe skaters is an echo ofthe skaters' own voices. The illusion of stillness and the alien voice of Nature, however, are not exactly objects or results of the autonomous childhood will. The engagement ofthe will in this situation is without an object. The skaters' "din" is not directed toward an other in dialogue, and the boy's breaking away from the crowd is an undirected, "sportive" motion (475). Insofar as the child's motion has a purpose, it is a typically Wordsworthian pursuit of an "object" which is on the one hand reflected and illusory, and on the other hand eternally deferred. He "glanced sideway" To cut across the reflex of a star That fled, and, flying still before [him], gleamed Upon the glassy plain. (1850, 1, 450-52) "Flying still" looks forward to the ambiguous "spinning still," enriching the sense of infinite deferral with the sense of stillness in motion. This type of experience will reach a climax in Book vi, when the poet will proclaim that "our destiny, our nature and our home" are in the realm of "effort, and expectation, and desire, / And something evermore about to be" (vi, 538, 541-42). It seems that this particular relation between Nature and the child is a function of the child's will precisely insofar as that will is exercised as pure intention, unencumbered by volitional objects which would intrude upon his innocent autonomy. The will's energy?whether of voice or of motion?must find an object, however, as surely as the arbitrary path of travel chosen at the beginning of the preamble must ultimately lead somewhere. However, because the object is not dictated by the agent in this case (the child's willing is neither a choosing of something nor an advance toward someone), the volitional energy is taken up, mag nified, and reflected by the whole of Nature towards which the child's will is necessarily, if unintentionally, directed. Thus the skaters' undi rected "din" returns to them as the voice of Nature, and the lone skater's "sportive motion" is magnified and taken over by the surrounding</page><page sequence="27">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 59 Nature.32 The stolen boat episode provides the most famous example of this, as the boy's rowing motion is terrifyingly transferred to the cliff which "like a living thing / Strode after" the youth (411-12). On the one hand, this transfer of energy reinforces the unity and atemporality of the child against the background of differentiated, tem poral Nature. The exercise of will does not connect an agent and object in a dialogue or differentiated relation; instead, the volitional action is transferred from agent to object, freeing the agent (the child) from his act's temporal consequences, as the substance of that act is transferred to Nature (as the boy's voice and motion are transferred to the hills around him). On the other hand, this transfer gives over to Nature the human temporality and volition which was exercised in a non-directed way by the boy, and as Nature thus "answers" the boy, he is reinvolved in his now-reflected act on a new level. It is thus that Nature becomes associated specifically with the voice and temporality of narrative. Na ture's magnification and reflection of the boy's voice and motion emerge as a narrative voice, a voice which will be seen to have strong figural ties to the voice of the narrating poet. According to Geoffrey Hartman, "Wordsworth projects nature as something that . . . textualizes a phantom voice."33 The ice-skating and stolen boat episodes suggest that here this projection is rooted in the child's non-directed will, as magnified and returned to him by the Nature around him. That temporal, narrating Nature is then associated with the narrative voice of the mature poet. In this way Nature mediates between the narrated youth and the discursive adult: Nature's reflection of the boy's will becomes a vehicle for the mature poet's narrative will. Nature adopts this narrating role in moving from a ministering force, answering the boy's intentionality with the power of natural beauty and sublimity, to a witnessing agent, narrating a relation to the boy of care fully distanced otherness. As a ministering force, the language of nature is powerful, but strange and inarticulate: With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind Blow through my ears; the sky seemed not a sky Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds! (1, 348-50) 32. On the level of Wordsworth's own work, this transfer of subjective energy to Nature has preoccupied critics from Coleridge's assertion in "To William Wordsworth" that the poet "received / The light reflected as a light bestowed" to Hartman's description ofthe Imagination's via negativa through nature, in Wordsworth's Poetry 1787-1814. 33. "Words, Wish, Worth: Wordsworth," in Harold Bloom, et. al., Deconstruction and Criticism (N.Y.: the Seabury Press, 1979), p. 194.</page><page sequence="28">60 DAVID P. HANEY As a narrating witness, however, Nature becomes exactly as articulate as the speaking poet: The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell How when the sea threw off his evening shade And to the shepherd's huts beneath the crags Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to fancies such as these, Engrafted in the tenderness of thought, A stranger, linking with the spectacle No conscious memory of a kindred sight, And bringing with me no peculiar sense Of quietness or peace?yet I have stood Even while mine eye has moved o'er three long leagues Of shining water, gathering, as it seemed, Through every hair-breadth of that field of light New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers. (i, 594-6o8) The scene described here involves a complex interplay among poet, boy, and Nature. The boy is "a stranger" to "fancies such as these, / Engrafted in the tenderness of thought," a stranger to the adult, remem bering, metaphorizing consciousness which interprets the experience and translates it into the discourse of the poet. This alienation points up the rhetorical distance between the poet and the simply perceiving boy, and presents a paradox: how can one discuss, in associative, memory-laden language, an experience which is supposedly prior to such association? The youth did not, if we can believe these lines, possess the dual con sciousness necessary to witness this experience and translate it into the metaphors of the memory. This paradox is resolved by shifting the responsibility for witnessing and narrating this experience to Nature. The sands, creeks and bays "can tell" what the poet cannot. The boy's relation to Nature here subtly reflects and figures the boy's relation to the adult narrator. The syntactic suspension of the phrase "a stranger" (601) illustrates this structure perfectly. The boy is primarily a stranger to adult "fancies" such as the personification of the sea and the huts in the preceding lines (a sense made clearer in the 1850 version), but he is also a stranger to the spectacle itself. The "spectacle" (described by Nature) is the panorama of the sea throwing off his evening shade and sending "sweet notice of the rising moon" to the shepherd's huts (The latter image shows Nature presenting the "spectacle" of herself in the act of communicating, appropriate to her role as a narrator). The</page><page sequence="29">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 61 boy's perception, however, is not of this spectacle, but of something very different: the "field of light" which constitutes the "shining water." The spectacle as told by Nature consists of temporal, communicative acts ("throwing off" and "sending notice"), while the boy's perception is spatial and passive, rooted in figures of distance and light. The two aspects of "stranger" are ultimately the same, since this "spectacle" which the boy does not see is the adult poet's narration, here presented as what Nature "can tell." The boy's alienation from the spectacle of Nature thus equals his alienation from the perspective of the adult poet. But that is precisely the point: the boy's general separation from the temporality of Nature provides a figure for the distance be tween the youth and the adult, and here the two poles of that figural relation are brought together. Nature testifies to the distance between herself and the boy, but her presence as a witness to this distance guarantees it as a stable relation of otherness. Her narrating presence is interchangeable with the narrator's presence as a witness to the otherness of his pre-temporal youth. The poet openly testifies to his own distance from that youth a few lines later, by apologizing for beginning his "tedious tale" in days Disowned by memory?ere the birth of spring Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. (i, 642-44) His youth exists in a realm which, because it is prior to the "birth of spring," prior to the beginning of seasonal, generative temporality, is "disowned" by memory, by the highly temporal consciousness of the writing poet. This complex figural structure, in which the relation between Nature and the boy mirrors the relation between the adult poet and the boy, seems to function as a kind of experiential guarantee of what is essentially a rhetorical structure necessary to the beginning of The Prelude. The poet calls on Nature to testify to the distance between her temporal self and the atemporal boy. The relationship between Nature and the boy, rooted, as we saw above, in the boy's innocent will, provides a figure which enables the poet to place a similar distance between himself and the boy. The redeeming value of Book i's "tedious tale" is that it may have "fix[ed] the wavering balance" ofthe poet's mind (650), and given the poem a beginning impetus. However, that impetus is more than merely a function of retrieving "invigorating thoughts from former years" (649). By means ofthe figural relation outlined above, the poet has been</page><page sequence="30">62 DAVID P. HANEY able to erect a differentiated narrative structure in which the poem can begin. The "wavering balance" of the autobiographer's ambiguous re lation of identity and otherness to his subject has been temporarily fixed, with the aid of the relationship between the boy and nature, as a relation of otherness. The "tedious tale" of a boyhood which preceded the tem porality of memory was necessary in order to satisfy narrative's demand for an object "other" to the narrating voice. This figural structure, in which the boy's relation to Nature symbol izes and reinforces the poet's relation to the boy, obliquely intersects and helps to sustain the figural structure discussed earlier, in which the autobiographical narrative figures the "present" existence of the poet. The figure now being discussed, in establishing the poet's writing con sciousness and his youthful self as qualitatively different, insures that the autobiographical figure itself will at least temporarily maintain a rela tively unproblematic relation of otherness to its referent, the "present" writing author. That this web of figural relationships supports a beginning fiction, whose dissolution is implied in its very inception, becomes clear if we widen our perspective to view Wordsworth's use of the autobiographic genre in context. The provisional establishment of the object of narration as "other" to the writer helps the autobiographer to begin, but for Wordsworth this gesture is also the establishment of autobiography itself as his chosen narrative mode. He limits himself to "a theme / Single and of determined bounds" (668?69)?autobiography?while within the beginning of that autobiography he limits the object of narration by establishing it as other to his present, discursive existence. The conflation of these two operations is an important part of the beginning fiction, in that the autobiographical enterprise is a project of "single and determined bounds" only in this beginning moment in which the "theme" can be discussed as other to the discursive voice. When the poem moves beyond that relation with an "other" childhood into the problematic intersec tions between presents and pasts which constitute much of the rest of the poem, those bounds are continually transgressed. This beginning fiction involves a technique which we observed in the attempt, at Book i's outset, to isolate a purely present "way": a moment in a temporal sequence is isolated and given paradigmatic value by the exclusion of its temporal context, but that exclusion is performed in such a way that the re-entry of the context, and consequently the com plication of the originally isolated moment, are inevitable. The estab lishment of the poet's early life as an a- or pre-temporal sphere, in order to facilitate the poem's beginning, privileges the "singleness" and "de termined bounds" of the theme as a necessity of narrative. However, this gesture also grants a paradigmatic, in a sense atemporal, status to</page><page sequence="31">AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PRELUDE 63 autobiography as a genre of "determined bounds." In actuality, however, autobiography is profoundly temporal, and cannot be "bounded" be cause as long as one is able to write, the boundaries of one's topic expand at such a rate that, as Tristram Shandy discovered, one can never catch up. One can, of course, limit the events which one will describe auto biographically, as Wordsworth does in stopping at the point when We have reached The time, which was our object from the first, When we may (not presumptuously, I hope) Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such My knowledge, as to make me capable Of building up a work that should endure. (xm, 273-78) However, those events' only authentic existence is in the interpretations of the writing poet, interpretations which alter as the writer continues to live, even though the basic configurations of the events themselves have been delimited. The years spent in The Prelude's revision bear out the fact that objective representation of one's past is impossible, that, as Wordsworth says in "Tintern Abbey," "I cannot paint / What then I was." Thus the establishment ofthe child as an atemporal figure other to the writing poet is a beginning fiction which, it is clear from the outset, will generate its opposite; that same child becomes the measure of The Prelude's temporality, and slowly manifests his identity with the speaking poet. The inevitability of this transformation makes it clear that these fic tions, or, to use Marin's term, "ruses of writing" (the atemporal oth erness ofthe boy, and the unitary status of autobiography), are by no means evasions of any "true" state of affairs, but are provisional conces sions to the demands of autobiographical narrative which, by empha sizing their own fictionality, openly face their own imminent obsoles cence. In a sense, the exigencies of poetic autobiography preclude any discussion of an objectively "true" state of affairs which the poet could be accused of perverting. That is, in discussing Wordsworth's perception of nature's relation to his childhood as a figure for his own relation to his past, I am not suggesting that he deviated from the way his childhood "really was" for the sake of rhetorical exigency. To the poet, it "really was" exactly as it appears through his own remembering consciousness, through the eyes of one whose memory of his past and involvement in the rhetorical labyrinth of autobiography are indistinguishable parts of the same poetic consciousness.
