BRAIDWOOD HE site of Matarrah lies in the Kir- kuk liwa of north-central Iraq, at Lat. 350 23' N., Long. 440 12' E., at a general elevation above sea level of about 220 meters. This location is some 34 kilo- meters south of the city of Kirkuk (see map, Fig. 1). The site takes its name from the nearest village, which lies just east of the main Baghdad-Kirkuk road; the site itself is about three kilometers west of the road and is easily visible from it as a low, regularly profiled mound. This mound rises some eight meters above the sur- rounding plain. Our excavations indicated that only about half of this elevation con- sisted of occupational debris, the lower core being a small natural hill (Fig. 5). The plan profile of the mound (Fig. 2) is roughly ovoid and about 200 meters in diameter; the main irregularity is a cres- centic indention on the northeast flank, due apparently to some stage of active erosion of the now normally dry wadi, before the natural hill-core was first occu- pied. Soon after the war, the Oriental Insti- tute began making plans for the resump- tion of excavation in Iraq. When it was decided to give our attention first to the elaboration of the general picture of the beginnings of food-production and the es- tablishment of the village economy-a range on which attention had been par- ticularly focused owing to the remarkable series of excavations carried on by the Iraq Government's Directorate General of Antiquities during and just following the warl-we communicated our interests to Dr. Naji al-Asil, the Director General of Antiquities. In that spirit of friendly co- I See especially Seton Lloyd and Fuad Safar, "Tell Hassuna," JNES, IV (1945), 225-89; and Lloyd and Safar, "Tell Uqair," JNES, II (1943), 131-58.

The Directorate particularly called our atten- tion to the site of Matarrah and also to the site of Qalat Jarmo. Our decision was to excavate at Matarrah and to seek a one- month sounding permit for Jarmo. On our formal application, the Directorate granted us the concession for work at Matarrah and the sounding permit for Jarmo.2 During the course of the excava- tions, we continued to receive the aid and counsel of the Director General; of Sayid Hussein Awni, the Assistant Director; and of the staff. Messrs. Taha Bekir, Fuad Safar, Seton Lloyd, and others were our guests on several occasions; and we were fortunate in having Dr. Faraj Basmachi as our representative. We are deeply in- debted to the Directorate General of Antiquities for its helpful role in the suc- cess of our season's work at both Matar- rah and Jarmo.3 2 A short preliminary note on the results of our work at both Matarrah and Jarmo appeared in the section "Archeological News-The Near East" of AJA, LIII (1949), 49-51. A complete report on the materials of Jarmo will appear following the continued excavation of the site which was undertaken during 1950-51, but see Antiquity, XXIV, No. 96 (1950), 189-95. 8 We also made many friends during our stay in the Kirkuk liwa; all were helpful. H. E. Said Kazaz, Mutaserif of the Kirkuk liwa; Sadik Pasha, Khaima- khan of Kirkuk; Dr. Bashir Sarsam of the Govern- ment Hospital; Mr. and Mrs. Philip B3radbourie, who were then in the British Consulate; Sayid Zeki Hassan, the local representative of the Directorate General of Antiquities; Dr. and Mrs. John Davies of the I.P.C. Hospital; Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hotch- kiss, also of the I.P.C.; the Hon. George Wadsworth and Messrs. Walter Harris and Armin Meyer of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad-all were extremely kind to us. We are especially indebted to the Rev. and Mrs. ,J. C. Glessner of Kirkuk and to Sayid Daud Sulieman, then Khaimakhan of Tauq; without their friendly aid, our work would have been much less effective.</page><page sequence="3">MATARRAH 3 The staff of the "Iraq Project" con- sisted of Robert J. and Linda Braidwood and Miss Charlotte M. Otten, a graduate student in anthropology, for whose travel and field expenses we are indebted to a grant from the Department of Anthropol- ogy of the University of Chicago; and Dr. Faraj Basmachi. The operations superin- tendent was Abdullah Said Osman al- Sudani, veteran of the Oriental Institute's Syrian Expedition. The field operations were of relatively short duration; work went on for the months of March and April, 1948, at Matarrah. In the preparation of this report, we have been fortunate in having, as col- laborators, two qualified graduate stu- dents of the Department of Anthropology of the University of Chicago, James G. Smith, M.A., and Charles Leslie, M.A., both students of ours in archeology, who have, with our supervision, prepared the descriptive section on the Matarrah as- semblage (Smith) and a generalizing study of the early painted pottery of northerly Iraq as stimulated by the painted wares which occurred at Matar- rah (Leslie). Leslie's conclusions are his own, tempered perhaps through discus- sions with us. Smith's conclusions will be published in the near future in conjunction with a series of technical studies by vari- ous experts on ceramic analysis, faunal re- mains, grain, human paleontology and dentition, and petrology, which are, un- fortunately, not yet ready. Our own sec- tion of conclusions is thus short, generaliz- ing, and somewhat tentative. The illustrations in this report are from the hand of Mr. Bobbie Shephard; we also had much-appreciated volunteer aid from two other graduate students, Mrs. Fredrik Barth and Mr. Martin Kanofsky. The map (Fig. 1) indicates the location of Matarrah as just above the general 200- meter contour. The site might thus be de- scribed as lying on the hilly flanks of the "Fertile Crescent." Under present-day climatological conditions, the line of the 200-meter contour might be taken as more or less coincident with the isohyet4 delim- iting the southwestward extent of winter rains sufficient to yield a grain crop with- out the aid of irrigation. That the position of this isohyet may not have been greatly different during the time of the Hassunan assemblage is indicated by the fact that tells of any sort begin to thin out in the region southwest of Matarrah (as do mod- ern villages). Samarra itself is the one ex- ception we know of south of the Jebal Hamrin for the earlier village-stage mate- rials, and it is probably significant that it lies on the Tigris. There were a fair num- ber of tells in the immediate vicinity of Matarrah, and their number increases to the north and northwest. We noted Has- sunan-Samarran, Halaf, Ubaid, and later types of pottery on other mounds in the vicinity of Matarrah, especially in surface collections which Dr. Basmachi made dur- ing the course of our work at Matarrah. Nevertheless, we all came to the conclu- sion that these indications thinned out entirely some ten or fifteen kilometers south of Matarrah. It is in this sense that we describe Matarrah as a southern vari- ant of the Hassunan assemblage so fully delineated at the type site by the Directo- rate of Antiquities' work under Lloyd and Safar. We would hardly suspect that there will be found any more southerly indica- tion of it, save along the banks of the Tigris itself. It might be observed parenthetically that, in view of Lloyd and Safar's sugges- tion of possible Samarran elements in the basal (pre-Ubaid) painted pottery style at Eridu,5 there would be some importance 4 W.

We have never held, as does Albright,' that the earlier now known vil- lage assemblages presuppose an agricul- tural system based on irrigation.' But Samarra, and any site south of it, would seem to lie well below the isohyet of suf- ficient winter rainfall; and the problem of irrigation might well come into the pic- ture, just as we suppose it must in dealing with any site in southern Iraq, e.g., Eridu. We hold that the assemblage now seen most adequately at Hassuna and Matar- rah must be moved down to the place of being the second earliest village material available from Iraq; we admit, however (p. 66, below), that our assessment of precedence for Jarmo over Hassuna and Matarrah is based mainly on typological grounds. What we find interesting about Matarrah is the technological variance (as well as general similarity) which its as- semblage shows with that of Hassuna. This has obvious cultural implications. Probably Matarrah lay well on the pe- riphery of the Hassuna "heart-land." Al- though our field operations were on a modest scale-we began with some thir- teen two-by-two meter soundings and ex- panded only two of these (soundings VI and IX) and a step-trench (TT-1, from sounding VIII) to any considerable area (see Fig. 2)-the yield was in sufficient bulk to be trustworthy. The remarkably poor quality of the Matarrah chipped- stone work, when compared to the ex- amples shown in the Hassuna report, and the complete lack of the Hassuna-type "hoes," constitute one peculiar aspect of our site. Another is the lack of any painted pottery style but the Samarran one. We at first believed we were justified in clas- sifying some of the more simple and poorly executed painted sherds as "Hassuna Archaic" or "Hassuna Standard Painted" wares; but we were dissuaded by our col- leagues Lloyd and Safar, who could, of course, bank on their own experience with the originals of the wares in question. This left us with a single bulk of painted pot- tery, some of which was practically "clas- sic" Samarran from the point of view of artistic embellishment, and the rest aes- thetically intermediate or uninspired. This has tended to strengthen our impres- sion that the Samarran painted style may be no more than one aspect of the later phase of the Hassunan assemblage8 and not the "imported" or "luxury" ware it has sometimes been claimed to be, let alone a "Samarran culture" in its own right. Leslie's paper has as its main point the consideration of the problems raised by the Matarrah painted pottery of Sa- marran type. It is particularly unfortu- nate that we were not able to arrange for Dr. F. R. Matson's ceramic analysis of the various Matarrah wares in time for this report. As Smith indicates (p. 15, n. 18, below), however, we fully expect that the fabric and indications of habits of prepa- ration of the Matarrah-Samarran pottery will be no different from those of the Ma- tarrah Fine Simple and Incised wares. For the rest of its assemblage, Matar- rah generally parallels that of Hassuna. It was Lloyd and Safar's opinion that the Fine Incised Ware at Matarrah actually had a greater flourish than at the type site. Otherwise, the Matarrah materials were rather technologically inferior to those of Hassuna. Hence our use of the word "variant." 6 W. F.

INTRODUCTION Matarrah represents one of the oldest of the village assemblages of the Near Eastern area and is on the direct line of de- velopment to the great urban civilizations of Mesopotamia. The Carbon 14 date available for Jarmo (see p. 66, below) gives us some idea of the time involved for the great developments which followed the beginnings of settled life. We have divided the assemblage into an Upper Phase and a Lower Phase. The Upper Phase is marked by the appear- ance, in quantity, of the Samarran painted pottery style. We would include the fol- lowing levels in the Upper Phase: all levels of Operation IX, VI, surface-1 m., and TT-1, I. It is possible that TT-1, II, 1 belongs in this phase; but, since the preci- sion of control of any step-trench is com- paratively poor, we hesitate to place the precise beginnings of any phase with a feeling of certainty. A total of thirteen operations plus the step-trench (TT-1) were opened on vari- ous parts of the mound (see plot plan, Fig. 2). Of these, VI, IX, and TT-1 were the largest in area and depth and provided the greatest bulk of material in all cate- gories. Operation I was on the peak of the mound. It was an exposure of 17 square meters and was carried to a depth of about two meters. Level 1 was considered to run from the surface to one meter; level 2, from one meter to the bottom. This.was the only operation to yield libn and the only one, apparently, to have Ubaid pot- tery in situ. Operation II went to a depth of 1.5 meters, in an area of four square meters; it lay to the east and slightly to the south of the center of the mound. The yield was small, and there was some uncertain wall- ing. Surface to one meter was considered the first level, one meter to 1.5 meters the second level. Operation III, on the southwestern edge of the mound, was carried to a depth of 2.5 meters over an area of nine square meters through wash material, sterile sand, and gravel. Operation IV, on the western edge of the mound, eventually went to a depth of 3.5 meters over an area of 12 square meters. Surface to 1.5 meters was consid- ered the first level, 1.5 to 3.5 meters the second level. There seemed to be some in- dication of a floor, but this may have been an old land surface. Operation V, on the west-central part of the mound, went to a depth of 1.5 me- ters over an area of nine square meters. Surface to 0.75 meter was considered the first level, 0.75 meter to 1.5 meters the sec- ond level. A complete pot was recovered at a depth of one meter. Operation VI, to the northwest of the center of the mound, was one of the major operations, yielding the greatest bulk of material of the Lower Phase. At the point of greatest depth, it reached slightly less than four meters (see the section, Fig. 4). This operation covered a total area of about 96 square meters. The third-floor, fourth-floor, and fifth-floor levels were based on the presence of architectural fea- tures; 1-3 were more or less arbitrary levels with some discontinuous floor lines. Operation VII yielded only wash mate- rials over its entire area of 10 square meters, on the extreme north of the mound. Operation VIII, on the north of the</page><page sequence="6">06 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES mound near the area where the wadi cuts in, yielded only wash materials over an area of eight square meters to a depth of 4.5 meters. Operation IX, on the northeast of the mound, was a major operation which yielded architecture on two floors (see Fig. 3). A two-meter by two-meter test-pit was sunk below the second floor; it encoun- tered three more floors before reaching virgin soil (cf. Fig. 3, section). Operations X, XI, XII, and XIII re- vealed no architecture or significant mate- rials. All went down at least one meter, X over an area of nine square meters, XI over 12 square meters, XII over six square meters, and XIII over six square meters. The step-trench, TT-1, was a major op- eration (see Fig. 5). Gallery I had some mixture with Ubaid wares at its top, but lower gallery I and galleries II and III correlate the stratigraphy of Operations VI and IX. TT-1, IV yielded wash mate- rials of the Upper Phase at first, and then very little of anything. The sorting for this and the lower galleries was small, and samples were not returned. Operation I yielded the latest material on the site, and, together with the con- tiguous TT-1, performed the function of establishing the stratigraphic sequence. The few Halaf sherds recovered were too few to be significant, coming as they did from the surface or as single examples from upper levels. The Lower Phase assemblage is con- sistent within itself. The Upper Phase as- semblage is generally consistent with the Lower, except for the introduction of the Samarran painted pottery style and a few other traits-the concave-based spindle whorl and the clay scraper. Wherever else the Samarran style has been found and published with full regard to context and in bulk, it has been associ- ated with simpler painted wares. At Has- suna it is associated with, and is appar- ently consistent in style with, the Hassuna archaic and standard painted wares.9 At Nineveh the same is apparently true. The absence of the other painted wares at Matarrah is a matter that calls for ex- planation. Although all other whorls from Matar- rah are biconical, two are concave-based, a feature that is known, at this period, only in Iran and at Anau. The clay scraper is of a type found only, so far, at Tall- i-Bakun A.'o The relative lack of the more elaborate Samarran painted pottery, the presence of the more simple type of Samarran sherds in fair quantity, and the existence of a few traits of Iranian localization indicate that a reconsideration of the interrelations of the earliest Near Eastern village assem- blages is in order. II. ARCHITECTURE Substantial architecture was exposed in Operations IX, first and second floors; VI, third, fourth, and fifth floors; and I, first floor. The architecture of I, first floor, con- sisted of a portion of a wall of libn. The exposure at this operation was not ex- tended to give further elaboration. The largest area exposed was in Opera- tion IX, first floor. The houses of this level were of four to six rooms, constructed of packed mud or touf (Fig. 3:1, P1. I, top). The orientation is roughly northeast by southwest, an orientation that was main- tained in all the levels that we exposed. Almost complete remains of three houses and parts of the walls of several others were uncovered. The largest complete room measured about 5.0X 3.5 meters, though the rooms tended to be smaller, averaging about 2.OX 1.5 meters. In the northern wall of 9 Cf. Leslie's paper, below. 10 Alexander Langsdorff and D. E. McCown, Tall-i-Bakun A ("OIP," No. LIX [Chicago, 1942]), pp. 70-71, P1. 83:1-5.</page><page sequence="7">MATA RRA H 7 the complete house, toward the east of the exposure, was a horseshoe-shaped oven, constructed of clay that had become hard- ened by heat. The second floor of IX was excavated in about only half of the area of the first floor, and the remains of only one com- plete house were uncovered (Fig. 3, cen- ter; P1. I, bottom). This consisted of at least three rooms; a large room to the south of the three-room complex may be- long with it, but there is apparently no connecting door. Because of the common wall and no other indication of one-room houses, we are inclined to consider the four rooms as one unit. The largest room was 3.5X 2.0 meters, the smallest 2.OX 1.0 meters. In the fragmentary house in the north- east corner of the exposure was a hearth, constructed of broken sherds of a large storage jar. On the south, in an open area, was a small area of fire-hardened earth, a hearth. A complete rebuilding is indicated for the first floor, since the foundations of the houses of the upper level are not immedi- ately above the foundations of the second floor. Operation VI, third and fourth floors, each gave indications of at least one house, though in each case the exposure did not disclose them completely (Fig. 4, top, upper middle; P1. II). On the third floor, to the east of the house, was a small pile of earth of consistent color. To the southeast of the pile of earth is a low semi-elliptical wall, about two meters in diameter. Im- mediately below this is a more or less el- liptical depression (which was mapped with level 4), with slightly raised walls and partially coated with bitumen (Fig. 5; P1. III, top). When this wall of the third floor and the bitumen-lined pit of the fourth floor are superimposed, it is clear that some relationship exists. The fifth floor of Operation VI revealed a number of pits and drains dug into vir- gin soil (Fig. 4, lower middle; P1. III, bot- tom). B-1 and B-2 are bitumen-floored features, the latter showing a bit of smoothed and burned flanking wall, not very high. Both of these features are later than the floors of 5 immediately on the virgin soil or jebal. The area beneath was not excavated. Features 10 and 11 are not fire-reddened. Features 12, 8, and 9 are fire-reddened cuts into the jebel about 18 centimeters deep. Feature 9 had a number of stones in it. Feature 7 is a shallow fire- place, about six centimeters deep, with black and grey ash. In the test-pit, T. P., a fire-reddening could be seen running under B-2. Feature 13 is a deep hole, about 40 centimeters deep, in the jebal, not red- dened. The drain, Feature 11, runs into an area that is not jebal, which was left un- cleaned. Feature 1, a deep cut with fire- reddened sides, is clear save on its north end. A number of the strange trapezoidal- sectioned, semi-burned, bricklike frag- ments or tabuk's (e.g., Fig. 5, left, bottom) were found in it, none being complete or in any position likely to be original. Two fairly long fragments slanted up on the east side, however. At the north end the floor rises; and there are two pits (Fea- tures 14 and 15), probably dug into the jebal later than was Feature 1, spoiling its outline. Feature 14 is undercut and about 35 centimeters deep. Feature 15 is about 28 centimeters deep. Feature 2, another large fire-reddened pit, is unclear on its north end; but the subsidiary lobe on the south end is probably original. The lobe is about 65 centimeters deep, and the depth of the normal floor of the feature behind it is 72 centimeters. On the north end, Fea- ture 2 cuts through some older feature, not jebal, and the reddening and hardening of the walls give out. Feature 16 was a small fire-reddened pit, 28 centimeters deep, cut into thejebal near Feature 2, but not obviously con-</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES nected with it. Feature 2 also had some tabuk's, two of which were found. The longest one encountered was more or less rectangular in section, on one end, and on the long side. The greatest preserved length was about 55 centimeters, and the depth was about 10 centimeters (Fig. 5, left center, but this tabuk is not trape- zoidal in section). A bowl also came from the floor of this feature. Features 4 and 5 are pits, apparently cut later than the features that surround them. They were not fire-reddened and were full of blackened dirt. It was clear that Feature 5 was cut later than 3 and was also probably later than 6. Feature 3 is a well-cut pit with fire- reddened sides cut into thejebal. Like Fea- ture 1, it seems to constrict on one end (i.e., the southwest end), where the floor also goes higher. There were remains of a pit, based about 30 centimeters above the floor of the constricted end, certainly later. Bones and pieces of tabuk appeared on the floor line. The complex of pits numbered 6 gave every indication of having been a con- sciously connected affair. The consistency of the fill and the fact that the axial lines of the northern and the central "corri- dors" (along a northwest-southeast axis) are not the same suggest that the whole complex was in use at one time. The function of these features is a baf- fling problem. It has been suggested that some of the larger of these pits were cov- ered with mats to provide a more or less temporary shelter and that the tabuk's may have served to weight the edges of the mats at some time prior to the appearance of permanent architecture. We feel that the size of even the largest of these pits makes this unlikely: an area one meter wide and two to four meters long seems hardly large enough to have been more than a most makeshift habitation. We believe that no precise interpretation can be made con- cerning these pits and drains. The fill of the pits seems to be incon- sistent with the stratigraphic position: sherds of the Fine Simple Ware are far more numerous than is indicated for the levels immediately above. It is possible, of course, that the fill of the pits is later than their use. III. POTTERY The pottery of Matarrah presents the largest bulk of material for analysis-both internal, with reference to the changes oc- curring at Matarrah, and external, in terms of the comparative archeology and the general picture of the prehistoric Near Eastern assemblages. The appearance of the Samarran painted pottery style in quantity is the basis for dividing the assemblage into two phases, an Upper and a Lower. The basis for the following analysis of the ceramic industry is provided by a to- tal of 1,051 sherds in Chicago, not includ- ing the Ubaid sherds or the scattered Halaf material. This figure represents ap- proximately 5 per cent of the bulk exca- vated. The basis of the selection was to sort out 10 per cent of the bulk, represent- ing the several wares in the proportions in which they appeared at the site. One half of the 10 per cent was the share of the Iraq Government's Directorate General of Antiquities; the remaining 5 per cent was allocated to Chicago. Chart 1 is a break- down of the count, by levels, of the Chi- cago sampling. The figures indicated by the chart are not always in agreement with the quantities appearing in the field notes. For example, the type-sorting for the Upper Phase, as shown by the field notes, is 5 per cent painted, 30 per cent Fine Simple Ware (undecorated), 20 per cent Fine Simple Ware (incised), and 45 per cent Coarse Simple Ware, including approximately 10 per cent husking trays.</page><page sequence="9">MATARRAH 9 The sample count in Chicago for this level, IX, second floor, would indicate that the painted examples bulked to about 40 per cent. The seeming disproportion is the result of obtaining a sample of the Samarran painted style which includes the eluding Ubaid, about 10 per cent; Fine Simple Ware (undecorated), about 50 per cent; Fine Simple Ware (incised), about 25 per cent; and Coarse Simple Ware, about 15 per cent, including 5 per cent husking trays.

Almost all pieces were of the Coarse Simple Ware, with only a few in- cised pieces. VI, 4-5. This was a shallow layer, in- cluding the fourth floor. The proportions were as above, with only one incised piece and very few Fine Simple Ware sherds. VI, 5. The sherds were taken only from the pits into virgin soil. The fill of the pits may be later than the original use of the pits; this seems reasonably clear if the sample is valid, and there is little reason to doubt that in this case the number re- turned represents the true proportion. The step-trench (TT-1) materials fol- low the pattern of Operation VI. In TT-1, I, 1 there were six Samarran-style sherds, and the remainder were mainly Fine Simple Ware sherds. Below this level the proportions follow those indicated above. The ceramic wares of Matarrah include the following: 1. Coarse Simple Ware 2. Fine Simple Ware a) Undecorated b) Incised 3. Samarran painted pottery style. 1. Coarse Simple Ware (363 examples; 35 per cent of total sherd bulk; Figs. 8-11, Pls. IV and V. This is a coarse hand- made ware. About 10 per cent of the ex- amples have a core left blackened by un- derfiring. This darkened core averages about 50 per cent of the thickness of the sherd. The paste, where completely fired, is orange-buff in color, though this varies from a "dirty" orange-buff to a greenish buff, caused, presumably, by overfiring. A typical sherd with blackened core and considerable thickness has a color range from orange-buff near the surface through a brownish buff color to the black of the core. The tempering is of two sorts, al- ways found together in the same sherd: white to black mineral inclusions, and vegetable inclusions, straw or chaff. The latter is highly concentrated, and the min- eral inclusions are distributed from a sparse to a medium concentration.12 The size of the grit inclusions was fine (under 0.33 mm. in diameter) in 15 per cent of the available sherd bulk, 37 per cent of the 11 It will be noted that this level is not represented in Chart 1. Those levels indicated here, but not shown in the chart, as well as obviously missing samples, e.g., TT-1, I, 2, had no sample taken. 12 Sparse concentration is taken to mean a con- centration of inclusions amounting to less than 15 per cent of the unit area; cf.

The surface color is the same as for the paste, though two sherds from a milk-jar are dark and have a dirty appearance. The surface is rough and uneven, and further roughness re- sults from pits left by the burned-out vegetable temper. About 15 per cent of the sherds are burnished; the remainder are wet-smoothed at best. A considerable variety of forms is man- ifest in this ware. The forms and the quan- tity in which they are represented in the sample returned to Chicago are as follows: Husking trays. ................ 14 Large open bowls.............. 8 Large flat-bottomed bowls....... 14 High-walled bowls ............. 2 Small open bowls .............. 9 Jar with angled side............ 2 Carinated bowls .............. 8 Small deep bowls .............. I Straight-sided bowls............ 2 Hole-mouth jar................ 1 Low-collared jars ............. 17 High-collared jars...... . 32 Husking trays15 are the most numerous form in the assemblage. They are manifest in all levels of VI, IX, and TT-1. The sides vary in height from 4.5 to 9.5 centi- meters. Only one complete husking tray was recovered (Fig. 16:1; P1. V:4). Half a dozen examples of husking trays from the Upper Phase have circular holes through the bottoms (Fig. 8:12). The base of this example and that of Fig. 9:1 are most typical of the form of the base. The in- terior wall is frequently incised, generally with large, rough lines (Fig. 8:13-15; Pl. IV:1). A few examples have more or less diagonal grooving (Fig. 9:1), oriented in either direction. The bottoms are varied in preparation (Fig. 9:2-7; P1. IV:1). Excision, rather than incision, is apparent in a substantial minority of the sample. The bottoms may have roughly rectangular excisions (P1. IV:1) or very rough and deep impressions (Fig. 9:2). A small number had neatly ex- cised wedges or widely spaced, more or less rectangular excisions (Fig. 9:3, 4). Very large and deep triangular impressions oc- curred a few times (Fig. 9:5). A rough, crackled finish of shallow depressions and low rises was also quite common (Fig. 9:6). Grooves were present in only two sherds. The most common bottom was without any particular type of impression; the potter was seemingly interested only in having a rough surface in most ex- amples (Fig. 9:2, 6). The large open bowls show a wide range of quality. Some of them are poorly and roughly made; whereas others approach the Fine Simple Ware in texture, having comparatively little straw temper. The form tends to be subhemispherical (Fig. 9:8, 9), but sometimes flares out (Fig. 9:10). Examples with tripod feet ap- peared; a reconstructable example is in the Baghdad Museum (Fig. 11:1). A few pedestal bases may belong with this group (Fig. 10:16-18). The large flat-bottomed bowls (Fig. 9:11-13) resemble the husking trays but have undecorated walls, and the bottoms have a plain flat surface. The high-walled bowls, of which there 13 For a full description of megascopic analysis of sherds, see "OIP," No. LXI. 14 A count was not taken of the husking trays, since by far the greater number in the sample were extremely small, broken sherds. Since one tray may be represented by several sherds, a count might very easily be misleading if one attempted interpre- tation on the basis of this sample. See, however, Chart 1 and general remarks (supra, pp. 8-10). 15 "Husking tray" and "milk-jar" are terms intro- duced by Seton Lloyd and Fuad Safar, JNES, IV (1945), 277-78. We accept the terms as useful "handles" without committing ourselves as to their utilitarian implications.</page><page sequence="12">12 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES are only two examples, are very large and similar to a modern pail. One of these has a nipple lug (Fig. 11:2). The small open bowls have low walls and slightly rounded bottoms, some of which may have been flattened. Rims, as with all of the Coarse Simple Ware, are more or less knifelike (Fig. 9:14); but one turns outward and is rather thick (Fig. 9:15). The two jars with angled sides are both from VI, 5. In each the remaining are of the rim is small, making it difficult to orient (Fig. 10:1). Actually, this might be more similar to the hole-mouth jars. The carinated bowls vary considerably in size. The smaller ones have an angle less pronounced than the larger examples (Fig. 10:2, 3). Small deep bowls have slightly rounded, high walls (Fig. 10:4, 5). One example has a flat bottom (Fig. 10:5); the remainder are broken so as not to give any indication as to the base. Of the straight-sided bowls, one has the wall flaring slightly outward (Fig. 10:6); the other rises vertically (Fig. 10:7). Both are from VI, 5 and are harder and better burnished than the normal Coarse Simple Ware; but the blackened core is present in both. Only one example of what was probably a hole-mouth jar was recovered (Fig. 10:8). Low-collared jars were fairly numerous and have only a slight indication of the collar (Fig. 10:10-11). High-collared jars, in which the collar was built up with addi- tional clay, were more numerous. The fairly large size of some of these may indi- cate that they are to be classed as "milk- jars," of which we have three reconstruct- able examples (P1. V), in addition to the sherds. Some of the collars are fairly low (Fig. 10:12), and one has a pierced lug. There is a marked tendency for the collars to flare out (Fig. 10:13, 15), but a number of the coarsest examples show a reverse tendency (Fig. 10:14). Two of the three pedestal bases of the Coarse Simple Ware resemble that of the "fruit stand" of the Fine Simple Ware (infra, p. 13), and both come from the Upper Phase (Fig. 10:17, 18). The third example is from VI, 5 and is broken at the top (Fig. 10:16). It was apparently pierced by "windows" and is harder and smoother than is normal for this ware. Bases were fairly numerous in all levels. The most common type is flat with the wall rising and curving slightly in before moving outward (Fig. 10:21). Next most numerous is a flat bottom with walls rising vertically (Fig. 10 :22). Less common,and better made, are gently flattened bottoms (Fig. 10:19) or those having a clearly de- fined flat base (Fig. 10:20). Secondary features include the foot (Fig. 11:1), already mentioned, and the nipple lug (Fig. 11:2), which is the most common element in this category. There is only one example of the ledge handle (Fig. 11:3). Two loop-handles were pres- ent, one of half the size of that illustrated (Fig. 11:4). A number of sherds bearing nipple lugs too small for any utilitarian purposes were found (Fig. 11:5-7). The first of these has a fairly large diameter, but the lug does not project far from the surface of the sherd. The second type occurs in groups of two immediately below the collar. The third type, of several grouped lugs, must have been purely decorative. A few examples of the semicircular or "knob" ledge are found on small sherds, whose orientation is not certain (Fig. 11:9). A pierced lug occurs only twice (Fig. 11:8; Fig. 10:12). Other than the crude incisions on the interior wall of the husking trays, about twenty sherds had incised designs (Fig. 11:10-14). One high-collared sherd has what appear to be rays above a broken</page><page sequence="13">EMATARRAH 13 surface (Fig. 11:10). Another has rather neat straight lines in something like a zig- zag pattern (Fig. 11 :11). The herringbone pattern occurs only once (Fig. 11:12). A badly broken sherd with a "ledge" handle has more or less vertical lines under the handle (Fig. 11:13). Small, almost circu- lar impressions were made below the collar of one jar (Fig. 11:14), but not by use of a reed, as is common with the Fine Simple incised pieces. 2. Fine Simple Ware: (a) undecorated and (b) incised. For purposes of descrip- tion of forms and decoration it is necessary to distinguish between the undecorated and the incised subgroups of this ware, but for a description of the fabric they may be lumped together. This ware is handmade but is some- times finely done. Only two sherds have a core left dark by under-fire. The color of the paste varies from orange-buff to green- ish buff, with buff the normal color. Greenish buff paste is present in only one undecorated sherd but amounts to 25 per cent of the incised group. The sherds tend to be medium to well fired. Surface color is roughly the same as that of the paste, though burnishing has tended to bring the finer particles to the surface, giving the effect of a slightly lighter shade. Tempering is of grit, usually black and granular; but a few sherds have some red colored inclusions which otherwise look to be the same as the normal black grit. Oc- casionally, the grit is white in color. Inclu- sions are normally sparse (in 70 per cent of the examples) to medium (in 30 per cent). Only a few particles of straw may have been used as tempering. The inclusions are fine in 37 per cent of the sherds, 49 per cent medium, 10 per cent coarse, and 4 per cent very coarse.16 All but 5 per cent are burnished, though the burnishing is ordinarily very light and not easily noticeable. Modeling is limited to three faces, two on high collars, the other on a large bowl. The surface is usu- ally smooth but is sometimes granular. a) The undecorated subgroup (202 ex- amples, 19 per cent of total sherd bulk: Fig. 6; Fig. 7:1-8; Fig. 16:2, 5-7; P1. V:6-7; P1. VI: 1-4, 6): Subhemispherical bowls ........ 55 Sack-shaped bowls............. 7 Small deep bowls .............. 3 High-walled bowls ............. 13 Miscellaneous bowl-forms ....... 3 Bowls with S-shaped walls ...... 28 Hole-mouth jar................ 1 Low-collared jars .............. 9 High-collared jars ............. 27 The subhemispherical bowls have a great range in size, from the very small, cuplike vessel (Fig. 6:1; Fig. 16:2) to the larger bowls (Fig. 6:2, 3). The rims are normally tapered, though the edge is sometimes rounded. Other forms of the rim include a diagonally flattened one, flaring out slightly (Fig. 6:4), or diago- nally flattened without flaring (Fig. 6:6), or horizontally flattened (Fig. 6:5). One sherd has its thickest cross section consid- erably below the rim (Fig. 6:7). A number of feet found, in the Fine Simple Ware fabric, probably belong to this group, though there is no case of clear associa- tion (Fig. 7:6, 7). One pedestal base also probably belongs here (Fig. 7:5); and a reconstructable bowl, complete with ped- estal base, clearly does (Fig. 16:5). The latter has been termed a "fruit stand"; but, if the term is used, it should be re- membered that this is only a "handle." Sack-shaped bowls have a slightly rounded bottom and walls that curve up- ward and inward slightly (Fig. 6:8-9). Small deep bowls have slightly carinated walls, but no bases are associated (Fig. 6:10). 16 See n. 12, p. 10 above, for explanation.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES A group of high-walled bowls begin, in some examples, to approach the hole- mouth shape (esp. Fig. 6:12). The rims are ordinarily tapered (Fig. 6:11) but are also flattened (Fig. 6:12), and one is splayed (Fig. 6:13). In addition, there were two fragmentary bowls with a thick rim protruding outward (Fig. 6:14-15). Miscellaneous bowl-forms include one that is wide and with a flaring wall, in form similar to the cyma-curve (Fig. 6:16). A miniature cup or bowl comes from VI, 4 (Fig. 6:17). One very low- walled bowl has a flat base and a vertical wall (Fig. 6:19). Bowls with S-shaped walls are among the most numerous forms. The curve of the side seems to indicate a slightly rounded base. The bowls tend to be very well made, fairly large, and with a slightly higher degree of burnishing than is com- mon for the ware as a whole. The range in size is indicated in Figure 6:20-22. One example belongs to this group but is with- out a noticeable S-curve (Fig. 6:23). The only hole-mouth vessel in this ware is crudely made and has a rough, flat base (Fig. 6:24). All save one of the low-collared jars are small (Fig. 6:25-27); the large one is atypical (Fig. 6:28). High-collared jars are more numerous and are ordinarily easily distinguished from the low-collared jars by a small lump of clay in the interior of the vessel, indicating that additional clay had been used for building up the col- lar. The collars are almost invariably ver- tical (Fig. 6:29), with only two exceptions in which the lip flares slightly. The range in size and form is indicated in the illustra- tions of the incised subgroup (cf. Fig. 8:7-10). Only ten sherds occur which are defi- nitely bases. Three of these are simply flattened areas below a curving wall (Fig. 7:1). In three other examples the base is clearly demarcated (Fig. 7:2). There are two examples of a flattened bottom with steeply rising walls (Fig. 7:3); a single variant of this type has walls that rise and close in steeply (Fig. 7:4). One base, badly broken, from a "fruit stand," occurs (Fig. 7:5). The nipple lug occurred once among the sherds of this ware (Fig. 7:8), and three examples of feet probably belong to the subbemispherical bowls (Fig. 7:6-7). One high collar has had several pieces of clay added to make a representation of a face (Fig. 6:30; M-82). A sherd of a very large bowl has a modeled eyebrow and eye (Fig. 6:31; M-139).17 Two loop- handles came from disturbed areas near the surface. We feel they cannot definitely be assigned to the basal assemblage at Matarrah. 2. Fine Simple Ware: (b) incised sub- group (268 examples; 25 per cent of total sherd bulk: Fig. 7:9-23; Fig. 8;1-11; Fig. 15; Fig. 16:8-10; P1. VI:5, 7-9). Subhemispherical bowls ........ 89 Carinated bowls ............... 5 Sack-shaped bowls............. 2 Beakers..................... 10 Hole-mouth jars............... 10 Low-collared jars .............. 24 High-collared jars.............. 44 Subbemispherical bowls are similar to those of the undecorated subgroup of the Fine Simple Ware. Rims are normally tapered (Fig. 7:10-12), with only one ex- ception, where the rim is turned out (Fig. 7:13). There were a few carinated bowls, ranging from a wide, shallow form (Fig. 7:14) to deeper bowls with a smaller diameter (Fig. 7:15-16). The sack-shaped bowls both came from the Upper Phase. Their main characteris- tic is a slight incurving near the center of 17 We feel justified in stating these to be human faces in the light of the sherd found at Tell Hassuna (cf. JNES, IV (1945), Fig. 1:1).</page><page sequence="15">MATARRAH 15 the body, most pronounced in the first bowl illustrated (Fig. 7:17-18). Beakers or extremely deep bowls are an important and exceptionally well-made group, first appearing in the upper levels of the Lower Phase (Fig. 7:19-21). There is one example of a hole-mouth jar with angled sides (Fig. 7:22). The re- maining hole-mouth jars (Fig. 7:23; Fig. 8:1-2) are unexceptional, save that one example has two small holes below the rim (Fig. 7:23). With the exception of one from TT-1, II, 2, all are from the Upper Phase. Low-collared jars have a considerable range in size (Fig. 8:3-5). A few sherds are thicker, and one has a very thin lip (Fig. 8:6). The collars of the high-collared vessels are generally of greater height than the preceding group or have a noticeable flare (Fig. 8:7-10). Some collars are rather high but indicate a narrow neck (Fig. 8:7), and some are relatively low but wider and flaring (Fig. 8:8). Of frequent occurrence are high collars, flaring and with a slightly protruding or rounded lip (Fig. 8:9). The majority of sherds tend to fall within the size of the above. A few are quite low and with considerable flare (Fig. 8:10). One jar has a very low collar or lip (Fig. 8:11). Bases seem to have been of the same types as for the undecorated sample (cf. Fig. 7:1-3), though there were relatively few that had decoration. The tripod- footed bowl is apparently not represented in the incised group. Decoration by means of incision was elaborate and varied (Fig. 16). For the most part, a fair degree of care was taken in the decoration of the vessels; but a few of the designs were poorly done (Fig. 15:6, 7, 21, 25). A knotted cord was sometimes impressed into the wet clay and combined with normal incision (Fig. 15:14). The potter apparently used his fingernail to impress a few designs, but a sharp instru- ment seems ordinarily to have been used Punctate designs, produced by the ends of reeds, were common and usually com- bined with other designs (Fig. 15:17). The use of a stick or other instrument to pro- duce wedges is apparent (Fig. 15:29) but not common. The most common form of decoration was one, two, or three horizontal rows of oblique slashes, usually done evenly and with precision (Fig. 15:3, 5). Next in pro- portion were long or short wavy lines cov- ering the upper surface of the vessel (Fig. 15:1-2). Chevrons lying on their sides, pointed in either direction or in both di- rections, were also common (Fig. 15:18- 19). Triangles hanging from rows of short slashes or straight lines, or from the rims (Fig. 15:8-9, 11-15, 20) are an important minority because of the similarity of de- sign to some of the painted pottery of this assemblage. The remaining designs illus- trated are infrequent but are shown in order to give an impression of the great variety of motifs. 3. The Samarran Painted Pottery Style (218 examples; 22 per cent of total sherd bulk: Figs. 12; 13; 14:1-19; 16:11, 12; Pls. VII and VIII). We have classified the painted pottery as a style rather than as a separate ware, since megascopic analysis indicates the clay to be the same as for the Fine Simple Ware.18 The vessels. indicated by the sherds are handmade, frequently well done, but with considerable variation. The paste is orange-buff to buff; but a few sherds are a deep brown, and occasional pieces are bright pink. About 15 per cent are over- fired, producing a greenish buff color on ~ In liea of a technological report by Dr. F. R. Matson, which will follow, we can only give it as our considered opinion (via megascopic examination) that the fabric involvedt here is essentially that of the Fine Simple Ware.</page><page sequence="16">16 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES the surface and in the paste as well as (oc- casionally) in the slip. Tempering is of grit, usually black and granular, occasion- ally white, and very infrequently red. In- clusions are of sparse (in 63 per cent of available sherd bulk) to medium (in 35 per cent of available sherd bulk) concentra- tion. A few examples have a heavy concen- tration. The grit inclusions range in size from fine (43 per cent) to medium (50 per cent) and coarse (7 per cent). Most sherds have a slip, usually cream but sometimes turned green from firing. The sherd is lightly burnished above the slip and then painted. The surface is ordinarily smooth, but the poorer specimens are sometimes rough and granular. Subhemispherical bowls......... 34 Walled subhemispherical bowls.. 30 Deep bowls ................... 8 Bowls with curved walls........ 15 Krater-like jars ............... 21 Low-collared jars.............. 2 High-collared jars ............. 24 The first class of low subhemispherical bowls are simply truncations of a true sphere, although the rims are sometimes drawn in slightly at the lip (Fig. 12:1-3). The rims are generally tapered, as is nor- mal for this assemblage. One example has a considerable incurve at the rim (Fig. 12:5), and one sherd has a flattened rim (Fig. 12:4).19 Subhemispherical bowls with definitely vertical upper walls were frequently found. Normally, the wall is of medium height (Fig. 12:14-16) but is sometimes high (Fig. 12:17). One example is shallow and has a sharp angle at the junction of the wall and the curve to the base (Fig. 12:18). Rims are ordinarily tapered, but two are flattened (Fig. 12:19). One rim is rounded and flaring (Fig. 12:20). Variants of this group continue on Fig. 13:1-4. Unfortunately, large deep bowls are all broken fairly close to the rim; but some have the suggestion of being beakers. The rims are all tapered, and the body tends to narrow below the rim (Fig. 13:5-7). Another class of bowls is characterized by a gentle incurving of the body with a slightly flaring rim (Fig. 13:9-11). Six of these had flattened rims (Fig. 13:12). Deep krater-like jars were fairly numer- ous. The rims are all tapered and flaring. There is a constriction below the rim, somewhat like a neck, below which the body increases in diameter (Fig. 13:16- 19; Fig. 14: 1-2; Fig. 16 :11). We were able to identify only two low- collared jars, one small (Fig. 14:3) and the other fairly large (Fig. 14:4). The first of these is green, without slip and with simple green decoration. The high-col- lared jars were more numerous. The rims were tapered and ordinarily not high, though a few badly broken sherds indicate some height. The bodies, indicated by the sherds (Fig. 14:5-8), were globular. One reconstructable jar, now with others in the Baghdad Museum, is illustrated (Fig. 16:12). There is a total of six painted and in- cised sherds, of which four are from high- collared jars (Fig. 14:8). The painted decoration tends, in a very general way, to be confined to that part of the vessel above the point of greatest diameter. Decoration of the interior rim is present in roughly one half of the sample and is, for the most part, fairly simple. One piece is very elaborate and atypical in this respect (Fig. 12:16). Naturalistic forms occur only five times, always in the interior of vessels (Fig. 12:5; P1. VII :16- 18, 20). Numerous zones of decoration are rela- tively infrequent and tend to be found on 19 The plan of illustration for the painted pottery is to illustrate in the first three profiles in each group the normal shape and range in size, followed by variant forms of the group, and the motifs that are found on the I)articllar form.</page><page sequence="17">MATARRAH 17 the deeper vessels. Negative painting is not frequent and is always used with zonal decoration. Three to five horizontal lines are the most common element below the rim, with pegs and oblique lines following in that order. The latter come in groups of two to five parallel lines. Occasionally, regularly spaced diagonal lines form rather neat St. Andrew's crosses. The most common element is the composite zigzag, most frequently out of phase but sometimes in phase. Steps and alternate rows of painted and unpainted squares are not common and always occur on large, elaborately painted sherds. Groups of dia- monds or triangles in horizontal rows oc- cur but are rare. Only six examples of the Samarran painted and incised sherds occurred. The largest of the high-collared jars has a St. Andrew's cross made up of multiple ob- lique lines in a rectangle consisting of three closely spaced lines on each side (Fig. 14:8). The incisions are horizontal chevrons alternating in direction. Another small fragment has small drop-shaped im- pressions, alternating in rows (P1. VIII :8). The sherds noted above conform fairly well to those known from earlier excava- tions. Perhaps the most significant single group of objects from this assemblage were the simple painted sherds. These have the elements of the "classic Samar- ran" design20 but are without the great elaboration one had heretofore been led to suspect was the only true Samarran style. The poorer examples of the style lack numerous zones of neat, busy abstract fig- ures; there is a tendency for only one or two elements to be present on the individ- ual sherds. Simple zigzags, in or out of phase, are the most common element. Simple crosshatching of widely spaced broad lines is sometimes encountered. Horizontal bands below the rim are fre- quent, sometimes combined with zigzags, and, less frequent, a single line limiting the decorated area. The quality of the draftsmanship is fre- quently poor: lines are not neatly parallel, often approaching or diverging. We have attempted in both the line drawing and the offset plates to indi- cate the variability of the quality of the painted pottery. We feel that the plates give an accurate picture of the Samarran painted pottery style as it exists at Matar- rah, and we have maintained the propor- tion of finely executed sherds to poorly executed sherds as it exists in the available sample. The most frequently used colors, as they appear from the sample, were, in order of frequency, chocolate-brown to maroon, red to orange-red, black, brown, and green. 4. Miscellaneous pottery. Three sherds of the fabric of the Coarse Simple Ware exhibit unique featuies. One of these is a subhemispherical bowl with an orange- red wash, the single occurrence of this type of decoration (Fig. 14:22). The sec- ond is a sherd from a deep bowl with an extremely high, lustrous burnished sur- face, especially noticeable on the interior (Fig. 14:21). The third one is from a high- walled bowl and has a flaring lip. The core is blackened and extremely thick, with only a thin layer of orange-buff surface clay and relatively high burnish (Fig. 14:20). The above sherds are of certain con- text; but, in addition to these, a number of sherds occurred in circumstances that indicate probable intrusion. These include a plum-colored body sherd with bright orange paste, a sherd with five concentric 20o We would restrict the use of the term "classic Samarran' to indicate the "ideal type" of zonal bands of decoration; neat, busy geometric elements; a balance of painted and unpainted areas; and painting mdeinonstrating a high degree of precision of drafts- inanship.</page><page sequence="18">18 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES grooves, and a coarse straw-tempered sherd with a cream slip and brown paint in a crosshatch design. One sherd had a cinnamon-colored clay and came from a collared jar. The outer surface is painted brown, with a pattern in purple, seem- ingly applied by negative painting, and giving the appearance of enamel. Nine Halaf sherds appeared from un- certain context. The designs include a bukranium in red paint, a broad black band with hanging loops, and one metope design. In every case the fabric was cin- namon-colored clay and the paint glaze- like. IV. POTTERY OBJECTS The clay from which the pottery ob- jects was made seems, megascopically at least, to be the same fabric used in the manufacture of the Fine Simple Ware. A total of 199 sling missiles was recov- ered. The largest missile was about 61 X 43 millimeters (Fig. 17:1) and the smallest 40X23 millimeters (Fig. 17:3). The ma- jority tend to fall around a median of 54X31 millimeters (Fig. 17:2; P1. IX:4). The distribution was as follows: IX, surface-first floor ......... 144 IX, 2. ................... 23 IX, 3 ..................... 2 VI, surface-1 m .............. 6 VI, 1 ...................... 5 VI, 2.. ..................... 4 VI, 3 ....................... 1 VI, third floor ............... 1.

All, with the exception of two, were biconi- cally shaped (Fig. 17:4-7), though there is considerable range from the accentua- tion of one or both cones to an almost el- liptical shape (P1. IX:3). Two concave based whorls (Fig. 17:8) came from IX, surface-1 m., and IX-2. The distribution of the normal biconical whorls is as fol- lows: IX, surface-i m............... 1 IX, 1....................... 20 IX , 2 ............. ........... 5 VI, surface-1 m ............ 3 VI, 1..................... 6 VI, 2 .................. ..... 1 VI, 3... ...... .. . .......... 2 VI, 4-5 ...................... 2 TT-1, III, 1 ................ 1 TT-1, IV ......................... 2 I, surface-1 m ................. 1 Surface ................... . 1 Decoration of the whorls was limited to three examples. Two had small, circular impressions on one surface (P1. IX:3); and one had a series of straight lines radi- ating from the center hole. A single clay scraper, more or less tri- angular in cross section, came from IX, surface-1 m. (Fig. 17:10.) Two incised sherds of the Fine Simple Ware were shaped and reused, probably as rubbers (P1. IX :2). A long, more or less tubular, grey bead was made of baked clay and came from VI, third floor (M-97). An anthropomorphic figurine of a fe- male, with one breast and the head miss- ing, came from VI, surface-1 m. (P1. IX:5). Animal figurines were slightly more numerous. One, of some undeter- minable species, with a pinched nose but with the ears and tail missing, came from I, first floor (P1. IX:7). A portion of the head of another animal figurine came from the surface of Operation IX. The eyes and mouth were indicated by incision (Pl. IX:6). A single clay horn probably represents the moufflon or some species of goat or</page><page sequence="19">MATARRAH 19 sheep (Fig. 17:9). A surface find was the head and forelegs of a similar animal. The circumstances of its finding preclude its definite association with the basal as- semblage. An object of indeterminable use came from II, surface-1i m. It is flat and roughly circular, and was grooved, as is apparent in the cross section (Fig. 17: 11).21 Two clay nails with curved shafts were found, one from a surface area, the other from VI, third floor (P1. IX:l1). It is pos- sible that the latter was intrusive from the Ubaid levels, since there was some con- tamination on the north side of this level. A knoblike object, with the remainder missing, occurred in XI, surface-2 m. (M-29). V. FLAKED-STONE INDUSTRY The remarks concerning the flaked- stone industry are based on a total of 722 pieces of flint and 94 pieces of obsidian. This bulk represents about 40 per cent of the total excavated; an equal amount is in Baghdad, and the remainder was left at the site. The industry is surprising in that com- paratively few tool-types are recognizable. Just under 5 per cent of the bulk in Chi- cago have been definitely retouched or their specific use determinable from the working. Although the retouched quan- tity is small, about 80 per cent of the total show some indication of having been used. Sharp edges are chipped frequently, pre- sumably from the pressure exerted in their use. Few of the flakes look as if they had been struck from the core with a definite shape in mind. For the most part the flakes are miscellaneous, erratic shapes. The striking-platforms of the flakes and the bladelike flakes are large; small strik- ing-platforms are noticeable in only the few small, neat blades. Sickle blades were the most numerous of the recognizable types, accounting for eighteen examples clearly recognizable by the glossy sheen. Of these, five were made on blade sections (P1. X:4). Eight were made on bladelike flakes (P1. X:1, 5), and seven on flakes (P1. X:2, 3). Fourteen of the sickle blades have a partial coating of what seems to be bitu- men. In most cases this comes fairly close to the cutting edge (P1. X:1, 5). In one case the bitumen was not evenly applied (P1. X :5). The cutting edge is never re- touched but is sometimes denticulated by use. A single example shows retouch; it is steeply retouched along the back to pro- duce a blunted edge. One example gives evidence that the position of the blade was reversed when the first side became dulled. There is some indication that a few of the blades were used for other purposes, both before and after their use as sickle blades. The sickle blades came from the follow- ing levels: Blades Flakes Bladelike Flakes VI, 1 II, surface-1 VI, 2 IX, second VI, 2 VI, 3S floor TT-1, I, 2 VI, third floor VI, 4-5 (2) TT-1, III, 1 VI, 4N IX, first floor TT-1, VI, 1 IX, first floor TT-1, I, 2 XI, surface-2 TT-1, II, 2 TT-1, III, 2 TT-1, III, 1 Three pointed tools, probably used as borers, were recovered from VI, 2, from IX, first floor, and from VIII, surface- 4.5 m. The bulbar surface is worked on only one of these. Retouch covers both sides entirely and the upper surfaces as well. The retouch is fairly steep on the sides (P1. X:8). A fourth artifact is also probably a borer; the point itself is miss- ing. 21 Professor Braidwood informs me that one of these objects was also found in the Amouq; its pos- sible uses are unknown.</page><page sequence="20">20 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES One "knife" was found in VI, sur- face-1 m. (P1. X:12). The cutting edge is unretouched, except for possible bits along the upper surface. Steep retouch along the back may indicate that this was held in the hand, but a substance something like bitumen adheres to both sides; possibly the tool was hafted in some way. In addition to the sickle blades on blades, there were seven fairly good ex- amples of blades (P1. X:ll1). Only two show retouch, but all show signs of having been used. It is on these blades that the only small striking-platforms, other than those of the sickle blades, occur. The bulk of the material gives the im- pression that no great care was taken in the manufacture of artifacts of flint. The neat blades, present in very small quan- tity, indicate that the flint worker had suf- ficient skill to do better work but that pre- cise working was felt to be unnecessary. Three pieces of black flint, from VI, 3, from VI, 4-5, and from IX, first floor, have considerable steep retouch but are without any specific form. One large flake, 140X40 millimeters, with retouch along both edges, came from TT-1, II, 2. An- other large bladelike flake, 130X 65 milli- meters, with steep retouch along the back and possibly retouched along the edge, came from IX, first floor. Two smaller bladelike flakes, with fairly steep retouch along one or both edges, occurred in TT-1, II, 3, and in TT-1, III, 2. A total of 94 pieces of obsidian was returned to Chi- cago. Of these, 24 are blades or blade sec- tions (e.g., P1. X:6), the remainder mis- cellaneous chips (e.g., P1. X :7). Three of the blades are retouched along both edges. Almost all of the blades show slight signs of having been used. One blade section was exceptionally large, measuring 150X 70 millimeters; but the majority falls close in size to that illustrated. The flint and obsidian came from the following levels in the quantity indicated: Level Flint Obsidian VI, surface-i m.... 40 7 VI, 2............. 27 7 VI, 3 ............. 131 12 VI, third floor. ..... 34 11 VI, 4.......... 98 0 VI, 4N ............ 113 19 VI, 4-5............. 22 14 VI, 5. ........... . 176 4 TT-1, I, 1 ......... 2 0 TT-1, I, 2 ......... 3 1 TT-1, I, 3 ......... 2 2 TT-1, II, 2 ........ 21 2 TT-1, II, 3 ........ 19 1 TT-1, III, 1 ....... 50 3 TT-1, III, 2....... 42 0 TT-1, V, 2. 4 1 TT-1, VI, 1........ 4 0 IX , 1 ............. 44 44 IX, first floor ....... 50 2 IX, 3 ............. 41 0 IX , 4 ............. 6 0 I, 1 ............... 4 0 II, surface- m. ..... 44 0 V, 2 .............. 40 0 VIII-4.5 m......... 1 0 XI-2 m ............ 9 0 XII-1 m........... 9 0 VI. GROUND-STONE INDUSTRY Objects in the ground-stone category include mortars, pestles, rubbers, and nu- merous beads. For the larger implements limestone, diabase, dolorite, and low met- amorphic schist are the most commonly used raw materials. Limestone, chalce- dony, and marble are the most common varieties of stone used for the manufac- ture of small objects. A considerable number of pestles was found, in general similar to Plate XI:I (o6litic limestone from IX, 1) and to Fig- ure 19:6 (sandstone from II, surface- 1 m.). Figure 18:5 (oilitic limestone from IX, surface-i m.) is a shorter, stubbier variety.</page><page sequence="21">MATARRAH 21 A broken quartzite cylinder, about seven centimeters in diameter, has a slight polish on the remaining end; but the sur- face is pitted from a point about 3 centi- meters from the end. It is possible that this was used as a roller, perhaps in grind- ing grain. Large mortars were also present. The major portion of one mortar (Fig. 20:13) and a smaller portion of another from the surface (Fig. 18:3-of dolorite) are closely similar. Both were round or oval, with a shallow depression in the center. The bot- toms are rough and pitted. A large, flat stone slab, roughly rec- tangular, with rounded ends, has a worn and beaten surface. It probably belongs in a group with the mortars. Rubbers, roughly globular in shape, were found throughout the operations. The rubbers generally exhibit a number of facets received in rubbing (cf. Fig. 18:1 and P1. XI:2, both from IX, 1 and of diabase). Another rubber is flat and more or less lozenge-shaped (Fig. 18:2 from VI, 1). Two borers of low metamorphic schist were recovered from VI, 2 and IX, 2 (Fig. 19:3; P1. XI:7). Only one celt was found at the site. It is shaped like an ax with a polished work- ing edge and a chipped butt. The stone is diabase (Fig. 19:1). Plate XI:3 probably illustrates the beginning of another celt. It gives the appearance of having had one side ground down and then being dis- carded while still unfinished. The material is quartzite. Two tools of low metamorphic schist have adzlike edges. One of these has a flat butt (Fig. 18:4 from VI, 4-5). The other has an adz edge on both ends (Fig. 19:5 from TT-1, III, 1). Both are roughly shaped. A large hoelike implement with a con- vex axlike edge (M-20 from VIII, sur- face-4.5 m.), is of polished stone, with a chipped edge. Near the butt is a large perforation, probably for use with a haft. Two pieces of shale, one from VI, third floor (Fig. 20:12), the other from TT-1, III, 1 (P1. XI:4), have edges too flat and squared to have been caused by natural forces. The latter has a quantity of red pigment, probably ocher, heavily im- pressed on the narrow side, with some spread over the large surfaces. A small, flat, and almost circular piece of shale came from IX, first floor (Fig. 18:6). A piece of shale from VI, 3 may have been used as a scraper. The curved end is a more or less rounded point that is fairly smooth. The butt is flat and about one centimeter thick (Fig. 19:2). Two stones from disturbed areas are circular and have depressions worn in both sides (P1. XI:5). A roughly oval stone from I, sur- face-i m. (P1. XI:6) resembles the sling missiles in shape and size. From II, surface-i m. came a more or less semicylindrical stone (Fig. 19:4). The roughly flat lower surface has been smoothed. Scratches without any orienta- tion indicate that it may have been used for rubbing. Two rim fragments of polished stone vessels were recovered from VI, surface- 1 m. (M-55) and VI, 4-5 (M-131). A small cup, quite crude, was made from a pebble (M-18 from IX, surface-0.5 m.); and one rim fragment of another small bowl has a pitted surface (M-26 from IX, 1). Six stone nails were recovered. Of the four returned to Chicago, only the spe- cific type of stone of one example has been determined; this proved to be marble (Fig. 20:2). Another is also white, perhaps also</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES marble (Fig. 20:6). Two others came from the surface or close to the surface (P1. XII :19, 20). A flat, polished semicircle that is broken was recovered from IX, 2 (Fig. 20:1 of marble). A single biconical white-stone toggle came from IX, 1 (M-24). The cones are separated by a groove around the circum- ference. Stone beads, of which about forty were recovered, have their greatest concentra- tion in the Upper Phase; but a smaller number are scattered through the levels of Operation VI. The stones most commonly used in their manufacture, as indicated by the analysis of those in Chicago, are lime- stone, chalcedony, calcareous shale, car- nelian, and soapstone. Most of the beads are relatively simple, short, oblate shapes (cf. Fig. 20:11 and P1. XII:14, 22); and some are disklike. There are also long beads (Pl. XII :15-17 and Fig. 20:8), some round in section, others flattened. A roughly rectangular bead or pendant came from IX, 1. It originally had a button-like perforation, but this part is now broken (Fig. 20:10). It is of limestone and is incised with paral- lel oblique lines. Five long, drop-shaped beads with lengthwise loop bored perfora- tion, broken save in one instance, came from the Upper Phase, two from IX, sur- face-1 m., one from IX, 1, and one from VI, 1 (Fig. 20:4, 5). The two in Chicago have been identified as marble. A pendant of incised white stone came from the sur- face of the site (M-13); it may or may not belong with the assemblage. A complete necklace was found in association with the burial S-M-8 from VI, 4 (P1. XII:22), mainly of long beads of shell interspersed with many small, disklike beads and ob- late beads and one globular bead of tur- quoise-like material. VII. BONE INDUSTRY The bone industry is described on the basis of a sample of 226 specimens, a few of which are in Baghdad, with descrip- tions in Chicago. The lot returned to Chi- cago consisted, for the most part, of defi- nitely worked and shaped pieces. There are only 90 examples of this lot which were unworked and to which no use can be attributed. Awls are the most numerous single form, with 78 examples, including 14 shafts which we are convinced belong in this group. The awls have a considerable variation in size, ranging from small, thin points to large examples complete with articular surface. A few of the more or less complete awls are long and slender (Fig. 21:1), and it is with these that we would include the slender shafts (e.g., Fig. 21:11). All of this group are highly polished. Larger and thicker, but of the same type, are several others (M-32, Pl. XII :2, 3). These slender shafts and double-pointed awls may have been used as pins rather than awls. One, with a fairly definite butt end (M-109, P1. XII:3) has bitumen adhering to it. With increasing size the method of manu- facture was to split the bone through the center, retaining the articular surface as the butt, and to polish the point and rounded surfaces (Fig. 21:2-5, 8; P1. XII:1). Variants of these are thick-based triangular points (Fig. 21:6), of which we have six examples. The size that the awls may reach is evident in Figure 21:7, though this example is broken beneath the articular surface. However, five large awls were complete (Fig. 21:8, P1. XII:1). Eight small, slender bones were pro- vided with a perforation, indicating their use as needles (Fig. 21:12, 13; P1. XII:4). Two of these had pointed upper ends (Pl. XII :4).</page><page sequence="23">MATARRAH 23 Nine spatulate-ended bones, used as gouges, were found. Almost all of these had a fairly good adzlike edge and prob- ably utilized the natural hollow of the bone (Fig. 21:14, Pl. XII:6), but the hol- low is missing in two examples (P1. XII:7). A total of 14 rib-blades was found. Of these, two had pierced holes (Fig. 21:10), but the others were plain (P1. XII:8). A single bone tool was recovered that had a bipronged working end (M-75). In the realm of decoration, bone was used for gorgets and beads. One of the gorgets is more or less rectangular in transverse section, and is 52 millimeters long (M-28). The other is double-pointed and 23 millimeters in length (M-64). Four bone beads were recovered, three from VI, 4 and one from VI, 4-5. One of these was long and more or less cylindrical (M-100; P1l. XII:10), and one was seg- mented by incision (M-107; P1. XII: 11). The remaining two (M-103, M-106; Pl. XII:12, 13) were tubular and fairly long. In addition to these, which are in Chicago, one bead with flattened, bulging sides, of blackened bone (M-114), is in Baghdad. Relatively unclassifiable in terms of functional or decorative use are a polished tube, 35 millimeters in length (M-96), and a more or less rectangular bone tab (M-19, P1. XI1:9). One bone was whittled down to a point and has the general appearance of an awl, though without the smoothness and polish that are characteristic of the awls noted above. Twenty miscellaneous bone fragments have been polished, but the remaining fragments give no indication of their origi- nal use. Seventeen polished bones, includ- ing 12 artifacts, were blackened, possibly as the result of fire. The sample included 90 pieces of un- worked and unpolished bone. The distri- bution of the bone artifacts was as follows: Rib- Awls Gouges blades VI, surface-1 mi... 5 0 0 VI, 1............ 2 0 0 VI, 2 ............. 3 0 0 VI, 3............. 9 2 0 VI, third floor ..... 1 0 0 VI, 4............. 8 2 2 VI, 4-5 ........... 1 1 1 VI, 5 ........... 1 0 1 IX, surface-1 m... 1 0 0 IX, 1.............. 1 0 0 IX, first floor ..... 5 1 3 IX, 2........... . 14 1 3 TT-1, I, 3........ 1 0 0 TT-1, II, 1 ....... 1 0 0 TT-1, III, 1 ...... 3 0 1 The awl shafts and nine awls of un- known or uncertain context are not in- cluded in the above breakdown. Three spatulate and three rib-tools could not be definitely assigned to any level. VIII. OTHER MATERIALS Shell was the only category of material not listed above which was used for the manufacture of artifacts. Products, as they remain to us, include only beads. A more or less complete necklace was found in association with burial S-M-8, which included stone beads interspersed among those of shell (P1. XII:22). In addition to the necklace, 12 shell beads were recovered. Two had had the ribs ground down to give a smooth surface (Fig. 20:7), but the remainder retained the ribs (Fig. 20:9). Five were from IX, 2, one from VI, 3, and six from VI, 4-5. IX. BURIALS Two burials of Islamic date were lo- cated but were not excavated (S-M-1 and S-M-7). A multiple burial (S-M-2), with the remains of four individuals, was exposed</page><page sequence="24">24 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES in IX, first floor. All had apparently been dismembered and thrown into the pit without orientation. The bones were com- pletely mixed, some broken at the time of interment. In no case was the atlas or axis still near the head. The individuals repre- sented were (1) an infant, perhaps new- born, recognizable from the shape of the fragmentary, papery skull; (2) one ten- year-old, recognizable as such from the teeth (some were permanent, but some permanent teeth were still unerupted)-- possibly a male; (3) one young adolescent, perhaps 13 to 16 years old at time of death; and (4) one young adult, possibly female. S-M-3 is a mature male found in IX, first floor. The orientation of the atlas and axis was 600 west of north. The legs were slightly flexed and forward. It was buried with the head lying on its left side, the shoulders turned, and the pelvis almost dorsal. The arms were bent up, with the hands together near the chin in front of the face. The preservation was extremely poor; the head was crushed and frag- mented. Mortuary gifts included a sub- hemispherical incised bowl of the Fine Simple Ware (M-84) and a small, thin jar of the storage-jar type. One stone bead and one bone bead were also associated. S-M-4 is a newborn infant. The head is crushed and distorted and upright. Under- neath and to the southeast stretched the ribs, vertebrae to lumbars, and humeri. The only teeth were unerupted milk teeth. There were no Beigaben. The preservation was extremely poor. It was found in VI, 1. S-M-5 was a flexed burial on its right side. It was found in IX, first floor, and judged to be contemporary with that level. The elbows were bent, bringing the fingers near the head. The knees were flexed. The skeleton was extremely frag- mentary and the preservation poor. There were no Beigaben. S-M-6 was an extremely fragmentary burial in IX, first floor. Other than bones of the skull the shaft of a longbone was all that remained. The position of the face was upside down. The preservation was fair, but not enough material remained to be significant. There were no Beigaben. S-M-8 was a juvenile burial intrusive from VI, 4. It was flexed, and the orienta- tion of the atlas and axis was 200 east of south. Beigaben consisted of a shell and stone necklace (M-149, P1. XII:22). The preservation of all skeletons lo- cated was too fragmentary or too poor to permit interpretation as to physical type. X.

Our par- ticular interest is in the dynamics of style change during this period. Such an under- taking involves many difficulties, not the least of which is the use of publications. Each archeologist has a different way of presenting his materials; and, partly be- cause of the exigencies of publication, partly because of idiosyncrasies of the workers, there is much unevenness in the reports. This makes it practically impos- sible for anyone to form an idea of the basis of selection of illustration and discus- sion and, in studying pottery, to get some grasp of the range of variation within a particular style and period. Another dif- ficulty in working mainly with drawings and photographs is developing a "feel" for style which derives from such characteris- tics of the color and texture of the sherds and the observation of certain qualities of drawing. I have been able to compensate to some extent for depending upon repro- ductions by handling the Matarrah and Baghouz materials and by a brief exami- nation of samples of Halaf-style sherds from Arpachiyah, Tepe Gawra, Tell Shaghir Bazar and Tell al-Halaf at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. Concerning the larger problems of com- parative archeology in the region, I have depended on the synthesis presented by Ann Perkins and have limited my investi- gation to the analysis of the style tradition of the painted pottery. The kinds of variables that I have found most useful in formulating the rela- tionships of the Hassunan, Samarran, and Halafian painted styles may be classified as follows:22 1. Regional and local 2. Temporal 3. Functional 4. Technological 5. Internal 6. Idiosyncratic We shall consider the painted pottery tra- dition of the earliest styles under these categories (except the idiosyncratic vari- ables which are not amenable to archeo- logical research, but which are mentioned for reasons of theory). The Samarran style occurs in a context of less elaborate pottery at Tell Hassuna and at Matarrah. In all probability it is nowhere the exclusive ceramic component of an assemblage. Our problem is first to show that the Samarran style is part of a tradition that includes other styles and then to outline the processes by which these styles evolved within the tradition. The excavators of Tell Hassuna main- tain that from the first arrival of the Samarran pottery to its ultimate disappearance there was no per- ceptible sign of its style or material being in any way influenced by the indigenous Has- suna potters. Similarly, although Samarran pottery was evidently treated locally as a superior commodity, there were only rare in- stances of any local imitation of it or of adapta- tion of Hassuna pottery to the Samarran style.23 22 The Department of Anthropology, University of Chicago, has on file a copy of my M.A. research paper in which I elaborate on the social and psycho- logical aspects of these kinds of style differentiation in reference to their recognition in the Americanist field by such scholars as Boas, Ruth Bunzel, Anita Brenner, and Anna Shepard. 23 Lloyd and Safar, "Tell Hassuna," JNES, IV (1945), 261.</page><page sequence="58">58 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES We have taken a number of the band de- signs from Hassuna standard and archaic sherds and compared them to Samarran bands from Hassuna, and we find the design elements within the two types to be similar. That is, the characteristic ele- ments of decoration on sherds that Lloyd and Safar illustrate as Hassuna standard and archaic types are also characteristic Samarran style elements. There are, of course, a number of distinctive Samarran elements and a couple of Hassuna ele- ments-we shall consider them once we have established the fundamental stylistic connection between the two. Although this connection rests upon rather simple characteristics, they seem to "hang to- gether" in a convincing manner. The Sa- marran style is basically simple. The bands of crosshatching, lozenges, oblique lines, and numerous variations of the tri- angle and zigzag are typical of both Has- suna and Samarran design. On Figure 22 are thirty band designs abstracted from the illustrations of the Hassuna report, which should be compared to the Samar- ran repertoire from Baghouz, Samarra, and Nineveh, as illustrated in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, III, No. 1 (1944). One sees immediately that almost the en- tire Hassuna repertoire is duplicated in the Samarran repertoire-the difference appears to lie mainly in the more careful and better drawing on Samarran-style sherds. An examination of the Ninevite 1 and 2 sherds24 leads us to believe that at that site also the Samarran style occurs with a simpler but related painted style. From these drawings it is impossible to abstract bands, as we have done for the Hassuna style; there is enough, however, to indicate that at Nineveh we have ap- proximately the same use of zigzags, hatching, chevrons, and triangles as at Hassuna.I The profile forms of Samarran-style pottery are not complex; although they are more various than the Hassuna painted forms, the two are stylistically similar. The curvature and thickness of the walls, the lack of handles, lugs, and other plastic appendages, the bowl- and jar-forms resemble one another in the two wares. The combination of painting and incising is found in both; and both avoid large areas of paint, using line and small geometric figures to achieve a busy and even metered effect. Within the band, dec- oration is continuous rather than paneledt or grouped. Lloyd and Safar argue that the Sa- marran-style pottery at Tell Hassuna is imported. They give three reasons: 1. Samarran-style sherds occur after the Hassuna types have developed and last into the Halaf period. 2. "It is . . . hardly too much to assume that it was brought from a distance rather than locally made" because it was regarded locally as a "superior commodity." 3. Samarran-style pottery has differences in shape, design, and fineness from Hassuna types. It may be that the Samarran ware at Has- suna is imported, but our point is that it belongs within the same cultural tradition as the local style. If this is true, we must also consider the alternate hypothesis-- that it was manufactured locally. We be- lieve that, when Tell Hassuna is placed in the context of the general archeological picture, the latter hypothesis accounts for the facts more adequately. Baghouz, on the Euphrates, has an oc- currence of Samarran-style pottery which has been studied in some detail. One con- clusion was that about one-third of our sherds from Baghouz are so like those of Samarra as to seem more im- ports than merely pots of similar design. The remaining two-thirds of the Baghouz sherds 24 As illustrated in the Annals of Archeology and Anthropology, XX (1933), Plates XXXVII-XLV.</page><page sequence="59">MATARRAH 59 have motifs typical of the Samarran painted style but the execution of these motifs lacks the deliberation evinced at Samarra.25 Braidwood remarks that this "impression may be due to Herzfeld's selection of ex- amples for illustration."26 The Matarrah material seems to support this observa- tion. According to Lloyd and Safar (obser- vations made to the Braidwoods at the site), all the painted pottery recovered at Matarrah is Samarran except the few Halaf and Ubaid sherds from the upper- most levels. If this is so, we must revise our idea of the Samarran style to include a number of comparatively simple sherds less precisely painted.27 Thus we are led to suspect that there is a near continuum be- tween the Samarran style and the Has- suna style and that the available reports are misleading. First, Nineveh yielded a simpler pottery; then, two thirds of the Baghouz sherds showed less precision of execution; next, at Tell Hassuna the Sa- marran style was found in excellent con- text with a simpler ware; and now, at Matarrah we get the Samarran style again, and with a gradation from the simply drawn to the tight, busy, precise drawing which is the "ideal type" for the style. The present published material is not adequate to find a temporal variation in the Samarran style: from Nineveh and Baghouz we have only a few sherds; there is no stratigraphy at Samarra; there are only a few Samarran sherds at Arpachi- yah; at Matarrah the Samarran style oc- curs only in the later phase. Tell Hassuna has a number of levels with Samarran style, but this material cannot be properly analyzed for time variation from the pub- lication. It may be that, if the absolute dating one hopes for through the C-14 process becomes available, we will find that we are dealing with styles that have a more rapid development and much shorter periods of popularity than we are accus- tomed to assume. On the relation of the Samarran and Halaf styles (which we shall discuss at the end of this paper) Mallowan indicates his belief that very little tem- poral differentiation existed: My own guess would be that, as these two schools of painting flourished together for a long time, they might also have been invented at about the same time. I suspect that they sprang into being fully fledged, like Pallas Athene out of the head of Zeus, and that the invention might have occurred as the result of the technical control which the earliest Ninevite and Hassuna schools of pot painting had acquired over clays, pigments and kilns.8 There is a temptation to interpret Tell Hassuna as an example of the evolution of Samarran style out of a simpler painted pottery style, with the simpler Hassuna painted style continuing as a common or domestic ware. (The excavators of Tell Hassuna object to this interpretation, as we have already pointed out.) The invita- tion to fallacy here is the tendency to visualize "evolution out of" in terms of a simplistic conception of "origin" and of unilinear development. It seems more ap- propriate to formulate a conception of a tradition, having some local variation, which recognizes a functional distinction between domestic and fine ware. If this is true, then the differences between the Hassuna painted style and the Samarran style can be interpreted as following from the increased skill and attention paid to the manufacture and decoration of the Samarran-style ware. Certain purely for- 25 Edna Tulane, JNES, III (1944), 64. 26 JNES, III (1944), 52. 27 Both Lloyd and Safar, too, noted this relative simplicity; their reaction was to call these simpler sherds "local Samarran." It was their opinion that none of the painted sherds at AMatarrah conformed with what they had classified as either Hassuna "standard" or "archaic" at the type site. 2S M. E. L. Mallowan, "Excavations at Brak and Chagar Bazar," Iraq, IX (1947), 247.</page><page sequence="60">60 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES mal factors of differentiation would be in- volved inr such a process of change. The present limitations of our knowledge of the material make it impossible to say ex- actly what these formal factors were, but we suggest that they may have been as follows. Since style is systematic, we are justi- fied in assuming that there is an inter- dependence of parts that condition changes of style. A potter begins to deco- rate a pot with some notion of how the pot should look and with some ability of carry through this notion. Stated in formalistic terms, this notion of the Samarran potter is as follows: 1. The predominant use of unpaneled ele- ments within enclosed bands. 2. The alternation of direction of movement and/or symmetrical motion of contiguous bands. 3. The emphasis of fourfold rotation or of quatrofold radial symmetry of finite de- signs."9 4. The dominant use of lineal rather than areal design elements. 5. The uniformity and precision of drafts- manship. 6. The tendency to balance equally painted and ground areas. Stated in psychological terms, as an aes- thetic ideal, the style is neat, busy, and abstract.30 In examining individual sherds and pots, we must discount a certain amount of variation as idiosyncratic; and we should avoid being overly influenced by particular sherds. In other words, we should form an over-all or gross impres- sion of the material. Our typology does not have to conform exactly to this im- pression, since we may want to make an analysis in terms of ideal types. This needs to be said because, in working with pub- lished material where there is no standard procedure of publication, it is impossible to do more than guess at what has been left out and why. We have already dis- cussed the fact that the Samarran style must be taken to include more variability of execution than was at first thought. The illustrations of the Samarran style at Matarrah in this report give us a range from the neat, small geometric figures of Plate VIII:3, 8 to the simpler and more free zigzags on sherds (Fig. 12:2, 3). Herzfeld shows a few examples of rela- tively loose or careless or unskilled draw- ing"1 but so few that they appear com- pletely idiosyncratic. At Matarrah the narrow bands of small figures are rare, and the zigzag, plain lines and crosshatched bands are most common. There may have been some local variation in the style in terms of the popularity at different sites of small geometric figures in narrow bands, crenelated lines, crosshatching, etc.; but we cannot tell from the publications. We have no choice but to consider the various manifestations of Samarran style to- gether, as illustrated in the several re- ports. Taken thus, we can recogni7e the formal charasteristics outlined above. One of the formal features of the Sa- marran style and of the simpler contem- porary style is the use of a continuous rather than paneled band. The band is usually framed, but other structural lines are rare. Paneling does occur, bu but by far the most common arrangements are the serial repetition of small geometric figures equally spaced and variations of the zig- 29 These and a few more terms are used in this paper following Anna O. Shepard's usage in "Sym- metry of Abstract Design with Special Reference to Ceramic Decoration," Contributions to American Anthropology and History, IX, No. 47 (Carnegie Institution, 1948). 30 See Perkins' formalistic characterization of the Samarran style, "SAOC," No. XXV (1949). Our analysis agrees with Perkins and contrasts with Tulane's, JNES, III, No. 1 (1944). 3' IHerzfeld in Samarra V (1930), Pl. XXIX, 241; P1. XLII, 286, 231: P1. XXIII, 115, 116. 32 P1.

Of the small figures the "pegs" are famous-these occur most often in con- nected bands rather than in single bands (Fig. 23:1). In the Matarrah example we see them on Figure 13:16, 17, 18; while on Plate VIII:8 there is an interesting vari- ation of the pegs. There is movement in this form, but it is not directional-the same is true of several of the bifold rota- tional elements (Fig. 23:2, 3). Often, how- ever, the movement of the symmetry is given direction by the "pointing" of ele- ments (Fig. 23:4) or by mechanical equi- librium (Fig. 23:5). These bands are usu- ally alternated so that the dynamic effect is increased by contrast (Fig. 24:1). Even when the directional element is not so strongly emphasized, we find the same principle of contrast underlying the alter- nation of bands, for the motifs of one band are diagonally oriented and of the next are orientated vertically and horizontally (Fig. 24:2).

In Figures 335 and 338 of this group (of Tulane's) the contrast is of symmetry, .... o 2 3 4 5 FIG. 25 with one band having direction defined by mechanical equilibrium and by associa- tion defining the direction of the alternate band (Fig. 24:5). Other examples of direc- tional orientation are bands of diagonal lines and of chevrons. The varied use of the zigzag results in a great deal of move- ment of a less staccato effect than the fig- ures we have just been discussing, and sometimes the two are nicely contrasted- as in M-147 (Fig. 25:1; Fig. 16:11). A discussion of the famous bowl-cen- ters would involve us in too great detail for our purposes. There are several formal characteristics of the centers that should be briefly discussed-it is our belief that they are obvious enough not to require elaboration. In the designs having some representational elements the torque of the arrangement is usually quite pro- nounced. The symmetry of design is most often fourfold rotational-and, to quote Shepard, As a working hypothesis to be tested in the study of design, I suggest that rotational sym- metry is a primary factor (causing dynamic effect in decorative design) because rhythmic motion is inherent in its structure.34 The vitality of movement is heightened by connotative elements such as direction of head, "flowing hair," suggestions of lo- comotion, etc. A number of bowl-centers have only abstrast design-these tend to be more compactly decorated and to have quatrofold radial symmetry. 35 At Hassuna there occurs a "Hassuna archaic painted ware" bowl which has on the interior two broad crosshatched bands crossed to form a quatrofold radially symmetric design and another bowl of the same ware with the interior decorated.36 It would be possible to go into great de- tail concerning the niceties of the Samar- ran style, possibly defining substyles; but our aim is to stick to the broader or tradi- tional characteristics and to indicate the direction of differentiation and the stylis- tic processes involved. To do this, we have concentrated on the principle of contrast and its psychological counterpart, the dy- namic and sometimes busy effect of the 3a JNES, III, No. 1 (1944), Figs. 335-40. 34 Op. cit., p. 236. 15 JNES, III (1944), Figs. 281-90. 36 JNES, IV, No. 4 (1945), P1. XIV, 2.</page><page sequence="63">MATARRAH 63 style. We would call attention to several other elements of the style. The first of these is the dominant use of line rather than area. Lines are contrasted to each other, occasionally by varying width but most often in terms of direction and orien- tation. Although negative painting was used, it was not important; and it was em- ployed to get lineal effects (Fig. 13:7). The contrasting line is manifest in such bands as the variations of the zigzag (Fig. 25:1, 2, 3, 4), chevrons, bands of diagonal lines (Fig. 25:5), crosshatching, etc. Another characteristic of the style is the tendency to balance equally painted tand ground areas. That is, painted areas are given even play with ground areas, so that the contrast is maximized. This is done either by having approximately half the areas painted or by evenly breaking up the ground areas by the spacing of de- sign elements. We are referring to the dec- orated zones of the vessel rather than to the vessel as a whole. Matarrah examples amply illustrate the first method (P1. VIII, all examples except No. 7). The bowl- centers illustrate the second method. The last characteristic which we want to mention is the sharpness of edges of lines, their straightness and flatness of tone. This indicates painstaking attention to the uniform quality of drawing. Al- though the designs are made dynamic, and although line is the principle agency of design, the lines themselves ideally are standardized to an almost compulsive precision. This brings them out so that their contrasting movement and their separateness from the ground are empha- sized. The formal characteristics of Samarra.n style which we have just been discussing are the ideal rather than the empirical norm. There are some common characters which we have not discussed-pendant elements, grouped elements, and paneling. Nor have we discussed the thickness and shape of the vessels, their color and tex- ture. Most of these qualities have been amply described in the literature that we have cited. What we wish to emphasize is that the style taken as a totality is simply organized-the vessel shapes are rounded and plain, the zoning37 is neat and appro- priate to the simple shapes, surfaces are even and dull,38 painting is precise and monochrome. In addition to its simplicity, the style includes a number of subtle and dynamic effects which we have briefly ex- amined in terms of contrast. Hassuna standard and archaic painted wares have most of the characteristics we have described but in an attenuated form.39 At Matarrah we have noticed that the range of "fineness" of the Samarran style is greater than one would expect from publications of other sites. We have postulated a near continuum between the two styles and have examined their for- mal differentiation which we believe re- sulted from the greater time and technical ability applied to Samarran-style vessels. Given a simple painted style like that found at Hassuna and Nineveh and add- ing a desire to make a "fine" ware, either for ceremonial, trade, or local luxury use, we believe that the increased attention to drawing and the larger investment of time would lead to something like the Samar- ran style as we have dessribed it. At Tell Hassuna, Baghouz, Matarrah, Nineveh, and Samarra we may be dealing with a local or an imported ware. That is, there may have been towns that special- ized in the manufacture of fine painted pottery. It may be that at a given site some of the Samarran-style pottery is im- 37 Ann Perkins, "SAOC," No. XXV, 13-14, gives an excellent description of Samarran-style zoning. 38R. J.

XVI, 1, vessels 8, 9, 10; P1. XVI, 2, vessels 1, 3, 5.</page><page sequence="64">64 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES ported and some of it is locally made. It is our guess that there are substyles of the Samarran style as we have discussed it which correspond to local specializations. For example, one village or family may have specialized in the bowls that have representational elements on the inside design, another may have "owned" or specialized in the manufacture of vessels having narrow multiple bands of small geometric figures, etc. Microscopic analy- sis of the clay, temper, and paint should be useful in testing this hypothesis, as well as more excavation and fuller reporting. The paucity of material makes it al- most impossible for us to do more than speculate on the nature of the transition from the Hassuna and Samarran styles to the Halaf styles. A number of the motifs of Samarran style are incorporated with some modifications into the Halaf style-- the fringed triangle, pegs, diaper pattern (P1. VIII:8), quatrofold organization of plate centers, crosshatched lozenge, and a number of other elements. These are the things that often dominate style compari- sons in archeological literature. We shall take a more general view of the tradition. The characteristics of Halaf style which have greatest structural significance are: 1. The freedom of drawing, which approaches cursiveness. 2. The importance of color (polytone and/or polychrome) in giving value to the pat- tern. 3. The tendency toward two-dimensional or over-all design and to "openness" of bands. 4. The lack of dynamic effects. The Halaf style contrasts sharply to the Samarran style in the treatment of line. The Halaf-style potter allowed his brush strokes to vary in pressure, length, and direction so that he obtained a free and rapid effect. Lines are allowed to spot at the ends and wherever strokes overlap and cross. This variety of line builds up detail within the design. A number of factors may be involved: (1) the shift of interest to color may have led to the neglect of draftsmanship; (2) mass manufacture may have resulted in less attention to pre- cision of drawing; (3) the viscosity of new paints favored for their glaze and color may have made precise control of brush work more difficult. Each one of these probabilities could be elaborated and their importance weighed if we had more data. Mallowan advances a technological ex- planation for the importance of color in Halaf ceramic style: This variation of colour due to the difficulty of regulating the furnace is of cardinal im- portance, for it was owing to this that the potter eventually found himself led to the deliberate use of polychromy. In the first stage he deliberately exploited the variation of tone in colours by applying his paint with greater or less density according to his desire to obtain a red or a black tone ... .It is therefore quite wrong to suppose that the Tall Halaf potter learnt the use of polychromy from an outside source: he discovered it for himself, by a natural and logical process of experiment.40 The problem that this poses is the classic one of invention and diffusion. Did the importance of color in the Halaf style arise in Arpachiyah-or in such North Tigris and Habur centers as represented by Arpachiyah and Tell Halaf--as part of a local variation, and diffuse over the re- gion? Or did the shift within the tradition from emphasizing precise lineal qualities to the emphasis of color contrasts take several local forms and through mutual interchange become the Halaf style? Our present knowledge is inadequate for more than a formulation of this problem. What we can observe is the formal relatedness or consistency between the value of color contrasts and the cursiveness of drawing 40 Iraq, II (1935), 176.</page><page sequence="65">MATARRAH 65 in Halaf decoration in contrast to the rigidity of drawing and value of lineal con- trasts in the related Samarran style.41 It should be realized that all these formal factors operate in a complex of situations in which technological, temporal, func- tional, local, and idiosyncratic variables play a part. Although we applaud the evi- dence that Mallowan has produced con- cerning the relationship of firing tech- niques to polytone and polychrome deco- ration, we are not ready to see this as "a natural and logical process"-at least un- til more facts are available concerning the transition from Samarran to Halaf style or, as Mallowan has suggested, their rela- tionship as contemporary styles through most of their careers. The last two characteristics of Halaf style which we have listed-the tendency to two-dimensional design and the lack of dynamic effects-are discussed by Per- kins.42 The openness of bands is probably related to the changes of motifs favored (the extensive use of dots, for example) and the character of the drawing. The "static" effect of the Halaf style in com- parison to the busyness of the Samarran style in part results from the lesser empha- sis on lineal contrasts in the Halaf style ("dynamic" effects are most easily ob- tained by giving directional orientation to design, and this is done more effectively with line than with color). The increased use of paneling and the decreased usage of rotational symmetry are also important factors effecting the "static" quality of the Halaf style. This is compensated for by the greater variety and complexity of motifs, the richness of total contrasts and of detail of brush work. Perkins summarizes Mallowan and Rose's Arpachiyah report to illustrate three phases of development of the Halaf painted style. The style is shown to de- velop from simple shapes and decoration to the fancy plates of the "Late Phase." How much temporal variation these phases represent is entirely unknown. Even if they do have developmental sig- nificance, they are probably representa- tive of the local scene only and thus are misleading when applied to the region as a whole. This is particularly true since so little is known of the manifestations of the Halaf style in the Lake Van area and since there is an as yet vaguely defined regional variation between the Halaf style in the Habur drainage and the eastern sites.43 There is some evidence that Arpachiyah was a center of pottery production; there- fore many of the differences which Perkins outlines as characteristics of the Early, Middle, and Late Phases may be func- tional, formal, and technological but not "evolutionary." That is, the fine plates of the Late Phase are probably the product of a single craftsman, family, or guild, and some or most of the Middle and Early Phase wares the manufacture of other wholly or at least partly contemporary potters. SUMMARY Under the headings of six kinds of dif- ferentiation we have outlined some of the variables of stylistic change in the earliest known painted pottery tradition of north- ern Mesopotamia-local, temporal, func- tional, technological, internal, and idio- syncratic. Our main interpretive hypothe- ses have emerged as follows: (1) that the Samarran style belongs to the same painted pottery tradition as the Hassuna style; (2) that the Samarran style is dif- ferentiated as a luxury ware from contem- porary styles within the tradition; (3) that some of the special stylistic features of the Samarran style are structural elaborations initiated by its cultural function as a 41 That these may not be necessary relations does not mean that they were not historically significant. 42 Ann Perkins, "SAOC," No. XXV, 28-31. 43 Ibid., pp. 28-31.</page><page sequence="66">66 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES "fine" ware; (4) that there were probably centers of pottery manufacture which spe- cialized in one or another of the substyles of the Samarran style and traded these over the region. We have postulated a stylistic con- tinuity between the Hassuna and Samar- ran styles and the Halaf styles and, though questioning Perkins' three phases of Halaf stylistic development, have indi- cated some of the structural characteris- tics of the transition and the probable role of technological, local, and internal dif- ferentiation. CONCLUSIONS ROBERT J. BRAIDWOOD AND LINDA BRAIDWOOD The general picture of the early village development in northerly Iraq, as avail- able from extant materials before the site of Matarrah was excavated, is indicated by Dr. A. L. Perkins' Comparative Arche- ology of Early Mesopotamnia44 and in Lloyd and Safar's (and our own) sections in the Hassuna report.45 Since a further interpretation of the evidence from Ma- tarrah will be published when the techni- cal reports are ready, we shall restrict our- selves here to certain general observations. At this writing, there is no direct stratigraphic evidence that the materials we recovered in our excavations at Jarmo (see n. 2, p. 2, above) are earlier than those of Tell Hassuna or Matarrah.46 In terms of pure typology, the Jarmo mate- rials are earlier-the site yielded no port- able pottery save in its uppermost levels, but did contain a certain proportion of microlithic sized flint tools, a trait present in the extended Gravettian exposure at Zarzi47 but so far not noted in the avail- able earliest village materials of Iraq, Iran, or Syria. We consciously exercised such control at Matarrah on several test occasions so that, had microliths been a normal and appreciable item in the Ma- tarrah assemblage, we should have recov- ered them. The map, Figure 1, indicates how Jarmo lies well up in the hill country above Kirkuk, while Matarrah lies on the flanks of the alluvial plain. The point at, issue here is obviously whether Jarmo lay somewhat in a geographical (and by impli- cation, chronological) backwater. While through hilly country, the way up to Jarmo from Kirkuk is an easy one. We do not consider that the factor of isolation is significant here. For the moment, how- ever, an assessment of antecedence for Jarmo over Matarrah or Hassuna is based on typology alone, coupled with the ap- pearance of potsherds of Hassunan type on the surface of mounds in the Jarmo region. The point is of some interest owing to the fact that Professor Libby and Dr. Arnold were able to make one "run" on snail shells from Jarmo with the Carbon 14 dating apparatus; the resultant date was for the range 4756 B.C. + 320 years.48 In our Introduction, we noted our im- pression-based on our observation of the Hassuna materials as published and as available in the Baghdad Museum-that the Matarrah assemblage seems in general 44 "SAOC," No. XXV (Chicago, 1949). 45 JNES, IV (1945), 255-89. 46 Potsherds of Hassunan type were recovered in surface survey on at least two mounds in the plain of Chemchemal (wherein Jarmo lies) in 1950-51. Hence a Hassunan manifestation is indicated in the very region where the Jarmo stage flourished, and Jarmo cannot very well be intercalated into the sequence following the Hassunan stage. 47 D. A. E. Garrod. BASPR, No. 6 (1930). The site of Zarzi lies not far northeast of Jarmo; see our map, Fig. 1. 4S Drs. Libby and Arnold remain less comfortable over their results from shell than from vegetable materials. Moreover, as only one "run" is involved, the above dates for Jarmo should be taken as tenta- tive.</page><page sequence="67">MATARRAH 67 a somewhat impoverished southern vari- ant of that of Hassuna. We implied that this impoverishment might have some- thing to do with the fact that Matarrah lies almost on the southern border of effec- tive rainfall. However, the details which the nonartifactual materials may suggest concerning the original climatic situation at Matarrah must await the completion of the technological reports. Lloyd and Safar subdivided the general range of the Hassuna occurrence into a "neolithic," characterized by the mate- rials from level Ia, and the full Hassunan assemblage which progressed through lev- els Ib.to VI. In our own "Prefatory Re- marks" to the Hassuna report, we offered the alternative suggestion that there may not have been a distinct (and by implica- tion, cultural) separation between the Hassuna Ia materials and those that fol- lowed. There was nothing in the Matarrah occurrence which would tend to make us change our opinion in this matter, one way or another.: Superficially, the traces of the impermanent establishment which we exposed in operation VI, 5 at Matarrah, might be compared to the "neolithic" of level Ia at Hassuna. Unfortunately, the yield in both sherd bulk and in other cate- gories of artifacts from Matarrah VI, 5 was so small that we cannot make a very reliable assessment of the assemblage in- volved for this level. We certainly do not have evidence that it represents a cultural pattern clearly distinct from the succeed- ing levels of Matarrah, however strange the odd-shaped pits themselves may look. In fact, we cannot judge very clearly just which early level in Matarrah should be equivalent to which early level in Has- suna. Smith, as a result of processing the Matarrah materials and studying them in comparison with the Hassuna materials in their published form, came at first to the tentative conclusion that there may have been an earlier phase at Matarrah, not evidenced at Hassuna as it is reported. He subsequently revised this view, and we would ourselves tend to think this might be a function of the generally "impover- ished" aspect of the Matarrah materials and would not impute chronological sig- nificance to it. In our opinion, the estab- lishments at both Hassuna and Matarrah must have been contemporary for the ma- jor portion of their duration: we do not believe there is evidence at present to sug- gest which site was occupied earlier. The general resemblance of the mate- rials from Matarrah and Hassuna will be apparent immediately the two reports are compared. Closer inspection will show that the comparable traits are either (1) sometimes so general as to be of relatively little value for detailed point-by-point comparison, e.g., in architecture, the gen- eral presence of the touf-walled rectilinear several-roomed house at both sites, or (2) if specific in detail, the comparisons fall mainly in the pottery vessel category which has so far been best studied. In pot- tery, the profiles and general handling of the fabric of the Simple Wares at Matar- rah seem rather directly comparable (cf. our large jars, P1. V:1-3, with the Has- suna "milk-jars," [JNES, IV (1945)], Fig. 6:1-2; P1. XIII:1; our "husking trays," P1. V:4, with the original Hassuna ex- amples, op. cit., Fig. 3, 8-10). It may be noted that the "milk jar" profile appeared in the lowest levels of Hassuna (op. cit., pp. 276-78, Fig. 5). In Lloyd and Safar's opinion, our sherd-sortings from the ear- lier levels (in fact from all levels) con- tained no "Hassuna Archaic Painted Ware" whatsoever: on rechecking with the originals in the Baghdad Museum, we would concur with this. Proper dark-faced burnished ware, apparently present in Hassuna in small amounts (op. cit., p. 278), cannot be said to have appeared in</page><page sequence="68">68 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Matarrah at all (the two or three sherds which might be pointed to as exceptions to this were doubtless due to accidents in firing or use). Lloyd and Safar were espe- cially struck with the quality of execution and elaboration of motifs in our Fine Simple Ware-incised subgroup counter- part of the "Standard Hassuna Incised Ware," especially in the higher Matarrah levels. This elaboration was not apparent at Hassuna. On the other hand, Matarrah yielded no cases which Lloyd and Safar took to be typical of "Hassuna Painted and Incised Ware" or of "Hassuna Stand- ard Painted Ware." Matarrah did not yield examples of the large bitumen- and gypsum-lined grain bins of the lower Hassuna levels (op. cit., e.g., Pl. VI:2). Save for spindle whorls and sling mis- siles, there was a general paucity of pot- tery small objects at Matarrah, as com- pared to the type site. We remarked in our Introduction on the generally poor quality of the chipped- flint and obsidian industry, as seen at Matarrah. Unfortunately, we did not see the Hassuna flints and so can only make comparisons with the published examples. Matarrah produced no identifiable pro- jectile points and, in fact, no flint or obsidian artifacts which had any second- ary retouch such as is exhibited on the Hassuna examples.49 The impression one receives from looking at the published Hassuna flint and obsidian examples is of a flint industry which has few identifiable tool types-only sickle blades and pro- jectile points and perhaps an end scraper can be identified in the illustrations-but which is primarily a neat blade industry. On referring to the table of illustrations, however, one sees that only three of the neat blade sections are made of flint; all of the rest of the blades are of obsidian. It may thus be the case at Hassuna, as at Matarrah, that blades and blade sections of obsidian were present in small numbers but that relatively few blades or blade sections of flint were being produced. At both sites one has as a common trait that of using rough flakes for sickle blades. What we want to emphasize here is that there is a definite possibility that the flint and obsidian industries of Hassuna and Matarrah may prove to be fairly similar-aside from the few well-worked "javelin" projectile points of Hassuna- when the bulk of Hassuna lithic material is examined in comparison with the Ma- tarrah flint and obsidian artifacts. When comparing the Matarrah flint and obsidian industry with the industries of the early village materials of Syria and Palestine with which we are more familiar, one immediately recognizes a vast differ- ence. It is then that the casual, careless flint working with little retouch of Matar- rah comes into true focus. For in contra- distinction to Matarrah, the more west- erly villages excel in flint working. Their industries are predominantly neat blade industries-sickle blades, projectile points, points, gravers, borers, etc., are all made on neat, regular flint blades. Secondary retouch is used on many of the items in the tool kit, and the retouch is neat and careful. Some flakes are found in these in- dustries; but, except for scrapers, which are a recognizable tool-type on flakes, the remaining flakes are in the main rejects. Thus, when one sees the mass of Matarrah flint and obsidian, one is forcibly struck by the emaciated aspect of the industry. The tool kit is extremely limited-only two tool-types, the sickle blade and the borer, are present. There is a minimum of retouch on the artifacts. Extremely few flint blades were produced, and in only a few cases were these used as sickle blades. Rough flakes and somewhat more sym- 49 JNES, IV (1945), Fig. 22:8-10.</page><page sequence="69">MATA RRAH 69 metrical bladelike flakes were evidently preferred to blades and were predominant- ly used, as can be seen by the signs of use along their edges. It is difficult to understand the absence of chipped hoes at Matarrah. They were relatively common at Hassuna; but, ex- cept for one large, perforated atypical im- p)lement which may possibly have served as a hoe, no other hoelike object presented itself at Matarrah. Nor were any large celts found at Matarrah (with the excep- tion of one medium-sized axlike celt and a few roughly shaped ground implements with more adzlike bits) which could have served as hoes. Again, polished and chipped celts were relatively common at Hassuna. It is hard to suggest what might have been used as a substitute for the hoe at Matarrah--a wooden stick fortified with a flint flake would be a poor substi- tute. Perhaps more light will be thrown on this question when further excavations are made at Jarmo, for proper hoes are also lacking there. Despite these pertinent omissions, there are quite a few similarities in the ground- stone work of Matarrah and Hassuna. This is most apparent in the large splayed pestles, the globular rubbers, and the heavy mortars. In the smaller stone-object category, there seems to be a basic simi- larity in the bead-types used. Represented at Matarrah by several examples but not found at the type site is a more unusual bead form, a drop-shape of plano-convex section with loop bore on the flat under- surface (cf. P1. XII:18; Fig. 20:4, 5). Another unusual type of decorative small object which is present at Matarrah but absent at Hassuna is the "stud" with bent undershaft (Fig. 20:3; Pl. XII:21, exam- ple with broken shaft). Well represented at both sites are small naillike objects-use unknown (Fig. 20:2, 6; P1. XII:19, 20). The bone industries of Matarrah and Hassuna seem to be basically similar. Awls with articular surface serving as butt and spatulate or gougelike tools, some perforated, are common artifacts at both sites. The more slender pinlike shaft and slender needles of Matarrah are appar- ently missing at Hassuna. As far as more generalizing observa- tions and impressions are concerned, we might very diffidently put down what fol- lows. As a result of handling the Matarrah materials (and observing those of Has- suna) at the same time as we worked on the artifacts from Jarmo, we came to the positive, although completely subjective, conclusion that the Matarrah assemblage must refer to a stage that was technologi- cally rather static, whereas Jarmo refers to a technologically and aesthetically dy- namic stage. If we are right in our assess- ment that Jarmo is earlier than Matarrah and Hassuna, and hence closer to the be- ginnings of the food-producing economy, then the above observation might be translated into the following cultural terms. Jarmo probably flourished during the first flush of cultural intensity which must have followed the discovery of food production. Matarrah (and Hassuna) came later, at a time when the first stable -although primitive-adjustment to the peasant economy had been reached and when cultural intensity had probably somewhat leveled off. We do not mean to imply that the time of Matarrah was one of cultural inactiv- ity, however. We would sense it as a pe- riod when-their food supply and home industry now being stabilized-people be- gan to look outward. Hassuna shows better than Matarrah the traces of con- tact with another focus, that in Syro- Cilicia. These traces seem to indicate that the contact flowed both ways-west to east and east to west. We agree with</page><page sequence="70">70 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Lloyd50 that there is probably a relation- ship between the darker burnished wares of Hassuna and the standard dark-faced burnished ceramic of the west. Full- ground celts and flint "javelin" projectile points are at home in Syro-Cilicia; they seem to be rare at Hassuna51 and almost nonexistent in reliable Matarrah contexts. As to the east-to-west flow, we also agree with Lloyd52 that the earliest painted pot- tery of Hassuna may intrude toward Amouq B and the "protochalcolithic" of Mersin. Professor Mallowan first called our attention, in 1936, to the similarity between the incised ware of Nineveh I (i.e., the incised decorated ware seen in such quantity at Hassuna and Matarrah) and that which we were then getting as a minor strain in Amouq B. There is a rather unmistakable "husking tray" frag- ment at Tell Halaf, supposedly from the "altmonochrom" levels.53 We also sup- pose the clay sling missile to be a basically eastern (Hassunan?) trait; it does not seem to reach the Amouq until Phase C. The clay sling missile, present in Sialk I,54 brings up the question of the links be- tween Iran and the Hassunan assemblage. Smith (see p. 6, above) remarked on the presence of the concave whorl there55 in relation to the Matarrah examples. The presence of the Archaic Painted Ware in the lower Hassuna levels somewhat com- plicates the generally accepted picture of Iran's role as a homeland for early pottery painting, especially if one takes into ac- count both our proposition that the Sa- marran painted style may have arisen in- digenously within the generalized Has- sunan assemblage and the present lack of chronological precision. Another coinci- dence with Iran is the presence at Jarmo, as well as at Sialk I,56 of grooved stone wristlets. At this writing, we still see three basic generalized early village assemblages in the now available material from Syro- Cilicia, northerly Iraq, and northeasterly Iran: Amouq A (Mersin "neolithic," Ras Shamra V), the earlier phase of Hassuna (Nineveh I, lower Matarrah), and Sialk I (Chashmah Ali). We would judge that these assemblages represent the material traces of three distinct cultural foci, al- though we also believe there is evidence (suggested briefly above) that these cul- tures were in some form of contact with each other. We suppose that Jarmo is earlier than the Amouq A-Hassunan- Sialk I stage; we would not be surprised if the terminal cave materials of Professor Coon (near the Caspian) and of M. Ghirshman (in the Bakhtiari hills) are perhaps in part earlier still. All of this range cries out for the sub- mission of specimens to the Carbon 14 dating project. Tentative results with cer- tain Egyptian samples suggest that there may need to be a radical lowering of the archeologists' guess-dates in the range of time pertinent to our materials here. Such would simply add interest to the whole matter. Without the Carbon 14 dating, the archeologist has no really adequate means of assessing time. For all we know, once the food-producing revolution took place, the rate of cultural acceleration may have been surprisingly fast. It has been so since the time of James Watt and the birth of the Industrial Revolution.
