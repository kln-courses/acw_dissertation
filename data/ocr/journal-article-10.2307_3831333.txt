Writing as a Nigerian professor who feels that he is in a good position to correct what he considers defects in Abrahams' view of traditional African society, Ogungbesan argues that Abrahams, who left South Africa in 1939 and has lived in Jamaica since 1959, has become so westernized that he cannot see objectively the socio-political problems of his native land. The professor offers straightforward descriptive criticism of Abrahams' novels and autobiographical writings, but seems less concerned with their literary qualities than for their social significance-or lack of it.

This is the poignant story of Barrie's relationship with the five brothers who (along with his own dead brother, killed in a skating accident at the age of thirteen) became the inspiration for Peter Pan. Himself in many ways a child who could never grow up, Barrie formed a close friendship with the five young sons of Llewelyn and Sylvia Davies and, after the deaths of the parents, became their guardian and surrogate father. It is a touching story, not only because Barrie 447</page><page sequence="8">J. M. BARRIE played his role with affection and generosity, but also because the "lost boy" theme so domi- nant in his life and writings took on a tragic dimension in reality when his two favorites found premature death, one in World War I and the other, the most brilliant, in a drowning accident while he was an undergraduate at Oxford.

THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF GODOT. University Press of Kentucky, 1980. 144 pp. $12. In this study of Waiting for Godot, Busi traces affinities between Beckett and Cervantes and their mutual debt to the traditions of the commedia dell' arte. In certain early Christian heretical works and some books of the Apocrypha, he finds possible sources for Beckett's God/Devil, Jesus/Jude ambiguities as well as some of the names Beckett had in mind when he wrote the play, Busi also explores the influence of Joyce's Finnegans Wake on some of the linguistic and reflexive aspects of the play. But Busi goes beyond sources and influences as he discusses the complexities of Beckett's best-known work. Cohn, Ruby. JUST PLAY: BECKETT'S THEATER. Princeton University Press, 1980. 314 pp. $23.50. Reviewed by JAMES ACHESON, University of Canterbury, New Zealand lust Play: Beckett's Theater, Ruby Cohn's third book on Beckett, differs from her earlier Samuel 449</page><page sequence="10">SAMUEL BECKETT Beckett: The Comic Gamut (1962) and Back to Beckett (1973) in that its emphasis is on scholarship rather than criticism. There is a wealth of scholarly information in the book's three parts-information about Beckett's dramatic devices in Part One, about some of his unpub- lished manuscripts in Part Two, and about productions of his plays in Part Three. In the introduction Cohn implies that the first and third parts of her book are more important than the second. Yet it is in Part Two that we find the first account ever published of Beckett's abandoned play, Human Wishes (1937); the text, in private hands until now, appears in an appendix. Cohn's chapter on the play is fascinating, for she obtained permission from Beckett not only to publish Human Wishes, but to comment on the notes he compiled on its subject, Dr. Johnson's relationship with Mrs. Thrale, prior to writing it. Where the play, a fragment, runs to only ten pages, Beckett took some two hundred pages of notes: Cohn rightly spends more time on them than the text, drawing in helpful background material on Johnson. In the second chapter of Part Two she demonstrates how the as yet unpublished Eleutheria deviates from the conventions of the well-made play; and in the final chapter, on Endgame, she reveals (among other things) that an early draft set the action in Picardy following a mysterious disaster said to have occurred between 1914 and 1918. This is an interesting contrast to Beckett's determina- tion that the completed play should be free of limiting spatio-temporal reference. Beckett's refusal to conform to the conventions of dramatic realism is an aspect of his art Cohn explores in Part One. Here she coins the term "theatreality" in reference to his creation of settings more closely related to the artifices of the theater than to the outside world; she discusses the term in detail in chapters on Beckett's use of soliloquy, fiction, and repetition. Cohn's treatment of Beckettian repetition is particularly good in that she has been granted access to some of the production notebooks he compiled in directing his own plays. Thus we discover with interest that in his Berlin production of Happy Days, Beckett set aside a list of "repetition texts" for special attention. In Part Three, Cohn discusses the production notebooks more fully, devoting a chapter to Beckett's work as a director. Here a good deal of information emerges about his modus operandi to supplement what has appeared in the recent Bair biography. Of particular interest is Beckett's concern to establish a relationship between theater and music: Cohn reveals, for example, that in his 1975 production of Krapp's Last Tape, Beckett found it useful to have Krapp-Pierre Chabert treat the "dialogue" as though it were a sonata. Other interesting details are to be found in the chapter dealing with the directors and actors Beckett has worked with, and in the chapter which discusses the translation of some of his plays from one genre (radio, stage, and so forth) to another.

Using as their point of departure two unpublished works, Beckett's first novel, Dream of Fair to Middling Women, and his first play, Eleutheria, Knowlson and Pilling deal with Beckett's post-trilogy prose and his drama after Endgame-from Krapp's Last Tape to Breath. In addition, they take up the seldom-discussed "ends and odds" that Beckett has released in recent years, 450</page><page sequence="11">and they have separate chapters on his poetics, his debt to Heinrich von Kleist's 1810 essay "On the Marionette Theatre," and his affinities with John Millington Synge. Levy, Eric P. BECKETT AND THE VOICE OF SPECIES: A STUDY OF THE PROSE FICTION. Barnes and Noble, 1980. 146 pp. $22.50. Levy's title indicates his special theme, the attempt to show how Beckett gradually evolved a narrative structure from what he called "the experience of Nothing" through a universal voice, "the voice of species," that makes the foundations of individual identity available once again. Levy takes issue with the prevailing notion that Beckett's writings are largely about their own composition, arguing instead that Beckett comes full circle as he demands of his readers a confrontation with "the perplexing centre of our own humanity."

JOHN BERRYMAN A Haffenden, John. JOHN BERRYMAN: A CRITICAL COMMENTARY. New York University Press, 1980. 216 pp. $22.50. If "critical commentary" suggests top-of-the-head interpretation, the subtitle of this book is misleading. Haffenden is primarily concerned with facts, his approach is scholarly, and he makes more use of exegesis than explication. After tracing the composition of Homage to Mistress Bradstreet, The Dream Songs, and other works, he provides extensive notes to selected lines from the poems. There is an appendix on the chronology of The Dream Songs and another on "Scholars at the Orchid Pavilion," which was to serve as the Paradiso of a tripartite group consisting also of Homage as the Purgatio and the unfinished Black Book sequence (about the Nazi persecution of the Jews) as the Inferno in Berryman's own Divine Comedy with its "hunch of Heaven." Students of Berryman's poetry will find Haffenden's work an essential handbook. C Martin, James Lawrence. Heart and Guilt Together: Three Scenes on the Life of John Berryman with Notes Following.

University of Alabama Press, 1979. 246 pp. $15.75. Because the biographical essay which opens this book is based mainly on interviews and extensive correspondence between Aggeler and Burgess, we have the feeling that the novelist is somehow looking over the shoulder of the critic while the latter dissects his works in the later chapters. Be that as it may, Aggeler takes up the novels in roughly chronological order, traces the principal themes, and goes a long way towards convincing us that Burgess is a writer who deserves and repays close scrutiny.

Cannan is one of those writers of more interest today for his personal relationships and literary associations than for his own works. In only fourteen years of working life he managed to turn out twenty eight books, fourteen plays, and many poems, essays, short stories, and columns of dramatic criticism in addition to a translation of Romain Rolland's exhaustive Jean-Christophe. But it is his personal life that makes this biography of both dramatic and historic interest. Cited as co-respondent in Barrie's divorce case, he went on to marry Barrie's ex-actress wife Mary, who was almost twice his age, and managed to maintain close ties with both the Bloomsbury and Lawrence circles (the painter Mark Gertler served as model for Cannan's portrait-of-the-artist novel Mendel and Lawrence stands behind the character of Logan in that work) until he left Mary for a younger woman and his increasingly erratic behavior estranged him from most of his friends. He lapsed into insanity and spent the last thirty years of his life in an asylum for the mentally ill. He deserves to be remembered not only as another burnt-out case, but as one who played an important role in the cultural life of his time. Diana Farr, whose mother was one of Cannan's nieces, has produced an admirable book. E Buhr, Richard J. "Gilbert Cannan: An Annotated Bibliography of Writing About Him."

Fisher, Barbara. JOYCE CARY: THE WRITER AND HIS THEME. Barnes and Noble, 1980. 414 pp. $24.50. In an effort to revive the declining reputation of Joyce Cary, Fisher has produced a study of that writer which is more extensive and more belabored than anything previously available. She argues that his sixteen novels are unified by a single theme-"freedom in the widest sense, and particularly in its moral and religious implications." The novels are summarized at greater length than would appear to be necessary for readers interested enough in Cary to confront this bulky study, and there is little in Fisher's treatments of the fiction to support the contention that he is now neglected because he was ahead of his time. The Cary who emerges from this study appears to be a rather old-fashioned humanist. More attention to his experimental techniques and his concerns as a literary artist would have given this book a better balance. Soderskog, Ingvar.

Male readers may feel that the biographer places more emphasis on Colette as "average woman" than both her life and her literary success can possibly justify, for the story that emerges is one of most unusual involvement not only in personal relationships but in the cultural scene of Paris from "la belle epoque" through two world wars. After all, if it were not for that male chauvinist pig, Willy, her first husband, who locked her in a room to write the books he took credit for, we would not have an opportunity to read this engaging biography of an "average woman."

Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980. 244 pp. $16.50. It is to Bonney's credit that he makes a deliberate attempt in this study to deal with aspects of Conrad that have been generally neglected. He begins by showing how certain works, "Typhoon" in particular, reflect Conrad's ontology as shaped by some of Schopenhauer's ideas and certain Oriental concepts. The central portion of this solid work is devoted to ways in which Conrad modified the romance genre he inherited at the end of the nineteenth century. Standing on the side of those critics who recognize a strong strain of irony and cynicism in Conrad, Bonney shows how such works as the seldom-discussed The Rescue reject the redemptive affirmation of "teleological romance." The final section of the book is concerned with technical aspects of Conrad's writing, most notably the ways in which he achieved "discontinuity" in both his narrative perspectives and his semiotics. Strongly influenced by contemporary critical theory, 469</page><page sequence="30">JOSEPH CONRAD Bonney's book is rather heavy reading, but it has the real merit of attempting new approaches to a writer who all too often has been over-simplified. Bruss, Paul. CONRAD'S EARLY SEA FICTION: THE NOVELIST AS NAVIGATOR. Bucknell Univer- sity Press, 1979. 186 pp. $13.50. It is not surprising that someone would eventually write a critical study of Conrad the writer in terms of what Conrad had learned as a sailor, but it may be surprising to discover that the approach actually works. After finding in some of Conrad's essays on his sea experiences certain principles that serve as background behind his early sea fiction, Bruss traces what he calls Conrad's "navigational metaphor" from its first appearance in The Nigger of the "Narcissus." The Marlow stories, for example, show a progression from the confused apprentice of Youth to the mature Marlow who comes to recognize the "navigational" nature of human relations as he confronts the enigma of Lord Jim. Bruss finds significant differences between the stories that take place on sailing vessels and those set on steamers. "Typhoon," "Falk: A Reminiscence," and "The End of the Tether" are shown to be ironic reworkings of The Nigger of the "Narcissus," Heart of Darkness, and Lord Jim as Conrad grew to be increasingly sceptical about the teleologi- cal assumptions behind his navigational metaphor.

Escher's well-known Drawing Hands is used as an illustration on the jacket cover of this book points to Hawthorn's concern with the reflexive nature of Conrad's writing. Showing the ambivalent nature of Conrad's attitude towards language, as well as the broader question of the relationship of fiction to truth, Hawthorn considers in detail five of the major works-Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim, Nostromo, The Secret Agent, and Under Western Eyes.

As if the same thing had not been done many times before, Schwarz simply takes up the early fiction in chronological order, discussing each of the works independently, noting the relation between theme and narrative point of view, and finding that Conrad was very much a humanist in search of moral order in an amoral world.

University of Alabama Press, 1977. 128 pp. $6.50 cloth, $2.95 paperbound. Reviewed by PHILIP R. YANNELLA Since the middle of the 1960s a great deal of scholarly and critical attention has been paid to the poetry of Hart Crane. A masterful biography, John Unterecker's Voyager: A Life of Hart Crane, book-length critical studies by Herbert A. Leibowitz, R. W. B. Lewis, Sherman Paul, and M. D. Uroff, among others, some important bibliographical work, and several significant critical es- says have demonstrated both the continuing need for elucidation of Crane's poetry and the fascination of his life, death, heroic attempts, pitiful failures, swollen rhetoric, and brilliant accomplishments. The result is that we now possess a well-developed body of work on one of our more enigmatic poets, and it is work that is often useful, impressively acute, serious. These things need to be said in order to understand the context in which the recent books by Robert Combs, Marc Simon, and Richard P. Sugg occur. They are very different kinds of studies, to be sure. One of them, Simon's Samuel Greenberg, Hart Crane and the Lost Manuscripts, is a sort of extended footnote to previous scholarship that presents new material on the young New York poet from whom Crane drew directly in several poems and in occasional phrases. Richard 473</page><page sequence="34">HART CRANE P. Sugg's book, on the other hand, is a "description" of The Bridge as a poem "about the life of the imagination trying to realize its 'dream of act' by giving form, and thereby meaning, to itself." It is altogether conventional in conception and execution and seems to have been written with little regard for previous work on Crane. Finally, Robert Combs's Vision of the Voyage takes up one of the stock perceptions of Crane-that, for better or for worse, there are elements of Romanticism in his poetry-and argues that Crane is wholly, and simply, a Roman- tic poet. Of the three studies, Combs's Vision is by far the most provocative. The book is accomplished through three chapters, the first of which argues that the psychology of Romanticism is most fruitfully understood through Hegel's philosophy, the second of which applies Hegel and Romantic psychology to Crane's White Buildings, and the third of which does the same for (or to) The Bridge. Running through Vision is the sense that Crane ought to be liberated from his own statements about his poetry, that critics ought not view his work by regarding his stated purposes so intently. Once having thrust aside the simple-mindedness of intentionalism, then, Combs is free to pursue his Romantic Crane, to provide his own impressions of the poetry by laying the language of Hegel's constructions atop it. The result, of course, is that Crane begins to sound like the quintessential Romantic. It is a very neat method indeed. There are crucial methodological issues involved. The periodization of literary history is always difficult, and there have always been tendencies to make Romanticism extend into the twentieth century. But Combs never even states the intricacies and subtleties of this issue. He presupposes that Crane is a Romantic, he recognizes no modern (or non-Romantic) influence on Crane, he recognizes, in fact, nothing but the force of Romanticism, of Romanticism interpreted through Hegel. There is, in short, one idea in Vision of the Voyage; literary historiography is reduced and complex issues of method are disregarded. The result is an ahistorical interpreta- tion of Crane. Hegel's language, or Hegel's language grafted to Combs's, is applied to Crane's poetry, and this sometimes yields a seemingly fresh reading. But, testing Combs's readings against those of previous critics, one usually discovers that the differences are merely rhetorical. Substantively, Combs does not add much to our understanding of Crane, unless, of course, one considers his ahistorical picture of Crane, his contention that Crane is a full Romantic, an addition. In Combs's readings of Crane's poetry we are called upon to distinguish rhetoric from sub- stance, with a result that is disastrous for a book that constantly asserts its originality. Richard P. Sugg's study of The Bridge does not lead to difficult considerations. It is, rather, a simple step-by-step description of the long poem that. will neither startle readers by a theoretical contention nor awake readers by a fresh sense of Crane's language and meaning. The book could be thought of as a Bridge primer. An innocent undergraduate student of poetry could learn from it how a long poem is conventionally read. But he or she could just as well turn to many of the other books on Crane for that lesson. In any case, however, Sugg's book does not contain much of interest to the Crane scholar. Marc Simon's monograph on Greenberg and Crane does add something to Crane scholarship. From time to time a number of critics have written of the influence of the mysterious, doomed poet (he died of tuberculosis in 1971) on Crane. Simon synthesizes this previous commentary and, more importantly, adds a considerable amount of new material on Greenberg's life, on the strange voyages of the so-called Greenberg Manuscript, which at one point fell into Crane's hands for copying, and on the actual uses to which Crane put Greenberg's poems. That the Greenberg Manuscript was, as Simon says, "source, suggestion, stimulant" for some of Crane's work is amply demonstrated. Scholarship and criticism of Hart Crane is strong and has been for a number of years. As Combs's book suggests, it is at this point difficult to say original things about the poet without becoming tendentious. Simon's book does not contain the stuff from which a new reading of Crane is going to emerge. However, it is good, solid scholarship. Simon is a bright reader of poetry, it is very clear that he labored carefully over his study, he has done some first-rate 474</page><page sequence="35">research, and he has drawn things together in a clear, direct form. For all of this, Crane scholars will have to be grateful. C Britton, Donald Eugene. Wrapt Inflections: Hart Crane's Poetics of Praise. American, 1979, Edward L. Kessler. DA XL-849.

In an effort to show that though Emily Dickinson may have been something of a recluse in her personal life she belongs to the mainstream of American literary tradition, Keller traces the affinities between her work and that of her Puritan New England heritage; such dominant contemporaries as Stowe, Emerson., Hawthorne, and Whitman; her circle of literary friends around Amherst; and to later generations of writers. There is a whole chapter dealing with the impact of Dickinson on Robert Frost, and Keller argues that it was she, more than any other American poet, who "taught the twentieth century how to write." 478</page><page sequence="39">Patterson, Rebecca.

The late Rebecca Patterson (she died in 1975) was a devoted Dickinson scholar for more than thirty years, and this book offers her final studies in the "unifying clusters of images, metaphors, and symbols" which provide entries to "that total poem which was her life's work." Continuing to argue her controversial theses that the lover referred to in the poetry was a woman and that many of the poems are erotic in intent, Patterson first deals with imagery derived from a second "tomboy" self within the poet's psyche before taking up other kinds of sexual imagery and her use of jewels, colors, astronomy, geography, and the four cardinal points of the compass.

University of Texas Press, 1979. 220 pp. $14.95. Reviewed by RICHARD S. KENNEDY When I finished Linda Wagner's critical study last summer, I thought it the most intelligent book I had ever read on John Dos Passos, and I was overjoyed that a book of this scope and caliber had finally emerged. Melvin Landsberg's book, Dos Passos' Path to U.S.A., was the first to show the results of interviewing and essential research, such as a look at the Dos Passos papers at the University of Virginia, but his book only extended to midcareer. Some studies, notably those by Blanche Gelfant and George Wickes, have provided valuable insight into individual works, but most of the serious critical writing stuck drearily to commentary on Dos Passos' social or political views, usually lamenting his swing from early communist sympathies over to being a supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy and a contributor to the National Review. Even Malcolm Cowley, who is usually astute and perceptive about his contemporaries, seems unsuccessful in catching the character of the man and the peculiar quality of his achievement when, in The 481</page><page sequence="42">JOHN DOS PASSOS Second Flowering, he gave Dos Passos the title "The Learned Poggius" and suggested that he was a scholar and an intellectual among the American writers of the twenties and thirties. Although Dr. Wagner's book is quite short-i 76 pages of text; the rest contains notes and bibliography-she nevertheless covers the complete range of his work beginning with the Harvard Monthly poems and stories and going on through all his novels, travel books, and historical studies as far as the unfinished Century's Ebb. In her approach, she tries to discern "his aims as a writer and historian" and to consider how those aims "shaped his life as a writer." In so doing, she never loses sight of the fact that he was a conscious artist and that "method" dominates his writing and determines ultimately what it became. She has scrutinized all of his scattered essays, introductions, and statements made to interviewers in her search for significant clues to what he was attempting at each stage of his career, and she has related it all to an assessment of his creative work. She finds a rather consistent set of values reflected in Dos Passos' writing throughout his life: the need for individual expression, the concern to have a social system that will guard that individualism, and the necessity to remain curious and doggedly optimistic in spite of the inevitable disillusionments of the American experience. In her critical assessment she finds that his development as a novelist reaches its height in U.S.A. because of his merging a number of his talents (as poet, biographer, historian, reporter, novelist) into a single artistic complex. The shortcomings of the works of midcareer show up because of his change to a "simplification of plot and texture," and the strengths of Midcentury (and even the unfinished Century's Ebb) result from his return to a "montage of techniques." Wagner's book, though short, is not an introduction; rather it is addressed to a reader familiar with the bulk of Dos Passos' work. As soon as I began to read Townsend Ludington's John Dos Passos: A Twentieth Century Odyssey I knew that the promise which lay in his expert handling of Dos Passos' diaries and letters in The Fourteenth Chronicle (1973) had been fulfilled. I used to tell my graduate students that the only sound biography of Dos Passos would be found in the several introductory sections that Ludington supplied for this fine book and that the most authentic glimpse of Dos Passos' cultural development and of his fundamental decency as a human being could be had if one browsed through its selection of letters. The Fourteenth Chronicle can still serve an introductory purpose, but Dr. Ludington has now written the definitive biography for our time-the product of years of careful research and extensive travel and interviewing. A number of scholars have had access to the Dos Passos papers at the University of Virginia, but no one has exercised the patience and perceptiveness in using them that Ludington shows in his book. For any biographer, the most difficult part of his work is digging out the information about the childhood and youth of his subject. As a result of his efforts, Ludington has been able to devote one-fourth of his book to the early years (up to 1917, the year Dos Passos volunteered for the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Service in France), and it provides an essential foundation for what follows. He has given us the fullest account yet of the complexities of John R. Dos Passos, Senior's liaison with the boy's mother, of young John's distressful early years as the unacknowl- edged illegitimate son, of his travels, his yearnings, of his uncertain relationship with his father, and of the gradual awakening of his creative and intellectual interests. The details about his reading and his exposure to modern art during the Harvard years are especially valuable. Given the amount of detail and anecdote (and one wishes Ludington could have omitted some of the less important incidents), the book is very well proportioned in its handling. About one-half is devoted to the years 1917 to 1936 (from the war years to The Big Money), and the remaining one-fourth covers the final thirty-three years. What this means is that one can follow closely the growth of Dos Passos as a novelist and the formation of his social and political sensibilities and not be burdened too heavily with the chronicle of his declining years. Although this is a critical biography, the emphasis is preponderately upon the life rather than the work. The critical material that is most valuable is largely descriptive, the tracing of the origins and the development of individual works-for example, the examination of the notes for 482</page><page sequence="43">The Forty-Second Parallel which show the search for variety of character and incident that will be included. The general critical view that Ludington takes is to look at Dos Passos as a satirist, a valuable approach and one which I have seen adequately presented only once before-in William Orth's Ph.D. dissertation, "The Later Novels of John Dos Passos." Ludington's book is so rich in his offering of new information and in intelligent use of previously published material in The Fourteenth Chronicle that it is hard to convey its density in so brief a review. If I were asked, however, to single out any portion for special praise, I would have to choose the three chapters about Dos Passos' war experience. The first focuses on the tour of duty near Verdun, the second on the excursion to Italy and the troubles with the Red Cross authorities, and the third on the Sorbonne period and the discovery of the new art, music, and ballet in Paris. We have here the fullest background for the understanding and further study of several of Dos Passos' novels and for the formation of his basic social and political positions. Ludington's book is one that deserves to be placed on our shelves along with such literary biographies of modern American writers as Carlos Baker's on Hemingway, Mark Schorer's on Sinclair Lewis, and John Unterecker's on Hart Crane. I hope that the publication of books such as Wagner's and Ludington's, plus the forthcoming study by Virginia Spencer Carr, will restore Dos Passos to his proper place among the leading modern writers, and that when a book like Jackson Bryer's Fifteen Modern American Authors appears, he will not again be left out.

Purdue University Press, 1979. 272 pp. $11.95. Critics have tended to ignore the importance of Eliot's dissertation on Knowledge and Experi- ence in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley, and he himself spoke lightly of the thesis, once saying that it was accepted at Harvard because it was unreadable. Like the subject of his study, Eliot's dissertation has been called "a painfully obscure work," and it is no wonder that it has frightened off even those writers on Eliot concerned with the origin of his critical ideas. Lewis Freed has spent at least twenty years attempting to make sense out of both Bradley and his young interpreter. This admirable book shows that Freed's hardy persistence has paid off. He shows convincingly that Eliot's literary criticism is pervaded with the basic concepts of Bradley and that there is a consistent and intelligent body of philosophy behind Eliot's concept of poetry and the language of his critical prose. Often Freed juxtaposes passages from Bradley, the disserta- tion, and Eliot's criticism to show a clear and convincing progression of influence; and though some may feel that Freed overargues his case, the sheer weight of his evidence makes this work one that future students of Eliot will have to take into account. Hargrove, Nancy Duvall. LANDSCAPE AS SYMBOL IN THE POETRY OF T. S. ELIOT. University Press of Mississippi, 1978. 234 pp. $15. After discussing Eliot's concept of symbolism in general and making a strong case for the importance of place and setting among Eliot's major symbols, Hargrove proceeds chronologi- cally through his poetry, offering close analyses and interpretations based not only on internal elements, but also on information about the actual geographical locations described in the poems. That Eliot's landscapes started as real places before being elevated to a symbolic stature is demonstrated by the inclusion of some forty photographs captioned with appropriate quota- tions from Eliot's poetry. Lee, Brian. THEORY AND PERSONALITY: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF T. S. ELIOT'S CRITICISM. Humanities Press, 1980. 148 pp. $25. Perhaps the key to this study is to be found in Lee's statement that "the 'theory' of Impersonality as it appears in T. S. Eliot, Pound, Hulme and others I shall take to be still an issue, a living issue, 486</page><page sequence="47">and one which we have not settled with ourselves." For Eliot and many of his fellow Modernists the effort to achieve Impersonality meant the sacrifice of selfhood, and the attempt to achieve objectivity too often meant that the individual had to be subordinated to the overwhelming dominance of "tradition." Lee's compact and challenging study of these problems finds Eliot often wavering inconsistently from one position to another, and Lee concedes that the poet- critic never came to realize fully that "true personality and true impersonality are the same thing." Moody, A. D. THOMAS STEARNS ELIOT, POET. Cambridge University Press, 1979. 366 pp. $19.95. "The 'Thomas Stearns Eliot' of my title," says Moody, "is a collection of writings, and the 'Poet' is the author within his poems." This mature and carefully considered study traces the develop- ment of that "author within his poems" from the vigorous originality of the early poems through the crisis years reflected in The Waste Land and the increasingly confident poetic self in "The Hollow Men" and "Ash Wednesday" until finally, in the Four Quartets, this "elected self" becomes the protagonist in an ideal civilization. In addition to his critical exposition of the poetry and plays, Moody throws in a few bonus features-the inclusion of the syllabus for Eliot's course of six lectures on modern French literature given at Oxford in 1916, discussion of the unpublished drafts of some of the major poems, some textual emendations, and an appendix on "The Christian Philosopher and Politics Between the Wars." Newton, Robert Page. LEAVES OF QUEST: A FUNDAMENTAL EXPLORATION OF LOVE IN THE EARLY POETRY OF T. S. ELIOT. Vantage Press, 1979. 92 pp. $5.95. Although it would be easy enough to dismiss this little book as a Master's thesis (University of Puerto Rico, 1973) published by a vanity press, it turns out to be worthy of attention. Newton's intention is a modest one: he traces Eliot's treatment of love from the imitative poems of the schoolboy years through the "panoramic erotic states" of the middle stage to "an all-embracing compassion" that informs the later works. That is hardly a startling discovery, and we cannot call this book a major study, but it does admirably what it sets out to do, the critical apparatus is more than adequate, and though it may be "only a thesis," it happens to be a good one.

Esenin accompanied his wife on her triumphant and sometimes scandalous tours of the Continent and America, and this dual biography gives a vivid picture of the artistic and cultural milieu in which they were immersed during the early decades of this century.

Introduction by Carvel Collins. University Press of Mississippi, 1980. 126 pp. + illus. $10 cloth, $5 paperbound. The award-winning documentary film "William Faulkner: A Life on Paper" was produced by the Mississippi Authority on Educational Television and first broadcast by the Public Broadcast- ing Service in December 1979. This book records the performance in printed form. Both Bezzerides, who wrote the script, and Ann J. Abadie, who edited and adapted it, contribute prefatory material to a transcription of the script as narrated by Raymond Burr and a generous selection of still shots from the film.

WILLIAM FAULKNER: THE COFIELD COLLECTION. Introduction by Carvel Collins. Yoknapatawpha Press, 1980. 196 pp. + illus. $20. J. R. ("Colonel") Cofield, whose father and grandfather had been professional photographers before him, opened a photo studio in Oxford, Mississippi, in 1928, and in that year first met William Faulkner. From that time on Cofield collected photographs of Faulkner and his family, many of which he took himself, and placed them in large albums now on loan in the Ole Miss library. Now the "colonel's" son, Jack, a fourth-generation photographer himself, has made a selection from the collection. The remarkable book that results provides a vivid photo- biography of the writer, and Yoknapatawpha Press (Box 248, Oxford, Mississippi 38655) can only be praised for making it available. Faulkner, William. MAYDAY. Introduction by Carvel Collins. University of Notre Dame Press, 1980. 96 pp. $8.95. Faulkner wrote Mayday in January 1926 and presented it as a gift to Helen Baird, a young woman he wished to marry. Hand-lettered, illustrated, and bound by the author, it was even- tually acquired by William B. Wisdom, who presented it to the Tulane University Library along with the rest of his Faulkner collection. Published in a limited facsimile edition in 1977, Mayday is here made available in a trade edition with the text of Faulkner's fable in letterpress accom- panied by examples of his hand-lettered pages and many of the illustrations, including the only Faulkner watercolor known to exist. Carvel Collins provides a substantial introduction to the fable that follows-the story of a young medieval knight's quest for perfect love. When Sir Galwyn of Arthgyl finally sees the woman of his desire, he discovers that she is Death, providing an ironic twist to the labor of love which went into Faulkner's gift to a woman who had refused to marry him. . MISSISSIPPI POEMS. Introduction by Joseph Blotner. Afterword by Louis Daniel Brodsky. Yoknapatawpha Press, 1979. 54 pp. $40. Limited to 500 copies, this is a facsimile edition of a sheaf of twelve typewritten poems and a seven-page essay which in 1924 Faulkner sent to Myrtle Ramey, a childhood friend. Nine of the poems were eventually published in altered versions. Three appear here for the first time, along with the essay, "Verse Old and Nascent: A Pilgrimage," which begins with "At the age of sixteen, I discovered Swinburne. Or rather, Swinburne discovered me, springing from some tortured undergrowth of my adolescence, like a highwayman, making me his slave" and goes on to describe his youthful and exalted view of poetry. 490</page><page sequence="51">.

SELECTIONS FROM THE WILLIAM FAULKNER COLLECTION OF LOUIS DANIEL BRODSKY: A DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. University Press of Virginia, 1980. 172 pp. $17.50. Much more than a list of some six hundred of the more important items collected by Brodsky, a poet and a businessman, over the past twenty years, this volume describes or transcribes important material not in print elsewhere, including some early poems, four variant Faulkner wills, numerous letters by Phil Stone, and cartoon drawings made by Faulkner as a high-school junior. There are forty illustrations of significant items from the collection. Kerr, Elizabeth M. WILLIAM FAULKNER'S GOTHIC DOMAIN. Kennikat Press, 1979. 264 pp. $15. In Yoknapatawpha: Faulkner's "Little Postage Stamp of Native Soil" (1969), Elizabeth Kerr wrote a memorable book intended to distinguish between the domain of Yoknapatawpha (William Faulkner, "Sole Owner and Proprietor") and its prototype of Lafayette County. Here she ranges farther afield to reveal still another domain in Faulkner's fictive world-his use of a Gothic tradition inherited from European and American predecessors. Between chapters entitled "From Otranto to Yoknapatawpha: Faulkner's Gothic Heritage" and "From Yoknatawpha to the World: Faulkner's Gothic Bequest" are detailed analyses of seven individual novels and the Snopes trilogy. The result is a solid examination of an important aspect of Faulkner's work. Miss Kerr's treatment is so thorough that it covers the subject once and for all. Minter, David. WILLIAM FAULKNER: HIS LIFE AND WORK. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980. 326 pp. $16.95. Because Faulkner himself once said that a book is in some sense a "writer's secret life, the dark twin of a man," Minter's approach in this work is especially valid. Instead of separating biog- raphy from criticism as other writers of "life and works" have done, Minter does succeed in maintaining a tight bond between the man and his creative other self as he writes about the "deep reciprocities, of relations and revisions, between Faulkner's flawed life and his great art."

Cornell University Press, 1979. 212 pp. $12.50. For all his greatness, Faulkner was a working writer. Most of his critics have taken a fait- accompli approach to his writings. What distinguishes Stonum's book is the way in which it concentrates on Faulkner's development as a writer as the product of a consciously chosen career. "My guiding question, in effect," Stonum writes, "is how does Faulkner know what to write next? What conditions the possibilities that are open to him at any given moment?" The approach works very well indeed and opens the way for similar studies of other writers whose struggles have been overshadowed by their success. Wittenberg, Judith Bryant. FAULKNER: THE TRANSFIGURATION OF BIOGRAPHY. University of Nebraska Press, 1980. 264 pp. $17.50. Using an approach very similar to that of David Minter, Wittenberg looks at the fiction in the context of Faulkner's life. She leans more towards psychological interpretation than Minter does, and she tends to concentrate on such recurring themes as father-son tension and the failure of love, such character types as the absent mother and the doomed young man, and such techniques as the use of paired or tripled characters to express Faulkner's own divided psyche. In spite of the emphasis on recurrence, Wittenberg's chronological survey of Faulkner's career does show that his transformation of autobiography was dynamic, enabling him in his later years to treat with a gentle touch and a hint of comedy what had been the tragic themes of his youth.

This is a book like many others on Forster. Cavaliero simply summarizes Forster's life, writes about his background, and describes his biographies and criticism before taking up the fiction in chronological order. He interprets the novels and stories as "the imaginative ordering of certain conflicting personal insights and experiences; and as the stabilizing of tensions and contradic- tions into a balanced and comprehensive mode of perception." Such factors, says Cavaliero, help to make Forster "our one indisputably homosexual novelist of classic status." Das, G. K., and John Beer, eds. E. M. FORSTER: A HUMAN EXPLORATION/CENTENARY ESSAYS. New York University Press, 1979. 314 pp. $24.50. A number of well-known Forster critics are among the contributors to this book commemorating his birth on January 1, 1879. Oliver Stallybrass, Judith Scherer Herz, George H. Thomson, S. P. Rosenbaum, R. N. Parkinson, Wilfred Stone, Mohammad Shaheen, John Drew, J. Birje-Patil, V. A. Shahane, John Colmer, Benita Parry, Michael Orange, P. N. Furbank, Evelyn Hanquart, May Buckingham, C. E. Baron, and Frederick P. W. McDowell provide studies of various aspects of Forster and his works. Included also are two essays on Forster and D. H. Lawrence by Alan Wilde and John Beer, and comparisons of Forster's work with that by T. S. Eliot (G. K. Das), Anton Chekhov (James McConkey), and Virginia Woolf (H. K. Trevedi). Forster, E. M. COMMONPLACE BOOK. Introduction by P. N. Furbank. London: Scolar Press, 1979. 320 pp. C?150. Limited to 350 numbered copies, this is a facsimile edition of a commonplace book given to Forster's grandfather by its original owner, Bishop Jebb. Forster acquired the book in 1925 and until 1968 amused himself by filling it with extracts from Voltaire, Ibsen, and other infidels as well as his own moral reflections, tag-ends of literary criticism, catty remarks about other writers, and random observations on a variety of topics. 498</page><page sequence="59">.

Kemp. John C. ROBERT FROST AND NEW ENGLAND: THE POET AS REGIONALIST. Princeton University Press, 1979. 274 pp. $13.50. Frankly revisionist, this study breaks through conventional views of Frost as a New England poet to show that much of his stance as a "Yankee farmer poet" derived from his need to establish a poetic persona that was quite different from his real being. According to Kemp, Frost worked hard at preserving the popular image of himself, but much of the power of his verse derives from the irony that often undercuts the pose. Frost's best poetry, according to Kemp, is found in those New England poems that transcend local-color writing. Tharpe, Jac, ed. FROST: CENTENNIAL ESSAYS Ill.

THE ARCHETYPES OF CARLOS FUENTES: FROM WITCH TO ANDROGYNE. Shoe String Press, 1980. 240 pp. $19.50. In two letters printed as an appendix to this volume, Fuentes admits to Gloria Duran that since childhood he has been haunted by an image of the Mexican Empress Carlotta as prototype for the eternal feminine. Drawing heavily on Jung's archetypal scheme, Duran traces varied man- ifestations of the witch-goddess figure as she appears in most of Fuentes' writings. The resulting study helps us realize that Fuentes' work is solidly grounded in universal, mythic themes that transcend the social and political concerns that have tended to dominate studies of his writings.

Documentary Studies in Modern Russian Poetry. University of California Press, 1980. 198 pp. $14.50. Indeed a "difficult soul," Zinaida Gippius rejected traditional male/female roles as early as the 1890s and went on to play a significant role in the Symbolist movement which dominated Russian poetry during the early years of this century. Zlobin, himself a poet, served as her secretary after she emigrated to France following the revolution, and his book is an engaging account of the part she played in the circle of Russian emigres who found refuge in Paris. Married to the novelist and critic Dmitry Merezhkovsky, she was in love with an unattainable other man and believed herself to be in personal contact with the Devil. But Zlobin recognizes behind the eccentricity the talents of a genuine poet. JEAN GIRAUDOUX A Reilly, John H. JEAN GIRAUDOUX. Twayne's World Authors Series, No. 513. Twayne, 1978. 168 pp. $9.95.

Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 220 pp. No price listed. Taking up where Without Shelter: The Early Career of Ellen Glasgow (1971) left off, Raper traces a development from the surface realism of the early stories to the solid complexities of the novels she created in mid-career. He finds crucial to this progression her discovery of the technique of phantasies ("images that 'show forth' the otherwise hidden motions of the soul"). Although conceding a decline in Glasgow's creative force from 1932 until 1945, Raper feels that even then she remained ahead of her time in her depiction of strong and independent female characters.

It was Gogarty's doom to find a place in modern literary history as the original behind Buck Mulligan in Joyce's Ulysses rather than as the good writer he was. Carens does much to redeem Gogarty in this first full-length study, showing that his reputation as a wit, satirist, and gregarious man-about-town has obscured his talents as a sensitive writer with a genuine lyric gift and, at least occasionally, a strong social conscience. Carens considers closely Gogarty's relationship with both Joyce and Yeats. He argues that Buck Mulligan is a caricature of Gogarty that had its origin in Joyce's personal animosity. His close friendship with Yeats, on the other hand, helped him develop as a poet as he moved beyond the ribaldry of the early limericks to the sharp wit of a modern classicist.

There is a preliminary chapter on some principal influences, including subjects as diverse as Egyptology and juvenile books of the Victorian era, and throughout the analyses of the novels Johnston finds such recurrent themes as anti-rationalism and duality.

Marion Boyars, Inc., 1980. 186 pp. $16. The title of this book is somewhat misleading. Unlike most of the other authors of critical introductions to Grass, Hollington places more emphasis on the artistic aspects of the writings than on their political implications. True, there are short chapters on "The Politician" and "The Contemporary Political Novels," but the main focus of the chapters on the Danzig Trilogy that made Grass's reputation falls on his literary sources, his use of the classic grotesque, and his Modernist irony. For Hollington, "the essential theoretical issues raised by Grass's work concern the problems encountered by the reader as he attempts to negotiate deceptive ironic strategies in the tradition of Sterne and Jean Paul." Thus Grass is more likely to be remembered as "an essentially comic writer within the humanist tradition" than as a political activist. C Paidosh, Mary Catherine.

More critically astute than previous books on the locale of Hardy's fiction, this is a study of how Hardy translated his Dorset world into the Wessex of his novels. Enstice shows how Hardy's landscapes reflect the gradual change from the somewhat idyllic rural scenes of his early work to the somber, darkened worlds of Tess and Jude. Ten maps are included. Gittings, Robert, and Jo Manton. THE SECOND MRS. HARDY. University of Washington Press, 1979. 150 pp. $10.95. Using as a starting-point Somerset Maugham's disguised but clearly hostile depiction of Hardy's second marriage in Cakes and Ale, Gittings and his wife, Jo Manton, offer a sympathetic account of Florence Emily Dugdale to show that she was something more than a mere "helpmate of genius." Making use for the first time of hundreds of her private letters, the biographers tell a rather touching story about the difficulties an intelligent young woman encountered as she tried to make her way into the world of letters. The Second Mrs. Hardy is a welcome postscript to Gittings' two-volume biography of Hardy and a distinguished companion to Denys Kay- Robinson's The First Mrs. Thomas Hardy, described below. Grundy, Joan. HARDY AND THE SISTER ARTS. Barnes and Noble, 1979. 204 pp. $22.50. Hardy wrote about "the solidarity of all the arts" and maintained a deep personal interest in the theater, music, dance, and the visual arts. The author of this book shows how Hardy made use of other arts in his fiction and poetry, not only as subject-matter, but also as models of techniques that enabled Hardy, far ahead of his time, to achieve "cinematic" effects that brought him close to "the composite Muse" which inspired the Modernist movement. Grundy's book is a knowl- edgeable contribution to the study of literature and the other arts. Hardy, Thomas. THE COLLECTED LETTERS OF THOMAS HARDY-VOLUME TWO, 1893-1901.

THE FIRST MRS. THOMAS HARDY. St. Martin's Press, 1979. 278 pp. $16.50. It has long been recognized that Hardy's first marriage began almost like a collaboration, with a significant effect on his early writings, but slowly deteriorated as the two grew further and further apart in their literary standards and personal beliefs. Kay-Robinson makes use of many primary and secondary sources never before uncovered as he looks more closely into the character of Emma Lavinia Gifford than any previous Hardy biographers have done. He sees her as a likely model for Sue Bridehead in Jude the Obscure, and though he fails to champion her against a repressed and misunderstanding husband, he provides a more balanced view of the lady than we have had before. Of related interest is the reissue by Oxford University Press of her Some Recollections (1980, 96 pp., $12.95) with a new Introduction by Robert Gittings. Kramer, Dale, ed. CRITICAL APPROACHES TO THE FICTION OF THOMAS HARDY. Barnes and Noble, 1980. 218 pp. $28.50.

Casagrande, Simon Gatrell, Mary Jacobus, W. J. Keith, James R. Kincaid, David Lodge, Michael Ryan, Daniel R. Schwarz, Elaine Showalter, and Leon Waldoff. Page, Norman, ed. THOMAS HARDY: THE WRITER AND HIS BACKGROUND. St. Martin's Press, 1980. 276 pp. $27.50. Whereas the essays gathered in Kramer's collection are mostly critical analyses and interpreta- tions of individual works and topics, the new studies brought together in this volume deal with broad aspects of Hardy's social and intellectual background as well as the heritage he passed on to other writers and thinkers. Thus, for example, Merryn and Raymond Williams write about "Hardy and Social Class," Philip Collins about "Hardy and Education," and George Wing about "Hardy and Regionalism." Some influences on his work are traced by Lennart A. Bjork in a paper on "Hardy's Reading" and Roger Robinson in a study of Hardy and Darwin. Samuel Hynes considers "The Hardy Tradition in Modern English Poetry," while James Gibson in an essay called "Hardy and His Readers" writes about the extent to which he was affected by the Grundyism of his time. Editor Page provides an essay of his own on "Hardy and the English 515</page><page sequence="76">THOMAS HARDY Language," and Richard H. Taylor provides both a bibliographical essay and a selected checklist. Richardson, James. THOMAS HARDY: THE POETRY OF NECESSITY. University of Chicago Press, 1977. 144 pp. $12. Reviewed by VINCENT L. TOLLERS, State University of New York at Brockport Previous reviewers rightfully have attacked Richardson's poor style, endless quotes of poetry and criticism, willy-nilly organization, and faulty bibliographical apparatus. But those I have read fail to mention his sensitive treatment of the poet's craftsmanship and his comparative study of Hardy, Browning, and the Romantics. Other monographs about Hardy the poet-by Hanes, Davies, Brooks, and Paulin-do not, for the most part, approach him as does Richardson, a fellow poet. This is most evident in what I think is the best chapter in the book, "Style and Self-Division," in which we are shown the bond between the inner Hardy and his themes, structures, and language. Nor have others enlightened us as much about Hardy's view of death and the past, considered in the final chapter, "Old Furniture: Hardy's World." While we may complain that we are bludgeoned all-too-frequently in some chapters with the book's thesis- Hardy was ambivalent about the unfulfilled possibilities of life and art-Richardson ably shows how it applies in different ways to a number of poems. In other chapters, however, he strays from his central point. For instance, in "Other Lives: Hardy and Browning," Hardy is ignored for long patches of this 44-page subdivision as Richardson contrasts Browning and the Romantics. Although the commentary is impressive, it is out of place in a study of Hardy. In short, the monograph shows all the signs of being rushed into print by a poet-critic gifted with insight and armed with knowledge. Richardson shows the promise of stimulating and thoughtful scholarship. Assuming he will take the time to organize and polish his next book, it should be well worth reading. Smith, Anne, ed. THE NOVELS OF THOMAS HARDY. Barnes and Noble, 1979. 196 pp. $18. Nine new essays on Hardy's writings are gathered here. Five of them deal with individual novels: Under the Greenwood Tree (Barbara Hardy), The Return of the Native (Robert B. Heilman), The Mayor of Casterbridge (Juliet M. Grindle), Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Rosemary L. Eakins), and lude the Obscure (Patricia Gallivan). Andrew Enstice offers an overview of Hardy's fiction with emphasis on its relation to the Book of Job. Rosalind Miles studies the women characters. Philippa Tristram writes about the physical ambiance in the interiors of houses in Hardy's fiction. The final essay is a textual study by Simon Gatrell which demonstrates how Hardy's printers corrupted his own style of punctuation. C Beck, Barbara Youmans. Thomas Hardy and the Ballad.

This attractive picture-book offers many photographs of Parisian scenes mentioned by Heming- way and his associates. The pictures, most of them in black and white, are accompanied by extracts from writings by Hemingway himself and many of the people who have written memoirs about life in Paris during the 1920s. Nelson, Raymond S. HEMINGWAY: EXPRESSIONIST ARTIST. Iowa State University Press, 1979. 96 pp. + illus. $9.95 cloth, $5.95 paperbound. Nelson argues that Hemingway, far from being primarily the "realistic" writer he is generally considered to have been, was deeply influenced by the Expressionist movement in the arts. Hemingway's writings show much the same kind of extreme emotion, distortion, and violent contrasts that mark Expressionist art. There is a certain amount of special pleading in Nelson's attempts to pin down Hemingway as an Expressionist, but we find convincing some of the analogies he draws between Hemingway's way of writing and the techniques used by visual artists in general; for example, his short, assertive sentences are not unlike the vigorous brush- strokes of a painter. Thomas Hudson, the painter-hero of the somewhat neglected Islands in the Stream, is vividly depicted in this study as a surrogate not only for Hemingway himself, but as his ideal artist. Oldsey, Bernard. HEMINGWAY'S HIDDEN CRAFT: THE WRITING OF A FAREWELL TO ARMS. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1979. 124 pp. $8.95. This impressive study is based on material that only recently has come to light-transcripts of two handwritten chapters that constitute the earliest beginning of the novel known to exist, 41 variants of the ending, and other material. Oldsey has much to say about such subjects as the 33 titles Hemingway considered giving his novel, the differences between Hemingway's actual experiences in Italy and the events depicted in the novel, and the alternatives he rejected for both the beginning and the ending of the work.

London: Hamish Hamilton, 1979-published in U.S. by Atheneum. 244 pp. $11.95. After a prologue on the Oxford Movement, which undoubtedly served as a main influence on Hopkins' poetry and his choice of profession, Mrs. Kitchen offers what is essentially more a biography than a critical study. She places much emphasis on the clash between sensuality and purity that not only affected his choice of imagery as a poet, but compromised his performance as a preacher. His habit of introducing sexual imagery into his sermons shocked many of his listeners as well as the superiors in his order, and the Hopkins who emerges from this fresh study comes across as a somewhat naYve and confused man who, for his own sake as well as ours, was able to find some refuge in the writing of poetry that endures. Sprinker, Michael. "A COUNTERPOINT OF DISSONANCE": THE AESTHETICS AND POETRY OF GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980. 150 pp. $10.95. Disagreeing with traditional interpretations of Hopkins which emphasize his religious themes and see his verse as an imitation of the natural world, Sprinker applies new theories of textual criticism, including deconstruction, in an effort to show those reflexive qualities in Hopkins' poetry which produce a tension between the man writing and the writing itself. Included are extended considerations of "The Windhover" and "The Wreck of the Deutschland" as well as chapters on Hopkins' esthetics, his theory of language, and his concept of the relation between self and text. 523</page><page sequence="84">GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS C Motto, Mary Lou.

Reviewed by ESTHER SAFER FISHER, University of Toronto In his The Poetic Art of A. E. Housman, B. J. Leggett claims, "The formalist tendency to separate the poem from the poet has had the effect, in Housman's case, of simultaneously preserving the poetry and obscuring (or damning) the poet." Fortunately, Richard Perceval Graves avoids such formalist inclinations in his A. E. Housman, The Scholar-Poet. Primarily a biography which, as the title indicates, unites the poet and scholar, the book also integrates the poet with the poetry. 524</page><page sequence="85">The account of the genesis of "Illic lacet" and of Housman's continuing relationship with that poem is a good example of Graves's method. Several years ago, while examining some letters of Georgian poets held by Housman's friend Percy Withers, I noticed that, appropriate for the date, 2 December 1917, Housman had inscribed "Illic lacet" for Withers. I did not realize then that this poem, which Housman had sent to his sister in 1915 shortly after her son had been killed in the first World War, was written after his brother Herbert's death in the Boer War. In light of Housman's personal loss and pain on both these occasions the poem gains in intensity and complexity; it gives us both the sense of the waste of young lives and the necessity for such sacrifice. "Illic lacet" is testimony to Housman's compassion, and it displays the conflict appar- ent in so much of his poetry-the tension between the desire for life and the equally pressing need to fulfill one's sense of obligation. It was with great difficulty that Housman translated his frequently opposing thoughts and feelings about existence into that much maligned The Name and Nature of Poetry. There, he attempted to convey his attitudes about poetry by separating the life of reason from the life of emotion. It is these two lives that Graves tries to bring into equilibrium, but as in Housman's theory, the emotional life overshadows the intellectual. We learn that Housman was a consummate Classi- cal scholar and textual critic, but what takes precedence is the depth of his passion and his ideal of love. Graves gives us the aging poet telling a young woman that he did not know how a man could love more than one woman in his life, continuing, "anyone who had considered that he had done so had simply never loved at all." Like previous biographers, Graves locates the source of Housman's poetry in his unrequited love for Moses John Jackson, but this biographer also convinces us that the poet's commitment to Jackson was but one aspect of Housman's constancy to those he loved. Unbidden, he generously contributed to the financial support of members of his family, and he paid for Jackson's son's education. This sensitive account of the life presents a Housman imbued with a sense of responsibility while still a child. His mother died when he was twelve years old, his father was weak and incompetent and, as the eldest in the family, Alfred took seriously his role as protector. Seeking not credit but anonymity for his beneficence, throughout his life he did what he considered to be his duty, a duty allied with moral honesty. Even Housman's antipathy to women, which some- times erupted in invective, was submerged with his female students. One woman remembers, "We did not mind his making us cry, because we knew he was just." He was equally just in his dealings with others; although he declined to sign a letter requesting contributions for the aged poet William Watson because "the letter grossly overpraised Watson's work," he, nevertheless, sent a cheque to the fund. And, in 1933, after years of "loaning" money to Grant Richards, Housman finally refused, saying, "If I did what you asked, because it is painful to refuse, it would be cowardice, and I should be angry with myself afterwards and ashamed, and you would be obliged to think me weak." The strength of Graves's biography lies in his ability to present us with words and deeds which reveal Housman's courage and, above all, his integrity. Graves is less successful in his forays into causes for Housman's homosexuality. That Hous- man's mother died when he was a child, that he was brought up with Victorian attitudes to sex as dirty, and that he was circumcised when he was fourteen years old are not necessarily reasons for being an invert. Such conjectures would perhaps be better left to the psychoanalyst; fortunately Graves does not pursue them at great length. By far the greatest emphasis in The Scholar-Poet is on "rounding out" things we can know about Housman's character. His sehse of humor is apparent in some youthful poems, not printed in the Collective Poems, which Graves includes to complement his portrait of the poet as an imaginative, energetic witty young man. A juvenile parody such as Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet Opening her mouth very wide There came a great spider; she opened it wider And the spider ran down her inside. 525</page><page sequence="86">A. E. HOUSMAN looks forward to the later Wherever placed, it matters not In how unsuitable a spot, The parallelogram must stay, It is too weak to crawl away. Instead of the frequently held view of Housman as a dour, withdrawn scholar, the poet emerges as a reticent but compassionate and frequently fun-loving man. In his travels abroad we meet the bon vivant, enjoying a sexual liaison with a Venetian gondolier. On holiday on the Conti- nent Housman, the epicure, indulges his tastes for gastronomic delights and homosexual prosti- tutes and adds to his collection of pornographic literature. Such glimpses into the personal life help to explain the dichotomy between the serious, often unpleasant subject matter of many of the poems and their more matter-of-fact manner. What Graves terms "the austere classical scholar and the broken-hearted romantic poet" meet in the poetry, and the result is frequently irony, as in "To an Athlete Dying Young" or "Grenadier." Graves notes that the latter poem conveys Housman's sympathy for the common man; it is also a bitter comment on the human condition as Housman saw it--as a bad joke. Housman claimed that his poetry was not autobiographical; Graves shows us otherwise. Writing biography is inevitably fraught with problems of organization. The Scholar-Poet is divided into chapters entitled, for example, "An Academic Life, 1 892-1911," "Mainly Family, 1892-1929," "Traveling Abroad, 1897-1929," "Trinity College, Cambridge, 1911-1929." These divisions, treating separate aspects of the poet's life, tend to militate against the sense of wholeness Graves is trying to convey; they not only compartmentalize life, as Housman himself did, and I suppose as we all do to some extent, they also lead to repetition, and at times to tediousness. But these are minor considerations in a well-documented, carefully indexed and extremely readable biography. Within the bounds Graves has set for himself and acknowledging his view of the "limited emotional range" of Housman's verse, he achieves his aim: to give a balanced account of the life and to introduce new readers to the poetry.

After summarizing James's comments on Hawthorne and the critical response they have evoked in others, the author of this study describes and evaluates the extensive body of work done on the Hawthorne-James relationship, beginning with general considerations and proceeding to the influence of The Scarlet Letter, The Blithedale Romance, The Marble Faun, and Hawthorne's other works on writings by James. Bradbury, Nicola. HENRY JAMES: THE LATER NOVELS. Oxford University Press, 1980. 228 pp. $32. With close attention to his subtle and sophisticated techniques, Bradbury discusses James's fiction from The Portrait of a Lady to the unfinished novels, but concentrates her attention on the three major novels published at the turn of the century. Particularly impressive is her chapter on "The Unspeakable and the Unsayable," in which she writes tellingly about ways in which James may be said to have anticipated Beckett in discovering silence as a means of expression. The chapter on The Ambassadors deals with various perspectives grouped around "the still point." The Wings of the Dove is discussed in terms of what she calls "the expansive principle," and in James's most ambitious novel, The Golden Bowl, she finds the novelist struggling for a level of understanding beyond expression. 529</page><page sequence="90">HENRY JAMES Gervais, David.

University of Pittsburgh Press, 1979. 204 pp. $12.95. Whereas Babiiha's book on the Hawthorne-James relationship is organized in terms of Haw- thorne's writings, this one reverses that procedure by offering chapters on those works by James which most surely show the influence of his predecessor. Long is concerned with James's use of such Hawthornesque themes as garden-and-Fall, mesmerist-and-maiden, and doctor-and- daughter as he considers works of James's earlier period. Long concludes this comparative study with two chapters on The Blithedale Romance and The Bostonians. We can only hope that in a sequel to this work Long will take up the considerable impact of Hawthorne on the works of James's later period. Sharma, J. N. THE INTERNATIONAL FICTION OF HENRY JAMES.

If "alchemy" may be defined as a kind of art or science intended to turn base metals into gold, then the author of this study is perhaps justified in saying that "Finnegans Wake is Joyce's alchemical Philosopher's Stone." Conceding that Joyce did not do extensive research on the subject of alchemy but showing that he was acquainted with such basic works as A. E. Waite's Hermetic Museum, DiBernard demonstrates convincingly how "Joyce uses alchemy, especially in Finnegans Wake, as a metaphor for change and the artistic process; the alchemical transmuta- tion of lead into gold parallels the artistic transmutation of life into art." Beginning with a chapter on "The Excremental Vision: Spiritual and Physical Alchemy," she goes on to chapters on death and rebirth, number symbolism, colors and forgery, and ingredients and equipment before concluding with a discussion of Shem the "alshemist." Gose, Elliott B., Jr. THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS IN JOYCE'S ULYSSES. University of Toronto Press, 1980. 228 pp. $25. Gose is not directly concerned with alchemy, but the many kinds of transformation he finds in Ulysses have much in common with that ancient art. "In writing Ulysses," Gose begins, "James Joyce aimed to include as much of the human body and the human spirit as his art and his insight would allow. He was attracted to what I call the transformation process because of his belief in the malleability and resilience of man's physical and spiritual nature. That process offered him not only a technique for creating a fiction but also a vehicle for his belief that man needs to be linked with both his higher and his lower nature." The first half of this intelligent work is concerned with philosophical and psychological aspects of the transformation process with much attention to Joyce's use of Bruno and Freud. In the second half, Gose applies some of his theories more directly to Ulysses with special attention to "Circe" and the concluding episodes. We rate this study high among those interpretations of Ulysses which may be called affirmative readings, but we would still insist that there is a negative side to Joyce's view of life which must be considered as well. Gose places his emphasis on the progression from the physical to the spiritual and perhaps forgets that all cycles have a way of turning back upon themselves. Gottfried, Roy K. THE ART OF JOYCE'S SYNTAX IN ULYSSES. University of Georgia Press, 1980. 192 pp. $15. In this first book-length study of the syntax of Ulysses, Gottfried considers the novel's rich variety of sentence patterns and finds a single unifying strategy. Joyce's style enabled him to find a 536</page><page sequence="97">medium through which he could express his pervasive sense of an inevitable dualism between order and freedom. Groden, Michael.

London: George Allen and Unwin, 1980. 182 pp. $15.50-available from Allen &amp; Unwin, Inc., 9 Winchester Terrace, Winchester, Massachusetts 01890. Forsaking the chronological approach used in Harry Blamires' Bloomsday Book and other guides to Ulysses, Kenner moves from the easy to the difficult as he takes up a wide variety of topics. Advanced Joyceans as well as beginners will find much that is new in this commentary, proving once again that each time Ulysses is re-read it becomes richer and more complicated. When the re-reader is Hugh Kenner, we can expect many fresh discoveries, and in this welcome book we get them. MacCabe, Colin. JAMES JOYCE AND THE REVOLUTION OF THE WORD. Barnes and Noble, 1979. 186 pp. $22.50. In a study strongly indebted to Jacques Lacan, Walter Benjamin, and other theorists, MacCabe attempts to show that Joyce's peculiar strategies of language enabled him to bring to the surface levels of sexual and political meaning that could not be expressed through conventional or traditional methods of discourse.

F Ordinarily there is a lames Joyce International Symposium in odd-numbered years, but the eighth symposium has been postponed to lune 1982 in order to commemorate the centennial of Joyce's birth, and the gathering in Dublin is expected to be one of the most vigorous ever held. Yet those Joyceans who could not face the prospect of celebrating Bloomsday alone could have attended the Joyce symposium at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque on June 11-16, 1981. Henry Rcth was the guest of honor, and Robert M. Adams the keynote speaker. Also there was a symposium at the Inter-University Centre for Post-Graduate Studies in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, May 1 -29, 1981, organized by Bernard Benstock, Morton P. Levitt, and Ivo Vidan. It consisted of lectures, panels, and workshops, as well as a display of pictures highlighting Joyce's career. And the Joyce symposium organized by Zack Bowen and Nathan Halper which was held at Provincetown in June 1980 was another great success. The organizers of the New Mexico and Dubrovnik gatherings also hope to keep the tradition going in 1983 as well. FRANZ KAFKA A Stern, J. P., ed. THE WORLD OF FRANZ KAFKA.

The title of this book was first used by Levitt for the lead-essay in the Kazantzakis special number of JML in 1972. He has expanded that essay into a full-length book that must now be considered the definitive study of Kazantzakis in English. After explaining the metaphor of the Cretan Glance as that combination of outward stance and inward poise which enables man to face the uncertain future with dignity and hope, Levitt takes up the major writings in separate chapters before offering a conclusion which places Kazantzakis in the mainstream of Modernist writing.

Random House, 1979. 402 pp. $15. McNally, who holds a doctorate in history, spent over six years interviewing people who knew Jack Kerouac and his circle of friends. In this compelling biography of the "King of the Beats," we learn much not only about Kerouac, but also about the spirit of the times in which he lived-that turned on, dropped out generation of the 1960s that did much to establish the counterculture of the past two decades. William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen are among the more prominent writers who played roles in the life of Kerouac.

Eighty-five stories written by Irish-American Mary Lavin from 1939 to 1977 are the concern of this study. Instead of taking them up one by one, A. A. Kelly groups them in terms of such themes as the social hierarchy, the family and intimate relationships, religious conventions, and artistic intentions. A whole chapter devoted to textual revisions helps to show that Mary Lavin is very much a craftsman of fiction. 546</page><page sequence="107">Peterson, Richard F. MARY LAVIN.

University of Arizona Press, 1980. 428 pp. + illus. $25. For more than a decade, the author of this book and his wife, the photographer LaVerne Harrell Clark, have gone to most of the places which Lawrence visited during the years of restless traveling with Frieda. Quoting liberally from Lawrence's writings about these scenes, Clark shows that Lawrence's travels were motivated by something deeper than mere wanderlust or the quest for an ideal Raninim. His exploration of strange lands, says Clark, was "a search for identity, an all-absorbing endeavor to reconcile the conflicts of religion and sex and disease within, and the identity he sought was the fullness of a strong and vital manhood, the struggle for physical and psychological health all but identical with a search for artistic expression." This book may be praised not only for its solid content and perceptive insights, but also as a beautiful example of book-making. Attractively designed with marginal abbreviations to identify the many sources that are quoted, the book is printed on glossy paper in order to do justice to many fine photographs taken by Mrs. Clark. Delany, Paul. D. H. LAWRENCE'S NIGHTMARE: THE WRITER AND HIS CIRCLE IN THE YEARS OF THE GREAT WAR. Basic Books, 1978. 420 pp. $15.95. The title of this book is deceptive and misleading. The Great War remains far away in the background, and though it is true that Lawrence suffered some inconveniences and embarrass- ments during the years of the war, they hardly constituted a "nightmare." After all, the years from 1914 through 1918 were pivotal for Lawrence and Frieda. It was during this period that they widened their circle of influential literary acquaintances and Lawrence found his own voice as a literary artist, composing during this period the novel that is now considered his masterpiece, Women in Love. Relying primarily on published sources, Delany does a good, thorough job of tracing the Lawrences through the war years, and he has more to say than earlier biographers about ways in which the Lawrence circle sometimes overlapped with Bloomsbury. But Delany might as well have called his book "D. H. Lawrence's Triumph." Not only did Lawrence manage to avoid conscription; he spent those troubled years shaping his art and becoming recognized as a major figure in twentieth-century literature. Dix, Carol. D. H. LAWRENCE AND WOMEN. Rowman and Littlefield, 1979. 126 pp. $18.75. Far from degrading women and treating them as mere sexual objects, Lawrence was far ahead of his time in his attitudes toward women. So says Carol Dix in this energetic study. She argues that Lawrence created female characters who were finally to emerge as real people some fifty years after his death. In his own words, the ideal of woman "becoming individual, self-responsible, taking her own initiative" is the guiding principle behind the way in which he depicted women in his writings. 547</page><page sequence="108">D. H. LAWRENCE Gutierrez, Donald. LAPSING OUT: EMBODIMENTS OF DEATH AND REBIRTH IN THE LAST WRITINGS OF D. H. LAWRENCE. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1980. 184 pp. $14.50. The Phoenix theme of death and rebirth was pervasive throughout Lawrence's career, and Gutierrez does a fine job of investigating its implications during those years when Lawrence seemed to know that he was close to death himself. Gutierrez directs his attention to four neglected books of Lawrence's final years-The Virgin and the Gypsy, Last Poems, Etruscan Places, and Apocalypse-and has much to say about them that is illuminating. Lawrence, D. H. APOCALYPSE AND THE WRITINGS ON REVELATION. Edited by Mara Kalnins. The Cambridge Edition of the Letters and Works of D. H. Lawrence. Cambridge University Press, 1980. 250 pp. $27.50. One of the first unnumbered volumes in the Cambridge Edition of Lawrence, this book sets a high standard for those that are to follow. Kalnins offers a substantial Introduction to the texts-Lawrence's pseudonymous review of Dr. John Oman's The Book of Revelation, his Introduction to Frederick Carter's The Dragon of the Apocalypse, and his own Apocalypse- and provides full explanatory notes and textual apparatus. . THE LETTERS OF D. H. LAWRENCE: VOLUME ONE-SEPTEMBER 1901-MAY 1913. Edited by James T. Boulton. The Cambridge Edition of the Letters and Works of D. H. Lawrence.

Capra Press, 1980. 272 pp. $15. In 1932, shortly after he wrote Tropic of Cancer, Miller was asked to write a short critical work on Lawrence. "Possessed" by his subject, Miller produced at least three versions during that year, but except for three short extracts, they remained unpublished in Miller's archives for nearly fifty years. The editors of this work have skillfully collated the three sometimes contradic- tory versions in order to produce a single integrated work. Miller saw Lawrence as his "soul mate," and as may be expected, this "passionate appreciation" tells us at least as much about Miller and his philosophy as it tells us about Lawrence and his world. Niven, Alastair. D. H. LAWRENCE: THE WRITER AND HIS WORK. Longman for the British Council, 1980. 118 pp. + illus. L3.95. Published as a "special" in the long-established Writers and Their Work series, this is a concise introduction to Lawrence accompanied with well-chosen illustrations, some of them in full color. Pinion, F. B. A D. H. LAWRENCE COMPANION. Barnes and Noble, 1979. 316 pp. $23.50. After summarizing Lawrence's life and his dominant ideas, Pinion offers descriptive criticism of the poetry, novels, short stories, and other writings. A few maps and other illustrations, identifi- cation of real-life sources behind the people and places in the novels, a page on Lawrence films, and a very selected bibliography help to justify the "companion" in the title. Ross, Charles L. THE COMPOSITION OF THE RAINBOW and WOMEN IN LOVE: A HISTORY. University Press of Virginia, 1979. 168 pp. $13.50. 548</page><page sequence="109">In this study, published for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, Ross provides a chronology for all the manuscripts, an examination of the physical states of the texts where they yield information about the sequence of writing and revision, and commentary on how reaction by agents and publishers affected the growth of the two novels. Sagar, Keith. D. H. LAWRENCE: A CALENDAR OF HIS WORKS. University of Texas Press, 1979. 294 pp. $19.95. In a work that should be invaluable for those doing extensive research on Lawrence, Sagar offers a chronological record of Lawrence's writings and paintings. Year by year, month by month Sagar tells us where Lawrence was living and what work he turned out. Increasing the usefulness of this book is a 75-page checklist of the manuscripts of D. H. Lawrence-Section E of Warren Roberts' Bibliography of D. H. Lawrence revised and extended by Lindeth Vasey. . THE LIFE OF D. H. LAWRENCE: AN ILLUSTRATED BIOGRAPHY. London: Eyre Met- huen, 1980. 256 pp. ?9.95. Much more than a picture book for the coffee-table, this is a concise but thorough biography of Lawrence with a generous number of quotations from writings by his acquaintances and biog- raphers as well as over 150 pictures, including six in color. Sagar's research is up-to-date, and he offers information not to be found elsewhere. Wilt, Judith. GHOSTS OF THE GOTHIC: AUSTEN, ELIOT, AND LAWRENCE. Princeton University Press, 1980. 308 pp. $18.50. The Rainbow and Women in Love dominate the 61-page chapter on Lawrence in this study of Gothic fiction from its beginnings in the eighteenth century. Included in Wilt's preliminary over-view of the tradition are discussions of Stevenson's Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Bram Stoker's Dracula. Worthen, John. D. H. LAWRENCE AND THE IDEA OF THE NOVEL. Rowman and Littlefield, 1980. 198 pp. $22.50. What distinguishes this study of Lawrence's development as a novelist from other books that take up the novels one by one in the order in which they appeared is Worthen's emphasis on Lawrence's sense of his audience. Lawrence's involvement with ideas of social change reached a creative crest with the writing of The Rainbow, according to Worthen, and deteriorated thereafter as he retreated within himself.

F The Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia has been given the outstanding collection of Lawrence manuscripts and books gathered by the late David V. Lederhandler. Included is a heavily corrected typescript of the short story "None of That!," an autograph letter in which Lawrence discusses unconscious symbolism in Lady Chatterley's Lover, and many signed limited editions of works by or about Lawrence. T. E. LAWRENCE A O'Donnell, Thomas J. THE CONFESSIONS OF T. E. LAWRENCE: THE ROMANTIC HERO'S PRESENTATION OF SELF. Ohio University Press, 1979. 196 pp. $13.50. Based largely on Seven Pillars of Wisdom and The Mint, this study sees Lawrence as a radical instance of a divided self. Relying heavily on the Romantic myth of self as found in the writings of Schopenhauer and Carlyle, Lawrence was very much aware of the split in his nature between an expansive self that tried to shape a world and a contracting self that sought annihilation. O'Donnell makes good use of the unpublished Bodleian manuscript of Seven Pillars as well as previously unstudied letters to Charlotte Shaw and the Garnetts to show that Lawrence recognized his own dilemma.

FABLES OF AGGRESSION: WYNDHAM LEWIS, THE MODERNIST AS FASCIST. University of California Press, 1979. 190 pp. $11.95. Reviewed by BURTON HATLEN, University of Maine at Orono Fables of Aggression is an important book for at least two reasons. First, it represents a major addition to the (as Jameson notes) still "meagre" critical literature on a writer who remains the least-read of the major English Modernists. Second, the book represents the first extended effort at practical criticism by a writer who has become the principal American exponent of Marxist criticism, and who has for the last decade conducted a vastly instructive public dialogue with 555</page><page sequence="116">WYNDHAM LEWIS structuralist and post-structuralist critical tendencies. Both Jameson's Marxism and his knowl- edge of the new French criticism are put to good use in this rigorous but remarkably sympathetic study of a novelist whose work, as Jameson himself notes, is in large measure centered on a hatred of Marxism and all its works. Jameson offers detailed discussions of all of Lewis' major works of fiction from Tarr through The Human Age. All these novels, Jameson shows, are marked by an explosive energy within the individual sentence. Jameson sees in Lewis' style a decisive movement beyond the still Romantic "art sentence" of Joyce et al., with its implicit glorification of the shaping spirit of the artist, toward a celebration of the impersonal, mechanical process of linguistic production. Indeed, the Lewis sentence, by refusing to accept any "organic," "natural" bonds among things, becomes a powerful instrument of ideological deconstruction. But the potentially democratic implications of Lewis' style are offset, Jameson also shows, by a proto-Fascist cult of the "strong personality," and by a contempt for the masses, both of which impel Lewis toward a closed ideological system. In this contrast between an "open" style and a drive for ideological closure, Jameson finds the central source of energy in Lewis' work. Generally, Jameson proposes, the inner contradiction within Lewis' work manifests itself through an interaction between the members of a pseudocouple (Tarr and Kreisler, for example). Insofar as Lewis' theme is always interaction, he is, Jameson proposes, a political novelist in a way that Joyce and Proust for whom the "interior" life takes precedence over social exis- tence, are not. But insofar as the interaction remains sterile, with each member of the pseudo- couple revolving around but never truly touching the other, Lewis' sense of human life remains nondialectical. In Lewis' work, then, the autonomous subject of early capitalism is displaced, but no true concept of the collective has emerged in its stead. The consequence is the aggressive rage that pervades Lewis' work-the "rage and frustration of the fragmented subject at the chains that implacably bind it to its other." In a broader context, Jameson sees Lewis' stance as typical of a petty bourgeoisie which finds its "individuality" negated by the giant corporation, but which still regards with horror the prospect of being submerged in the anonymous masses. Fascism, Jameson suggests, is the characteristic political expression of such a marginalized petty bourgeoisie. Lewis' "Fascism" thus becomes not a momentary political aberration of an isolated crank, but rather a powerfully symptomatic expression of the inner disjunctions and the consequent frustrations of a social class that continues to hold the balance of power in our society. If the characteristic experience of our century is the anguish of the free "subject" as it finds itself displaced by larger historical "forces," then Lewis is, Jameson persuasively argues, one of-perhaps the-most representa- tive artistic voices of our time.

MALCOLM LOWRY; A PREFACE TO HIS FICTION. University of Chicago Press, 1980. 146 pp. $12.50. Partly to rectify what he considers too much emphasis on rather esoteric symbolism in previous criticism of Lowry's fiction, Cross makes a case for Lowry as a realist. Like the early masters of Modernism-Conrad, Joyce, Kafka, Mann, and Proust-Lowry made use of symbolism, but his primary intent was to illuminate the human condition. Cross places Under the Volcano, Lowry's masterpiece, in the matrix of his overall artistic development and has much to say of value about the writings that preceded and followed Lowry's major accomplishment.

MINA LOY A Kouidis, Virginia M. MINA LOY: AMERICAN MODERNIST POET. Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 148 pp. $15.95. Scarcely remembered today, Mina Loy (1882-1966) turned out a small body of poetry that was frequently compared with that of the more brilliant experimentalists of the 1920s and 1930s. In this first book-length study of Loy, who was a designer and painter as well as a poet, Kouidis makes a strong appeal for recognition of a woman who not only played a minor, but significant, role in the literary and artistic history of this century-she was friendly with some of the Italian Futurists, with writers associated with the little magazines in New York during World War I, and 559</page><page sequence="120">MINA LOY with some leading figures of the Parisian cultural scene-but also wrote poetry that deserves to be read. "It is as a precursor of postmodernism," says Kouidis, "that Loy's place in the modernist vortex becomes clear. She belongs in the Stein-Pound-Williams-Moore current of modernism, the current that by generating postmodern poetry became the most vital force in American poetry."

NORMAN MAILER: QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST. Barnes and Noble, 1979. 160 pp. $22.50. Based on the premise that Mailer's writings are best understood in terms of the radical ideas on the nature of fiction which he first put into practice in Advertisements for Myself (1959), this critical study deals mainly with Mailer's writings of the past two decades in terms of his continuing struggle to find a balance between his roles as reporter and novelist.

Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1980. 234 pp. $18. Living writers often consult psychiatrists, but usually must wait until they are dead before being subjected to psychoanalytic analysis by English professors. Norman Mailer, like Hemingway, has not been that fortunate. For Andrew Gordon, Mailer's works are dream books, transforming his tortured private fantasies into public concerns. Accordingly, Mailer is obsessed by sex, violence, power, and anality; and the tone of this earnest study may be suggested by several of the chapter titles: "The Naked and the Dead: The Triumph of Impotence," "Why Are We in Vietnam? Deep in the Bowels of Texas," and "Mailer, Swift, and Carlyle: The Excremental Vision." We suppose this book may be of some interest to readers more interested in psychology than literature, but we kept being reminded of that notorious book, published some years ago, which found the key to The Odyssey in the fact that Homer had been improperly toilet-trained.

Because Mann was strongly influenced by German Romantic tradition and the will-to-power philosophy of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Wagner, he found it difficult to speak up forcefully against the distortion of that tradition by the National Socialists. Apter writes with sympathy about Mann's dilemma as he struggled to reconcile his humanistic leanings with his own dark romanticism, but the critic feels that after the somewhat belabored optimism of the Joseph novels, Mann in Doctor Faustus could find hope only in the myth of re-birth after total destruction. 564</page><page sequence="125">Hamilton, Nigel.

Taking advantage of newly opened manuscript collections as well as private papers and inter- views, Alpers offers a much more thorough and candid biography than was possible for him to write when his first book on Mansfield appeared in 1953. Tracing her life from childhood in 565</page><page sequence="126">KATHERINE MANSFIELD New Zealand until her early death, Alpers shows how she managed to achieve literary distinc- tion in spite of her tortuous personal relationships. He tells' more than was previously known about her disastrous one-day marriage, her elopement with the man who fathered her unborn child, her complex relationship with her husband, John Middleton Murry, her ambiguous friendship with D. H. Lawrence, her lesbian relationships, and her desperate search for meaning in the writings of Gurdjieff. What emerges is an admirable portrait of an unhappy woman who entered a den of lions and, though badly scarred, emerged as a writer whose stature continues to grow more than a half-century after her death. Mansfield, Katherine: THE UREWERA NOTEBOOK. Edited with Introduction by lan A. Gordon. Oxford University Press, 1979. 108 pp. $22. In 1907 Katherine Mansfield, nineteen years old and just back from school in London, went camping in what was then the primitive and virtually unpenetrated Urewera region of New Zealand. The notebook she kept on the trip is here published in full for the first time along with six photographs taken on the trip. Editor Gordon offers a reassessment of the Wellington years in his Introduction and shows how the notebook served as a source for several of her New Zealand stories. Meyers, Jeffrey. KATHERINE MANSFIELD: A BIOGRAPHY. New Directions, 1980. 306 pp. + illus. $17.50. Like Antony Alpers, Meyers had the opportunity to examine many unpublished sources and to conduct numerous interviews in New Zealand, England, and America before undertaking this full-scale biography. The two books tell essentially the same story, as would be expected, but the biographers offer quite different views of their subject. Meyers treats Mansfield's fiction with respect, but he is less sympathetic to her as a person. In a final chapter that in somewhat different form first appeared in JML, he suggests that Murry's "cult of Katherine" did much to inflate her posthumous reputation. Moore, James. GURDJIEFF AND MANSFIELD. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980. 262 pp. ?8.95. Whether one chooses between the admirable biographies by Alpers and Meyers or reads both, this book is almost a necessary supplement. Making use of unpublished sources and interviews with the last survivors of G.I. Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at Fontainebleau, Moore offers a compelling account of Mansfield's final days. But what seems particularly striking about this book is the light it throws on a tangled network of literary, religious and occult interests that brought to the mesmeric Russian mystic not only Mansfield and Murry, but also Ida Constance Baker, Piotr D. Ouspensy, and Alfred Richard Orage. After offering biographical sketches of six main participants in the drama that was to be staged at Fontainebleau, Moore presents chapters on "The Initiation of the Priestess" and the "harrow- ing" of her husband, Murry, before presenting a new thesis about what lay behind Gurdjieff's most famous work, Beelzebub. Moore's book reads rather like a novel, but he has done his research with care. C Chatterjee, Martha Fuller. The Relationship Between Katherine Mansfield's Criticism and Her Fic- tion.

Marquand's literary reputation in both the popular and critical senses has declined considerably since his death in 1960, and this long and bulky work may be more biography than he deserves as a writer. However, Bell, who has written sensitively on Henry James and Edith Wharton, does not make excessive claims for Marquand the novelist, choosing instead to emphasize what is suggested by her subtitle. Marquand's was an "American life" in a variation of the Fitzgerald sense, combining financial, social, and literary success with domestic failure and a private life that was almost always miserably unhappy. This biography is longer than it needs to be, but it has the virtue of reading rather like one of Marquand's own novels. EDGAR LEE MASTERS C Russell, Herbert Keith.

The life of a man who spent most of his mature years as a Trappist monk committed to silence and contemplation would not seem to be an exciting subject for a biography, but thinking readers will find this an engrossing book. Surprisingly enough, Furlong makes the monastery years as interesting as Merton's bohemian early life and his university years at Cambridge and 568</page><page sequence="129">Columbia. She deals sensitively with Merton's courageous attempts to test his faith by studying other religions, such as Eastern mysticism, and by placing dramatic emphasis on the many conflicts he had with his superiors, she gives a vivid picture of a man who remained very much an individual in spite of his submission to the rigid discipline of a structured establishment.

Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 166 pp. $14.95. Reviewed by MILES ORVELL Robert Coles begins his book on Flannery O'Connor wondering what anyone could possibly add to the already ample library of O'Connor criticism that has accumulated since her death in 1964. In fact, he has written a book like no other on the writer, a deeply personal appreciation that makes as good a case as one can for the importance of her Christian vision to the modern world. Coles is interested in O'Connor not so much as a particular literary problem (though he is abundantly sensitive to literary questions), but rather as a modern Catholic intellectual, and as a writer who was anchored in the totality of Southern culture. Again and again he makes the connection for us between the O'Connor world of grotesques and the life of the South, giving us voice after voice-gathered one presumes during his years of field work in the South in the early sixties-echoing the eccentric voices in the fiction. Preachers, child evangelists, blacks suffering the solicitudes of white civil rights workers, people imbued with the presence of God-these are brought forth by Coles to demonstrate the continuities between O'Connor's Southern creations and the real lives of ordinary people. It is a strategy that risks eliding the differences between art and life, but given the overall tone and purpose of the book, it works beautifully to support the authority of O'Connor's moral universe. Coles makes no secret of his sympathies with O'Connor's world view, especially with her preoccupation with the "sin of sins, pride." In fact, this is a book about pride: O'Connor's own as a believer struggling with doubt, and as an intellectual with some quite strong anti- intellectual sentiments; her characters' who in various ways were beset by the self-importance of secular man or by the different self-importance of God-intoxication; the reader's own secular, humanist pride that would scorn the eccentricities of belief; and not least Coles's own pride (of which he is disarmingly well aware) as a professional psychiatrist, a certified healer of the soul. Nevertheless, Coles's psychological insights, certified or not, are surely one of the strengths of this book, as they clarify again and again the subtleties of the texts. And he has one more advantage, being able to use the recently published collection of O'Connor's letters (The Habit of Being, edited by Sally Fitzgerald), that has revealed so much to us about the writer's inner life. Coles uses that collection wonderfully, alert to every nuance in O'Connor's voice, capitalizing 578</page><page sequence="139">grandly on the new information we have about her friendships, her response to her readers, her engagement with issues of Catholic history and thought, her own sense of herself as a South- erner and as a Catholic intellectual. If the book as a whole demonstrates the real advantages of identifying thoroughly with your subject's point of view, it also, to my mind at least, reveals at one or two points some stumbling blocks, as when Coles celebrates O'Connor's excoriation of the abstracting, reductionist, stupid rationalism of her various scapegoat "intellectuals"-Rayber and Sheppard especially. (Shep- pard may be as "proud" as Ahab, as Coles asserts, but by God he isn't as "credible"!) Even O'Connor, in her letters, admitted her failures in these characterizations. Still, this is a remarkable book, not unlike Coles's work on William Carlos Williams, on Agee, and on Percy, an approach to a writer's vision that, by its deep empathy, enriches our view of a fictional world, and connects that world with our shared vulnerabilities.

Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 158 pp. $14.95. Whereas previous critics of Flannery O'Connor have often insisted that her fiction can be fully appreciated only by those who share her religious beliefs, she herself once said, "My audience are the people who think God is dead; at least these are the people I am conscious of writing for." In this provocative study Schloss concerns herself primarily with the methods by which Miss O'Connor attempted to bridge the gap between the author and her readers. With the exception of a chapter on "Control of Distance in The Violent Bear It Away," there is less emphasis on analysis of individual stories than on the devices which distinguish the fiction in general-for example, extensions of the grotesque, rhetorical uses of analogy and allusion, and, perhaps most significantly, the dominance of epiphany in both its religious and its Joycean meanings.

Louisiana State University Press, 1978. 312 pp + illus. $14.95. Reviewed by PHILIP YANNELLA Charles Olson's work is wide open to intensive scholarship and criticism, more so than the work of most recent poets. There are abundances and complexities in his writing, as well as attenua- tions and obscurities. Questions of literary influence are constant. The long poem Maximus brings up issues of coherence and poetic control. The relationship of his poetics to his poetry is problematic. His politics, his sense of ideas and of culture, his philosophy and its derivations, his use of myth, his historiography, his delicacy and grace, his centrality to postwar poetry, these are all particular issues that command attention. In short, nearly every critical and scholarly question that we usually associate with major work is suggested by Olson's work. I do not know whether that makes him a major poet; questions and issues and complexities, the sheer quantity of attention a writer commands, obviously do not imply quality. It is clear, however, that a deep academic interest in Olson began in the 1970s, and that the interest shall probably continue. Olson thought of himself as a scholar, and most often he refers to himself as historian, archaeologist, geographer, and cartographer rather than poet. In the broadest sense, his work represents an opening up of resources for American poetry, a movement away from the autonomous, self-referential quality that he saw as characteristic of much of the poetry written in the first half of the century. If poetry can be thought of as a discipline, as Olson apparently did, then his work is interdisciplinary. It is almost never about literature per se; it is concerned with connections and with literature as a way of knowing the world. This is important for critics and scholars-normative approaches to Olson, approaches which stress his literary qualities and pay some attention to "background," will not suffice. Olson the scholar-poet requires a criticism founded on a scholarship which can describe and judge his work with full attention to his thought. George F. Butterick, who is the Curator of the Olson Collection at the University of Connec- ticut, has gone a long way toward providing such a fundamental scholarship. For several years he has been at work on Olson, editing the texts, organizing the papers, and he has done this work with great care and modesty. The publication of A Guide to the Maximus Poems of Charles Olson is a culmination of what one hopes will be his continuing interest, and it is a kind of double testimony. First, it is testimony to both the demands and the fruits of sound scholarship and research*. Butterick has put together an absolutely first-rate set of annotations to Olson's major poem; his sense of detail, coherence, and the integrity of facts makes the guide a tremendous contribution. Olson scholars will long be indebted to him; indeed, in its earlier, shorter form as a doctoral dissertation, the Guide was of crucial importance to the writers of the other three books reviewed here. Secondly, Butterick's work is testimony to the extent (though not the quality) of Olson's scholarship, for it documents the poet's personal library, his reading, and the sources for the Maximus poems. And it does more. Butterick's introduction to the Guide provides valuable insights into the composition of the Maximus poems and into the textual problems that will surely be discussed in the future. We are very fortunate in having the Guide. To my knowledge, literary scholars have never had the sort of documentation that Butterick has provided near the beginning of serious work on a writer. There is a good deal in Olson to draw a critic in the direction of reading him in the context of American intellectual history. Olson's roots were in universities. He was a brilliant under- graduate at Wesleyan, he did seminal research on Melville and Shakespeare, he studied for but did not finish his work for a doctorate in American Civilization at Harvard, he taught and administered at Black Mountain College, he taught at Buffalo, and he had just begun a new turn at teaching, at the University of Connecticut, when he died in 1970. His work is not just full of allusions to various knowledges; he persistently speaks of the need for methodological rigor among writers. Early in his literary career-which he did not begin until his late thirties, after he 581</page><page sequence="142">CHARLES OLSON had passed through a couple of high positions in the wartime Roosevelt Administration-he was particularly insistent on the primacy of knowledge and method in writing. Nearly everything he wrote until about 1960 emphasizes the theoretical (no matter how off-handedly he stated it: Olson always seemed torn between a scholar's sense of precision and a democrat's sense of the resources of the colloquial). Olson was deeply interested in the poem as a conveyance of information. There are occasions when it is clear that he thought of literature as a sort of data bank and that the great leap forward that he deemed necessary was a leap away from sensibility, from craft, ego, irony, and so forth. This overstates the point somewhat, takes Olson, who was given to bluff and grandiose propositions, on a literal level. Still, there is no question that these were his interests. Both Robert von Hallberg in Charles Olson: The Scholar's Art and Paul Christensen in Charles Olson: Call Him Ishmael emphasize the theoretical basis of Olson's poetry. Both make signifi- cant contributions. Christensen's analysis of Olson's study of Melville, Call Me Ishmael, includ- ing its relationship to F. O. Matthiessen's commentary on Melville in American Renaissance, is discriminating and to the point, as is his description of Olson's early years as a student and his years as a bureaucrat. Better still is his exposition of the development of Olson's poetics in the late 1940s. For his "cosmology" (yes, this postmodernist repeatedly used the old-fashioned word) and his historiography, Olson was greatly dependent on Alfred North Whitehead's Proc- ess and Reality. Christensen's discussion of some of the specifics of that dependence helps to define the issues. Robert von Hallberg also devotes much attention to these matters. Whitehead figures prominently in The Scholar's Art, but a sharper context is provided by von Hallberg's analysis of Olson's relationship to Zukofsky and Objectivism (a particularly apt point: Objec- tivism is as philosophically inclined as Olson and somewhat more rigorous). Robert von Hallberg, like Christensen, also argues persuasively the exact nature of Olson's use of Pound and Williams. Both books, in fact, should set to rest the major charge of Olson's detractors-that he imitated his two masters-by cogently and calmly indicating how Olson extended their work. Indeed, von Hallberg's remarks on literary originality, and on the modern critical insis- tence that all writers bury their direct antecedents, make this entire issue into something rather silly. Both these books emphasize theory. But each is also concerned with the texture of Olson's verse and with his accomplishment. Robert von Hallberg is particularly adept at detailing Olson's prosody and language. Paul Christensen, on the other hand, is at his best when he discusses the meaning and form of the Projective poem. Both have a high regard for Olson's work. But both are also tough-minded critics; each has the ability to recognize Olson's failures, his shortcomings, and his cant. Charles Olson, of course, was absorbed by history, especially the history of his town, Gloucester, Massachusetts. Williams and Pound figure in his absorption, but as negative mod- els. He dismissed Pound's history in the Cantos as egocentric and private. More importantly, he judged Williams' Paterson, the primary American place poem when Maximus was begun, as the product of a mind which was alive, surely, but which was ignorant about the American city. Olson was right, I think, about Paterson. Williams relies on easy formulas having to do with pastoral as opposed to industrial America. His book is anecdotal as opposed to systematic. His methodology, if it can be called that, is that of the local historian who finds shards of information and, for want of other information, calls those truth. Olson wanted to know, with his scholar's mind he wanted to do the best kind of research on Gloucester and then to generalize about America from the instance of Gloucester. Williams, then, was a mere poet, and this was not enough for Olson who was, at least until his last years, omnivorous and ambitious. Is Maximus serious history? Both von Hallberg and Christensen, and others who have written about Olson, think it is. They speak of Olson as if his attempt to write Gloucester's past was commendable and successful, and both their books weaken when they follow Olson moving off into a new field, mythology, in his last decade or so, judging this change of direction as contradictory to his earlier pronouncements and, worst of all, subjective. I think both Christen- sen and von Hallberg undervalue the later Olson's accomplishments. Some of what he wrote in 582</page><page sequence="143">these last years is scandalously self-indulgent; there is also, however, much in Maximus Three (a posthumous volume) that is excellent by virtue of its command of voice and its simple direct- ness, in spite of Olson's straying from Projective theory and complex historiography. But that is not quite the point. Olson demands respect as a scholar of Gloucester. Critics like Christensen and von Hallberg give it to him. But there is simply nothing in their books, or in the Maximus poems, or in George F. Butterick's Guide, to suggest that Olson knew much about historical research or, to again use one of his favorite words, methodology. In the last two to three decades historical scholarship on American communities has de- veloped into a significant subdiscipline. Scholars such as John Demos, Philip Greven, Stephan Thernstrom, and James Henretta have written, particularly about New England history, in ways that have greatly sharpened our sense of both methodology and content. Their creativity in asking well-formulated questions, in using archival material and nonliterary data generally, makes-Olson seem superficial by comparison. Olson's basic theme, that the early communitarian promise of Gloucester was overcome by the forces of nascent capitalism, a theme which is familiar and which, as always, substitutes outrage for investigation, is reductive, oversimple. His evidence, which seems to have been drawn largely from books of local history and a tourist guide which includes Gloucester, was impressionistic (perhaps as impressionistic as Williams' in Paterson). When he discovered that an historian could actually use maps and archaeology to discover things about the past, he wrote as if it was his discovery, that what was news to him was new to the world. And his conclusion, that Gloucester stands for America, that its history was American history, is a good example of literary synecdoche. It is not, though, sound empiricism. These are unusual grounds upon which to estimate a poet's work, but Olson establishes the basis by making his poems so pedagogical. In a way, his manner suggests that he is far removed from things academic. But, still, he is one of our most academic poets. What seems exotic and avant-garde is in actuality professorial, in all the good senses of the word. His interest in community, in the concept as well as in the facts of Gloucester, his absorption with the concept of the frontier, his excitement over the possibility at arriving at holistic interpretations of culture through myth, his interest in historiography, his abiding interest in trying to bring traditionally disparate disciplines together, nearly everything he touched on has its analogue in the American university of his time. Specifically, Olson's interests parallel the shifts in the field of American Studies from the late forties to the mid-sixties. The problems begin, however, when we are called upon to judge the quality of his pedagogy and scholarship. There are, as I have tried to point out briefly, some real problems. There may be others. Perhaps his future commentators will conclude that Olson was simply a fine and influential poet (which he certainly was), that issues of truth ought to be set aside, and that, after all, poetry is of the "creative imagination" and not of the larger world. But I hope those formulas are not adopted. Olson deserves more. At the end of his book, Robert von Hallberg tries to account for what he deems Olson's loss of rigor, his increasing subjectivity, in his last years. He speculates that Olson weakened as a result of the adulation of his public, that his pedagogy deteriorated into shamanism. This is possible; it is certainly a familiar sequence of events. And Olson could compel an audience of young people and poets. He could even compel Sherman Paul, whose Olson's Push: Origen, Black Mountain and Recent American Poetry covers much the same ground as von Hallberg and Christensen but does so in a much more enthusiastic manner and with greater attention to the stream of purely literary history. There will be readers who will value Paul's book. He is imaginative, he is capable of startling transitions and juxtapositions, and he likes Olson a great deal. But his breathless prose and his tendency to free-form interpretation, to parenthetical ejaculations, and to merely clever or glib insights, makes the book far less useful than it might have been. Paul's appreciation of Olson-and that is what his book is-rather thoroughly precludes any exercise of judgment, and Olson ends up sounding like a grand postmodernist guru with truth to tell about nearly everything. Paul glosses a great number of Olson's poems, but this reader found many of his interpretations arbitrary. Mostly, Paul writes a kind of hot hagiography. Perhaps I was too distant or calculating in reading him. In any case, I did not find 583</page><page sequence="144">CHARLES OLSON useful or accurate statements like "By filling his given space and thereby making it place, he made traceries that we find useful" or, colossally, that Olson in response to postwar conditions was forced "to review the entire history of humankind, and in that reviewing to find ways (the Way) of renewing." I quote from Paul's "Epilogue," but these remarks are representative of both the tone and the thematic content of Olson's Push. Obviously, I did find useful the books by Butterick, Christensen, and von Hallberg. They give us a fine start with Olson. Scholars will find Butterick's Guide essential. Christensen and von Hallberg are more open to debate and revision. But they have written intelligent books, books with many insights, fine discriminations, and precise definitions. Olson, Charles.

After an introductory chapter on conventions of stage dialogue and dramatic form in America before O'Neill, the author traces the playwright's increasing skill in language from his use of American vernacular in the early plays through the failure of language in the middle years until he finally found a distinctive voice in The Iceman Cometh and other later plays. In particular, Long Day's Journey into Night shows O'Neill achieving a "family rhythm" of speech that lifted the language of prose drama to a level very close to that of poetry. O'Neill, Eugene.

THE POETIC ACHIEVEMENT OF EZRA POUND: University of California Press, 1979. 248 pp. $14.95. After briefly summarizing Pound's career and the state of his critical reputation at the time of his death, Alexander offers in a second chapter an explanation of what is peculiarly his own in Pound's poetry, selecting poems from successive periods for close readings that show "the ways in which Pound's poems work." The remainder of this helpful introduction takes up Pound's books of poetry in order of publication with the Cantos receiving the main thrust of Alexander's attention. Bacigalupo, Massimo. THE FORMtD TRACE: THE LATER POETRY OF EZRA POUND. Columbia University Press, 1980. 512 pp. $35. Reviewed by JOSEPH BARBARESE 591</page><page sequence="152">EZRA POUND Unlike many critics of Pound, Bacigalupo, a professor of English at Genoa, does not apologize for the intellectual or stylistic excesses of his author. Concurring in Blackmur's 1934 judgment of Pound as "neither a great poet nor a great thinker," Bacigalupo attempts to qualify Blackmur's remark through this "lengthy consideration of the vicissitudes of modern poetry in America." He views the Cantos as the product of the cultural "crisis of closed forms" as well as of Pound's obsessive attention to the written word: "To Pound, a full correspondence between reality and discourse is possible; this elementary mimetic hypothesis he never questions." Bacigalupo reads the Cantos as a primitive extension of this hypothesis into poetry, where "art is but the manifestation of what is already 'there,' not invention but 'finding'"; the result is a palimpsest of uneven beauty, designed on the principle that nature deposits "traces" or "signa- tures" which men import into culture. The book draws its title from Canto 36, where "the formed trace" is the signature of memory, "another form of writing." Bacigalupo's style tends to knot itself around textual sources, and some of his most tantalizing suggestions find their way into parentheses. His account of "American Tradition" seems rushed and contains judgments of Pound's successors that are either questionable (that Ashbery is "indebted to the Whitman-Pound-Williams mainstream") or incorrect (late in life, Lowell "claimed descent" from Williams, not Eliot and Pound). At the same time, however, he supple- ments a critical vocabulary inherited from Kenner ("rhyme"), Derrida ("trace"), and Pound himself ("ideogramic") with terms such as "splice" and "scenographic," which I find useful and just additions. He draws convincing parallels between Pound's "sensual immanentism" and a "religious conception of art which comes down to Pound from the decadents" of the nineties; he uncovers some provocative sources for the Middle Cantos in Fascist tracts of the period, to the extent of reprinting a portion of a "poem" about bread that was written by Mussolini and eventually found its way, in substance, into the Cantos. Bacigalupo's textual apparatus is sound and his footnotes are, thankfully, at the bottom of the page. I counted twenty-one instances (twelve of them in the notes) where he points to breakdowns in the New Directions' text of the Cantos and eleven instances where he supplements or corrects the Anno- tated Index. This book is exhausting to read, but offers an indispensable alternative to more fashionable interpretations of Pound's mature work. Brooker, Peter.

Limited to 400 copies. Hugh Kenner says of this work: "When Barbara Eastman came upon the scene the text of the Cantos seemed in perpetual flux. Her great service has been the enormously laborious one of collating the printings, recording variations, and so far as possible designating their authority. The present volume in effect tells us what happened to the poem between 1948 and 1975, the period of the combined and collected editions. That job seems done once and for all, and it is a service to every student of Pound." Flory, Wendy Stallard. EZRA POUND AND THE CANTOS: A RECORD OF STRUGGLE. Yale University Press, 1980. 322 pp. $20. Whereas many readers are put off from The Cantos because of the esoteric look of the poem and the many borrowings from obscure sources, Flory cuts through the smoke screen to reveal a work that is essentially autobiographical. The best passages, she argues, describe not the univer- sal and mythical, but profoundly personal responses to the moral and intellectual dilemmas which Pound faced courageously. The Pound who emerges from Flory's readings is a much more humane and sympathetic figure than is to be found in most criticism of the man and his work. Kearns, George.

University of California Press, 1979. 428 pp. $22.50. "Make It New!" Pound may have proclaimed, but his route to Modernism took him through ancient and medieval byways that helped him define his own particular brand of newness. Particularly influential was his adaptation of troubadour poetry associated with Provence. Makin, who knows Provencal literature and language very well indeed, traces the influence of the tradition from Personae to The Cantos and shows how Pound trained himself as a poet by working on the sophisticated and difficult art produced by the troubadours of Provence.

A LIGHT FROM ELEUSIS: A STUDY OF EZRA POUND'S CANTOS. Oxford University Press, 1979. 306 pp. $29.95. Reviewed by ANDREW J. KAPPEL, Virginia Polytechnic Institute In the Preface to his A Light from Eleusis Leon Surette calls his study "a new interpretation of the Cantos" that recognizes for the first time the importance of the rites of Eleusis to the poem. They are important, he claims, as a model of what he considers to be the most important action of The Cantos, the encounter between human and divine. The other models of this paradigmatic action which have already been identified by scholars-the Odyssey and the Divine Comedy-are in Surette's opinion inaccurate. They are so because neither of them depicts "a descent that leads directly to a 'paradiso terrestre.'" In The Cantos as in the Eleusinian rites, he claims, paradise is underground; the gods are below and we must go down to meet them. This is clearly not the case in the Odyssey or the Divine Comedy. Unfortunately, it is not the case in The Cantos either. One goes down in that poem, certainly, but not for good. Pound's descent is preparatory, as are both Homer's and Dante's, and in all three poems the longed-for paradise is above ground. There can be no mistaking this. In the later cantos, where Pound is persistently seeking his paradise, the attention is overwhelmingly up- ward. The otherworldly yearnings of these cantos are summed up simply in the repeated lyric refrain of Canto XC: "m'elevasti." In his efforts to discredit the Odyssey and the Divine Comedy Surette contradicts himself and mistakes facts. He claims that Pound's interest in the Odyssey was restricted to its Eleusinian elements, which are Circe (sex) and the nekuia (descent). Though other critics have noted the importance of the nostos (return home), Surette is abruptly dismissive of their work and claims that "Pound never alludes to [Odysseus'] return to Ithaca and reunion with Penelope"; "Penelope and Ithaca," he says, "have no roles in Pound's epic." Penelope and the return are mentioned specifically in Canto CII, in a passage which Surette himself quotes in full on page 258. To an extent he seems aware of the fact that his thesis is untenable, that the paradigm he insists upon is no paradigm at all. He explains that an awareness of the Eleusinian rites allows only limited understanding of Pound's poem: one, because not much is known about Eleusis ("after all, it remains a mystery"); two, because he has been unable to ascertain precisely what part of the available information Pound knew; and three, because the whole poem is incoherent anyway (stated explicitly in the Preface and assumed throughout). If the reader is left wondering why Surette undertook his scholarly venture in the first place, he need only refer once again to the Preface. There Surette complains that as a graduate student he had been misled by Pound into thinking that the "key [to the poem] might be discovered by an ingenious and assiduous student." That complaint betrays a na'vete about the nature of poetry and the function of the literary critic that accounts for the relative uselessness of A Light from Eleusis, which is primarily a record of Surette's abortive researches. Because he commits himself to a full-scale reading of The Cantos in terms of a concern that is not persistently relevant, many of his discussions are lopsided, pointless, and cursory. If we are interested in the history of the drafts of early cantos, which Surette is at some pains to delineate, we are much better off with Ronald Bush's The Genesis of Ezra Pound's 'Cantos' (Princeton, 594</page><page sequence="155">1976). If we are interested in the paradisal aspects of the later cantos, we are better off with James Wilhelm's The Later Cantos of Ezra Pbund (Walker and Company, 1977). If we are interested in the crucial Canto 36, of which Surette gives a lengthy reading because he considers it crucial to his thesis, we are. better off with George Dekker's Sailing After Knowledge (Rout- ledge and Kegan Paul, 1963). If'we are interested in the relevance of the Eleusinian rites even, there is Guy Davenport's brilliant essay "Persephone's Ezra" in Eva Hesse, ed., New Ap- proaches to Ezra Pound (Faber and Faber, 1969). Surette's most helpful discussion-of Pound's economics-has little to do with Eleusis. Surette's prose is often flat and banal; he asseverates where he should argue: "No one of Pound and Eliot's generation could simply accept Christianity as a birthright"; "This volume [Drafts and Fragments] announced the terminus of the poem in an appropriately indirect, but rather pathetic manner"; "Of these last cantos, only 113 and 116 are of very great interest." When the asseverations are elaborated we get bombast instead of argument: "To come to the Pisan Cantos after the Fifth Decad, China, and Adams is to come home again to familiar human discourse after having been kept reeling in nightmarish vertigo by an unceasing babble of disembodied voices." The book has been beautifully printed by the Clarendon Press and costs $29.95. If the matter were better, it would be worth it. Terrell, Carroll F.

Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980. 128 pp. $19.95. Believing that the ideological simplicities of Pound's view of life are too often taken more seriously than they deserve, Woodward tries to show that in The Pisan Cantos, as in the best of his other poetry, philosophy is subordinated to a oblique and stylized idiom that enabled Pound to find an inner core of peace and silence not unlike that to be found in Taoism.

Southern Illinois University Press, 1980. 154 pp. $10.95. Stark, John O. PYNCHON'S FICTIONS: THOMAS PYNCHON AND THE LITERATURE OF INFOR- MATION. Ohio University Press, 1980. 184 pp. $12.95. Reviewed by SHELDON BRIVIC Cowart and Stark both divide their studies of Pynchon's works into chapters about his uses of different disciplines, an obvious plan to use in discussing a polymath. Both books, for example, have chapters on film and literature, but the overlap between them is not grave. Cowart de- scribes the functions of four different arts in Pynchon's fiction, while Stark deals with the relations between six different areas of knowledge. The theses of both writers aim to bind together the disparate materials in their chapters. Cowart's jacket presents the second published photo of Pynchon, a Navy shot. Earlier, Cowart was first to describe the Remedios Varo painting that appears in The Crying of Lot 49, and much of Cowart's chapter on art is concerned with Varo. The chapter on music makes a useful contribution while discussing references to Puccini's Manon Lescaut by clarifying the relation between the story "Under the Rose" and the third chapter of V. Most readers of the novel can benefit from an explanation of how Pynchon transformed his Alexandrian story into this inordi- nately difficult chapter. Cowart, who tends to focus on psychology, explains in his film chapter how the racial and sexual symbolism of King Kong is used in Gravity's Rainbow. He also interprets the astonishing "poem with woodcuts" dreamed by the protagonist of this novel, Tyrone Slothrop. Unfortunately, Cowart's material is not well unified by his thesis about the different roles of the arts in Pynchon. He argues that pictorial arts show life as empty, music suggests new possibilities, and literature serves an optimistic mysticism; but he does not explain why Pynchon disposes the arts so. I am inclined to accept the first two points of his thesis, but have reserva- tions about the third. Pynchon's use of Rilke, for example, hardly seems optimistic, and some of the optimistic references to E. M. Forster's tales that Cowart traces seem dubious. Cowart senses the advisability of depicting Pynchon as constructive, but he lacks the facility and determination needed to do so effectively, so he falls back on less-than-forceful statements: "But if the value of the grail seems problematic, the quest itself continues to seem worthwhile, because it is in the nature of questing to be purposive, if only in appearance." This sounds as optimistic as Samuel Beckett, yet on two occasions Cowart refers to Pynchon as "sanguine." Stark's more substantial thesis is better able to employ his varied material. He argues that Pynchon portrays a chaotic universe in which a variety of systems of information appear. Stark strives to distinguish the relative values of these systems and to design a method for com- prehending the roles they play in organizing Pynchon's fictional worlds. Systems of knowledge Stark devotes chapters to include psychology, history, religion, and scientific technology. There- fore he ranges more widely in his source material than Cowart. But if Cowart's thesis is too narrow, Stark's is too vast. He cannot hope to explain every system of knowledge in Pynchon, and his efforts to cover the areas he maps out are spotty. Stark's chapter on science and technology, for example, has little to say about chemistry or physics. He confines himself to discussions of mathematics and cybernetics as organizing principles, making use of Lance Ozier, the authority on Pynchon's mathematics, and of Norbert Wiener. In his chapter on psychology Stark sketches various psychological theories used in Gravity's Rainbow, leading to the conclusion that the multiplicity of these contradictory systems serves to illustrate the inadequacy of any one. He follows the same strategy with religions and theories of history. The point of Stark's title is that Pynchon recognizes all of the theories people project on life as fictions. 599</page><page sequence="160">THOMAS PYNCHON The chapter on history is one of Stark's best. He shows how penetratingly Pynchon questions the basis of historical authority and how he projects history in a variety of shapes in Gravity's Rainbow, such as line, curve, and circle, in order to undermine each metaphor. The chapter ends, however, with a statement by Richard Wasson that the point of V is "to reveal the inadequacy of all metaphors of history." Wasson did not apply this point to Gravity's Rainbow, but this is an indication that Stark sometimes depends too much on other critics. In his final chapter Stark argues that literature has to be the primary system of organization in Pynchon's works because they are about the constructions of fictions by their characters. Stark's discussion of how Pynchon's characters fictionalize includes suggestive points about the self- reflexive nature of Pynchon's world. Finally Stark devises an elaborate method for determining the relative roles of different systems in different works by Pynchon. He applies this method most fully to the story "Low-lands," in which Dennis Flange, having been thrown out by his wife, moves in with a three-and-a-half foot girl who lives at the end of a tunnel under a garbage dump. Stark says, "their relationship will be satisfying" because it accords with the fictions in Dennis' mind that dominate the story. This reading suggests that Stark's concern with systems of knowledge tends to form an abstraction that separates him from the reality of the work he describes. He seems inclined to reduce Pynchon's characters to schematic figures illustrating his theory of information handling. Stark concludes that Pynchon justifies the idea of order for our time by including such a multiplicity of varying visions within the order of his work. This is one of Stark's impressive points, but it would be better served if Stark's theory of the order of Pynchon's work fit the actuality of that work more snugly and comprehensively. One of Stark's problems is his style, which includes sentences like this: "This vast knowledge distances in emotional terms a reader from Pynchon's material because it increases one's intellectual response to his work and decreases one's emotional response." His potentially exciting ideas are impeded by such heaviness. Pynchon has attracted some fine critics and will attract many more. So far this year, however, we have had only one book that is too modest and another that is too ambitious. C Braha, Elliot. Menippean Form in Gravity's Rainbow and Other Contemporary American Texts.

JEAN RHYS A Staley, Thomas F.JEAN RHYS: A CRITICAL STUDY. University of Texas Press, 1980. 140 pp. $11.95. By the time Jean Rhys died in 1979 at the age of 84 she had earned a small but secure reputation as a writer of modest output and genuine talent. She produced five books between 1927 and 1939, then lapsed into a long period of silence until Wide Sargasso Sea appeared in 1966. In this first book-length study, Staley first traces her life and considers the major influences on her writing, including her personal relationship with Ford Madox Ford, and then looks closely at her early books with particular attention to the ways in which they reflect new themes and techniques characteristic of Modernism. Wide Sargasso Sea is granted a chapter to itself, and the book concludes with a rather brief consideration of the three volumes that followed. Those last books, says Staley, show her penetrating more deeply into questions of feminine sensibility and other topics of strong contemporary relevance.

Laura Riding has played a significant role in the history of Modernist poetry, and this first book-length study of her work does justice to those qualities which make her writings peculiarly distinct. Wexler sees the poems and other writings against the background of Riding's life and her associations with Robert Graves and other writers, but the prevailing emphasis falls on the continuing struggle in the poet's mind between the claims of the senses and the need for thought. Partly because she never resolved that conflict, Miss Riding renounced poetry in 1938, but as this book shows, she had already established a firm niche for herself in the literary history of the Modernist period.

It is Roethke's reverence for Nature that most clearly places him within the Romantic tradition, and Parini does justice to that theme by focusing his attention on the poet's nature imagery.

THE POETIC VISION OF MURIEL RUKEYSER. Foreword by Kenneth Rexroth. Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 412 pp. $27.50. Writing the first book-length study of the woman who is now considered one of the first feminist poets of this century, Kertesz offers not only thorough critiques of many poems, but also an account of the reviews which greeted the appearances of her books. Beginning with her associa- tion with the proletarian writers of the thirties, Rukeyser continued to write in a tradition closer to Whitman than to Eliot and the other Modernists, thus putting her out of favor when New Criticism reigned supreme. Kertesz argues convincingly that the time is right for full appreciation of a vigorous woman who wrote poetry that is both passionate and controlled. A chronology and a full bibliography help to make this book invaluable for anyone interested not only in Rukeyser, but also in the origins of a new feminist sensibility in the poetry of this century.

Hall, Trevor. DOROTHY L. SAYERS: NINE LITERARY STUDIES. Archon Books, 1980. 130 pp. $19.50. Using detective methods not unlike those of Lord Peter Wimsey, Hall solves various mysteries in both the life and work of Sayers-for example, the nature of her marriage to Atherton Fleming, the chronology of Busman's Holiday, her attitude toward spiritualism, and the influence of Conan Doyle on her writings.

The first five deal with detective fiction as viewed by R. B. Reaves, R. D. and Barbara Stock, Lionel Basney, E. R. Gregory, and Hannay. Sayers' plays are considered by Terrie Curran, Alzina Stone Dale, and William Reynolds; and her translations of Dante and other works are covered in papers by Lewis Thorpe, Barbara Reynolds, and Barbara J. Dunlap. Nancy Tischler writes about her aesthetic theories; Richard T. Webster and Richard L. Harp deal separately with The Mind of the Maker; and Robert Paul Dunn finds links between the Wimsey stories and the Christian vision of their creator. Included as well is a bibliography of Sayers manuscripts and letters in U.S. libraries. Hone, Ralph E. DOROTHY L. SAYERS: A LITERARY BIOGRAPHY. Kent State University Press, 1979. 218 pp. $15. Hone was a Baptist minister before earning his Ph.D. in literature and is thus better qualified than most critics to evaluate both the fiction and the religious writings of Sayers. This narrative biography covers her private life, including the illegitimate child she eventually adopted but never publicly acknowledged, as well as her public life as a celebrity engaged in social causes and wartime work. Her literary output is described and analyzed in an effort to show that Sayers deserves to be ranked among the important writers of her time. Tischler, Nancy M. DOROTHY M. SAYERS: A PILGRIM SOUL.

The Story of an African Farm brought fame to Olive Schreiner and gained her entry into literary and political circles when she arrived in London in 1881. Admired by Shaw, Wilde, and Gladstone, among others, she formed a close friendship with Havelock Ellis and met other thinkers, suffragettes among them, who helped to shape the ideas of her influential Women and Labour. Returning to her native South Africa in 1889, she sided with the Boers and was placed under house arrest in spite of her relationship with Cecil Rhodes. Until her death in 1920 she continued to speak up vigorously for the rights not only of women but also of Black Africans. This book is a readable account of a woman whose life and books were in many ways ahead of their time. E Friedmann, Marion. "Trooper Peter and Zimbabwe." London Magazine, XX (March 1980), 60-69.

One third of this book deals with the Raj Quartet, considered his master work, while the other novels are treated in a more cursory, but adequate way. Swinden emphasizes the social and political implications of Scott's concern with national identity, but he does not neglect the more universal moral and metaphysical issues which emerge in Scott's fiction.

For a man who loathed sex and considered love "hopelessly vulgar," Shaw certainly managed to get himself involved with an unusually large number of women during his long life. Without devoting much attention to Shaw's career-except when she can show that some of Shaw's women friends inspired characters in his plays-Peters writes a biography of Shaw largely in terms of his relations with women, not only such actresses as Ellen Terry and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, but also the "older woman" Jenny Carpenter, the feminist Annie Besant, and others.

SOLZHENITSYN AND DOSTOEVSKY: A STUDY IN THE POLYPHONIC NOVEL. University of Georgia Press, 1980. 228 pp. $17.50. Because most studies of Solzhenitsyn emphasize his biography, his political conflict with the Soviets, and the realism of his works, this book should be welcomed as one of the first significant studies of him as a subtle and conscious literary artist. Solzhenitsyn himself defined his method as polyphonic, a concept associated with Dostoevsky, and Krasnov shows how in his three best 615</page><page sequence="176">ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN novels-The First Circle, Cancer Ward, and August 1914-Solzhenitsyn demonstrates his con- cept of the polyphonic novel. Simply defined, the polyphonic method requires the novelist to introduce several potential heroes who are made to contend with each other in an effort to express ultimate spiritual and social values. Because these polarized characters are allowed to act as if they were independent of their creator, Solzhenitsyn achieves a kind of spiritual realism which is a twentieth-century equivalent to Dostoevsky's.

Reviewed by ROBERT DeMOTT, Ohio University These two books comprise the latest contributions to the matter of Steinbeck and represent the continuation of a trend which, since 1976, has witnessed the publication of six other works based on Steinbeck's manuscripts, journals, and letters or devoted to aspects of his biography and personal relationships. The most heralded of these commercial enterprises-Elaine Stein- beck's timely, but subjective, edition of her husband's correspondence, Steinbeck: A Life in Letters (1975)-granted access to the overall design of his habitually guarded life yet also underscored the necessity for more detailed and objective future accounts. Fensch and Kiernan have addressed that need, though not always with the requisite impartiality their tasks demand. Fensch's book earns a qualified acceptance and should be part of any library where serious work on Steinbeck is contemplated; Kiernan's book is so unreliable that it should be used with extreme caution or avoided altogether. 617</page><page sequence="178">JOHN STEINBECK In supplying the missing details to one of Steinbeck's most enduring relationships, Fensch provides an ample chronological record of the correspondence and written communication exchanged between the novelist and Pascal Covici, who first served as Steinbeck's publisher (Tortilla Flat, In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony), then, from 1938 until Covici's death in 1964, as Steinbeck's editor at Viking Press. For three decades Covici exercised unflagging loyalty, generosity, encouragement and support in his dealings with Steinbeck. "You are my rarest experience," he told the novelist in 1941; in sustaining that privilege Covici not only nurtured Steinbeck's creative life (sometimes too insistently), but also ministered to a host of his psychological, personal, and domestic needs. This cumulative impact was not lost on Steinbeck-he dedicated East of Eden to Covici and, later, in a commemorative statement, claimed Covici "was my collaborator and my conscience." Although Fensch concedes that their friendship "must stand as one of contemporary Ameri- can literature's most faithful and strongest author-editor combinations," the portrait which emerges-colored by Fensch's preferential perspective-strongly favors Covici. Covici's humaneness and dedication are clearly evident in his letters, but so are his limitations-his superficial optimism, for instance-about which Fensch is relatively silent (Steinbeck had reser- vations about Covici's impatience, his mercantile attitude toward writing, and worried privately about Covici's attempts to "con" him). In making Covici the hero of this exchange, Fensch ascribes formidable powers to him, at one point calling him a "master psychologist" when actually his letter of 10 April 1945 indicates that he was only using common sense in assessing Steinbeck's situation. Of course, Steinbeck could be petulant during periods of composition or marital strife, but to propose that he was utterly dependent on Covici to analyze "the swamp of [his] own mind," that Steinbeck was "unable to do anything by himself" (here Fensch adopts Charles Madison's approach), or that Steinbeck was not sufficiently grateful for Covici's benefi- cence distorts the novelist's position and reveals the liabilities of Fensch's thesis. Steinbeck and Covici, then, is an uneven book. Fortunately, Fensch went back to the original manuscripts at the Humanities Research Center to correct errors in dating which occurred in A Life in Letters (especially Steinbeck's Bastille Day letter, written in 1962, not 1964). He also restored the full text of many letters which Elaine Steinbeck and her co-editor excised, and he has published nearly four dozen other Steinbeck letters for the first time, including a long one of 28 January 1963, in which-rare for Steinbeck-he muses on the nature of fiction. And yet Fensch has overlooked some intriguing documents: one suggesting that Steinbeck and his second wife edit a Viking Portable R. L. Stevenson; and an "Introduction" written in Steinbeck's hand, but with Covici's name affixed, which was apparently to serve as a model for Covici's Preface to the first Viking Portable Steinbeck (1943). In his last chapter Fensch neglects several Steinbeck letters, chiefly one of 28 December 1958 which is necessary to understand Covici's reply a week later. These oversights are symptomatic drawbacks of Fensch's treatment. His scholarship is limited, his annotations are minimal, and his commentary is often banal and obvious. In making the transition from PhD dissertation (1977) to published book, Fensch has not envisioned his material satisfactorily enough. Nevertheless, the letters which constitute the bulk of this volume make it a useful addition to the Steinbeck canon and, as a suggestive resource for pursuing the complexities of author-editor relationships, should serve to inspire an entire book devoted to Covici's career. Anyone with a reasonable awareness of Steinbeck's life and art, even that supplied by Fensch's book, will be appalled at Kiernan's meretricious biography. While the intention behind The Intricate Music is commendable it is hailed as the first "full-scale" treatment of Stein- beck's life and as a corrective to the skeletal design "glimpsed" in A Life in Letters-Kiernan's execution, knowledge, insight, and style are so deficient that his self-proclaimed competency as an "independent" researcher and writer, as well as the judgment of Little, Brown in having released the book, is immediately assailable. Even the book's potential thematic strengths, notably Steinbeck's determination to become a writer and the formative influence which the reading of literature exerted on his imagination, are so flagrantly mishandled that they are 618</page><page sequence="179">rendered meaningless. For example, Kiernan states that in the late 1920s Carlton Sheffield sent Steinbeck "a copy of Thoreau's Walden Pond [sic]. ... In a series of letters to Sheffield, Steinbeck had expounded on his appreciation of Thoreau's ideas and equated them to his own." This is a gross falsification which the original letters (now at Stanford University-Kiernan supposedly consulted them) will simply not bear out. Furthermore, a survey of the book's contents betrays its comprehensive claim, for Kiernan covers the last twenty-three years of Steinbeck's life in forty-two pages. This is an unconscionable compression considering the extent of Steinbeck's activity from 1945 to 1968 (more than a dozen works, including three- Cannery Row, East of Eden, and Viva Zapata!-which are currently thought to be among his most interesting productions) and hardly enough space for Kiernan to discuss intelligently, much less settle, the controversial issue of Steinbeck's artistic decline. The major problem with The Intricate Music is its lack of authority, its utter disregard for documentation. Kiernan employs just enough verifiable facts (gleaned, ironically enough, from the uncut typescript of A Life in Letters and from Nelson Valjean's impressionistic biography, John Steinbeck: The Errant Knight) to maintain narrative continuity and to provide fairly accu- rate dating, particularly about Steinbeck's Stanford years. Beyond that, Kiernan rarely observes the difference between fact and fiction. Even the Introduction, where he recreates a 1966 interview with Steinbeck, is untrustworthy: "I do not quote him verbatim; rather, I give the sense of what he said based on the notes I took afterward." Kiernan gives little indication of his sources ("A list of their names would be of no interest to the reader," he says; one frequently attributed informant told me he had never met or spoken with Kiernan), relying instead upon innuendo, gossip, and erroneous conjecture to reinforce his subjective perception of Steinbeck as a truculent, unhappy, and hostile man. Nor does Kiernan do any better when he discusses Steinbeck's work, some of which he never bothered to examine, as his comments on the script for Hitchcock's Lifeboat demonstrate. Certainly Steinbeck deserves better treatment than this, and until Jackson Benson's scrupulously researched biography appears, the intricate design of his life will remain incomplete.

Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980. 160 pp. $12. Reviewed by MILTON I. BATES, Williams College "Poetry," Wallace Stevens asserted in one of his better-known adages, "must resist the intelli- gence almost successfully." Except for that qualifying "almost," this statement might stand as one of the tenets of la poesie pure, under whose aesthetic aegis he wrote the poems of his first volume, Harmonium (1923). During the thirties, he still believed that poetry should be the true subject of poems. But as editors and interested readers pressed him to explain his work, he came to feel more comfortable discussing it in terms of its ideas. In Wallace Stevens: The Making of the Poem, Frank Doggett speculates that this may have propelled him toward the abstraction of his later poetry. In Doggett's most suggestive chapter, entitled "A Possible for Its Possibleness," he examines the shifting boundary between given and potential meaning in Stevens' poetry. How much of a poem's implied meaning did Stevens deliberately withhold from the reader? How might that meaning be retrieved? Addressing the first of these questions, Doggett maintains that Stevens consciously used elliptical locutions to extend the range of implication. Occasionally, he re- vealed a poem's possible meaning when explaining it in a letter. More often he did not, and then the reader who follows Doggett's advice will stalk the meaning through Stevens' "schemata"- those configurations of image, scene and persona which recur in his work and whose connota- tions remain much the same early and late. To the schemata Doggett considered in his first book, Stevens' Poetry of Thought (1966), he adds several here, notably the image of the figure beside the sea which appears in "The Idea of Order at Key West" and other poems. Useful as these schemata are, they falter before the kind of Stevens poem we most need help in reading. Confronted with "Earthy Anecdote," Doggett ventures only a step beyond Stevens' remark that there is a good deal of theory about this apparently simple tale of the bucks and the 620</page><page sequence="181">firecat. "Whatever theory there is," Doggett tells us, "must be an idea about the poem and not an idea to be found in it." In this instance, poetry has resisted the intelligence most successfully. Doggett's discussion of given and potential meaning in Stevens' poetry is framed by two introductory chapters and a rather cursory final chapter, tracing the growth of the typical Stevens poem from its inception in the subconscious mind, through that phase when it enters con- sciousness and becomes an integrating subject, to its final status as artifact, complete in its unique semantic and musical form. As Stevens viewed the creative process (and Doggett must rely throughout on the testimony of Stevens' poems and published letters), it was virtually a natural event unfolding within the self and proceeding as though independent of conscious volition. Frank Doggett's Wallace Stevens: The Making of the Poem is a worthwhile book because it is also about the reading of the poem. We know, of course, that theme is but one element in a literary work, and we try not to mistake the paraphrase for the poem. Doggett is not the first critic who has stepped forward in recent years to remind us that poetic composition is an incalculable process and the poem to some extent an indeterminate thing. But his reminder is couched in a clear, jargon-free prose which manages always to gratify rather than resist the intelligence. , and Robert Buttel, eds. WALLACE STEVENS: A CELEBRATION.

Humanities Press, 1980. 338 pp. $32.50. The first full-scale comprehensive book on Strindberg's drama in English, this work divides his career into what Ward calls the Pre-lnferno Plays and the Post-Inferno Plays. If something seems to be missing in the middle, that is because the period from 1894 to 1897 was a time of severe mental illness for Strindberg. Before then he wrote naturalistic plays concerned with social and psychological themes; after the years of insanity, he turned to symbolism and expressionism in an effort to express religious convictions that approached mysticism. Assuming that his readers are familiar with the plays and do not need plot summaries, Ward writes intelligent criticism that illuminates the plays not only in terms of their ideological sources, but also as constructs in themselves that, taken together, reveal Strindberg to be the first major Modernist playwright.

Contrary to the widespread assumption that Synge knew little of his native language, Kiberd here shows that the playwright was deeply indebted to Gaelic traditions and the Irish language. Much of the dialect in the plays is shown to be direct translations from Irish, and some of the more important speeches are traced back to letters to Synge from the Aran islanders. Kiberd's study draws heavily on Synge's own unpublished writings in Irish, and the book concludes with 624</page><page sequence="185">a fresh consideration of Synge's stormy relationship with the Gaelic League with new evidence on the causes of the Playboy riots.

Countering the general view of Synge as a man who held himself aloof from religious and political concerns, Thornton shows how the playwright retained certain aspects of his family's religious milieu throughout his lifetime. "For Synge," says Thornton, "ideas, beliefs, were not trivial; they were on the contrary of such importance that the theme of the power of ideas, especially of implicit ideas, runs throughout his life and works." Thornton traces intellectual and moral themes in Synge's plays and finds the culmination of his individual viewpoint in Deirdre of the Sorrows. C Hays, Janice N.

Walker, who teaches American literature at the University of Glasgow, considers Warren to be America's best living writer in the European sense of a humanist concerned with moral values and skilled in several genres. In this somewhat plodding but workmanlike study, Walker traces Warren's literary career from the early poetry to A Place to Come To (1977). Although the approach is more critical than biographical, Walker makes use of materials in the Donald Davidson Collection in Nashville and documents in the Tennessee State Archives to help explain Warren's affiliation with the Fugitive and Agrarian movements. The volume concludes with the transcript of an interview of Warren originally conducted by Walker in 1979 but expanded in subsequent years. Warren, Robert Penn.

EUDORA WELTY'S ACHIEVEMENT OF ORDER. Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 188 pp. $20. Reviewed by MARGARET JONES BOLSTERLI, University of Arkansas Since Michael Kreyling's book is the first comprehensive study of Eudora Welty's fiction since Alfred Appel Jr.'s A Season of Dreams in 1965, the attempt here to measure Welty's vision by finding the informing, therefore organizing, principle by which order is achieved in each of her books is sometimes useful and sometimes frustrating. When Kreyling's method works, as it does for The Robber Bridegroom, the result is gratifying, for the reader is provided with new insight into the elusive strands from which the fiction has been woven. In fact, the method works better on all the novels than on the story collections, perhaps because novels must, by their very nature, have unity of vision of one sort or another. It is helpful to see how the original ideas of Delta Wedding and the The Optimist's Daughter developed from short stories to novels. How- ever, his reading of Losing Battles as a struggle between the forces of history and myth embodied in Miss Julia Mortimer and Judge Moody on one side and the Beecham-Vaughn connection on the other provides a handy formula as the organizing principle of the novel but is a crippling reduction of the richness explored in other losing battles in the story. There are occasional misreadings that make one wonder how Michael Kreyling visualizes rural Mississippi. For example, the last sentence of his chapter on Losing Battles reads, "There was Julia Mortimer wandering the dusty streets lost to herself after so many years of such certain knowledge." Streets? However, minor lapses like this should not stand in the way of the praise Kreyling deserves for his ability to be analytical about the writing and at the same time sensitive to the nuances of the Southern subject matter with its emphasis on caste, as in the case of Edna Earle Ponder, who must, among more troublesome worries in The Ponder Heart, cope with the possibility of the Ponders' becoming as declasse as the Peacocks. This ability is a saving grace for any critic of Welty, whose works are as valuable for the social worlds they portray as for any exigencies of plot. Kreyling's determination to find connections between the short stories in the various collec- tions is so strained as to cause a suspicion that one is dealing with his achievement of order rather than Welty's. It is one thing to say, as several critics have done (and Welty has denied, as he rightfully points out), that the stories in The Golden Apples are so closely connected, because of shared characters and locale, that they form a novel. It is a different matter to hint, as he does, 635</page><page sequence="196">EUDORA WELTY at similar cohesion in The Bride of the Innisfallen. The similarities used to claim kin among these stories do not apply to all (where is the large body of water in "Kin"?) and are, in fact, such generally exploited themes in modern literature that to use them as criteria for selection would allow inclusion of about half the stories written since 1940. Much can be forgiven a critic who writes as well as Michael Kreyling does. Even while disagreeing with his premises, one is impressed with the variety in his prose and his imaginative use of metaphor brings freshness to the recounting of scenes from the novels and stories. The attempt to find principles by which to measure the vision of Eudora Welty's whole body of work to date is not only heroic but critically necessary. That Michael Kreyling fell short in trying it does not mean that he has not made a contribution to Welty scholarship so much as it indicates that her vision defies reductive analysis. If Welty's fiction teaches anything at all, it must be that losing battles have their rewards too. Mr. Kreyling should be congratulated for the promise he shows in this work and is encouraged to do more. Prenshaw, Peggy Whitman. EUDORA WELTY: CRITICAL ESSAYS.

This beautiful book provides a permanent record of the exhibit held at the Whitney Museum from December 12, 1978, to February 4, 1979. Williams served as the central focus of the show, but it ranged over the works of many other artists and writers associated with the poet-the Stieglitz circle, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, Grant Wood, and many other prominent visual artists as well as literary figures who helped found some of the little magazines and presses in which Williams and his compatriots expressed a new kind of sensibility that was both socially conscious in theme and experimental in technique. Tashjian is to be praised for his selection of materials to be exhibited, though some may feel that by emphasizing so strongly the proletarian aspect of the period he may have misled some viewers to assume that Williams, essentially an apolitical artist, was more of a social rebel than he really was.

EDMUND WILSON: OUR NEIGHBOR FROM TALCOTTVILLE. Syracuse University Press, 1980. 174 pp. $11.95. This engaging and amiable memoir tells about Costa's friendship with Wilson during the last ten years of his life. Wilson spent his summers alone at The Old Stone House, his mother's family home, in Talcottville in upstate New York. Costa, then an ex-newspaperman teaching at Utica College, became friendly with the formidable man of letters and found him "squirearchical, Dickensian, benevolent" in spite of his reputation as a man who liked to keep lesser beings at a distance. There is a warm, virgorous tone about this memoir that brings Wilson to life in a way that has not been done before. That may be partly because Costa himself had not only personal qualities of friendliness and intelligence that must have appealed to Wilson, but also the right combination of respect and detachment to play admirably his role as Boswell.

New York University Press, 1979. 168 pp. $17.50 cloth, $8.95 paperbound. 642</page><page sequence="203">"Perception" is the key word in this critical work. Approaching Woolf's fiction on its own terms as art rather than as a reflection of the author's personality, Apter emphasizes those ways in which perception is strengthened in her best characters to such a degree that it becomes a means of communion. "To bring into one's own sphere of comprehension," says this critic, "the enormous vision which the world and the process of life have to offer, to integrate the external, universal flux of life, death and time into the personal vision, is the challenge presented by the needs of Woolf's characters." This thesis is applied to Woolf's nine novels in the order of their publication. DeSalvo, Louise A. VIRGINIA WOOLF'S FIRST VOYAGE: A NOVEL IN THE MAKING. Rowman and Littlefield, 1980. 202 pp. $19.50. In this close study of the manuscripts of Woolf's first novel, The Voyage Out, DeSalvo recon- structs and dates four distinct drafts. The way in which the novel eventually took shape tells us a lot about the nature of the creative process in general and more particularly about the close connection between Woolf's art and her mental equilibrium. The most dramatic evidence of this is to be found in the fact that each time Woolf worked on the death scene of her delirious central character she herself went mad and once tried to commit suicide. DiBattista, Maria. VIRGINIA WOOLF'S MAJOR NOVELS: THE FABLES OF ANON. Yale University Press, 1980. 252 pp. $17.50. The subtitle of this work refers to Woolf's adopting as a model of literary identity the voice of "Anon," the communal poet, as a means of escaping what she thought was a dangerous tendency towards subjectivity and solipsism in many of her Modernist peers. By de-emphasizing the personal background of Woolf's fiction, by concentrating on technical questions of narrative authority, and by showing that her work can be placed in a broad comic tradition of English literature, DiBattista gives us a Virginia Woolf quite different from the quivering, sensitive woman to be found in so many critiques. The novels studied in detail are Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, The Waves, and Between the Acts. Freedman, Ralph, ed. VIRGINIA WOOLF: REVALUATION AND CONTINUITY. University of California Press, 1980. 300 pp. $14.95 cloth, $4.95 paperbound. Growing out of a nucleus of papers read at the 1974 English Institute meeting at Harvard, but including other studies as well, this volume brings together the work of twelve Woolf scholars. A section headed "Perspectives" with general considerations by Freedman, Harvena Richter, James Hafley, and Avrom Fleishman is followed by interpretive essays on all the novels: The Voyage Out (Frederick P. W. McDowell), Night and Day (Jane Marcus), Jacob's Room (Freed- man), Mrs. Dalloway (Lucio Ruotolo), To the Lighthouse (Maria DiBattista), Orlando (Jean O. Love), The Waves (Madeline Moore), The Years (James Naremore), and Between the Acts (B. H. Fussell). Gorsky, Susan Rubinow. VIRGINIA WOOLF. Twayne's English Authors Series, No. 243.

Apter, Maria DiBattista, and other recent writers on Woolf, Rosenthal has turned away from the feminist and biographical concerns that dominated criticism at the height of the Woolf 643</page><page sequence="204">VIRGINIA WOOLF boom. Instead, he emphasizes questions of form, theme, and technique as he considers separately not only her novels, but her nonfiction, social criticism, and literary criticism. Schlack, Beverly Ann.

Lynch, David. YEATS: THE POETICS OF THE SELF. University of Chicago Press, 1979. 240 pp. $19.50. Reviewed by DANIEL O'HARA David Lynch utilizes recent speculations on narcissism, especially those of Hans Kohut, to claim that Yeats had a desperate need to remake himself into an "artifice of eternity." By so doing, Lynch asserts, Yeats hoped to escape a chronic feeling of emotional blockage-"'of energy, of certainty, and of transforming power stopped by a wall."' Lynch goes on to quote Yeats from this 1909 journal entry as saying that "'one must either submit' to this situation 'or rage helplessly against it."' This malady and the compensating drive to become a perfect icon of creative power result not so much from unresolved oedipal conflicts (this marks Lynch's novelty), as from Yeats's vain desire to live up to the mocking image of the idealized self that could provoke "'the brightening glance"' of loving recognition from a neurotic mother-figure's otherwise indifferent eyes. For Lynch, this theory of the narcissistic personality accounts for Yeats's ironic vacillation throughout his career between sentimental incorporation within a larger whole, as at the end of "Among School Children," and symbolic assimilation of the objective world by a grandiose "I," as at the opening of "The Tower," Part III. Eating and being eaten defines, for Lynch, the polarities of Yeats's mind. All that we know of Yeats-"his aristocratic fussiness . . . his admiration of the heroic . . . and, finally, his creativity itself" is "symptomatic in this sense." Lynch organizes this argument in "a cycle of interpretations" which approach the supposed narcissistic complex ahistorically via poems and plays from different periods in Yeats's career. These examples are selected clearly because they appear to fit what is after all a predetermined interpretive scheme, despite Lynch's counterclaims. The book would have been a little more rhetorically effective if Lynch had presented the analytic bases of his theoretical position first, in the usual way, instead of secreting most of them in a scattering of footnotes at the back. He could have gone on then to trace more carefully the development of Yeats's alleged narcissism as it works itself out in his imaginative life. Like others writing on Yeats from an influential psychoanalytic perspective, Lynch tends at times to overlook the nuances of poetic form, the subtle shades of authorial intention, and the historical dimensions of a career, in the interests of promoting a thesis. For example, throughout the first chapter Lynch makes much of the last stanza of "The Tower," Part II, which begins with the famous self-interrogation, "Does the imagination dwell the most/Upon a woman won or a woman lost?" This entire passage does not require, as Lynch unintentionally demonstrates, an elaborate analysis of the relevant Red Hanrahan tales in all their stages of revision. The significant gloss is simply a reference to the moment in 1903 when Yeats, about to give a lecture, receives the news of Maud Gonne's marriage to Major MacBride. This crucial moment of intense imaginative crisis is poignantly enshrined in an earlier poem of 1909, "Reconciliation," as is the compensatory nature of Yeats's art, all in terms very similar to those used here nearly twenty years later. Apparently, then, despite Lynch's novel argument and organization, Yeats's poetic alchemy cannot be explained away so easily. 647</page><page sequence="208">WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS Parkin, Andrew.

YOKOMITSU RIICHI: MODERNIST. Columbia University Press, 1980. 236 pp. $20. Keene makes a strong case for Yokomitsu Riichi (1898-1947) as the Japanese writer most akin to the Modernist writers of western culture. Deliberately and somewhat self-consciously, Yokomitsu wrote a number of experimental works that reflected the influence of his European counterparts and in so doing, helped to change the course of Japanese prose literature.

St. Martin's Press, 1978. 312 pp. $14.95. In her biography of Zola Richardson gives a well-balanced study of his personal life, literary career, involvement with various personalities, and especially his part in the Dreyfus affair. Afthough there is little new here and much of it is schematized to show Richardson's concern about Zola's personal anxieties and tensions (somewhat settled down after he met Jeanne Rozerot), nevertheless this is a good introduction to the man and the artist. Illustrations and a bibliography are also included. Schor, Naomi. ZOLA'S CROWDS. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978. 224 pp. $14. Making use of new theoretical approaches to the study of literature, Schor finds in Zola's use of crowds a key to what unifies the canon of his work. For her "the crowd is not a strandlike theme which can or should be detached from the fabric of the text, but an Ariadne's thread drawing one deeper into the maze, a structuring theme which engages all of Zola's fiction."

LOUIS ZUKOFSKY A Terrell, Carroll F., ed. LOUIS ZUKOFSKY: MAN AND POET. Orono, Maine [Dept. of English, University of Maine]: National Poetry Foundation, 1979. 450 pp. $22.50. There are critics who believe that Zukofsky was the greatest poet born in this century. Both the size and the contents of this volume lend support to that view. Divided into five sections, this anthology consists of 24 contributions, many of which first appeared in the Winter 1978 issue of Terrell's Paideuma: A Journal Devoted to Ezra Pound Scholarship and other literary publica- tions. Among the contributors are Robert Creeley, Charles Tomlinson, Hugh Seidman, Fielding Dawson, Barry Ahearn, Neil Baldwin, Don Byrd, Hugh Kenner, Peter Quatermain, M. L. Ro- senthal, Harold Schimller, L. S. Dembo, Cid Corman, Jonathan Greene, Burton Hatlen, Guy Davenport, David M. Gordon, and Marcella Booth. Celia Zukofsky offers a year-by-year bib- liography of the poet's writings, and Terrell provides not only an "Eccentric Profile" of Zukofsky, but also an annotated bibliography of criticism.
