The inscriptions on the stone monuments to dead heroes give added signi- ficance to this find: the chronological range and the qualitative differences in the iconographic and paleographic representations open up a rare op- portunity to make investigations and postulate hypotheses about the beliefs of the people who erected and worshipped the stones. Fresh material unearthed bv the archaeologists under the gui- dance of R Nagaswamy must be put alongside literary material of the olden days to help us form an idea of the set of beliefs that inspired the herostone worshippers. In this article I propose to construct a series of conceptual images of ancient faiths and beliefs about the herostones of different epochs, link these images historically on the basis of literary and archaeological evid;-n:e, and trace the development of folk beliefs re- garding the souls of heroes. I shall use data available in literature, cul- tural anthropology, folkl,re and epigraphy, on herostones and other monu- ments to ancestors. Herostones in Chengam are dated from the fifth to the sixteenth centry AD. There are others discovered earlier in parts of Tamil Nadu and Kcrala.</page><page sequence="2">HEROSTONES OF SOUTH INDIA Herostones are mentioned in Akananuru and Purananuru and other poems traditionally classified as Sangam poems. Tolkappiyam (a grammati- cal work of the Sangam age) on the date of which there is wide disagree- ment among literary scholars, and Purapporurl Venbamalai, a later text of the eighth century AD, also refer to the monuments erected to kings, generals and other members of the elite who fell in battle as natukal (erected stone). There are only few references to herostones for common soldiers who died fighting for their liege-lords and for folk heroes who were killed in clashes with marauders, cattle-lifters and invaders. In other words, elite hero- stones find more frequent mention than folk herostones. There were sculptured as well as unsculptured pieces of stone stand- ing, to the memory of fallen heroes, at street and road junctions with no edifice or structure over them. The sculptured stones are called Katavul eluthia kal9 (Stone inscribed by God) in Sangam classics. Most of these stones pay homage to the valiant deaths of kings and generals. For example Purarm 231 announces the death of Athiaman Netuman Anji from spear wounds sustained in battle.4 Puram 243 speaks of the herostone erected to honour his memory.5 Auvai (fyfrsnm) has written an elegiac poem in Puram in which she mourns the deaths of her patron. Ordained Rituals Auvai's poem says that Athiaman becomes a stone and was fed with sacrificial food in a small bowl.6 The stone itself is described as adorned with a peacock feather, an indication that it must have been unsculp- tured. The peacock feather adornment and food and drink offerings were part of sacrificial rituals. References to such stone rituals are found in Akam, Puram and other Sangam texts although Mayilai Seeni Venkata- swamy observes that herostones which strictly pertain to the Sangam age have not been unearthed.7 We find descriptions of rituals in Sangam clas- sics and prescribed forms of worship in Tolkappiyam, which appear to be propitiation rites for the disembodied souls of the royal and military dignitaries. The herostones were set up originally on sites near to where the heroes met their death, or to where they were buried. When cremation of the dead became a common practice, the stones began to be placed in the villages where the heroes were born or where members of the family lived. It appears that at the root of this practice was the belief in the divisible nature of the soul a part of which can inhabit a tree, animal, bird or stone. This belief prevails among many tribal people today, and was quite common in ancient communities. Transmigration is implied in the order of ritual for the erection of herostones. Tolkappiyam ordains six ceremonies. They are (1) Katchi (si,'@): Discovery; (2) Kalkol (srro Car&amp;) : Tnvitation; (3) Neerpatai (,jaLu6nL): Ceremonial bathing of the stone; (4) Natuthal ((,xP?o): Erection; (5) Perumbatai (Qu(ILLimU6L-): Food offering and (1) Valthu (c,nrAiJP): Invocation and blessing. 41</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL SCIENTIST The herostone ceremonies assume significance in the light of the anthropology of rituals, magic and worship. The first ritual of discovery consists in choosing the stone to be put up. Why should the oracle choose a particular stone to be deified? The answer is to be found in ancient be- lief in the divisible nature of the souls, a part of which may be deposited safely in a place outside the body. "Primitive man takes his soul out of his body and deposits it for security in a safe spot intending to replace it in his body when the danger is past." Evidence of this primitive belief is abundantly furnished by folk stories. As J G Frazer observes: "On the theory here suggested wherever totemism is found, and wherever pretence is made of killing and bringing to life again the novice at initiation, there may exist or have existed not only a belief in the possibility of permanently depositing the soul in some external object-animal, plant, or part of a plant." Frazer gives illustrations in hundreds of tribal legends and folk tales. We can extend this theory to the soul that has left its body for good. A part of it can reside in a favourite haunt even after death. It could be persuaded to visit a particular spot and temporarily remain there if people made sacrifices and invoked the soul to do so. A soul also could make a stone or tree its temporary dwelling place. 'Thus a soul that has departed this earth can leave its 'double' to visit a particular spot of its liking. Even after departure to a different world it can return to the place where its 'double' resides. It is this favourite haunt of the soul that the oracle is after in the katchi ritual. Significance of Observances Later, it was considered unnecessary to discover the favourite haunt because the soul could as well be persuaded to enter a particular stone by means of sacrifices and offerings. Believers of this modified theory are to be found among Tamils even today. They maintain that a disembodied soul can sojourn in a stone for a few days till the earthly obsequies are over. The two initial herostone rituals listed in Tolkappiyam could well be the identification of a stone where the soul does or can reside. Neerpatai, the third rite is the ceremonial bath. Ancients believed that water possesses magical properties. Observing that water enriches and fertilizes the soil, they ascribed many mysterious powers to it. Thus water from particular spots was considered a cure for barrenness in women. A prince before he assumed kingship was bathed in sacred water which was believed to endow him with divine powers. Thus if the stone was washed to the accompaniment of specific ceremonies it was supposed to become a home fit for the hero's soul to live in. Setting up the stone (natuthal) is followed by perumpatai and valthu, offerings and invocation respectively. The stone is put up in a place chosen by the oracle and offerings are presented. Then is the time for invocatory songs and ritual dancing. A later text of the eighth century mentions six rites of which four 42</page><page sequence="4">HEROSTONES OF SOUTH INDIA are identical with those prescribed by Tolkappiyar. The other two are Kalmurai palikal ( ,s)p6s, p u9sa-o): oblation and invocation and II kontupukutal ({So Q&amp;)sfrairG y43A): carrying stone to its assigned place. The author of Purapporul Venbamalai combines the rites of oblation and invocation. What is new in the ritual series is fixing the herostone in its 'abode' which is sort of a megalithic structure. This is called the house of the stone, il ( fo ). The information contained in Tolkappivam refers to the period called the Sangam age (first century BC to AD third century) whereas prescriptions appearing in Purapporul Venbamalai refer to the post- Sangam (AD fourth century to eighth century) rituals. These stones were mostly memorials to kings and members of the elite. Folk Heroes of Chengam The Chengam herostones are different. They commemorate folk heroes who were servants, slaves, common soldiers or village guards. The inscriptions identify them as having fallen in skirmishes with cattle-lifters, marauders or invading armies which passed through the countryside spreading death and destruction. These battles are called poosal (,ri)). Chengam heroes were mostly men of humble origin like: the servant of Vinnar; Gangaraisaru's servant; the guard of Karungalippat3. Their names also point to their low status in society: Akkandai- kodan ([SSJ,SS Can-iL6r); Kaganti Annavan (&amp;ira;serT- . o/6rr6sre); Karunchathan's son (n(-,,T^, .s 6T6ndr). The circumstances of the valiant deaths are clearly stated in the inscriptions. Some died while rescuing cattleherds carried off by kings, feudal lords or hunters. The words "Thorn ittuvithu pattan (G-,i ntr Q?69A aiC' uiLrLsr) are explicit enough, meaning "fell after winning back the cattle carried off". A few were killed while obstructing the cattle-stealing kings and chieftains. This end is indicated by the words, "Poosalil pattan" (sq-sio uLn_L) r6r): "Died in a skirmish."9 The inscriptions give a clue to the nature of cattle wealth which became the bone of contention: they refer mostly to Erumai thoru (herd of buffaloes) and less often, An thoru (herd of cows) and sometimes even a flock of sheep. The prosperity of Chengam region was based on livestock. The surrounding tribes used to raid villages and drive off the herds into their territory. Now and then the feudal lords who held sway over the tribals incited them to descend upon the peaceful villages, robbed the cattle with their help and shared the loot. The Chengam farmers and peasants were forced to organize themselves in self-defence squads. The memory of simple folk heroes who died in the fight to regain stolen cattle is enshrined in the stone monuments. It is interesting to examine the system of beliefs underlying the rituals and ceremonies of herostone worship. Cultural anthropology and folklore provide only a few hints. Prehistoric peoples believed that souls disembodied possess more power than souls residing in bodies.' ? This 43</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL SCIENTIST power manifests itself as either constructive or destructive energy. ' The disembodied souls are supposed to harbour a partiality for their own descen- dants. If the survivors of the deceased propitiate the disembodied soul by sacrifices, dances and worship, it will add its own power to their reserves of spiritual and physical energy. It will help them on the battlefields, protect them, their flocks and crops.12 This kind of belief is held even today by certain tribal people and is the basis of ancestor worship. Tribes in Ghana, Nigeria, South Sea Islands and red Indians in South America practise a particular form of ancestor worhsip 18 in which the souls of the dead are symbolized by baked clay dolls. In India, Brahmins worship their pithrus (forefathers) by paying homage to three living Brahmins on the death anniversary of the parents or grandparents. They feed the trio as a symbolic means of appeasing the souls of the dearly departed. 4 Before the dawn of civilization, there were men in the stage of lower savagery who believed that their progenitor was an animal 5. This belief led to a train of rituals, customs and taboos. At a higher stage of social evolution, the animal became a mere symbol and a name'6. They began believing that the ancestors were after all humans whose souls could invest them with strength and power 7. Faith in ancestral souls and their power has been noticed by anthropologists in all parts of the world. Soul Power Tribal law generally forbids hurting or killing a member of one's own tribe but not the aliens. One also comes across tribes which believe that if they kill an alien and perform for him all the funeral rites that are due to a parent, the new soul becomes an 'adopted' ancestor. It joins the company of forebears and augments the power potential' . Such beliefs are prevalent among certain clans of Nagas, the head-hunters of Sarawak and the Hottentots of Africa'9. The prestige of a man in the head-hunting tribes is proportional to the number of souls he has added to the ancestral soul-army. Even after societies outgrew the tribal organization many faiths and beliefs which originated in tribal life still lingered on for many centuries. Herostone rituals indicate a similar belief that the soul to which worship is made augments the tribe's might against enemies. The rituals were meant not only to reinforce the defensive capacity, but also to enlist soul-power to ensure that their crops and animals grew and multiplied without let or hindrance. In AD seventh and eighth centuries the villagers used to donate lands in the name of the herostones. The income from this land was used to defray the expenses of festivals and celebrations. One such record of land gift speaks of the stone as a soul (.56?). It is obvious that the stone was believed to be the abode of a soul or the soul itself. There are noticeable changes in the belief and thought regarding heroes' souls. The early stones of Chengam have only one horizontal panel in which the hero is represented in a wounded state with arrows penetrating his chest. This is a realistic representation of the prowess of the folk hero 44</page><page sequence="6">HEROSTONES OF SOUTH INDIA whose soul must be worshipped to transform it into a beneficial spirit. This straightforward concept was modified by other influences. Higher Heavens The belief of the elite sections of society that the fallen heroes are welcomed into a special world of glory found expression in the later Chen- gam herostones. This mingling of the two beliefs is represented in a few panels which contain two horizontal layers, one representing the simple folk belief and the other the elite belief. The lower layer represents the woun- ded hero and the upper layer has two goddesses standing with garlands, ready to welcome him.20 This concept of a glorious hero's heaven for those fallen in battle was widespread among people passing through what may be called the heroic age. Valhalla of the Germanic peoples, Elysium of the Greeks and Veera Swarga of the Aryans and Melor Ulagu (CLostir eP 6g) of the Tamils are all heavenly homes for the heroes. This glory does not stop a hero's soul from visiting a place on earth where a monument is erected to it. A few other herostones found in Tamil Nadu and Kerala show three horizontal layers. The first two are similar to those found in Chengam. The third layer depicts the soul of the hero standing with folded hands before the linga2 1. An image of Nandi is also found in one corner of the panel. These are indications of a new development in the belief structure regarding the final destiny of the hero-souls. The Bhakti move- ment of the Saivites overwhelmed the Tamil people from AD sixth to the eighth century. The religious faith of Saivism postulated the highest heaven, Sivaloka for the blessed. The heroes were naturally counted among the blessed, fit for nothing less than Sivaloka. The Melor Ulagu thus be- came some kind of a half-way paradise for the departed soul on its way to the highest glory and supreme bliss. Though the destination of the heroes moved to higher levels, the living carried on their rituals and ceremonies before the herostones with the purpose of obtaining material benefits here, of the earth, earthy. 1 R Nagaswamy, Chengam Nadukarkal, Department of Archaelogy, Madras.
