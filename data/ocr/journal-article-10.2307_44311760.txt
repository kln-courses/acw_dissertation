Pp. 497 + 34 illustrations. $30.00. Reviewed by Robert Lance Snyder, Seattle Pacific University Writing in 1837, Thomas De Quincey looked back to the period forty years earlier when anti-Jacobinism was at high crest in England and memorably recounted the notoriety that then surrounded the author of An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793): "Most people felt of Mr. Godwin with the same alienation and horror as of a ghoul, or a bloodless vampyre, or the monster created by Frankenstein." The statement is not rhetorical extravangance. From previous work on Godwin's career, further illuminated now by Peter H. Marshall's critical biography, we know this otherwise unobtrusive exponent of philosophical anarchism was indeed vilified by the reactionary establishment of his times. The supposedly pernicious influence of Godwin's theories, coupled with his marriage to the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, led to his being stigmatized as a calculating and subversive ideologue with covert ties to the French revolutionaries. Thus, even to read Godwin in the late 1790's, remarked Jane Austen in her correspondence, was to be considered disreputably "raffish." Like any good biographer, Marshall winnows fact from fiction in order to set Godwin's achievement in clearer historical perspective. His reappraisal goes beyond other recent studies by John P. Clark, Don Locke, Jean de Palacio, and B. J. Tysdahl in methodically tracing the relationship between Godwin's life and writings. In that undertaking he draws on many hitherto unpublished diaries, memoirs, and letters in the Bodleian collection owned by Lord Abinger. What most distinguishes Marshall's approach, however, is his fourfold argument: first, that the shaping context of Godwin's mature philosophy was the Dissenting tradition in which he was reared; second, that the fundamental tenets of Political Justice were develped relatively early and, despite later revisions, remained coherent in spirit; third, that Godwin's nineteenth-century legacy was more considerable than is usually assumed; and lastly, that much of this writer's voluminous corpus is conceptually relevant today. Because the first premise anchors the other three claims, it deserves special attention. Godwin, observed the astute essayist William Hazlitt in The Spirit of the Age (1825), was a "mixture of the Stoic and of the Christian philosopher" whose perfectibilitarian treatise could be read as a "metaphysical and logical commentary on some of the most beautiful and striking texts of Scripture." Quoting this assessment in his excellent second chapter, Marshall delves into Godwin's upbringing to disclose a pattern that corroborates Hazlitt's suggestion. The political theorist who even in old age spoke of his "vocation as a missionary" was a third-generation descendent of Dissenting ministers and exposed as a schoolboy in Norwich to the ultra-Calvinist doctrines of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 85 Robert Sandeman. Both extraordinarily precocious and priggishly austere, the young Godwin had decided to become a clergyman like his father but felt his understanding "paralysed" by Sandemanian views on predestination and human depravity. His anxieties concerning these precepts later surfaced, of course, in Things as They Are ; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794), unquestionably the best of his nine works of fiction and often hailed as the first psychological novel. Although never able, Marshall avers, to "free himself emotionally from his early Calvinism" (p. 24), Godwin yet repudiated its oppressive hold on him by converting religious dogma into intellectual faith. Central to that endeavor was the evolution of his theory of perfectibility, the rationalist doctrine compounding the morality of universal benevolence with the power of enlightened reason to discern truth and guide behavior. Godwin's studies at Hoxton Academy under Andrew Kippis further eroded his orthodoxy, and five years later the candidate minister moved well beyond the strictness of Sandemanianism through his reading of the philosophes . Amid all these changes, however, Marshall covincingly demonstrates that the liberal influence of Godwin's Dissenting origins remained undiminished and reinforced his lifelong opposition to all forms of authoritarian control over individual judgment. Marshall is equally successful in his second goal of tracing the development and essential congruity of the ideas propounded in Political Justice. Godwin's thought, galvanized by his friendship with the militant playwright/novelist Thomas Holcroft and most of all by the outbreak of the French Revolution, is analyzed for what it is: a rigorously deductive extension of the view that human beings are potentially rational and virtuous, together with the conviction that politics and ethics are indissolubly connected. Another strength of Marshall's treatment is his recognition that Godwin "does not naively picture his fellow men as perfectly rational beings inexplicably oppressed by evil institutions" (p. 115). Not retreating in the 1796 and 1798 editions of Political Justice from his basic position that man is "susceptible of perpetual improvement," the theorist yet is shown deemphasizing the necessitarian cast of his early formulations, which to some suggested that social reform would be inevitable, and stressing instead a utilitarian approach to the voluntary practice of morality. Perhaps because of the later value assigned to individual autonomy, Marshall frequently speaks of the libertarian aspects of Godwin's political philosophy which ranks, we are told, with that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Stuart Mill. Behind these intellectual adjustments, then, lies a radical commitment to the spirit of Christian Dissent by a man who yet rejected as tyrannical the institutionalized anthropomorphism of God. The meticulous care with which Marshall addresses his first pair of objectives is not quite sustained with respect to the last two. While elaborating on the scope and nature of Godwin's reception by his contemporaries, Marshall does provide a useful summary of Thomas Malthus' critique of Godwinism in An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) and generally delineates well the philosopher's role as revolutionary mentor to William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Less impressive, though, is the scant attention given to Godwin's impact on such peers in political economy as David Ricardo, who receives only passing mention, and on Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels as the architects of socialism. The latter weakness is particularly odd. Invoking their names in two brief passages of his book, once at the beginning and again in the concluding chapter, Marshall notes Engels' claim that by 1844</page><page sequence="3">86 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE Godwin had become "almost exclusively the property of the proletariat," merely on the following page to proffer this summary evaluation: "Marx, of course, was not sympathetic to Godwin's undialectical immaterialism, his pervasive moral emphasis, and his opposition to organized politics" (p. 392). Such broad strokes do little to substantiate Godwin's centrality to the labor movement of the nineteenth century, especially as it took shape beyond the shores of England. They also tend to discredit the argument that the author of Political Justice can guide us through the ideological thickets of bureaucratic collectivism today. All this is not to deny, however, the book's contribution to a more generous understanding of Godwin's career. Marshall undoubtedly is correct in proposing that the man in whom his friends recognized, according to Hazlitt's testimony, a "Metaphysician engrafted on [a] Dissenting Minister" can best be construed as a "rational Romantic" (p. 396) symptomatic of many tensions within his age. Not the least, certainly, was Godwin's disaffection from the dogmatism of his religious upbringing, coupled with his longing for a secular equivalent of divine grace, and in that he clearly anticipates a familiar pattern within Victorian and modern culture. Peter Marshall deserves considerable credit for his painstaking examination of a figure who projects these elements so well. • - - - ■</page></plain_text>
