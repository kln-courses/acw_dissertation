It follows that knowledge of phylogeny is a possibility and that, given all the relevant data, a complete phylogenetic scheme can be made. How such a scheme can be expressed, whether it would be too complicated to use in taxonomy, or how far it could be so used, are among the more important problems which have to be discussed below. There is still considerable doubt as to the relative importance of the various theories proposed as explanations of the mechanism or mechanisms of evolution. A majority of botanists appear to favour Darwinian as opposed to Lamarckian views, judging from those 473</page><page sequence="2">474 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW who have expressed their opinions on this matter in publications. The original theory of mutations and the modern experimental methods in the study of heredity were both introduced by botanists De Vries and Mendel. It is doubtful that theories as to the means of evolution have as yet much affected either taxonomic practice or phylogenetic theories. It is perhaps of some significance that those who have made the causes or means of evolution a main study have not produced general phylogenetic schemes. This is true of Lamarck, Darwin and De Vries. Lotsy published three large vol- umes essentially on plant phylogeny; he then investigated causal evolution and, as a result, forcibly condemned all phylogenetic schemes, including his own. It is unnecessary here to discuss the well known theories of the mechanisms of evolution associated with the names of Lamarck, Darwin, De Vries and others. Lotsy (271), for example, fully outlines them. For variations, additions and some more heterodox views, others (279, 329, 330, 508, 362) may be consulted. There are, however, a few modern works dealing with evolution in which conclusions are expressed that are less generally known but which have a more or less direct bearing on our present thesis. Berg (41) contends that evolution has been determined by law (nomogenesis) rather than by selection from the accidents of variation; that is, evolution follows a definite course which is shaped by both external (geographical) and internal (autonomic) causes. One important statement for which one would like more detailed evidence is that "in the origination of new geographical forms (species, sub-species, nationes) a vast number of individuals inhabiting a certain geographical area are simultaneously involved in the production of new characters". Certain kinds of distribu- tion in plants, when studied comparatively, e.g., in Colchicum and Abies, suggest that mass changes may occur through the whole or a large part of the geographical range of a group approximately at the same time. Turrill (448, 449) has suggested the term harna- genesis for this hypothesis. Clark (98, 99), working on zoological data, believes that palae- ontological and embryological evidence leads to the conclusion that "in its broader features the development of animal forms took place by concurrent evolution", that there was "simultaneous develop- ment of some representative or representatives of all, or practically</page><page sequence="3">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 475 all, of the phyla or major groups of animals at the time of the very first appearance of life", and that "all of the major groups of ani- mals were formed at the same time as the result of following differ- ent developmental paths from the primitive single cell. . . . There is no evidence of any kind which would lead us to suppose that any one of the major groups was derived through any of the others". "The process leading to and resulting in the first appearance of some representative or representatives of each of the major groups may be known as eogenesis". "Through eogenesis the ground is prepared for the growth of the evolutionary trees. Therefore the picture that we get shows a whole forest of evolutionary trees of widely different sizes each of which arose from a seed formed and planted by the process of eogenesis". Classes within a major phylum are also usually distinct without intergrades, and probably they arose "in the early embryonic stages of the animal types con- cerned more or less immediately after the fixation of the structural complex characteristic of the phyla". In a less and less extreme form abrupt discontinuities may be followed into orders, suborders, families, genera and species. Rosa (364) has developed the concept of ologenese from zoolog- ical studies. The word is derived from 'oos, entire, and is attached to a theory according to which "l'evolution se produit suivant des lignes ramifiees dichotomiquement et chaque espece est predeter- minee dans l'espece precedente comme un individu est predeter- mine dans l'oeuf". Rosa classes his theory with those postulating an internal cause as a predeterminant, not merely of variation but of the direction of evolution. He particularly stresses "L'hypoth- ese que la ramification des lignes phyletiques est due a des de- doublements qui doivent necessairement subir les especes en conse- quence de la constitution 'a laquelle etait parvenu leur idioplasma (ou plasma propre) au bout de son evolution precedente". Un- fortunately, the work lacks clarity and is largely occupied with generalities rather than with actual proof and examples of holo- genesis. Since phyla, i.e., species and through them higher taxo- nomic groups, are by hologenesis formed in pairs by the entire disappearance of the parent phylum, the continued existence of organisms of lower rank has to be explained by the subsidiary hypothesis of different idioplasms (even if they have originated dichotomously from a common source) having "une differente</page><page sequence="4">476 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW potentialite phylogenetique". In this way it can be explained "pourquoi dans les diverses lignees (phyla) l'organisation a atteint des niveaux si differents". There is much vagueness in the presen- tation of the main hypothesis, some of the statements made do not hold for plants, and it is not known how far the concept of dichot- omy, in any strict sense, can be applied to the known facts of evo- lution, in view of modem cytogenetic knowledge of mutations and hybridity. Some of the philosophical aspects of phylogeny, mainly German, are discussed at length by Beurlen (45). A zoologist, Przibram, proposed the theory of apogenesis which postulates that, instead of supposing phylogeny to be represented by a tree, "all the facts would be explained more easily by suppos- ing that there existed, at the beginning, many organised substances developing side by side into species, each of the latter passing through stages more and more advanced without actual relation- ship of descent between the different species" (74, 343). Since hybridization is being increasingly shown to be an important factor in evolution in plants, it is unlikely that such a hypothesis will be found to have much value in the study of plant phylogeny. The modern study of heredity and evolution is largely experi- mental in nature with, one is glad to note, an increasing linkage with field studies. Most phylogentic schemes have been prepared in museums, herbaria, laboratories or libraries. This suggests the need for closer co-operation of those working on different lines of research. How far it is advisable to separate macro-evolution from micro-evolution is questionable, but the terms are sometimes useful in discussing the problems of phylogeny. Phylogeny of the major groups has, on the whole, been studied by methods different from those used, especially most recently, in studying phylogeny at about the species level. The problem arises as to whether major group characters have in some way a different basis in the genotype from that of genes responsible for characters of less systematic worth. As Darlington has shown (122), the "genotype must be supposed to embrace three elements, nucleus, plastids and cytoplasm. All of these are subject to particulate inheritance and particulate varia- tion. The nucleus in addition is subject to a super-particulate chromosome variation to which the others presumably are not. The particles in the nucleus are genes; those in the plastids and cyto-</page><page sequence="5">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 477 plasm may perhaps be treated more rigorously if we also think of them as genes-plastogenes and plasmogenes". This is an ex- haustive classification, since one can not conceive of genes in the cell wall, food reserves or waste products, though these may influ- ence gene expression in characters through alteration of pH of the cell sap, etc. There remain, however, other possibilities on which a taxonomist would like the opinion of cytogeneticists. Thus, it seems certain that there are very different rates of mutation for different known gene-loci. Is the explanation simply that, for example, family characters of the taxonomist are inherited by means of non-mutable, or very rarely mutable, genes, while varietal characters are connected with genes that mutate more easily? Is there some position effect controlling this difference? Position here would mean not merely position relative to other genes in a linear series but also a position to exposure to or protection from influences or agents causing mutation, such as shallower or deeper embedding in some protective chromatin layer. The tendency in genetics now-a-days is to regard "unit characters" as a mere device for expressing empirically obtained results and to consider gene interaction within whole chromosomes or within the whole genom as the only unit basis of inheritance. Goldschmidt (167) even denies the existence of the gene. Thus, he says: "All points taken together suggest strongly that the chromosome is the actual heredi- tary unit controlling the development of the Wild type, that purely steric changes at the individual points of its length produce devia- tions from Wild type which may be described as mutations, though no actual Wild-type allelomorph and therefore no gene exists". To a certain extent such a view appears to depend on the definition accorded to the word gene, and there is little doubt that for the practical purpose of describing experimental and observational results the term gene will long continue to be used. Can, then, family and other characters of a high taxonomic grade have a basis of genes which have become relatively isolated from the influence of other genes and are thus responsible for characters which are uninfluenced or little influenced by modifying genes which in turn may be relatively highly mutable? A very different possi- bility is that high grade taxonomic characters are due primarily to genes whose alleles would result in early death of the organism or in such characters that it could not perpetuate itself. Such non-</page><page sequence="6">478 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW perpetuation might be due to unbalance of basic and, in a sense, specialized organization rather than to the unfavorableness of single characters. A somewhat similar effect would result if genes re- sponsible for a high-grade taxonomic character had pleiotropic or pseudopleiotropic effects (171), one of which affected vital char- acters. It is very probable that some combination of the above possibilities may account cytogenetically for taxonomic grading in so far as this is valid-and much of it certainly is. The whole matter is commended to the attention of cytogeneticists interested in the broader problems of evolution. On the taxonomic side, a careful analysis of the characters used in a selected number of groups of different hierarchical levels with synthetic tabulations of the results might throw much light on our problems. What is needed is a cytogenetic explanation of Church's words (95): "The older the factors of organization the more deeply they are impressed in the constitution of all races to come". To the taxonomist there seems to be much matter for thought and investigation in this sentence. Gates (156) reached the conclusion that higher organisms ex- hibit two contrasted types of characters which he designates karyo- genetic (nuclear, mutational) and organismal (recapitulatory, orthogenetic), respectively. While it is doubtful that these two categories, at least to any marked degree, correspond with taxo- nomic grading of characters, their possible relevance should be considered in any comprehensive survey of taxonomic characters- a survey which, it is again emphasized, is badly needed. Lotsy (275) says that the real problem of evolution is: How did the great phyla arise and why do they, after a shorter or longer time, fade out and are they replaced by others ? There is no evidence of any of the great phyla having sprung from a pre-existing one. On the contrary, more and more evidence is accumulating of the extreme antiquity of all of them. He concludes that the great phyla probably arose independently from unicellular organisms and have originated through plasma crossing before uniparental (maternal) transmission of the cytoplasm replaced the earlier bi- parental transmittance. This agrees, in part, with Clark's theory of eogenesis, outlined above. The discussion in the last few paragraphs raises one very impor- tant issue which must be faced. Are, or how far are, taxonomic</page><page sequence="7">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 479 groups artificial devices, or do they, or to what extent do they, represent groupings in nature? The most diverse opinions are expressed, often very dogmatically, on this question. It is stated, on the one hand, that all taxonomic categories are at best merely convenient fictions; on the other hand, that they represent, if they be real, the classification of Nature herself. These views are com- bined in any of the four possible ways with the views that a natural classification must be phylogenetic or based only on the largest possible number of characters. Many taxonomists appear to agree, more or less, that the major groups, down to families or even genera, are artificial to varying degrees, but contend that species are real groupings found as such in Nature. "Man makes orders, families, and genera, nature makes species." Others contend that all taxo- nomic categories are man-made and that Nature makes only indi- viduals. It would appear that in some groups of animals and plants Nature has not been too clear in her construction of individuals, and psychologists even recognize dual or multiple personalities in Homo sapiens! Questions arising from the reality or unreality of species are discussed by Turrill (447). Difficulties arise partly from the use of ambiguous terms like "natural", "artificial", "real", and so on, and partly from a lack of knowledge of the general mean- ing and principles of classification. Definitions can be made by which any and every group is natural or real and others by which any and every group is artificial or unreal. In biological taxonomy a group is natural in the sense that it is composed of a finite number of organisms, a population; it is artificial in the sense that the taxonomist selects the characters by which he delimits the group and places it in the taxonomic hierarchy. In these respects, it is difficult to see any difference between any of the taxonomic cate- gories. The extremely practical device of the taxonomic hierarchy means that the higher the rank of the group, the fewer are the char- acters shown in common by all its members; the lower, the larger the number of common characters of all members of a group. This holds, must hold logically, for any given series, but it holds from one series to another only to the degree that the groups on any one taxonomic level are equivalent from series to series. It is generally agreed that groups are frequently not equivalent in the degree of (usually morphological) distinctness from series to series. For example, genera in Orchidaceae, Compositae and Labiatae are more</page><page sequence="8">480 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW finely drawn than in, say, Ranunculaceae. This discrepancy raises other issues which, however, need not detain us. We can logically avoid it here by keeping within one series. Species Concept In any accepted series, say, orders, families, genera, species (plural), varieties, we usually find that a greater number of criteria separate the species one from another than separate the genera, families or varieties. That is to say, most often, though there are exceptions, the term species is given to groups of organisms formed on the basis of the greatest number of differences between the groups. Often there are more morphological group differences between species than between families, genera or varieties. Other and particularly some modern workers emphasize ecological, genet- ical or cytological differences. Further, it seems that a high degree of correlation is shown by the different kinds of criteria at the taxo- nomic species level. Nevertheless, in other groups there is less correlation, and the taxonomic species then depends on the criterion selected or emphasized-morphological distinctness, geographical isolation, ecological limitations, sterility, etc. The criteria and their correlation are essentially sense data, and their use (selection, emphasis, etc.) in the formation of classes (species, genera, etc.) is dependent on the taxonomist. The greater the correlation be- tween a greater number of criteria, the more natural is the class. In this sense only taxonomic species are usually more natural than genera. Another argument, with a good deal of truth behind it, is to state that so many groupings, essentially different, are included in one taxonomic category, e.g., species, that any attempt to define the categories in their present use or misuse or to debate whether they be natural or artificial, is a waste of time until it be determined how many categories are needed to avoid ambiguity, what criteria should be used to define them, and what names should be given them. At present, on one basis or for one purpose, a species may be a good species; from another viewpoint it may be equally valid to consider it a variety or subspecies of another species (cp. 180). If the taxonomist insist that a group must be monophyletic he is introducing a phylogentic criterion which adds to the characters to be correlated, assuming that he has evidence for determining monophyly apart from correlation of characters.</page><page sequence="9">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 481 Watkins (480) concludes that "The idea of species is valid in so far as it emphasizes that differences exist which are unlike those commonly found in an interbreeding population, and often larger. It is artificial to the extent that it includes in one category distinc- tions of totally different natures and origins, and presupposes a sharp line, where none can be drawn, between the large and the small". Robson (361) expresses the following opinions: "The proposal is frequently made that the concept of species and the systematic method of specific diagnosis should be given up in favour of some other system preferably based upon recognition of the method in which the differentiated characters are variously combined. The rejection of the systematists' concept does not, however, seem to be implied in these conclusions. Ill-defined as they may be and of varying dimensions, a certain tendency to character-groupings of a certain stability is fairly recognizable, and such grouping requires designation, the only difficulty being the line to be drawn between species and variety. From the point of view of classification, it seems desirable to retain that admittedly arbitrary device than to adopt a system of elaborate symbolic representation. At the same time there is no doubt that, if the systematist were to adopt some method of expressing character-groupings and combinations as an adjunct to his traditional method, it would illustrate the structural relationships of allied forms in a very useful manner". Rabel (345), in an exceedingly interesting paper which should be read by all biologists, after pointing out that "A clear formula- tion of the species problem can never be attained unless the two factors Resemblance and Descent are carefully kept apart", sug- gests, in outline, a decimal system for organisms, exemplifying its form and possible use from the angiosperms. A taxonomist may doubt the practicability of such a scheme applied to all organisms because of the enormous number of characters which would have to be included, the impossibility of memorizing masses of symbol combinations, and the great risk of writing, typing or printing wrong letter or figure symbols with little chance of a reader detect- ing errors, but its possibilities require investigation. Marsden- Jones and Turrill in Silene (289), Turrill in Glauciumn (451) and Chaytor and Turrill in Clypeola (87) have used schemes with a somewhat similar basis for the study of problems at and below the species level.</page><page sequence="10">482 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW An excellent summary of the facts and theories regarding the constitution of species is given by Cuenot (118). Characters It is impossible to lay down general laws as to what is or is not a single or unit character. Pleiotropism and pseudopleiotropism, additional to the ordinary difficulties of classifying characters, make simple genetical tests by themselves, even theoretically, of no greater value in taxonomy than conclusions from comparative morphology in deciding this question. Thus, Marsden-Jones and Turrill (292) found in male (female sterile) Ranunculus acris that a wide range of characters, affecting vegetative, floral and reproductive organs were always inherited together in the now hundreds of living plants studied, the assumption being that they were controlled by a single gene. Yet the low height and general habit, the clawed thick leaves, the small flowers, the narrow more numerous petals, and the reduced carpels would all be referred to as separate characters in any morphological-taxonomic description of the plants. On the other hand, a study of all variations within a group will give a minimum figure value for single characters as accepted by the systematist. The same phenotypic character may, of course, be due to different genoms, especially such absence characters as glabrousness and al- binism. We can not by any known method determnine a maximum of characters from either a systematic or a genetical standpoint, but by widening observations and experiments on an ever-increasing number of samples and by the use of statistical tests, the chances of finding a breakdown in a supposedly single character are greatly increased if the character be composite. Till reasonable proof is obtained to the contrary, a character has to be considered single. Thus, to take a very common example, a simple plane outline shape is usually considered a single character in descriptive botany, but it may be proved to be composite genetically, as by varying inde- pendently in length and breadth. The success of selection of characters for the practical purposes of classification can be judged pragmatically. There is, however, a danger in subjectively choosing characters to support a proposed phylogenetic scheme and ignoring others which lend no support to it. At least every known character should be given its due in</page><page sequence="11">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 483 publication. All characters which can be made available must be weighed as accurately as possible. There comes next the exceedingly difficult question of weighting of clharacters of supposed phylogenetic value. Lutjeharms (277) shows that the distinction between essential and unessential char- acters; given great prominence in phylogentic studies, dates back to Aristotle. The test of judicious weighting for the purpose or pur- poses of a practical classification must again be pragmatic. Does the relative evaluation, combined with previous selection of char- acters, result in a classification permitting precise and easy deter- mination and/or an arrangement in which organisms alike in most of the available characters are classed near together, etc.? On the other hand, in trying to determine phylogeny on the basis of char- acter resemblances and differences, weight is nearly always given to some character as having greater phylogenetic importance than others. How is this phylogenetic importance determined? When based on palaeontological evidence or, for lower taxonomic grades, on cytogenetic data, it may well be sound. In the absence of such basis, one can frequently detect an argument in a circle. Removing all verbose camouflage, a commonly used argument reduced to its essential terms is that a group is primitive or advanced because its members have primitive or advanced characters, while the char- acters are primitive or advanced because they occur in a primitive or advanced group. It can not be too strongly stated that such a circle must be broken before the inferences become valid. It can be broken only objectively, by independent evidence reasonably proving, i.e., so far as such matters can be proved, either that the group is or the characters are primitive or advanced. Series A very large number of progressive series have been made in the various groups of plants, particularly series showing more or less graduated changes (character clines) in one organ or what is con- veniently considered as a unit organ. This study of organogenesis or morphogenesis has intrinsically much to recommend it, since it brings to light many unknown facts, unrealized connections and cor- relations, and suggestions for further research. The difficulty is to know how correctly to read the series morphogenetically, whether up or down, or to start somewhere between the two ends and to</page><page sequence="12">484 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW read in two directions. For the Spermatophyta, Engler (140, 141) and Diels (131) give numerous examples of progressive series, and Zimmermann (506, 507) discusses the interest and importance of Merkmalsphylogenie. Wilson's account of the phylogeny of the stamen (493) is an example of recently published work on organo- genesis based mainly on anatomy. The theory of phyllome develop- ment, as stated by Domin (133), is another example. Where it is possible, as by palaeontological evidence, by certain distinction of vestigial from rudimentary structures, by clear evidence of pro- gressive specialization, etc., to determine the morphogenetic trend, there still remains the essential problem of uniting the different trends or series to determine the phylogeny of groups as composed of whole organisms. The reticulate nature of such trends rather than their parallelism is often obvious. The very difficult problem of the use of abnormalities in tracing organogenesis must be briefly considered. Worsdell (501) holds "that there can never have been, so far as vascular plants are con- cerned, more than three categories of organs [i.e., three main sub- divisions of the plant-body] in the past from which all modern structures have descended, viz. stem, leaf, and root." Indeed, ac- cepting, as he does, the phyton theory, even the stem "is built up solely by the bases of the leaves". Teratology is one of the methods which can be used "to determine the origin, from one of the three categories of organs, of any structure whose present nature is doubtful, and whose mere appearance is perhaps wholly mislead- ing". The method has to be used with care and constantly supple- mented by comparative and other evidence, but "In very many cases the so-called freaks and monstrosities represent reversions or harkings-back, in one form or another, to an ancestral condi- tion". Obviously, any valid evidence which will determine a more primitive condition of an organ must greatly assist in the correct formation and reading of a morphogenetic series of that organ. It is perhaps desirable to give two or three examples of organo- genetic series, but considerations of space demand excessive brevity. The 40 to 50 genera of the Ranunculaceae, with some exceptions, e.g. the Anemone and Aquilegia groups, are fairly sharply distin- guished morphologically. It is possible to make a number of organogenetic series, such as:</page><page sequence="13">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 485 Herbaceous ? woody habit Actinomorphy w zygomorphy Petalous ? apetalous Numerous carpels w one carpel per gynoecium Carpels free w carpels united Numerous ovules w one ovule per carpel Yet these series are not parallel, taking all genera into consideration. If, for example, the series be read from left to right: Clematis is advanced in having a woody, climbing, habit, in being most often apetalous, and in having one or two ovules, only one of which ripens to a seed in an achene fruit, and primitive in showing actinomorphy, numerous carpels, and free carpels. On the other hand, Ranunculus is advanced in having only one ovule per carpel, but primitive in the other five series. Nigella is advanced in having united carpels, relatively advanced in having a definite number of carpels, and primitive in the other four series. Delphinium is advanced in hav- ing zygomorphic flowers and few (usually 3) to one carpel per flower, and primitive in the other four series. There are other organogenetic series besides the six listed, and including these it is possible to show that every genus in the family shows a mixture of advanced and primitive characters. In the Gramineae, the Bambuseae show morphological charac- ters, especially of the flower, which are usually regarded as primi- -tive (see 19, 24, 25, 47, 208, 342). Some of Avdulov's cytological results and deductions have, however, been criticized (147, 346, 323, 97). Flovik gives reasons for assuming that the original basic number of chromosome units was 5, not 12 as assumed by Avdulov, and that "The higher basic numbers now generally oc- curring must therefore be regarded as secondarily balanced basic numbers". Exact cytological data for the Bambuseae are few, but the 2n numbers 48, 54 and 72 have been reported (227, 502). These numbers do not suggest 5 as the basic number for the tribe, and if Flovik be right, then cytologically the Bambuseae can not be regarded as primitive. It is highly desirable that more bamboos be cytologically examined. The Gramineae are of particular inter- est from our immediate point of view because Vavilov's theory of homologous variation was originally based largely on studies within this family. Arber (19) also gives numerous examples of paral-</page><page sequence="14">486 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW lelism and repetition for both normal and teratological characters in the family. My colleague, Mr. C. E. Hubbard, gives me the following strik- ing examples of parallel series in the Gramineae. Reduction, per- haps also multiplication, in the numbers of flowers per spikelet must have occurred in various lines, and the one end result of one floret per spiklet has been used in a very artificial manner in classi- fication. In Agropyron (Triticeae) there are, in different species, from many to two florets per spikelet. In Eragrostis (Eragrosteae) there are from ten to over 100 (in E. tremula Hochst.) to one to three (in E. habrantha Rendle). Sporobolus is essentially Eragrostis with the florets reduced to one per spikelet, but on account of this reduction is placed in the tribe Agrosteae by Bentham and by Hackel. In Lolium (Festuceae) from ten to two florets occur per spikelet. In Danthonia (Aveneae) from ten to two florets occur per spikelet. In Deyeuxia there is only one floret per spikelet, but there seems little doubt that the genus is polyphyletic, since several distinct series from as many genera can be traced leading to it. Indeed, the whole tribe Agrosteae (sensu Hackel) is probably highly arti- ficial in the sense that if all possible characters were taken into account and that of one-flowered spikelets not weighted, all the genera composing it might naturally be placed in other tribes. Awn development provides other series. In grasses awns of the lemma (flowering glume) may be produced by the apex of the lemma being three or more lobed and the central lobe produced into an awn, as in Danthonia, or by the middle nerve continuing from the back of the lemma as an awn, as in Avena and Agrostis. These two very different types occur even in the same tribe in existing classifications of grasses. Further, for each type, series can be traced from well developed, geniculate awns to straight bristles to small central lobes or minute dorsal projections, even in one genus, as Danthonia and Agrostis (336). In addition, parallelisms, either as graduated series or as con- trasting, presumably allelomorphic, characters are known in grasses for the following (inter alia) : habitat-high mountain versus low- land, coastal versus inland; habit-stoloniferous or creeping versus</page><page sequence="15">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 487 caespitose or erect, weak or robust versus normal; glaucous versus green colour of vegetative parts; variegated versus concolorous green; glabrous versus hairy sheaths and/or culms; degree of den- sity of inflorescence; large or small spikelets versus normal size; variously coloured (green, pale, yellowish, purple, etc.) versus normal coloured spikelets; glabrous versus hairy spikelets; chas- mogamous versus cleistogamous florets. The Bryophyta have many characters which can be arranged in series but these series are often not parallel with one another. For example, in the Hepaticae, we find: Thallus simple w thallus complicated Thallus dorsiventral &gt; thallus radial Thallus not foliaceous &gt; thallus foliaceous Perianth absent &gt; perianth present Sporangial receptacles absent w sporangial receptacles present Sporangium sessile w sporangium stalked Sporangium without elaters &gt; sporangium with elaters. There are numerous other morphogenetic series which, like those just quoted, criss-cross in larger or smaller taxonomic groups. In all probability some at least of these series are duplicated or even multiplied more than once phylogenetically, i.e.,. they represent two or more similar lines of evolutionary change which have oc- curred independently of one another. For example, Gates (157) instances several lines for the development of elaters in the He- paticae. The Marchantiales can be arranged in a series from Riccia with simple thallus to Marchantia with a highly complex thallus. Cavers (81) and Bower (52a), amongst others, accepted the series as an evolutionary one showing increasing complexity of gametophytic structure. Goebel (166) gives reasons for consider- ing the series as a reduction series. Bower, in a later publication (58), after considering Goebel's views, concludes that "the bal- ance of probability seems now to point to the simpler types having resulted from reduction in both of their alternating phases, rather than as themselves being primitive". In the Musci similar series can be arranged as for the Hepaticae, both for gametophytic char- acters and for those of the sporophyte. From these examples it is obvious that if a conclusion is to be reached on: a) whether a graded series of characters indicates, as</page><page sequence="16">488 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW arranged, a morphogenetic series; b) how such a series should be read-from left to right, from right to left, or in a di- or poly- chotomous manner; and c) if such series can be built up into a phylogenetic scheme and if they can how such a scheme is to be read, the characters have to be weighed and then evaluated from a phylogenetic standpoint. The latter process is difficult to keep entirely objective, since it means weighting or loading with the risk of bias in favour of a desired tip of the scales. The following general principles have been used: a) Palaeontological evidence gives relative primitiveness of groups. b) Cytogenetic data indicate, or prove, how groups have origi- nated, and from which other group or groups. c) Ontogeny is supposed to repeat phylogeny, more or less. d) More extreme specialization of structure and function are considered as evidences of a higher stage of evolution within the group, unless there is evidence of reduction. Conversely, organ- isms more closely approaching the general form or forms of the next higher taxonomic category are considered relatively primitive. e) A graded series is read on the basis that members showing greater or more resemblances to a group accepted as lower in the evolutionary scale are the more primitive. f) Orthogenetic, and sometimes teleological, trends are accepted as indicating the direction of evolution. g) Constancy of correlation of a large number of characters in members of a group suggests that the group is relatively mono- phyletic, and the degree and kind of breakdown of such correlation may indicate the direction of evolution. A constant character has, in taxonomy, generally meant one found in all or nearly all mem- bers of a group, i.e., in a logically natural system one of a number of characters showing high correlation. More rarely it has been used as the opposite of plastic, i.e., a character not easily modified in the course of its development by modification of environmental conditions. These general principles are sometimes combined and the evi- dence is then much stronger; sometimes they are subdivided and the evidence is then correspondingly weaker. Thus, Wernham (482), for the dicotyledons, considers "economy in production of the several items comprising reproductive organs" [under f above]</page><page sequence="17">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 489 and "progressive adaptation to the reception of insect-visitors" [under d above] as "the fundamental guiding principles in the progressive evolutionary history of the dicotyledonous flower" and that the main tendencies subserving these two principles are in- creased conspicuousness (enlargement, aggregation), zygomorphy and fusion of parts. Arber (17) points out that "The meaning of reduction-processes in evolution has been rendered unnecessarily obscure by the mis- leading terminology coined by morphologists. The use of the word 'economy' in connexion with reduced features in flower construction, has been peculiarly unfortunate, because it has carried with it un- warranted implication of purposefulness. No one would claim that the loss of hair in the elderly human being is an adaptation for the purpose of economizing in brushes-on the contrary, we recognise it at once as a symptom of failure in vitality due to age. And it seems reasonable that the same common-sense explanation should apply to racial losses and reductions". The warning against a terminology involving a too facile assumption of teleological ex- planations is opportune. The substituted explanation, however, ignores all problems of adaptation and specialization and, as a widely applicable general principle, also ignores the great mass of evidence in favor of natural selection. Organogenetic series, whether considered as examples of pro- gression or reduction, are usually based on morphology, but the physiological aspect has also to be considered. Thus, many of the examples considered by Haberlandt (179) in his work on physio- logical plant anatomy are or can be arranged in series similar to those claimed as organogenetic. Before leaving the subject of character series one protest seems desirable. The making of such series and the study of the evolu- tionary history of organs or of single characters should not be termed phylogeny-Merkmalsphylogenie of Zimmermann (506, 507). It can be termed organogenesis or morphogenesis and the term phylogeny reserved for the evolutionary history of phyla in the sense of any taxonomic unit. More detailed lists of principles for classification or indicators of phylogeny have been given by various authors. Many of these have been compiled with no more than shallow consideration of the truth of many of the statements which are made and without stating the</page><page sequence="18">490 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW evidence, or without stating it in such a way that it can be checked and re-evaluated. Many of the lists can be traced to Engler, Hallier (often via Senn) and Bessey. Swingle (417) says there is "rather uniform agreement on the following principles". "1. Plant relationships are up and down genetic lines, and these must constitute the framework of phylogenetic taxonomy. This will naturally form a branching but not reticulate structure. 2. Some evolutionary processes are progressive while others are regressive. 3. Evolution does not necessarily involve all organs of the plant at one time or in the same direction. One organ may be advancing while another is stationary or retrogressing. 4. Evolution has generally been consistent, and when a particular progression or regression has set in, it is persisted in to the end of the phylum. 5. In any phylum the chlorophyll-bearing plants precede the chlorophylless ones. Saphrophytes are derived from independent forms and parasites usually from saphrophytes among the lower plants, and from independent forms among the flowering plants. 6. Usually, structures with many similar parts are more primi- tive, and those with fewer and dissimilar parts are more advanced. 7. Among seed plants the stem structure with collateral bundles arranged in a cylinder is more primitive than that with scattered bundles. S. In most groups of seed plants woody members have preceded the herbaceous ones. 9. In most groups of seed plants erect members have preceded the vines. 10. Perennials are more primitive than biennials and biennials are usually more primitive than annuals. 11. Scalariform vessels are more primitive than vessels with round pits. 12. The spiral arrangement on the stem and of the floral leaves precedes that of the opposite and whorled type. 13. Simple leaves are more primitive than compound leaves. 14. Historically, leaves were first persistent (evergreen) and later deciduous. 15. Among the seed plants the netted venation of leaves is more primitive than the parallel venation.</page><page sequence="19">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 491 16. The many-parted flower is the more primitive, the type with few parts being derived from it, and the change is accompanied by a progressive sterilization of sporophylls. 17. A condition in which the perianth consists of like segments is more primitive than one in which sepals and petals are unlike each other. 18. Flowers with petals preceded apetalous ones, the latter being derived by reduction. 19. Polypetalous flowers are more primitive than gamopetalous ones, the latter being derived from the former by symnplhysis. 20. Regular flowers preceded irregular ones. 21. Spirally imbricate floral parts are more primitive than those that are whorled and valvate. 22. Hypogeny is the primitive structure and from it perigyny and epigyny have been derived. 23. Numerous carpels represent a more primitive condition than few carpels. 24. Separate carpels represent a more primitive condition than united carpels. 25. Axile placentation preceded parietal and central placenta- tion of ovaries. 26. The presence of numerous stamens indicates a more primi- tive condition than that of a few stamens. 27. Separate stamens preceded united stamens. 28. Evolution in angiosperms is believed to have proceeded from seeds with two seed coats to those with only one. 29. The primitive seed contains endosperm and a small embryo, the advanced type has little or no endosperm, with the food stored in a large embryo. 30. A straight embryo is usually more primitive than a curved one. 31. The solitary flower is more primitive than the inflorescence. 32. Bisexual flowers preceded unisexual flowers. 33. The monoecious condition is earlier than the dioecious. 34. Simple and aggregate fruits preceded multiple fruits. 35. The same evolutionary phenomena have often been repeated as separate occurrences in different parts of the plant kingdom, e.g., loss of chlorophyll, loss of petals, stamens and carpels, acquisition of fleshy texture in fruits and of various types of thorns, change</page><page sequence="20">492 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW from simple to compound leaves, from erect to prostrate habit, and from hypogynous to perigynous or epigynous insertion of floral parts, and lateral union (symphysis) of petals, stamens and carpels. 36. In determining the closeness of relationship between two families or other groups, it is usually best to compare with each other the more primitive, or basal, members of each group, rather than those that are simplified by reduction or those that are most highly specialized." There is a high probability that for both plants and animals transmigration from water to land gives definite directions of evo- lution for certain major groups. For vascular plants the dis- covery of adequate material which led to the establishment of the Psilophytales gives valuable evidence for the evolution of the Pteridophyta, not only by giving a relative starting point for the phylogeny of the group but also by providing phylogenetically early stages for morphogenetic studies of both vegetative and repro- ductive organs, though in the fossil forms these are known only for the sporophyte generation. At the other end of the scale of vascular land plants it seems clear from geological evidence that the angio- sperms were the last of the great groups to appear. Hence, changes towards characters peculiar to the angiosperms may with some justification be read as progressive, the more so that they are now the dominant group ecologically over much of the land surface of the globe. In the same way for the animal kingdom, the mammals form the last of the great groups to appear in the geological succes- sion. The much greater relevant palaeontological evidence for groups of animals than for groups of plants makes it possible to consider the primates as the "highest" group of mammals. The placing of man as the most highly evolved of all primates may be justified palaeontologically but also accords with human conceit, and one wonders how far phylogenetic schemes for animals are subconsciously influenced by "progress" being evaluated from an anthropomorphic standpoint. Some authors have attempted to distinguish between morpho- logical, fortuitous, or constitutive and adaptive, biological, or non- constitutive characters. The former are said to have relation neither to the environment nor to any biological function; the latter are in direct relation to some vital function or advantage and therefore more liable to change or exposure to the action of natural selection.</page><page sequence="21">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 493 Darwin (125) admitted the distinction to some extent, and Wern- ham (482), Diels (131) and Sprague (409, 236) have accepted it. Sprague refers to the distinction as follows: "Two corollaries have been drawn: that 'the occurrence of several common fortuitous characters in a series of plant-forms is valid evidence of their mutual affinity'; and that 'a group of plants may share a number of bio- logical characters in common without being therefore closely re- lated' (482). A possible objection to the acceptance of the two categories is that in many cases it may be a matter of opinion whether a particular character is or is not connected with the general mode of life of the plant or with some special function. On the whole, however, there is not much difficulty in separating char- acters which have no apparent connexion with function from those which definitely have such a connexion; and experience has shown that classifications based mainly on the former category exhibit greater correlation of characters than those based on the latter." Vesque (468, 469) introduced the term "epharmonique" for di- rectly adapted characters, contrasting them with characters of "filiation", the latter alone having a value in phylogenetic studies. Scott (386) takes exactly an opposite point of view and one which does not seem to have been fully considered by more recent writers. He says: "Another question which has been much dis- cussed is that of the supposed distinction between morphological and adaptive characters. Personally, I do not believe that any such distinction exists. . . . On a previous occasion I was at some pains to show that certain 'typical' morphological characters, on which the distinction of great classes of plants is based, were adaptive in origin, and even that their constancy is due to their functional importance [Darwin and Modern Science, 1909]. This applied in particular to the pollen-tube and the seed, which were considered in relation to fossil evidence". A rather interesting problem, which has been little or not at all discussed in detail by taxonomists, arises over the concept of "con- servative" characters, which, it is usually stated, are the most useful for classification and most valuable in phylogenetic studies. For plants, and especially for vascular plants, it is frequently added that the reproductive organs are more conservative than the vegetative. Yet, to take the carpel as an example, on any old or new theory of carpel morphogenesis there must have been far greater morpho-</page><page sequence="22">494 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW genetic evolutionary changes in carpels than in any vegetative organ considered throughout the Spermatophyta. Tuzson (459) gives as a criterion of relative age of two groups the size of the gaps separating the subordinate groups in each. Thus, he considers the monocotyledons as an older group than the dicotyledons, since the smaller groups of monocotyledons are sepa- rable into series and families which show greater gaps on the whole than those in dicotyledons. It has been stressed by some zoologists that certain and some- times large groups of animals are distinguished by a common pattern or organization which, because of the large number of physiologically interconnected parts, can not be supposed to have originated more than once. This gives, it is further stated, very strong proof that the units of the group are monophyletic. This criterion appears to be of more restricted value in the study of plant phylogeny. Asa Gray (169), however, says: "A natural classifica- tion in botany aims to arrange all known plants into groups in a series of grades according to their resemblances, in all respects, so that each species, genus, tribe, order, etc., shall stand next to those which it most resembles in all respects, or rather in the whole plan of structure. For two plants may be very much alike in external appearance, yet very different in their principal structure." The exact meaning of whole plan of structure is not very clear, but in these days, when holism and organism are stressed by philosophers, botanists might well give more consideration to unity of plan and its possible phylogenetic significance [see also below, under sub-heading Gross Morphology]. It is accepted by many of those taxonomists who aim at a phylo- genetic system that any group must be monophyletic, at least in the sense that its constituent taxonomic units all arose from only one group of equivalent rank. The hybrid origin of certain species, and possibly of some higher groups as well, rather hinders absolute application of this principle. Sprague (236, 410) appears to regard monophyletic groups as the only natural ones-at least at and above the family level in existing angiosperms. On the other hand, Hutchinson (230), in his phylogenetic scheme and classification, definitely retains groups he considers polyphyletic, e.g., Asterales and Euphorbiales. Phylogenetic taxonomists should agree as to</page><page sequence="23">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 495 whether or not (proved or postulated) polyphyletic groups can be accepted in a phylogenetic classification. One great attraction of phylogeny is that in one sense it gives a dynamic viewpoint from which taxonomic units can be considered. It is, however, doubtful how far the taxonomic uInits in general use-species, genera, families, etc.-are suitable for such treatment, since they are necessarily regarded as relatively static, as in the application of the rules of nomenclature. In evolutionary studies it may be better to replace themn by, or at least to supplement them with, lineages, lineage-groups, lines of evolution, etc., as suggested by Faegri (143) for species. Thus, he says: "a taxonomical-phylo- genetic line of evolution is a sequence of generations, the individuals of which descend from the individuals of the preceding generation and within each generation group themselves according to the law of probability with regard to all essential features, and further, form a closed sphere of combinations, reacting avitally or incompatibly witlh all other spheres of combinations with which it comes into contact. The species is the momentary realization of such a line." Anderson and Ownbey (12) conclude from studies of closely re- lated species "that differences between such species are to be sought not in any one character but in harmoniously integrated tendencies (genetic coefficients) expressed more or less throughout the entire organism". They develop a simple mathematical nota- tion "for expressing the resulting mathematical hiatus between two species" and discuss, inter alia, the application of estimates of genetic coefficients to "the determination of phylogenetic patterns". The view that tendencies have as much value in tracing phylogeny as fixed or group constant characters, has been expressed by a number of writers. Arber (17), for example, says: "It seems to me that the tendency to progress in a certain definite direction is as much an inherent character of a given race, as are the features of its chemistry or morphology". Wernham (482) constantly refers to tendencies shown by groups of the Sympetalae or in groups supposedly ancestral to them. We must now turn to a brief consideration of the kinds of data used in reconstructing phylogenies and often also in classifications not professing to be phylogenetic. For convenience a number of sub-lheadings are used.</page><page sequence="24">496 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW DATA USED IN CLASSIFICATION AND PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES Gross Morphological We have seen that so-called natural systems were well established, without reference by their authors to phylogeny, by the formation of classes to contain organisms having in common as many as possible of the studied characteristics, those considered being, with very few exceptions, gross and external morphological. Correlation of morphological characters, resemblances and differences in com- mon, with a certain amount of weighting, largely based on tradition, is still the basis of classification in nearly all groups of plants, except for certain special classifications. Reference may be made to Green- man (170) and his discussion of morphology as a factor in deter- mining relationships. Turrill (456) has pointed out that morphology, either plant or animal, nowadays includes a good deal more than the mere study of shape. Anatomy and much of cytology, ontogeny, embryology, palaeontology and genetics are or involve morphology. "Even within morphology in a very strict sense the taxonomist is forced to consider matters which involve physiology. The degree of cor- relation of characters and the constancy or plasticity of characters are so closely related to internal and external factors that the tax- onomist must, to a certain extent, consider the physiological work- ing of these last. . . . even the useful classification into morpho- logical and physiological characters (attributes) is artificial, in the sense that it is purely a device of the biologist". The occurrence, in various degrees, of plasticity complicates the taxonomic and phylogenetic use of all characters, but in a classifi- cation based entirely on morphology, only phenotypic characters can be used, and there are many examples in taxonomic literature where one knows, or strongly suspects, that different taxonomic groups have been formed for phenotypes of one genotype with the implication, at least, that they represent different genotypes. The very considerable morphological plasticity of certain species, e.g., Plantago major, on different soils under the same climate has been proved by Marsden-Jones and Turrill (291) in the transplant experiments of the British Ecological Society at Potterne, Wilts. For many purposes the study and even classification of phenotypes of one genotype is essential, but when they are uncritically included</page><page sequence="25">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 497 in a classification with phenotypes having different genotypic bases, the results are misleading. In the higher taxonomic divisions, i.e., phyla, families, etc., mor- phological criteria are still the only or most satisfactory ones for classification, though these often form an indissoluble combination with physiological characters. Since there is an enormous number of morphological characters, however one limits the term, taxono- mists choose for use those which they consider essential or likely to give the clearest classification or that most easy to use. The phylogenist usually weights his characters, in theory, according to accepted principles, some of which have been discussed above. Turrill (456) says: "That taxonomists often choose (abstract) the characters they use as diagnostic for their groups and give them, more or less arbitrarily, higher or lower taxonomic values has one important practical bearing which is not always recognized. Often several, equally valid, classifications can be made of the same organ- isms, entirely on morphological attributes. In all probability one of these will be more in accord with cytological, genetical, etc., classi- fications than the others". It follows that some one or other mor- phological classification is most likely to give the best basis for a general classification of the widest possible use, because morphologi- cal characters are, in general, easier to use than others. At the same time it is true that the classification of many plant groups, particularly in the angiosperms at the family level, has now been subjected to severe tests, and, as Crow (116) says, the characters used "are such as have been fo.und by long experience to give a har- monious scheme and bring together organisms which are alike, as it were, to the core. Artificial arrangements have been tried again and again, only to be abandoned because they do not give a coherent system". The great value of a classification based essentially on gross morphology is that it enables correlations of the characters studied to be easily determined. Smith (403), discussing the principal divisions of the Bromelia- ceae, the largest family of angiosperms entirely limited to the New World, into a capsular series and a baccate series, gives an excel- lent example of the way in which morphological data are frequently used to indicate phylogeny. It should be noted that his conclusion depends on acceptance of a particular view of carpel morphogenesis, on correlation of morphological and ecological-phytogeographical</page><page sequence="26">498 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW characters, and on an assumption. The systematic division of the family into a capsular and a baccate series is very widely accepted by taxonomists. In the former series the seeds are appendaged, in the latter unappendaged and the fruits have inferior ovaries. The sentences to which attention is particularly drawn are: "The mor- phological evidence indicates that the capsular series is the more primitive and gave rise to the baccate. Since carpels, sepals and petals evolved from leaves, the more they become fused the more advanced stage of development they indicate. In the capsular type the three carpels, though joined to form a compound ovary, split apart at maturity, while in the baccate they never split naturally but are irregularly ruptured by extreme age or outside agents. In the capsular type the carpels have remained distinct from the floral axis, leaving the ovary nearly or quite superior, while in the bac- cate type the carpels have fused with the inverted axis making the ovary inferior. Both these contrasts would denote the baccate series as the more advanced. The third contrasting character be- tween the two series, the presence or absence of seed-appendages, is not so easily interpreted. Other things being equal, one might reason that the appendages were an acquisition and denoted ad- vance, but in the light of the other contrasts it seems more likely that they were lost in the development of a baccate type. For with dispersal obtained through birds and animals eating the fruit, there would be no function for seed-appendages and they would tend to disappear". The entire baccate series has a more extreme develop- ment of epidermal absorptive scales. The geographical evidence supports, on the whole, the conclusion that the capsular series arose in the Andes and extending eastward gave rise to the baccate series. In the future development of morphological classification two outstanding improvements seem highly desirable. Firstly, that the morphological categories themselves be subjected to critical inves- tigation and, if it be found necessary, to drastic revision. This has been much stressed by Thomas (430, 431, 432). Saunders's theory of the polymorphism of carpels, whether accepted or not, points to the same necessity (376). Secondly, there is need for a full consideration of how far quantitative methods can be introduced advantageously into the morphological basis of taxonomy (cp. 282, 283). There seems to be considerable scope for co-operation be- tween taxonomists and biometricians. Many of the statistical meth-</page><page sequence="27">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 499 ods in vogue (145, 438, 393) are unsuited, in their existing forms, for taxonomic work, and solutions of certain important problems of a quantitative nature have apparently never been attempted by biometricians, or at least never been published. Anderson, in various publications (2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), has made noteworthy attempts, in part with colleagues, to devise diagrammatic and mathematical methods to express taxonomic differences, degrees of divergence and convergence, and probable phylogenetic rela- tionships. His methods are well worth close study, constructive criticism and further extension. Excellent discussions of correla- tion will be found in Robson (361) and Robson and Richards (362). Morphological studies have very largely been concerned with the structure of individual organs which are arbitrarily considered more or less independently from one another and from whole or- ganisms for purposes of study. In classification and in phylo- genetic studies the unity of plan of the whole soma and life-history is, however, of considerable importance. Interaction of parts is so close that modification of one must frequently involve modifications of others, or lethality (witness the almost innumerable lethal genes recorded), or at least disadvantages result. Reference may be made here to Fisher's theory of dominance (146). Hence, gen- eral unity of plan "involving homology of the different organs and systems, is a more valuable criterion of relationship than the pres- ence or absence of any individual character could be, since it is found to extend over large groups and enables large series of or- ganisms to be brought into a harmonious scheme" (116). Many of the biological facts on which the theory of holism (406a) is based are almost truisms, though the present writer feels that the explanation offered is unsatisfactory, since it seems to amount to little more than that holism is in some way caused or controlled by Holism. Natural systems for plants have been based almost entirely on morphological resemblances and differences. Usually, in phylo- genetic schemes they are expressed as ramifying or, more rarely, reticulate systems. To the extent that these schemes do or can express the facts, the whole facts and nothing but the facts, they must be accepted as showing genetic affinities, and the classifica- tion on which they are based is, to the same extent, explicable on</page><page sequence="28">500 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW evolutionary theories. It remains that historically phylogeny is based on natural classification, not classification on phylogeny. Certain modifications of this statement may be necessary for small groups of plants whose phylogeny and classification have been based on modern research not, or not entirely, of a morphological nature. Anatomical Anatomy (histology) is morphology with a compound micro- scope, but it has developed its own technique, its own outlook on general problems, and, above all, to a certain extent, its own postu- lates. It will be generally agreed that all aspects of plant structure and development must be considered in formulating a natural or a phylogenetic classification. Some anatomists claim that anatomical features are not infrequently more conservative than those of gross morphology and are therefore to that extent of greater use in trac- ing phylogeny or organogenesis. For example, vascular bundles may persist after external organs have become highly vestigial or obsolete. Vesque (468, 469) has emphasized the value of anatomy in taxonomic and phylogenetic research. Tipps (439) has given a valuable summary of the lines of evolution of stem structure, more particularly for the secondary xylem of angiosperms, as accepted by most plant anatomists. References to earlier work are given in this paper. He makes a claim which, if substantiated, is extremely important, since it may enable a break to be made in the primitive group-primitive character circle discussed above. The following are his words: "From this brief description of the methods of the anatomist, it can be seen that these lines of specialization are not based on any system of angiosperm classification, but have been formulated independent of any preconceived notion that this or that group of gymnosperms has given rise to the angiosperms; or any preconceived idea that the Ranales or the Amentiferae are primitive. Consequently any suggestions which the anatomist makes as to phylogeny will be unbiassed, and therefore of corre- spondingly greater value than would be the case were not his methods founded independent of classification." Stem anatomy points to the Magnoliales as a relatively primitive group of the angiosperms (439, 176). There is no doubt that anatomical char- acters often show an exact correlation with gross morphological and other characters and thus fit into a scheme of either logically</page><page sequence="29">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 501 natural or phylogenetic classification. Solereder (407) gives numerous examples of this. Fritsch (149) has summarized the major uses of anatomy in classification. Papers, with numerous references, by Odell (328), Edwards (139) and Chalk (83) may also be consulted. Chalk (83) notes that "the structure of wood is probably more conservative than that of the flower, and it is not surprising to find that the minor floral differences by which many species are dis- tinguished from one another are not reflected in the wood; thus the woods of different species of a genus are often indistinguish- able. Differences between genera are usually clearly defined in the wood, and where they are absent it can often be shown that the taxonomic distinction is open to question". He gives examples showing that wood anatomy can suggest improvements in classi- fication. One danger in using wood anatomy in classification is that wood usually means secondary wood, and the stressing of cri- teria derived, at least, mainly, from the secondary wood of trees and large shrubs may give results statistically biassed against her- baceous groups and the herbaceous parts of woody groups. Record (353) outlines problems of wood anatomy and empha- sizes that it is a science in a formative state. He believes that "Properly developed it will profoundly effect the orderly classifica- tion of plants, will revise paleobotany, and make clearer the lines of descent in the practical field . . . In the Thallophyta many organisms are microscopic in size and their morphology is of necessity anatomical. In the Bryophyta anatomical details occupy a large part of descriptions and have a corresponding importance in classification. In the Pteridophyta anatomy, both of the vegetative and of the reproductive organs, has an enhanced importance because of the available evidence of anatomy in fossils and of its use in ontogeny. The same is true for the Gymnospermae. A new and important line of research has been the comparative study of pollen grains of existing and fossil plants. This has par- ticularly been developed for existing plants by Wodehouse (494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499; see also 340). There seems no doubt that pollen grain characters give data as valuable for classification as spores in fungi and other plant groups. From the phylogenetic standpoint, by assuming that the pollen grain characters of gymno-</page><page sequence="30">502 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW sperms are primitive to those of angiosperms, it is possible to con- clude with Wodehouse that the one-furrowed grain is a primitive character in Saururaceae, Piperaceae, Chloranthaceae and Magno- liaceae, all of which families have been considered by various authors as primitive. The one-furrowed grain is not found in Salicaceae, Juglandaceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae and Casuarinaceae. The grains of these families show unmistakable signs of reduction and apparently trace their origin to some of the higher dicotyle- dons. Attention may be called to the interesting convergence in the development of pollinia in Orchidaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Legu- minosae (Mimosae and Acaciae) and Chlaenaceae (401). The adherence of pollen grains in tetrads is also recorded in a wide range of families and genera: Ericaceae, Epacridaceae, Juncus, Luzula, Anona, Drimys, Jussiaea, Periploca, Jacquinia, Fourcroya and Typha. Wilson (493) has considered the phylogeny of the stamen, mainly on the basis of its anatomy. Warming (478) has published an account of the systematic value of the anatomical structure and orientation of the ovule. Engler's use of ovule characters in parts of his classification is now usually considered to give an artificial result. Physiological and Biochemical Turrill (456) has pointed out that there is no valid a priori rea- son why a classification of plants should not be made entirely on physiological characters. Functions are as varied as organs and show comparable stability or plasticity. They are, however, gen- erally less easy to observe and to define precisely. "The close linkage so often obvious between form and function and the fact that subjects such as cytology, ecology, and genetics, have funda- mentally important, though often little understood, physiological aspects, must eventually lead the taxonomist to give more con- sideration to physiological attributes". Up to the present it has been biochemical rather than directly functional criteria that have been used in taxonomy. Essential oils, resins, latex, glucosides, alkaloids, etc. show in their occur- rence some degree of correlation with other characters, and their presence or absence has been used in classification. An excellent</page><page sequence="31">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 503 review of the subject is given by Molisch (308) who concludes that, while we are only at the beginning of phytochemical knowledge, the phylogenetic value of phytochemistry is already considerable. Especially can the chemistry of plant substances and their distribu- tion suggest the correctness or otherwise of phylogenetic schemes based on morphological or other criteria. He points out that a definite chemical substance may appear in a single species, in sev- eral species of the same genus, in a single genus, in several genera of one family, in an entire family, in two to many related families, in two to many unrelated families, or in large divisions of the plant kingdom. McNair has published a number of papers showing the dis- tribution of certain chemical substances in the families of flowering plants and its relation to climate (see 299 and earlier references there). Climatic conditions, presumably on the basis of natural selection, have a major influence on the distribution of plants con- taining certain substances-fats, volatile oils, alkaloids, etc. A general conclusion is, however, reached: that for the tropics, and perhaps for all climates, the more highly organized the plant the more highly organized are likely to be its chemical products. The trends suggested in McNair's tables and figures are not always very convincing, since they show very many and large irregulari- ties. The detailed work of Reichert (355) on the starches is particu- larly important, since he shows that it is possible to identify many plants by their starch grains, or, alternatively, to name the plant from which a given sample of starch grains was obtained, by utilizing a combination of characters (shape, size, markings, chemico-physical properties) of the starch grains alone. Roberts and Doyle (360) state that, in the conifers individual and habitat variations in the pH of the leaves is small (about 0.3 from the average, and often less). Seasonal changes are also small. All the conifers examined lay within the pH range of 3 to 6, but some complete families (Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, Taxa- ceae) are characterized by a narrower range. The large indefi- nite Cupressaceae, as well as the Podocarpaceae, are not so charac- terized, but the more natural affinities of most of the smaller sec- tions within them are expressed by definite pH groupings. They conclude that "there is in the conifers a very strong tendency for</page><page sequence="32">504 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW natural affinity to be expressed in similarities of metabolism which are reflected in the correspondence of the pH range of the related groups". Redfield (354) has pointed out that in zoology "Classical evolu- tionary theory is based primarily on morphological data. These data are formulated under the name of comparative anatomy; a mature body of doctrine in which the rules of the game are well established and agreed upon. . . . One of the rules of the game in comparative anatomy states that analogous structures do not count. Analogies are physiological resemblances, and it results that much of comparative physiology is ruled out a priori from the game of tracing evolutionary relationships". While phylogenists may dislike the word game in this connec-tion, the statement raises problems of general biological importance, since we know that many physiological functions are fairly directly genetically con- trolled, and that form and function are always intitnately related. The following additional paragraphs from Redfield are so relevant to our subject that they are worth quoting: "If the distribution of chemical peculiarities among the natural groups of organisms is to be given an intelligent interpretation, we must first develop some satisfactory criteria by which to judge what resemblances are sig- nificant in an evolutionary sense and what are not. We need some body of chemical doctrine, similar to that which embryology has given to the morphologists, by which to judge our findings. We must know not only what substances occur here and there, but also how they come to be where they are, from what they are made, and how their occurrence is determined". "A not unlimited number of basic configurations appear to be used repeatedly by animals and plants in forming complex mole- cules of the greatest importance. The various groups of organ- isms can be distinguished by their abilities to construct, transform, or utilize these substances". "There are certain limitations which the chemical nature of organisms places on the nature of variation (see Pantin: Jour. Linn. Soc. Zoology 37: 705. 1932). An organism can never be infinitely plastic. Its variation is limited by the variation of its chemical substances. It must occur step by step, each step as dis- crete as those which separate the species which chemists designate as different compounds". Illustrations are given which show "the</page><page sequence="33">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 505 multiplicity of the changes which must simultaneously occur in any successful evolution of function". Other relevant references are to papers by Blackman (49) on the carbohydrate production in the higher plants from the point of view of systematic relationship, and by Rosenthaler (365) on the general connections between plant biochemistry and systematics. The use in phylogenetic studies of the anatomy of traumatic (wound) structures and reactions has been much discussed (see 28, 243, and references in these). Serology has been developed in the past few decades, following advances in bacteriological technique. Reference may be made to Vigano (470) and Chester (90) for practical methods. Turrill (456) summarizes the position as follows: "In its taxonomic appli- cation this [serology] is the injection into an animal of protein or other organic material of known specific origin. The blood serum reacts to the extraneous matter and after being cleared will cause a visible reaction when added to a solution or suspension of what is chemically the same as the original or closely related material. Several methods, varying in detail, have been used (precipitation, agglutination, anaphylaxis, complement-fixation). For taxonomic and phylogenetic studies in plants the precipitation and agglutina- tion methods have been chiefly employed, proteins obtained from seeds being the injected material. Serum from an animal into whose blood protein from a given plant A has been injected is added to a solution or suspension of material from a plant B. The degree of precipitation or agglutination is taken as a degree of relationship between A and B. . . . That serological characters must be considered in future taxonomy is certain and improve- ments in methods and in presentation of results are likely to make serum-diagnosis more useful than it has been up to the present.... Recognizing that serum-diagnosis can yield characters which may be used in classification there remains to consider whether such characters are of any greater value for phylogenetic theories than other, for example, morphological, characters. Moritz (312) has urged that a high diagnostic value must be given to proteins on account of their occurrence in all organisms and of the structural complication of the protein molecule. This last, he thinks, makes convergence improbable, and, therefore, the theory of parallelism of serological activity and physiological significance can not be</page><page sequence="34">506 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW assumed. Whether improved biochemical technique and direct determination of the proteins will not eventually replace the in- direct determination of protein relationship, it is difficult to say. Logically, in spite of Moritz's contentions, it seems difficult to give protein characters any higher taxonomic value than other charac- ters which may, after all, be considered as manifestations of proto- plasmic (genic) activity". Chester et al. (91) have shown, on the other hand, that the same reactive substance (to the precipita- tion test) may occur in very distantly related families, though they maintain that within such limitations its applicability is consider- able. Boyden (62) notes that there are two great principles which apply to the comparison of the relative intensities of serological reactions: "1. An antiserum will react more strongly with the particular antigen used in its formation (homologous reaction) than with equivalent amounts of other substances (heterologous reactions). 2. The intensity of reaction between an antiserum and various antigens is proportional to the chemical similarity of the antigens tested". He points out that the results of serological tests are measures of the chemical similarity of the serologically active constituents of the sera of the animals compared and, there- fore, literally indicate "blood-relationships". Chester (90) furnishes a valuable critical summary of phyto- serology to 1937, with a list of literature of 392 items. He is de- cidedly favourable to the Konigsberg (Mez) school in their claims as against the Berlin-Dahlem (Gilg and Schiirhoff) school. He claims that the great advantages of the method are its sensitivity, its specificity and its objective character. He points out that the relationship reactions are "the summation of many or few identity reactions with the antigenic units in the protein complex of a plant extract". The claim that the reactions are to the proteins of the chromatin would appear to be difficult to prove. Boyden (61, 63), for animals, has strongly urged the value of serology. He says: "In recent years evidence has accumulated that such parts of the biochemic constitution as are best revealed by the precipitin reaction appear to have unusual values in syste- matic zoology. Thus, with an accurate and suitable method, the intensity of the interaction between antisera and antigens, such as serum proteins, parallels the systematic position of the species</page><page sequence="35">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 507 where that is well known. The facts indicate that the serological natures of animals are such that serum proteins must be conserva- tively inherited and hence these data should rightly complement our morphological comparisons". There is no need to enter here into various controversies that have arisen in connection with the application of serological data to phylogeny. Some of these are considered by Chester (90). Improved methods of technique have met some of these objections (60, 61, 90). On the other hand, a desire to construct a com- pleted phylogenetic tree has outrun the validity of the data in such a diagram as the "Sero-diagnostischer (Konigsberger) Stamm- baum des Pflanzenreiches, 1924", in which even extinct groups known only from their fossil remains are given place! The fol- lowing references will enable the student to trace most of the im- portant literature on phytoserology: (16, 29, 31, 40, 48, 88, 89, 90, 160, 161, 249, 251, 267, 285, 302-305, 311, 313, 371, 481, 485, 490, 491, 503-505). The choice of host plants by parasites is in part determined by the chemical constitution of the host. Thus, many animal para- sites choose plants with similar chemical characters-mustard oil glucosides, HCN glucosides, alkaloids, organic acids (especially oxalic), salts, etc. In correlation we find insect larvae which, when free to choose, limit themselves to one plant family or to such families as have similar chemical substances. Thus, Lirio- myza cruciferarum and Ceuthorrhynchus contractus generally live on the Cruciferae but are also found on related families and on Tropaeolaceae. Pegomyia bicolor occurs on Polygonaceae and Begoniaceae, families which are rich in oxalates, and Agromnyza reptans on Urticaceae and Loasaceae with stinging hairs (72). The important problems of biologic races in different plant and animal groups have received considerable attention. The litera- ture may be largely traced through the following papers and the references given in them: for bacteria (488), for fungi (66), for seed-bearing plants (450), for nematodes (168), for insects (435). It is clear from the examples and discussions in these papers that biological races play an important part in micro-evolution, and since they probably mostly have a distinct genetic basis, give first- class material for the action of natural selection, and strongly influ- ence the ecological and geographical distribution of the organisms</page><page sequence="36">508 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW concerned. Moreover, since they are amenable to experiment they should yield valuable data for the study of paramorphic phylog- eny (paramorph = any taxonomic group within a species). Palaeontological As we have seen, it is usually not difficult to arrange living organ- isms in series in such a manner that differences in the structure of one or more organs appear as graded steps. Such series are fre- quently interpreted as phylogenetic or, if the study be concerned with only one organ, as morphogenetic or organogenetic. When the evidence is carefully stated and fully established, evolution may well be the most rational explanation of such series. The great diversity of opinion in published accounts of plant phylogeny sug- gests, hQwever, that the available data are still too few for the con- struction of a valid general phylogenetic scheme-apart from diffi- culties i-herent in the presentation of phylogenetic data and those inherent in the application of such data to classification. There is no doubt that the paucity of relevant palaeobotanical data in most groups of plants (partial exceptions are the Pteridophyta and Gymnospermae) is a major cause of uncertainty as to whether or not proposed series are phylogenetic, and, if they be, in which direc- tion they should be read. Sufficient fossil evidence of the right kind gives a time sequence. To attempt phylogeny without it would be equivalent to an historian attempting to trace the historical develop- ment of, say, the British Constitution from its existing forms alone, from its complexities, traditions, absurdities, and, one must add, pragmatic strength, in the total absence of documents. The first thing in historical research is to obtain contemporary evidence. The first thing in phylogenetic research should be to obtain evidence from fossils. Palaeontological sequence alone does not, however, give a phylogenetic series, since, as Crow (115) has pointed out, mere sequence in the strata of successive geological periods does not prove or even necessarily indicate relationship. He adds: "in fact relationship of fossil organisms to one another must first be traced in exactly the same manner as that of living forms, and any argu- ments as to their relationships based on their stratigraphical ar- rangement are entirely secondary. They may confirm morphologi- cal data, but can never replace them. It is possible too that a living form may more closely represent the ancestral form of another liv-</page><page sequence="37">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 509 ing species, or even of a fossil form, than any fossil species yet dis- covered". While this may be true, apart from some exaggeration in the use of the words "entirely secondary", it does not reduce the great importance of stratigraphical facts. A concise summary of the palaeontological evidence for evolution and examples of its use in constructing phylogenetic schemes is given in Newman (321). Davies (126) presents a clear picture of both the strength and the limitations of palaeontological data on the zoological side. Since in certain groups of animals fossil evidence is relatively abundant and has been very carefully studied, it is useful to the botanist to know what general conclusions have been reached by palaeozoologists. Waddington (474) points out that there are two classes of evidence: "On the one hand, we can describe the general outline of the course of evolutionary change in a large number of organisms, in some cases even in a whole phylum. We are then dealing with phenomena which last throughout many geological periods, probably through times of the order of some millions of years. On the other hand, we have data as to the gradual altera- tion of one species or small group of species, a process which usually takes place within one of the more recent geological periods, over a period of a few million years. . . . On the large scale, whole orders and phyla seem to pass through an orderly series of changes which have been described as 'programme evolution'; while on the small scale it has been shown that a group of 'species' may evolve progressively along a certain line of change which has been called a 'trend'. 'Programme evolution' is particularly exemplified in the ammonites and graptolites. In the plant kingdom the nearest known approach is probably to be found in the ferns. In dealing with smaller scale evolution we meet with the concept of lineages". It is not intended to give a full account of the uses and concep- tions of the term lineage, as used by palaeontologists, since its use has been almost confined to palaeozoology; indeed, its application is possible only in such groups as can be studied as fossils in strati- graphically continuous series with abundance of specimens. Whole phyla of animals are completely excluded from its application be- cause of the absence of such material, and there are no plant groups that have yet been studied with any approximation to the details recorded for such groups as ammonites and oysters. Nevertheless, the lineage concept is of very great importance in any general con-</page><page sequence="38">510 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW sideration of phylogeny and taxonomy. A valuable, critical and thoughtful consideration of the problems involved is given by Swinnerton (420), and it will be of value here briefly to paraphrase and abstract some of his points. References to literature given at the end of Swinnerton's paper will enable the student to follow the subject further if he so desires. Swinnerton notes that "in ordinary language the word 'lineage' is used in one or other of two senses. It is sometimes used in the narrow sense of our history books for the line of descent of more or less notable people and, along with other similar lines, is erected into a genealogical tree. In its broadest sense it relates to the de- scent of a whole race". Davies (126) defines a lineage as "a series of genera and species which form an evolutionary series, each one being ancestral to its successor in the geological sequence". The broader and narrower views are not always clearly differentiated. Lineages represented by palaeontologists as single lines, as in Spirifer orestes L., have been shown to have the structure of a "bifurcating branching system in which each section or line repre- sents a separate line of descent". Trueman, after indicating the complexity of the internal constitution of a succession of communi- ties, gentes or species groups, says: "In fact, the 'lineage' is rather a bundle of lines, or more correctly, a plexus of lines which repeat- edly branch and reunite. In such a lineage there is a definite trend in the progressive characters, but also considerable variation in those characters at each horizon". Arkell (1935) says: "It is nearer the truth to say that the Perisphinctes of the Corallian form a plexus, the strands intimately linked and irretrievably tangled". After giving other similar examples of a band of anastomosing lines or a reticulation, Swinnerton rightly says that "for further light upon the structure of the plexus we must turn to the results of genetic experimentation". In free mating between bisexual organ- isms, and with the occasional appearance of mutations, a complex network can alone illustrate the distribution of characters from generation to generation. On the other hand, "the recurrence of the same morphological species over a long range of time points to the constancy of the communal heritage for that period of time". Progenitors of the later members of a series of form species are to be sought not in the earlier members of that series but in the community as a whole to</page><page sequence="39">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 511 which they belong. Successive mutations, in rates of growth, in unit characters or in size, may lead to a progressive development of some one feature which was already present in the ancestral com- munity in an incipient condition. The total result is "a gradual change in the constitution of the plexus, which is reflected in a corresponding change in the character of the community as a whole, a character which is dependent not merely upon the range of varia- tion of unit characters, or rates of growth in serial characters, but also upon the proportional distribution of these in the population as a whole". It is clear that the more microscopically such a concept as lineage is examined, the more it is found to be a diagrammatic simplifica- tion of actual facts. To this extent it may be misleading unless the plexus of anastomoses be somehow indicated in place of lines. Trueman (446) has reached very similar conclusions from a study of certain lamellibranchs and gastropods in which he showed that there is considerable variation in any series collected at one horizon. "At each horizon variation appears to be continuous, and the char- acters, on the whole, vary independently. Each community is apparently homogeneous and indivisible. It is suggested that such evolving stock must be regarded as a plexus or bundle of anastomos- ing lineages". Swinnerton (418) discusses the terms lineage, gens and plexus, which, with variable but not great differences in connotation, have been used to designate evolving community series of fossils. He attempts to link up, largely through the work of Huxley and Ford on growth rates in Gamnmarus, etc., the findings of palaeontologists with the results of genetical experiments. Bather (33) stated that "the whole of our system, from the great phyla to the very unit cells, is riddled through and through with polyphyly and conver- gence". He concluded that "important though phylogeny is as a subject of study, it is not necessarily the most suitable basis of classi- fication. For three reasons: the first, that the more complete the phylogenetic tree, the further must it depart from a classification based originally on different principles; the second, that the more refined our analysis becomes, the greater is the difficulty of repre- senting its results in any classificatory scheme at all; the third, that although the source of the raw material may, philosophically consid- ered, be a more important field of enquiry than the processes by</page><page sequence="40">512 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW which it is elaborated into the varied forms we know, still a classi- fication which obscures the qualities of the goods as delivered loses thereby in practical value". Calman (75) considers Bather has exaggerated the all-pervading occurrence of convergence; neverthe- less, he himself gives striking examples of it. He contends that a natural system does exist, and for it "no scientific explanation other than that offered by community of descent has ever been given". Woodward (500) has pointed out that our increasing utilization in classification of "extinct animals makes the use of the Linnean method of classification very difficult. . . . We can only make sat- isfactory classifications when fossils enable us to trace the ancestors of the various groups through a series of geological epochs. In- stead of classes, orders, families, and genera, we are concerned with phyla, lineages, branches, and grades; and we soon discover that related lineages pass through the same orderly succession of changes by which the same-or nearly the same-result is eventually at- tained. This means that when we are dealing only with existing animals or the associated animals of any single geological period, the families and genera, at least, which we establish consist of mem- bers that are not so closely related as they seem to be. They are merely the end shoots of a series of parallel lineages which have reached the same grade of development". He cites striking exam- ples of parallel development in the lineages of various groups of animals, invertebrate and vertebrate and even among the highest vertebrates. An example of a concentrated effort to trace the evolution of a definite group, mainly by the use of palaeontological and distribu- tional data, is provided by Macfarlane's work on the fishes (280). Arkell and Moy-Thomas (236) have pointed out that "palaeon- tological classification, like all classification, must primarily be use- ful. It should provide a practical means by which fossils can be identified and compared". Classification has, however, come to have the dual aim of providing an easy means of recognizing fossils and of giving a summary of existing knowledge of phylogeny. "It is part of the palaeontologist's business to unravel phylogeny by the study of fossils; but he can only arrive at an approximation to the truth, for he has only a fraction of the material to work on, the hard parts which alone have been preserved by fossilization. At the best of times his results are hypothetical and more or less subjec-</page><page sequence="41">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 513 tive, and it may be questioned whether such results form a suitable foundation on which to build a classification and a nomenclature. . . . The major problems of palaeontological taxonomy may be summarized by saying that a phylogenetic and a practical classifi- cation are frequently incompatible, and that lack of uniformity in scale and unity of purpose introduce further confusions". An in- teresting difficulty is illustrated by the ammonites: "a number of lineages of ammonoidea can be traced up through the Devonian rocks, all undergoing more or less parallel evolution. They may be classified in two ways: either 'vertically', making the genera cor- respond with the lineages, along which the successive forms are marked by parallel species, or 'horizontally', making the genera cor- respond with successive grades irrespective of the lineages". The chief objection to the 'vertical' system is the uncertainty of recog- nizing true lineages. "Since palaeontological classification is in- tended to be practical, no useful purpose is served by complicating it with detailed phylogenies, which are often of little interest save for demonstrating convergence". The authors make a strong plea to palaeontologists to avoid upsetting established nomenclature. Returning to plants, we find that fossil evidence is meagre, except in the Pteridophyta and Gymnospermae, in so far as it is relevant to phylogenetic problems. In the realm of micro-evolution we have no evidence of lineages at all comparable to that in such animal groups as the graptolites, ammonites or oysters, or even such rela- tively continuous series as those for the horses or elephants. The nearest approach to a plant lineage is found in the work of Chandler (86) on Stratiotes. This, however, is based only on a series of fruits, and the characters employed are thus limited to one organ. On a larger evolutionary scale the series of fossil ferns and espe- cially their stem anatomy may be mentioned. Again, it seems cer- tain that the Gymnospermae preceded the Angiospermae very con- siderably, even on a geological time-scale. It is, therefore, to this extent palaeobotanically sound to suppose that the latter may have arisen from some group or groups of the former. It is, perhaps, of considerable significance that some of those who have specialized in palaeobotany are most critical of its value in reconstructing phylogenies with the data available at present. Thus, Scott (386) says: "Like Dr. Lotsy, I have become sceptical of late as to most phylogenetic reconstructions, but one need not go</page><page sequence="42">514 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW so far as he does; in 'dim outline', at all events, we may still hope to catch glimpses of the course of evolution". Thomas (433, 434) concludes that what palaeobotanical evidence is available is com- pletely at variance with the more or less widely accepted views as to the origin of the Angiospermae. Excellent general summaries, with numerous references and judicious conclusions and inconclu- sions, of what is known regarding the history of plants are provided by Seward (390) and by Darrah (124). The origin of the Angiospermae remains a matter of speculation in the absence of any fossils connecting them with another group or with other groups. The following palaeobotanical facts indicate the main available data under our present heading. The oldest known fossil evidence for Angiospermae is in the form of pollen from Jurassic rocks, (394, 395) determined as belonging to Nym- phaeaceae, Magnoliaceae and ( ?) Juglandaceae. No other re- mains of Angiospermae have been recorded from rocks older than the Lower Cretaceous. The Caytoniales (428, 201) were appar- ently, at least in part, angiospermous, but they can not be classed with any of the modern Angiospermae. Stopes (413) has de- scribed petrifactions from England of stems of Aptian (Lower Greensand) age: Aptiana radiata, "in every detail like one or other of the modern, highly specialized types of Angiosperms"; Woburnia porosa, the structure "points to a Dipterocarpacean affinity"; and Sabulia Scottii, with wood characteristic of the higher dicotyledons. Other genera of dicotyledons of Aptian age, but of uncertain affini- ties, have also been described by Stopes (414). Seward (389) was not able exactly to correlate the Cretaceous series in Greenland with those of western Europe, but the fossil flora agrees most closely with the Lower Cretaceous floras of Europe and North America and with floras of the Old and New Worlds which are usually regarded as Cenomanian in age, and is probably to be re- garded as equivalent to Neocomian-Cenomanian or -Turonian. He recognizes the following families as occurring in these rocks: Palmae, Liliaceae (?), Fagaceae, Moraceae, Menispermaceae, Mag- noliaceae, Lauraceae, Platanaceae and Leguminosae. Stopes and Fuji (415), from Cretaceous rocks of Hokkaido, Japan, describe a monocotyledon and five dicotyledons (four Monochlamydeae and one Dialypetalae). The specimens are placed in or near Saurura- ceae, Juglans, Populus, Fagus, Sabia and Liliaceae. The published</page><page sequence="43">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 515 accounts of the Cretaceous floras of Portugal, North America and other parts of the world are too numerous to summarize here. While the taxonomist may doubt some of the identifications, they tell a story essentially similar to those recorded above: that by Cre- taceous times numerous families of monocotyledons and dicotyle- dons were already in existence. Archichlamydeae of a woody habit predominate as determinable fossils. This may be an accident of preservation, and the negative evidence of scarcity of herbaceous types must not be stressed. There remain important facts of the absence of any plant recognizably more primitive than known exist- ing families and the relative wealth of morphological structure (vegetative, floral, fruit and seed) of the families represented in Cretaceous, and even Lower Cretaceous, strata. It would appear either that the main development of the angiosperms was long pre- Cretaceous or that their diversification at about the family level took place almost immediately and suddenly after their first appearance and possibly as a result of their mode of origin. The researches of C. and E. M. Reid, Chandler, Bandulska and others throw much light on the history of Cainozoid floras, but their value for taxonomy and phylogeny concerns details rather than general schemes and principles or origins of major groups. Darrah (124), after summarizing the palaeobotanical evidence available for a study of the phylogeny of the plant kingdom, lists, on a morphological basis, a number of "fundamental inventions or developments in the history of the tracheophytes" (vascular plants). This list is well worth quoting, since it epitomizes the more impor- tant of the generalized problems which have interested palaeo- botanists and others in recent years: "1. The invasion of land by an undifferentiated thalloid plant (not later than Silurian). "2. The simple upright undifferentiated and protostelic axis (apparently Silurian). "3. Enlargement of the plant body with specializations towards a division of labor-sterile and fertile (apparently late Silurian). "4. Origin of the photosynthetic leaf (Devonian). "5. Specializations in the service of support, with the resultant secondary body (Devonian). "6. Development of the strobilus (Devonian). "7. The development of heterospory (upper Devonian if not earlier).</page><page sequence="44">516 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW "8. Retention of the gametophyte within the megaspore, within the megasporangium, where fertilization takes place, with the ulti- mate attainment of (a difference only in degree) the seed (probably upper Devonian). "9. The evolution of the pollen-grain. The same tendency as the retention of the megagametophyte (Carboniferous, if not earlier). "10. Evolution of the bisporangiate flower (Triassic). "11. Attainment of the condition of angiospermy (Jurassic or Triassic). "12. Evolution of the herbaceous habit (Cretaceous, but chiefly Cenozoic) ". Cytological Cytology is now-a-days regarded very largely as the study of the mechanism of heredity and variation. That it is already extending into biochemistry and biophysics is merely another example of breakdown in the artificial stratification of science, indeed, of knowl- edge as a whole. To say that cell, and particularly chromosome, structure and behaviour are essential in the study of heredity and evolution and therefore in the study of taxonomy and phylogeny, is in no way to detract from the importance of other lines of re- search bearing on the same subjects. Much nonsense has been written regarding the supposed exclusive or predominant value of single viewpoints, in both science and philosophy. Cytology is no more ultimate than, say, taxonomy or ecology. Nevertheless, cytol- ogy has a present prominent position in biology, firstly because of great recent advances in our knowledge, particularly of karyology, and secondly because it has become closely linked with genetics, whence the use of the term cytogenetics. Schurhoff (384), Darlington (121), Sharp (392) and White (487) have, amongst others, given us learned text-books which are not always written so that a non-specialist can understand them. The writer believes that cytologists and taxonomists must co-operate with reciprocal advantage in the future much more than they have in the past if the maximum possible advance is to be made in biology. Some of the more general relationships which must be developed between taxonomists and cytologists have been stated by Turrill (456). Here we must be limited to a few references to recent studies and aspects selected from the enormous number available.</page><page sequence="45">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 517 The number, structure and behaviour of chromosomes give char- acters which, in general, are constant or referable to a constant common plan for a species or other taxonomic group. When used in classification, other than a special classification, such characters must be evaluated with other characters, morphological, genetical, etc. Anderson (7) has reviewed the relationships between cytol- ogy and taxonomy. Smith's work on Anchusa (404) is an excel- lent illustration of the reciprocal support given to conclusions reached by taxonomic and cytological research, respectively. Cyto- logical data have, at present, special taxonomic and phylogenetic value at or about the species level in determining origin by poly- ploidy, hybridization, etc. Thus, the hybrid origin of Spartinia Townsendii (228), Galeopsis Tetrahit (315, 316) and certain species of Rubus (367), Antirrhinum (35) and Salix (324, 325, 326, 327) has been cytologically and/or genetically established, at least in so far as a species is determined by morphological and cyto- genetical characters. In certain genera, and larger groups too, the cytology of large numbers of species is so uniform as to be of little or no help in taxonomic differentiation. This is true, for example, in the genus Rhododendron (378). At the other extreme in the genus Carex (475, 209, 210) the species show little or no karyo- logical resemblance from one to another, at least in chromosome number. Wahl (475) found "The haploid numbers form an aneuploid series ranging from 13 to 56. A comparison of all the known chromosome numbers in the genus indicates the aneuploid series may be secondarily derived from euploid series with differ- ent basic numbers, of which 7 is probably most often represented". The taxonomy and cytology of Primula have been correlated, as far as possible, in the work of Bruun (71) and Wright Smith (405). To a great extent cytological data confirm the taxonomic results in this genus. Average size of the chromosomes was found to be the most constant character, and mere numbers may be misleading for phyletic purposes. The broad cytological data lhave imiore value as sectional characters than for the alignment of closely related species. The cytological work on Rosa by Tackholm (421) and others, on Triticum as summarized by Watkins (479), oni Cruciferae by Manton (287) and on Crepis by Babcock anid others (26, 27) further serves to illustrate the increasing linkages between taxon- omy and cytology.</page><page sequence="46">518 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW Connections between cytological research, phytogeography, ecol- ogy and taxonomy at or below the species level are well illustrated by Manton's work on Biscutella (288) and Hagerup's (182, 183, 186), Tischler's (440, 441, 442), Rohweder's (363) and Fischer and Schwanitz's (144) studies on polyploidy in various floras and ecological groups. Bowden's researches (52), however, in contrast to those of Hagerup and Tischler and his colleagues, "do not sup- port the theory that polyploids are usually hardier than diploids and are therefore better adapted to climatically unfavourable re- gions". Stebbins (411) concluded for dicotyledons that "Gross changes in the chromosomes have been more significant in produc- ing new types of growth habit than in differentiating new families and orders". Difficulties are bound to arise in attempts to co-ordinate results in two disciplines so different from one another as cytology and orthodox taxonomy. Thus, the taxonomist has perforce to take more criteria into account than the cytogeneticist in his delimitation of species. The taxonomic status of polyploids and of apomicts awaits stabilization, though, perhaps, this should not be attempted in any rigid manner till further data are available from a wide range of lines of research. Definitions of such oft-used terms as hybrid, affinity and environment frequently differ from author to author and lead to ambiguities. Other difficulties are inherent in the material. Darlington (122) gives examples showing that genetic systems can change while external forms remain the same. The cytologist has thus to make distinctions which are entirely beyond the scope of the taxonomist. Fairly considerable numbers of taxonomic species have different chromosome numbers in different individuals (408). The increasing number of known examples of plastid and cyto- plasmic mechanisms influencing inheritance adds complications which will afford problems to both the taxonomist and the cytologist. As contrasted with genetics, it might be expected that cytology would give help in elucidating problems of taxonomy and phylogeny much above the species level. Sufficient cytological data are, how- ever, available at present in only a few groups for detecting possible phylogenies above the genus level. Such data are increasing rap- idly, and a valid general survey for the angiosperms may not have to wait many decades. The great wealth of tropical floras has, how- ever, been scarcely touched cytologically, and till investigations on</page><page sequence="47">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 519 a fair proportion of tropical species have been made, general con- clusions may be dangerous because they would depend on data with a phytogeographical bias. The uniformity of gymnosperm cytology (377) and the cytological relationship of the Pomoideae to the rest of the Rosaceae, with a probable hybrid origin of the whole group followed by secondary polyploidy (123, 307, 379), are examples of facts and conclusions of use in taxonomy and phylogeny which may be expected in increasing number and scope. Anderson (4) has suggested from cytological data that the Magnoliales may have originated from wide crosses between different groups of Gymno- sperms. Genetical Genetics, essentially an experimental subject, has its greatest importance for taxonomy and phylogeny at about the species level. Turrill (456) gives records of a number of wide crosses and sug- gests that wide crosses on a large scale might be attempted under diverse conditions. That an F1 might arise and by chromosome doubling give rise to a fertile allotetraploid, even from parents taxonomically very diverse, is always a possibility that might give startlingly interesting results. The continued distinctness of groups designated as species by the taxonomist depends on intraspecific inbreeding and interspe- cific isolation. There are many kinds, causes and degrees of isola- tion resulting in lack of uniformity in the taxonomic concept of plant species. The zoologists have, in theory but not always in practice, emphasized intersterility of groups as the most important specific criterion. Cytogeneticists tend to follow this zoological lead. The botanist knows that for plants stuch a criterion used primarily would lead to a special classification of little or no gen- eral use. This, of course, in no way detracts from the importance of genetically controlled sterility as a cause of isolation of many species, one from another. Such sterility may be absolute and must in time be followed by divergence or increased divergence. An excellent example within one genus aind a linmited geographical area of the taxonomic importance of sterility dtue to cytogenetic causes is furnished by the British knapweeds (290, 293). Cen- taurea nigra, C. nemoralis and C. Jacea hybridize freely wherever they grow together, producing complex hybrid swarms, some of whose members have been described as distinct species. C. Sca-</page><page sequence="48">520 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW biosa is frequently found growing with one or more of these spe- cies and often in the midst of the hybrid swarms, but it always remains distinct, and no hybrids have been observed by the authors in very extensive and intensive field investigations or made by them in reciprocal matings in controlled experiments. Danser (119, 120) has proposed a taxonomic scheme, with the introduction of new categorical terms, based essentially on sterility- fertility criteria. A cornpariumn is the sum total of individuals which can be combined directly or indirectly by crossing; a corn- niscuumn is the sum total of individuals which can be combined di- rectly or indirectly by mixture, i.e., by crossing, which results in the production of fertile hybrids; a convivium is, within a com- miscuum, a group of individuals which can be distinguished from other groups by more or less sharp characters and which is main- tained in some degree of isolation by conditions other than cross sterility (ecological, phytogeographical). Turrill (456) has criti- cized this scheme from the standpoint of its possibly replacing the normal taxonomic procedure. Danser's ideas, however, will have to be taken into consideration when the time comes for the con- struction of a more generally useful taxonomy than has yet been published. Clausen (102), after quoting a series of examples, has well summed up the value of crossing as a criterion of phylogeny as fol- lows: "Crossing possibilities do not necessarily imply phylogenetic relationship but probably only a certain kind of genic affinity; the morphological relationship dealt with in taxonomy is probably for the main part contingent upon genic conformity, not always on a joint phylogenic development". Sax (381) also shows that it is wrong to assume that the degree of chromosome pairing in species or generic hybrids "can be used as an index of chromosome homol- ogy and species relationships". Anderson (8, 9) has shown that there are at least four hindrances to character combinations in F2 populations from crosses. These are imposed by gametic elimination, zygotic elimination, pleio- tropism (especially spurious pleiotropism) and linkage. Since there is increasing evidence that hybridization has played a very important part in the evolution of plants, and consequently must be considered in phylogenetic theories and schemes, limitations to its effects and any means by which discontinuities can be pro-</page><page sequence="49">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 521 duced in hybrid populations must concern the taxonomist and the phylogenist. Correlation of characters used in taxonomy is given considerable weight both in classification and in phylogenetic theory. Cyto- genetics can establish the degree and sometimes the cause of such correlationi. For the gall-wasps (Cynips), Kinsey (245, 246) has made an attempt to correlate a taxonomic study with the data of genetics. He believes "species to be realities which are large popu- lations representing interbreeding Mendelian races having access to a common stock of genes". Further, "It has been one of the major contributions of genetics to show that similarity is not wholly safe as a criterion for its recognition of relationship. . . . It is only when phylogenetic interpretations are based upon a variety of morphologic, physiologic and distributional data that true rela- tionship in such instances becomes evident." There appears to be no generally applicable genetic criteria by means of which alone characters can be evaluated as of varietal, specific or generic value. In Silene, Marsden-Jones and Turrill (289), and in Malva, Kristofferson (250) have definitely reached this conclusion. Matsuura (296) quotes numerous crosses be- tween two distinct taxonomic species which behave genetically in the same manner as varietal crosses. At the same time, as Mat- suura says, genetic "analysis of the specific characters offers biol- ogists a basis for a much clearer understanding of the fundamental constitution of the species and of the nature of the limits of taxo- nomic groups". In Viola and in Gossypium interspecific crosses reveal some minor differences in genetical behaviour from that in intraspecific ones. Thus, Harland (197, 198, 199, 200) explains that in certain cottons varietal crosses show segregation of modi- fiers which may partially or entirely obscure the distinction between dominant and recessive characters. Anderson (6) raises a number of important questions on this subject without supplying answers to them. He does, however, make the statement "that changes in emphasis are of specific rank, while differentiation separates categories higher than species". Epling (141a) points out that it is difficult to distinguish between changes of emphasis and differentiation, and finds, contrary to Anderson for Aquilegia, Narcissus, etc., that "in Labiatae the cate- gories higher than species are characterized, just as the species</page><page sequence="50">522 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW themselves, not by a change in pattern necessarily, but by different combinations of changes in emphasis. Such combinations in real- ity produce new patterns". Blakeslee, Murray and Satina (51) show that in the genus Da- tura crossability fails to run parallel with taxonomic relationships, as established by sections in the genus, and crossability may be different in reciprocal matings. Dobzhansky (132) deals with many of the problems in which genetics throws light on the origin and nature of species. It is, however, doubtful whether some of his conclusions can apply so widely in the plant kingdom as to make them valid biologically. This is particularly true of his conception of a species. What the plant taxonomist considers with full justification as good spe- cies-what for general botanical purposes he must accept as spe- cies-are often not nearly such discrete units genetically or cyto- genetically as postulated by Dobzhansky and other zoologists for animals. The view that species must be physiologically incapable of breeding one with another to produce fertile offspring can not be maintained in practice in plants to give a generally useful classi- fication. It could be maintained consistently to give a special classi- fication, possibly with interesting results, but these would be of limited use. Parallel variations are known in many groups of plants and ani- mals and led Vaviloff (462) to enunciate his well known "law of homologous series in variation". Matsuura (296) has, however, pointed out that up to 1935 for no group has "the genotypic identity of parallel variations in different plant species been demonstrated in the exact sense". He shows that what he calls "the method of diallel crossing" is the only way with certainty "to disclose geno- typic differences, if any, between the parental species, even though they are phenotypically alike", and "at the same time to discover genotypic identity between them even though they are phenotypi- cally dissimilar". The method consists in comparing the results from all possible combinations within and between two species for the pairs of dominant-recessive characters studied. He gives, how- ever, numerous examples of probable genetic parallelisms within a genus and within a family and concludes that a high degree of germinal composition and organization in common may be deduced on the occurrence of genotypic parallel variations. Further, he</page><page sequence="51">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 523 argues that taxonormic categories are only conventional and all characters, specific, generic, or family, "compose each and every species, and all should be alike in their genetical behaviors. The distinction between them is merely dependent upon the degree or extent of characters which the organisms have in common". As with cytology, so with genetics, the genetical species or other group does not necessarily coincide with the taxonomic. Raun- kiaer (350) implies this when he points out that genetics evaluates the individual by its offspring, systematics by what it is itself. With the necessary extensions the idea is applicable to all groups. Systematic units rest not on the genealogical principle but on the similarity principle. Phylogeny is not absolutely necessary for systematics, but systematics is for phylogeny. This is no doubt true, but one can add that genetics, or better, cytogenetics, is also essential for a proper understanding of phylogeny and for the establishment of valid phylogenetic schemes. The relationship between ordinary taxonomy and experimental taxonomy has been discussed recently by Turrill (236, 454). The valuable researches by Clausen and his colleagues in America (106) also deserve the close attention of taxonomists and phylog- enists. There is no doubt that experiments are essential before the taxonomy of many groups at or about the species level can be made most useful by being developed on a sound basis and before their probable phylogeny can be profitably discussed. A knowl- edge of genetic relationships is more basic than a knowledge of phylogenetic relationships. Genes may be aggregated in one indi- vidual or taxonomic group from many ultimate sources which can be traced only after prolonged investigation and detailed genetical analysis. The taxonomic value of genetics is so great, its methods and out- look are of such educative value to the taxonomist, that it would be advantageous for every taxonomist to have a training in genetics. The converse is also true and every geneticist should have a train- ing in taxonomy. Turrill (455, 458) outlines desirable relation- ships between taxonomy and cytogenetics with suggestions of prob- lems needing co-operative research. Clausen (103) also has cor- rectly urged the need for closer co-operation between genetics, taxonomy and field-studies. Thus, he says: "As long as genetics is concerned with the individual genes only, it makes no difference</page><page sequence="52">524 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW which type of material [wild or cultivated] is utilized. But genetics of our days is going further, trying to apply'its findings toward a revision of our conception of living organisms, their diversity and mutual relation as well as the origin of this diversity. This demands a closer contact with the living organisms in natural surroundings. Only to a very limited degree have geneticists studied the genetic interrelations of taxonomic units that are the immediate products of evolution as they invitingly offer themselves under such conditions". Clausen's own work with Viola (100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105) and Marsden-Jones and Turrill's work with Silene (289), Centaurea and other plants (290) illustrate the new line of attacking micro-evolutionary and micro-phylogenetic problems. Marsden-Jones, Summerhayes and Turrill (294) dis- cuss the need for the introduction of certain taxonomic methods into cytogenetical and ecological research. They ask especially for greater care in specific and varietal determinations and for the preservation of samples of the materials studied. The tremendous practical use of combined taxonomic-genetical- ecological studies can scarcely be better illustrated than by' the recent work on malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Anopheles maculi- pennis has been shown to be not a homogeneous species but a group of at least six widespread varieties which morphologically differ in little but egg type. In physiological characters there are profound differences between them in mode of hibernation, sexual behaviour and even host preferences. Preliminary breeding work showed sterility, complete or partial, between one of the varieties, atro- parvus, and the other five, messeae, elutus, typicus, melanoon, labrachiae. Other breeding experiments were unsuccessful. Two or more "varieties" often occur together in the same area. It would appear that sterility mutations have preceded morphological dif- ferentiation and geographical isolation. The existing diagnosis and classification of species in Anopheles by taxonomists is inade- quate, and, as Hackett (180) says, "The epidemiologist therefore is inclined to follow the geneticist, for to him behaviour is every- thing and morphology is only a tool". Ontogenetical Recapitulation, the dictum that ontogeny repeats phylogeny, has been much used by zoologists. A useful concise summary of re-</page><page sequence="53">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 525 capitulation, followed by a critique, will be found in Newman (321). The supposedly simple and straightforward comparisons made by the earlier phylogenists between phylogeny and ontogeny have not, on the whole, stood the test of more recent research. Such research, with references, has been ably summariied by de Beer in a number of easily accessible books (36, 37, 236), and it is not necessary to give details here. Nevertheless, some of his conclusions have a wide biological applicability, and quotation of some of them may direct the attention of botanists to a branch of study which has been somewhat neglected on the plant side in recent years. De Beer reaches the following conclusions relevant to our sub- ject: "Ontogeny is the result of the action of external factors in evoking responses from the internal factors of an animal to which the latter were transmitted by inheritance from its parents. Phylogeny is provisionally to be regarded as a series of adult forms, which are disconnected and causally unrelated to one another, each adult form being the result of an ontogeny which differs from the previous one. Successive ontogenies are related to one another by the trans- mission of internal factors from fertilized egg to fertilized egg. Modifications in ontogeny (in a constant environment) are due to changes in the internal factors. Phylogeny is therefore due to modified ontogeny. Phylogeny plays no causal part in determining ontogeny. The internal factors exert their effects at certain definite rates. Modification of the rate of action of the internal factors in suc- cessive ontogenies will result in heterochrony [alteration and re- versal of the sequence of stages as shown in ontogeny compared with phylogeny]. Evolution is brought about by acquisition of qualitative noveli- ties, and by the production of novel situations by quantitative altera- tion of the rate of action of the internal factors. New characters may appear at all stages of ontogeny, and by heterochrony they may be retarded or accelerated, so as to appear later or earlier in subsequent ontogenies. Characters present in the early stages of ontogeny have (pro- vided they are not too specialized) played an important part in evolution by paedomorphosis [the introduction of youthful charac-</page><page sequence="54">526 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW ters into the line of adults], resulting in large structural changes without loss of plasticity. Characters present in the late stages of ontogeny have played an important part in evolution by gerontomorphosis [the production of phylogenetic effects by modifying characters which were already present in the line of adults], resulting in relatively small structural change with loss of plasticity. Paedomorphosis and gerontomorphosis may act alternately in the phylogeny of a race, the former producing racial rejuvenes- cence, the latter racial senescence. Recapitulation, i.e., the pressing back of adult ancestral stages into early stages of development of descendants, does not take place, although there may be acceleration of one structure or another. Repetition of ancestral ontogenetic stages in the ontogeny of the descendant, whether retarded or accelerated, is due to the trans- mission of internal factors from ancestor to descendant. Similarity in ontogeny between any animals is proof of their affinity, and no evidence as to the adult structure of the ancestor. Atavism is due to the re-establishment in the ontogeny of the descendant of a set of circumstances which was present in the ontogeny of the ancestor. . . . phylogeny does not explain onto- geny at all. . . . For past phylogeny no method of study other than the historical descriptive is possible. But since phylogeny is but the result of modified ontogeny, there is the possibility of a causal analytic study of present evolution in an experimental study of the variability and genetics of ontogenetic processes". Recapitulation as a guide to animal phylogeny, though heavily criticized by some embryologists, is much used by palaeontologists. Lang (260) has said: "While embryologists may admit recapitula- tion, palaeontologists use it as a guiding principle". The evidence for a "reinstatement" of recapitulation "in its proper place as an established principle of evolutionary thought" is given by Swin- nerton (419). Turning now to the botanical use of ontogeny in its relation to the determination of phylogeny and affinities, we find that it has been, on the whole, much less stressed by botanists than by zool- ogists. In some groups of the vascular cryptogams the ontogeny of the stelar structure of the stems has been frequently accepted as indicating phylogeny or, perhaps it should now be said, organo-</page><page sequence="55">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 527 genesis. A useful summary of the facts interpreted by one or more botanists as supporting the theory of recapitulation is pro- vided by Sahni (369) for vascular plants-mainly vascular crypto- gams and gymnosperms. In the earlier part of this century a great deal of laborious research was devoted to the structure of the seedlings of phanerogams, particularly to the anatomy of their hypocotyls and the details of transition from root to stem. The following are references to a selection of these papers and through these others can be easily traced: (216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 426, 427, 265, 108, 109, 422, 215, 148, 224, 372, 373, 375, 445, 59). The results were not commensurate with the time and trouble involved. This does not mean that the structural details dis- covered will not one day be fitted into a wider scheme, but, as shown for example by Hill and de Fraine (218, 219), the enor- mous importance of physiology in questions relating to vascular tissues may so modify their structure as to outweight their value as indicators of phylogeny, which was in the main the background against which the researches were undertaken. A summary of recent work on the application of causal principles to seedling structure is provided by Thoday (425). The numerous examples of juvenile structures which apparently resemble adult organs in supposed allied or ancestral species or genera are too well known to need giving here. It may, however, be suggested that a re-investigation of these on a wider and more systematic conmparative basis is desirable. It might well be pos- sible to bring the facts into line with the modern findings on the zoological side which are outlined above. Gundersen (174) gives examples from the ontogeny of the angio- spermous flower which appear to support widely accepted views of the relative age of certain groups of angiosperms, especially dicot- yledons, in so far as these are based on floral structure and pre- sumed organogenesis. He points out that the following tendencies are widely accepted as progressive in organogenesis and agree with the findings in development: Petals: from separate to united. Petals: from actinomorphy to zygomorphy. Sepals: from separate to united. Ovary: from superior to inferior. Carpels: from separate to united. Placentation: from parietal to axile.</page><page sequence="56">528 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW Ecological and Phytogeographical Ecology resembles genetics, at the present stage of development of these two branches of biology, in that they both depend on taxon- omy to give them their "degrees of latitude and longitude" in what would otherwise be a chaos of animal and plant individuals, that both work mainly at and below the species level, and that, conse- quently, neither can yet give much help in tracing the phylogeny of higher taxonomic categories. Since, however, species problems are the centre of modern dynamic biology, the taxonomist must expect to meet ecological problems in his research. Salisbury (in 236) has recently outlined the reciprocal relationships of ecology and taxonomy. Like Turrill (in 236), he calls attention to the importance of plasticity and genetic variability in both taxonomic and ecological studies. The selective value of relatively constant genetic variations has been much studied, but the selective value of plasticity itself, especially in allowing a wide or extending ecological and geographical distribution, has not received much attention of late from botanists, and the subject is recommended for investiga- tion by modern methods. The occurrence of pairs of species which are kept distinct only because of ecological barriers is well illus- trated by field and breeding studies on Silene (289, 453). Salis- bury (in 236) and Turrill (457) give many other examples which have not, however, been worked out in so much detail. Since differentiating groups of organisms are constantly being subjected to the sieve of natural selection, we must expect the climatic, eda- phic, biotic and historical factors on an ecological time and space scale to be important links in the causal chain leading to divergence in micro-evolution and, usually in a more obscure manner, on a phytogeographical time and space scale, in taxonomically higher grade evolution. It may be suggested that differences in ecologi- cal behaviour between closely similar species should yield excel- lent material for a study of the way in which the genotype, physio- logically, biochemically and biophysically, controls the appearance of phenotypic characters. Haldane (187) has suggested that very high mutation rates due to heat may have played a part in evolution. It may have caused orthogenetic evolution of species near the tropical limit of their range, and thus may be partly responsible for the greater diversity of species found in tropical as compared with temperate and arctic</page><page sequence="57">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 529 habitats. Hagerup (182, 183, 186), Tischler (440, 441, 442, 443) and others (363, 144, 423, 370, 297, 461) have produced evi- dence which appears to indicate that polyploidy is greater under more extreme or peculiar ecological or phytogeographical condi- tions. Character-gradients within groups have been termed clines by Huxley (233, 234, 236). The observed gradient in visible charac- ters can frequently be shown to be correlated with some climatic or edaphic gradient. Clines of one sort or another are probably of frequent occurrence in nature, and the same idea can be applied with advantage to widely cultivated plant groups. Many of the distributions for cereals, legumes, etc., worked out by Vaviloff (463, 464, 465), appear to be examples of clines. Turrill (452) describes the series of morphological changes in Ajuga chia-A. Chamaepitys which can be traced in populations from the Levant and Aegean areas across Europe to the British Isles. These con- stitute a gross cline. In the genus Leontopodium, Handel-Mazzetti (196) regards adaptations to extreme ecological conditions as indicating non- primitive species. Taxonomists have increasingly recognized the importance of geographical distribution as an aid in both determination and clas- sification. The value of phytogeography as a subject in its own right became obvious after the classical studies of J. D. Hooker, Asa Gray and Engler. The literature of plant distribution is now enormous and a modern synthesis is greatly needed. The atten- tion of botanists may also be called to the works of Rensch (358) and Reinig (356). Here only one or two items of immediate relevance can be discussed and these only briefly. Geographical isolation and the controlling influence of barriers are widely, and sometimes not very critically, accepted as main causes in keeping taxonomic units and communities of vegetation distinct. Seas, mountain-ranges, deserts and other physiographi- cal obstacles to extension of range of plants and animals were par- ticularly mentioned by Darwin (125) in his account of geographi- cal distribution, lending support to the theory of natural selection. Much research has been devoted to this subject at about the species level. The work of Gulick on the land snails of the Sandwich Islands (172, 173) is worth the consideration of botanists. Many</page><page sequence="58">530 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW modern investigations concerning the importance in micro-evolu- tion of physical factors are referred to in greater or less detail by Huxley (235) and by various authors in "The New Systematics" (236). Geographical isolation is frequently accompanied by genetical isolation and it is often impossible to say which arose first. Not infrequently, however, widely discontinuous geographi- cal ranges are found in species which hybridize when they are artificially juxtaposed, as in gardens. A good example is fur- nished by the London plane. Concerning this Sax (380) says: "Platanus acerifolia, a natural hybrid between P. orientalis of south-eastern Europe [and N. Asia Minor] and P. occidentalis of North America, has 21 pairs of chromosomes which pair regularly at meiosis. The hybrid is fertile, and genetic segregation occurs in the second generation. These facts indicate that the parental genoms are similar and are compatible, even though the parental species have been isolated for a long period of time". A chapter is devoted by Robson (361) to isolation as a factor in the divergence of species. Rothschild (366) gives a number of excellent illustra- tions from insects of the interrelations of systematics, phylogenetic research and geographical distribution. Wettstein (483), after consideration of the dual purpose of sys- tematic botany to trace and express phylogenetic connections and to provide "eine m6glichst klare und eine rasche Orientierung zulassende Uebersicht iiber die bisher bekannt gewordenen Pflan- zen zu geben", says: "dass die entwicklungsgeschichtlichen Be- ziehungen der Pflanzen zu einander so mannigfach und so vielfach durchkreuzend sind, dass sie eine Darstellung in Form eines logisch aufgebauten Systems nicht zulassen". The following very balanced conclusion is reached: "Ein vollstandiger Aufbau des Systems auf phylogenetischer Grundlage wird daher kaum zu erreichen sein, wir miussen damit zufrieden sein, wenn das System soweit als m6glich ein Spiegelbild unserer phylogenetischen Kennt- nisse abgiebt und miissen mit der eventuellen Notwendigkeit rechnen, phylogenetische Erfahrungen in Form des Systemes selbst nicht zum Ausdrucke zu bringen". He also makes the very wise suggestion (he terms it a necessary concession) "dass descendenz- theoretische Erfahrungen nur dann in der Systematik Verwertung finden sollen, wenn sie als hinlanglich begriindet angesehen werden k6nnen. Bevor dies der Fall ist, diese Verwertung vornehmen, heisst in ganz iiberfluissiger Weise die Systematik zu einer swank-</page><page sequence="59">TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY 531 enden und die Zwecke der Orientierung ganz ausser acht lassenden machen". Wettstein points out that for the largest groups it is easy to make a sequence which, on certain reasonable assumptions, may be con- sidered phylogenetic, as: heterosporous pteridophytes gymno- sperms angiosperms. The smaller the groups considered, however, the greater become the difficulties. These are exceed- ingly great at the generic level, and "Vollstandig unmoglich aber wird eine derartige Anwendung der Phylogenie zumeist in der Systematik der Arten". Especially because of frequent morpho- logical convergence, the morphological method alone can not lead to a sound phylogeny. On the other hand, he believes that a com- bination of detailed morphological and phytogeographical (in the broad sense) studies shows that "Pflanzenarten von weiterer Ver- wandtschaft in Arealen vorkommen, die durch mehr oder minder grosse Gebiete getrennt sind oder aber in denselben Gebieten leben k6nnen; sei weichen naturgemass durch gr6ssere morphologische Unterschiede voneinander ab und sind im allgemeinen nicht durch nicht-hybride Uebergange miteinander verbunden". He considers that this dual method of comparative morphology and distribution is an objective means of determining relationship at and about the species level. In an area, such as much of Europe, where the post- Tertiary geological history is well known, the method can be used advantageously with the data derived from a study of the influence of the Quaternary Ice Age. Diels (131) points out that a geographical criterion may be particularly valuable when a group is adapted to a definite set of environmental factors, since such factors are nearly always spatially differentiated. The dependent groups must then show a corre- sponding distribution in space. If a group of systematic units be in a high degree epharmonically or adaptively organized, its geo- graphical distribution can be used to test whether or not the mor- phological criteria have phyletic significance. The geographical method is not limited to clarification of simple epharmonic form- circles. For more difficult groups the method is essentially the same as for the simpler: firstly, the series of morphological progres- sions are established and the distribution of the races mapped, then the geographical point of origin and the migration routes of the existing races are determined, the characters are compared with the environmental conditions of the ranges, or with their postulated past</page><page sequence="60">532 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW conditions, and finally the morphological gradation is made to accord with the geographical distribution. Smith (403) has published a paper on the Bromeliaceae which gives an excellent idea of the use of geographical data in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies. Smith frankly states that morphological facts must be given primary and range data secondary value. Distribution of the higher systematic categories, especially genera and families, has been relatively little investigated on modern lines. Attention may be called to the paper of Guppy (175) and the work of Irmscher (240). Guppy concluded that the history of the angiosperms is to be resolved into two principal eras: that witness- ing the rise of the great families, under relatively uniform environ- mental conditions, and that in which the family types were differen- tiated in response to the differentiation of climatic and other con- ditions. His statistical treatment shows that the distribution of families largely ignores the cleavage of the land into two great masses diverging from the north, but agrees in a marked degree with the differentiation of climatic zones. Guppy's paper was read in February 1918 and he does not refer to Wegener's theory. His views on the relation between mutation and natural selection need considerable modification in the light of recent researches. Willis (492) accepts and extends Guppy's theory of differentiation. Irmscher throughout his work most strongly supports the Wegener hypothesis. He concludes that the following three factor-complexes have acted together to give the present distribution of flowering plants: "1. Polverlagerungen als Ursache der Pflanzenwanderung und Florendurchmischung. 2. Grossschollenverschiebung und damit im Gefolge Veranderung des Grossformenbildes. 3. Aktive Ausbreitung und Weiterentwicklung des Pflanzenbestandes". Similar conclusions are reached as a result of a study of the distri- bution of mosses. In reading Irmscher's work one feels that his regional divisions are far too large-there are only four for the whole land surface of the globe. Tabulations on such a basis are very easy to construct but entirely obscure many of the most impor- tant correlations between range on the one hand and environmental and historical factors on the other. That phytogeography has much light to throw on phylogeny and much help to give to taxonomy, the present writer firmly believes, but full and careful analysis is essential before synthesis. (The concluding part of this study will appear in the December issue of the Review)</page></plain_text>
