Martin The University of Michigan Copyright © 2006 SAE International ABSTRACT Vehicle ride motion produces a dynamic response of the seated operator, which disturbs the intended fingertip trajectory during reach activities. This perturbation induces deviations that must be corrected to successfully complete the reach. Visual and/or proprioceptive information are necessary to detect these deviations and provide feedback to the controller of the neuromuscular system. In an attempt to predict movement alterations and adjustments under whole body vibration exposure, a trajectory planning and feedback controller was developed using split sample data from a series of reaching experiments on a six degree of freedom motion platform. INTRODUCTION Understanding the capabilities and limitations of human movement is essential to effectively design controls and displays used in vehicles and the workplace. Controls and displays should be easily accessible, simple to manipulate, and provide immediate feedback with respect to the success or failure of the intended task. For many years, physical prototypes (costly in both time and money) have been used to evaluate designs with respect to human performance. More recently, virtual prototypes and digital human modeling have become plausible alternatives, and extending the ability to predict and simulate human motions and behaviors is an increasingly valuable asset. One area of research that is particularly open is the ability of vehicle operators to perform manual reaching tasks while the vehicle is in motion. The terrain-induced ride motion causes perturbations to movements that should be predictable in a biomechanical sense, and can be incorporated into a motion prediction model that can accurately simulate human movements in a dynamic environment. Designers could then efficiently design controls and displays where the operator's movements are less susceptible to vehicle motion. Previous studies have shown that the direction of arm movement is a significant factor in the endpoint accuracy of the reach (Rider &amp; Martin 2004). Simulation of human movements is complex due to numerous interactive factors that cannot always be predicted. Some components are psychophysical in nature, such as motivation. Some have biomechanical underpinnings that include the infinite number of feasible solutions resulting from redundant degrees of freedom (Scholz &amp; Schöner 1999). Still other factors cause natural variability, including neuromuscular variability (Schmidt et al. 1979; Ghez 1991) and intersubject differences (Meyer et al. 1982). Incorporating these sources of variability where possible, researchers have developed different hypotheses to explain and predict hand trajectories during reaching movements. Two seemingly contradictory strategies are the equilibrium-point (EP) hypothesis (Polit &amp; Bizzi 1979; Bizzi et al. 1984; Feldman 1966, 1986) and the adjustment-current control theory proposed by Woodworth (1899). The EP view suggests that human movement is regulated through use of a mechanical spring and dashpot system, where agonist and antagonist muscular systems are simultaneously activated to achieve a position of equilibrium for the overall system. Dewhurst (1967) supports Feldman's A- model where reflexive muscular responses oppose perturbations to the system, however a 30 ms latency period between the perturbation and muscle activation suggests that a pure spring-dashpot systems is not a sufficient analogy for a biodynamic response model. It remains that the EP model does not well account for how the modulation of the muscular synergy would result in observable nonlinear hand trajectories, or how late-reach feedback from visual and proprioceptive systems is used to successfully complete the intended movement. Contrary to strictly passive mechanical effects, Woodworth's proposal suggests that movements have two successively planned volitional phases: an initial adjustment towards the target, and corrections as necessary (current control) to successfully reach the target. This theory does not indicate the mechanisms by which movements are generated, but does readily explain how visual and proprioceptive feedbacks are used to achieve the desired endpoint. 1131</page><page sequence="2">In order to accurately predict human movement capabilities in dynamic environments, active and passive neuromuscular responses to ride motion must be incorporated with movement planning. Through use of a split-sample dataset, an active human response model is developed to generate a trajectory path of the right index fingertip during a rapid reach to an in-vehicle pushbutton target under ride motion perturbation. Elements of the model are derived from motor control theory and human vibration response that include the formation of an open-loop trajectory, human biodynamic response, and feedback controller. The initial, open-loop trajectory is determined through proprioceptive feedback and includes neuromuscular variability in reach execution. Vibration feedthrough to the hand is simulated through an external biodynamic response model and affects the entire reaching movement. Closed-loop feedback is modeled using a preview controller, and activates after a visuomotor delay. These individual components are discussed below, as well as future efforts to validate and improve the model. The ultimate goal of these simulated in-vehicle reaching tasks is to successfully press a target button as quickly as possible, which can theoretically be accomplished without the use of feedback control through a perfectly planned, executed, and unperturbed movement. However the intended trajectory is not perfectly executed and the resulting movement is perturbed by the dynamic environment. The trajectory must utilize feedback control to successfully reach the target. TRAJECTORY PLANNING AND EXECUTION In its simplest form, planning a reach requires one to evaluate several task parameters that include the following: starting hand position, desired end location, and any obstacles between the two locations. Several theories exist regarding trajectory formation, though much of the literature focuses predominantly on Morasso's seminal work (1981) on apparent "straight- line" movements with bell-shaped speed profiles in the absence of obstacles. Hence optimization algorithms often use this Euclidean distance. These linear hand paths, however, may not be adequate representations of the actual hand trajectories (Atkeson &amp; Hollerbach 1985; Breteler et al. 1998; Rider et al. 2004). Soechting &amp; Lacquaniti (1981) have shown that pointing tasks have invariant kinematic characteristics, including the consistency in the trajectory of the hand regardless of movement speed. While replicated reaches are highly repeatable, Schmidt &amp; Lee (2005) discuss the natural variability that prevents repeated reaches from having identical kinetic or kinematic characteristics. They further suggest that this variability is introduced at two levels: movement planning and movement execution. An inexact estimation of the exocentric target location or egocentric postural representation creates a discrepancy between a hypothetical^ optimal movement plan and the planned trajectory. Repetition and learning reduce but do not eliminate this effect. In addition, errors in movement execution result from the imperfect execution of the intended movement plan, due to variability in the neuromuscular system and biomechanical perturbations induced by the motion environment. BIODYNAMIC PERTURBATION AND MODEL While extending the arm during a reach, the movement is often disturbed by external influences. Particularly in the case of moving vehicles, the response of the arm to the ride motion is referred to as the vibration feedthrough, or the vibration transmitted from the source to the end effector (i.e. fingertip). This terrain-induced ride motion and passive human vibration response are incorporated in a three-dimensional vehicle and biodynamics model (AVB-DYN), developed by Systems Technology, Inc. (STI, Hawthorne, California). The biodynamic module (BIODYN-II) calculates the dynamic response of a seated operator when subjected to specific vibrations. With this biomechanical model, the vibration feedthrough can be estimated to predict fingertip motions during a reach. The BIODYN-II module uses the accelerations of the seatpan and backrest to calculate the human biodynamic response of the seated operator during vehicle motion (see Figure 1). The model is intended to evaluate the passive biodynamic response while the operator is gripping a control stick. Figure 1. Example of spring and dashpot model of seated vehicle operator used to calculate the passive biodynamic responses to sagittal plane ride motion (Allen et al. 2005). VISUAL AND SOMATOSENSORY FEEDBACKS Visual and somatosensory feedbacks are the two principal mechanisms contributing to the regulation of reach performance (Bernstein 1967; Jeannerod 1988; Riemann &amp; Lephart 2002). Without visual feedback, reach accuracy is known to degrade (Keele &amp; Posner 1968, Zelaznik et al. 1983). Likewise the absence of proprioception (Ghez et. al 1990; Gordon et al. 1995) and the vibration-induced alteration of proprioception 1132</page><page sequence="3">(Gathier et al. 1981, Martin et al. 1991) reduce reach performance. It has been suggested that both vision and proprioception are used to construct an egocentric reference of the body, by which to employ postural and manual control (Clower et al. 1996). The model we are developing incorporates continuous feedback that transitions from proprioceptive to visual feedback, based on the remaining distance between the fingertip and the target. Vision becomes the dominant feedback mechanism after the end-effector enters the field-of-view (Schneider 1969; Blouin et al. 1993), though it is estimated to take between 85 and 135 ms for the visuomotor system to execute a compensatory motor command based on visual feedback information (Soechting &amp; Flanders 1989; Carlton 1992). In our model, the transition to visual control is delayed until 100 ms after the fingertip enters the field of view to approximate visuomotor delay. PREVIEW CONTROL MacAdam (1980), Gordon et al. (2002), and Prokop (2001) have developed vehicle-driver models that utilize a "look-ahead" or preview distance that achieves increased stability in a dynamic system by modifying the system state based on anticipated events, effectively removing the time-delayed response. These optimal control models utilize a fixed look-ahead distance, which is the desired position at some future time. The preview controller evaluates the difference between the current position and velocity, and the look-ahead vector. It then generates accelerations that will satisfy the desired position. Jagacinski &amp; Flach (2003) discuss a similar notion of "quickening", or the ability to reconcile current position and velocity information to predict future positions. The resolution, however, of early-reach predictions of the reach endpoint would not likely be sufficient to identify a need to modify the trajectory caused by excessive vibration feedthrough. MODELING METHODS ANTHROPOMETRIC CONSIDERATIONS Anthropometric variables, such as body segment masses and distributions are accounted for within the BIODYN-II architecture and the digital human avatar from Technomatix Jack. BIODYN-II also incorporates data from GEBOD that generates geometric and body segment masses, and locations and mechanical properties of joints for human and anthropomorphic test dummies (Cheng et al. 1994). Beginning with an initial, semi-supine driving posture, anthropometric data of the seated human avatar is exported from Jack and imported into the BIODYN-II model. BIODYN-II calculates the vibration feedthrough, based on body segment masses and joint stiffness parameters, estimated from experiments (Allen et al. 2005). Anthropometry data can be input into the model or default to representations of the individuals who participated in the experiment. TRAJECTORY CONSIDERATIONS Regression techniques from Faraway (2000) were used to estimate a reference fingertip trajectory from a split- sample of the replicated, well-trained, rapid reaches in a set if reaches to various locations around seated operators. It is presumed that the resulting mean is a fair approximation of the intended movement plan. With this reference trajectory determined for a given reach, the variability in movement execution is then modeled using a stochastic "launch cone" centered about the reference trajectory (Figure 2). This cylindrical cone is a three- dimensional normal distribution of the fingertip location at peak velocity, with respect to the reach origin. The base of the cone, at peak velocity, encompasses 95% of the data for the replicated reaches. Figure 2. Illustration of regression-based "launch cone" incorporating the initial trajectory for 95% of empirical reaches to various target locations. During reach simulations, a point is chosen within the base of this cone. The distance from this position to the reference trajectory is used to adjust the actual movement away from the reference trajectory. This adjustment is a linear extrapolation of the deviation at peak velocity projected through the remaining reach distance (Figure 3). This adjustment provides an estimate of the executed trajectory resulting from neuromuscular variability, without the use of a compensatory feedback control mechanism. ^ Reference trajectory _ _ - - - ~ ® ^ Gradient-adjusted trajectory * Figure 3. Gradient-based adjustment of reference trajectory based on movement variability. VIBRATION FEEDTHROUGH AND DATA MODELING Before proceeding further with the model development, it was necessary to gather fingertip trajectory data on participants performing pushbutton reaches while subjected to various vehicle motions. Ride motion data were recorded from a high-mobility, multi-wheeled vehicle. The ride profile was used to simulate a dynamic environment of a moving vehicle on a six degree-of- freedom (6DOF) Ride Motion Simulator (RMS, MTS Systems), combining three translational (X,Y,Z) and three rotational (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) accelerations (see 1133</page><page sequence="4">Rider et al. 2003). This dynamic environment induces perturbations to the arm that generally result in movement of the fingertip away from the intended trajectory. The BIODYN-II model is used to calculate the three- dimensional vibration feedthrough to the hand from vibration inputs to the seatpan and backrest. The accelerations of the hand due to this passive biodynamic response are then superimposed with the volitional reaching movements of vehicle operators in stationary environments to create the actual movement (Figure 4). It should be noted that this prediction is only useful before feedback control mechanisms activate. Figure 4. Examples of superposition of volitional fingertip accelerations and vibration feedthrough accelerations (Rider &amp; Martin 2005a). FEEDBACK CONTROLLER DEVELOPMENT The trajectory resulting from the superimposed accelerations is representative of an open-loop, uncompensated movement. Figure 3 illustrates that the accuracy of this trajectory is not sufficient to successfully complete the reaching task. Hence the fingertip will not reach the target unless visual and/or somatosensory feedbacks are utilized. The modeled feedback controller activates 100 ms after the fingertip enters the field-of-view, at which point the reach endpoint is estimated based on a projection of the current trajectory. If the projected endpoint does not satisfy the task requirements, adjustments are made to the trajectory based on the difference between the current movement vector and a landing vector defined by the target orientation. Previous studies have shown that for push-button targets, the desired ending trajectory can be represented by a vector orthogonal to the target plane (Rider &amp; Martin 2004). The target position then becomes analogous to the look-ahead distance of the optimal preview controller (MacAdam 1980; Gordon et al. 2002), where the trajectory is continuously adjusted to transition between the current and desired states. This preview control is modeled as a cubic Bézier spline between the current movement vector and the landing vector. The spline is constructed from the interpolation between four points: the initial position, the ending position, and two control points. The control points have some physical meaning, based on the magnitude of the current and desired velocity vectors. The forward projection of the current velocity is used to define the first control point (P1 ), and the backward projection from the target location defines the second control point (P2), as illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5. Illustration of the cubic Bezier spline PROPOSED TRAJECTORY CONTROL MODEL The trajectory control model that we are developing incorporates movement planning, motor variability, ride motion perturbation, and feedback control processes to successfully complete rapid pointing tasks in a dynamic environment. The following subsections outline the individual components and how they relate to the current model development. A schematic of the proposed model is depicted in Figure 6. The initial trajectory is formulated based on the input parameters of the origin and destination of the reach, where the initial direction of movement is a stochastic variable. Subsequently the model incorporates the system perturbation and calculates the effect of the vehicle motion on the movement of the hand. Lastly, the visual and proprioceptive feedbacks operate as an optimal controller, making any modifications to the trajectory that are necessary to successfully complete the reaching task. 1134</page><page sequence="5">Terrain profile ^ Vehicle gegt Ride Motion Suspension at seat Task LJ(t) + ^ Trajectory Jv Parameters I ^ Controller Execüted ?U Actual s I I 5 "TI trajectory Trajectory .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Validation of the model performance is currently being conducted, with and without use of the feedback controller. The endpoints of the simulated open-loop trajectories should create elliptical endpoint dispersions similar to those observed in an earlier study of visually- occluded reaches performed under simulated ride motion conditions on the RMS (Figure 7). Figure 7. Endpoints without visual feedback under stationary and ride motion conditions to each of the three touchscreens: a) Forward, b) Lateral, and c) Upward (Rider et al. 2005b). The data fitting ellipses contain 95% of the reach endpoints in a stationary cab (solid) and under ride motion (dotted). Endpoint dispersions of simulated reaches using only the trajectory formation, and neuromuscular variability components should resemble the stationary cab reaches. Inclusion of the vibration feedthrough should then produce the endpoint ellipses of reaches performed under ride motion. When the proposed model can sufficiently recreate these conditions, the feedback controller can be included to ensure a successful reach and emulate the reach times observed in the experiment, thus providing a method for predicting operator spatial and temporal performance caused by vehicle ride motion. Part of the feedback control includes the joint stiffness parameters of the model. McRuer et al. (1965) suggest that humans adjust the stiffness of their joints to create a consistent transfer function from the vibration input to the end effector in an attempt to improve their manual coordination. However the model parameters used in the development of the original BIODYN model are based on stationary postures, such as holding a control stick or steering wheel. Likewise, BIODYN-II was partially validated with joint stiffness parameters from vertical frequency sweeps (Rider et al. 2003) of the RMS while participants maintained an extended arm in lateral, longitudinal, or vertical directions. Determining variable joint stiffness parameters and additional effects associated with performing in-vehicle reaching tasks under ride motion requires further investigation.
