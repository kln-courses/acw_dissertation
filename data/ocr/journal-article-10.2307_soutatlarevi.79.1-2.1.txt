<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Biophilia in Thoreau’s Walden Judith P. Saunders Thoreau’s profound affinity with the natural world is central to his writing and has generated prolific comment. His simultaneously  imaginative and investigative relationship to nature has been explored  using a wide variety of interpretive paradigms, most recently that of  ecocriticism, but it has yet to be seriously examined through the lens  of evolutionary biology.1 In particular, the concept of biophilia intro- duced by Edward O. Wilson promises to shed light on the intensely  appreciative attentiveness Thoreau lavishes on the “living earth” (W  309).2 Studying the human propensity “to focus on life” and to affiliate  with a wide variety of living organisms, Wilson and other scholars have  amassed a considerable body of evidence suggesting that this tenden- cy is innate, an evolved adaptation in homo sapiens (Biophilia 1, 85).  Walden, the book in which Thoreau describes his “life in the woods”  and identifies nature as the irreplaceable source of human vitality,  contentment, and purpose, speaks eloquently to the “biophilia hy- pothesis” now under study in fields ranging from biology and anthro- pology to psychology, cognition, and the arts. Recognizing Thoreau’s  multifaceted engagement with nature as the expression of a human  universal enables readers to probe the adaptive significance of his radi- cal reassessment of human purpose. His defiance of social norms, to- gether with his affirmation of global kinship, reflects a coherent set of  fitness-based choices.  Conditions prevailing in the ancestral environment served as the  context in which biophilia could evolve. As foraging nomads, the earli- est humans were fully integrated in the natural world: intimate famil- iarity with their physical environment (including flora, fauna, topogra- phy, and weather patterns, for example) would have been essential to  survival. Many cognitive paths, affective preferences, and psychologi- cal responses were shaped in the crucible of environmental necessity,  and modern humans continue to inherit these adaptations, although  opportunities for expressing them have undergone radical modifica- tion. Thoreau lived well before principles of genetic inheritance and  behavioral evolution were formulated or understood, but he clearly  begins with the assumption that “man’s relation to nature has a perma- nent character” (Drake 73); he speaks “to our common . . . condition as  human beings, a condition he viewed as universal” (Specq et al. 2). His  thinking, as naturalist, small-scale homesteader, proto-ecologist, and  1 </page> <page sequence="2"> Judith P. Saunders environmentalist, proves consistently congruent with the biophilic  theory currently fueling research in fields ranging from biology and  anthropology to philosophy and aesthetics—namely, that “the widest  valuational affiliation” with nature “has conferred distinctive advan- tages in the human evolutionary struggle to adapt, persist, and thrive  as individuals and as a species” (Kellert, “The Biological Basis” 42).  Habitat Selection   “The crucial first step to survival in all organisms is habitat selection,”  as Wilson and others explain (Biophila 106, Soulé 443-44). It is no ac- cident that Thoreau describes at such length in Walden “where [he]  lived” and what attracted him to his chosen site. He is interested in  other people’s choices as well: his curiosity concerning cultures world- wide, ancient and modern, reflects his “paramount interest in man’s  relation to nature,” his eagerness to study humans “in one kind of  natural setting after another” (Christie 211). Just as nonhuman animals  follow “inborn rules of behavior” to get themselves into the precise en- vironment “for which . . . their anatomy and physiology is particularly  well suited,” there is evidence that humans, too, are guided by “a set of  ingrained preferences,” that in choosing living sites they are “respond- ing to a deep genetic memory of mankind’s optimal environment”  (Wilson, Biophilia 107, 113, 111-12). Archaeological evidence indicates  that “for most of two million years” the savannas of Africa served as  the original human environment (Biophilia 109). Its essential features  are open space, abundant vegetation, well-distributed trees, water, and  look-out points on nearby hills or ridges. To ancestral humans, such  a site promised good hunting and foraging, together with water, fuel,  and shelter; it included prospect points for descrying more distant  game or approaching enemies (Heerwagen and Orians 145-46, Ulrich  81-82, 89-90).  Thoreau offers numerous descriptions of the place he chooses for his  “experiment of living,” evidence that it contains critical elements of the  optimal ancestral habitat (W 51). He builds his house “by the shore of a  small pond” (86). The pond lies “in the midst of an extensive wood,” but  Thoreau makes clear that this is a reforested area, with smaller, second- growth trees and plenty of cleared ground: “From a hill top near by,  where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista  southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills”  (86). In some directions he is closed in by “the woods which surround- ed” him, but in others he enjoys more extensive prospects “over the near  green hills to some distant and higher ones . . . more distant moun- 2 </page> <page sequence="3"> South Atlantic Review tain ranges in the north-west” (87). The house itself is located “on the  side of a hill” and “on the edge of the larger wood”; a “narrow footpath”  leads “down the hill” to the pond (113). There is “a narrow shelf-like  path” completely “encircling the pond,” as well (180, 179). Describing  his daily walks, he indicates that numerous paths and routes connect  his home-base to other places of interest to him. In sum, his chosen  location corresponds very faithfully to ancestral preferences. It abounds  with animal and plant life, as well as with the critical resources of water  and fuel. There are paths to facilitate movement to other places, as well  as vantage points from which to survey more distant territory. Much  of the open quality of Thoreau’s home-site is provided by the body of  water at its center: the views beyond and across the pond create impor- tant visual space (see Ulrich 82). He notes with pleasure that in winter  the frozen pond supplies him with “new . . . routes to many points” and,  just as important, with “new views . . . of the familiar landscape” (W  271). In winter, his home looks more savanna-like than ever, with “snow  lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of  the hill on which my house is placed” (278, 282).  Thoreau discusses the importance of habitat evaluation and selec- tion at length in the second chapter of his book, “Where I Lived, and  What I Lived For.” Reporting briefly on his earlier attempt to purchase  the Hollowell farm, he comments that people regularly make hypo- thetical decisions about suitable locations; they are ready “to consider  every spot as the possible site of a house” (W 81). His insight points  toward an adaptation that served humans well in the Environment  of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA): nomadic peoples needed to make  habitat decisions repeatedly (Heerwagen and Orians 140). Thoreau’s  propensity to exalt the location he finally chooses lends biophilic  energy to his discussion of his own selection process. He praises the  site of his small homestead because it answers survival needs, enabling  him to feed, shelter, clean, and warm himself, but at the same time he  pays tribute to its intangible advantages. He demonstrates aesthetic  appreciation of the site’s features, large and small, pointing out that the  natural resources he enjoys are beautiful as well as useful. The pond,  for instance, serves him as a water supply, a mode of refrigeration, and  a source of edible fish, but he also lauds Walden water for its “crys- talline purity,” its “remarkable transparency,” its uniquely blue-green  color, and the “rare beauty” of the “gold and emerald” pickerel that live  in it (W 177, 178, 176, 285, 286). Because water is such a critical element in human habitats, Roger S.  Ulrich reports, “both modern children and adults evidence strong pref- erences for scenes with water and are sensitive to certain optical prop- erties of water in landscapes, especially glossiness” (90). Singling out  3 </page> <page sequence="4"> Judith P. Saunders the pond for sustained attention—aesthetic and spiritual, as well as  scientific—and attaching special importance to the qualities of purity  and transparency he observes in it, Thoreau demonstrates precisely  this kind of sensitivity. He further glorifies his home by associating  it with paradisiacal places and times: the Golden Age, the Castalian  Fountain, the Garden of Eden (W 179). By means of such comparisons  he underlines the desirability of the site dramatically, confirming the  foundational importance of habitat to the human animal.3  Studying Nature Wilson argues that we inherit the urge to explore the living organ- isms around us, to learn as much as possible about their physiologies,  life histories, and behaviors, from ancestors whose survival depended  upon the acquisition of such knowledge. As an amateur naturalist,  Thoreau demonstrates this particular biophilic inclination straight- forwardly.  In his close examination of animal and plant life, seasonal  cycles and elemental processes, we see at work the human propensity to  understand “the natural world as illuminated by the scientific method”  (Wilson, Biophilia 81). A patient and curious observer, Thoreau salutes  “the necessity of being forever on the alert,” together with “the disci- pline of looking always at what is to be seen” (W 111). He reports on  the appearance and behavior of wildlife in the area, including (among  many others) mice, squirrels, ants whippoorwills, jays, titmice, musk- rats, ducks, and loons. He conducts experiments over time to discover  how air bubbles become incorporated into ice; he keeps careful records  of freezes and thaws, of high and low water-levels in nearby bodies  of water: consistently he devotes attention to “sequence and verifiable  patterns” (Burbick 71). He goes to considerable trouble to refute the  myth that Walden is a “bottomless” pond, fathoming its depths from a  variety of positions (“more than a hundred” individual “soundings”) in  order to chart the conformation of its basin (W 289). Frequently Thoreau suggests no immediate practical purpose to  be served by the knowledge he acquires. He assumes that accumu- lating a store of information about the natural world, or at least the  portion of it he inhabits, is interesting and valuable in and of itself.  Such information may at some future time prove useful, as it does  for the fisherman whose knowledge of insect life enables him to get  good bait in winter, but even in the absence of pragmatic benefits  Thoreau communicates his conviction that studying the natural envi- ronment is fundamentally important and compelling, that “knowing  [other living creatures] well elevates the very concept of life” (Wilson,  4 </page> <page sequence="5"> South Atlantic Review Biophilia 22).4 He shows that such study demands substantial invest- ment of time and intellectual effort, and it is an investment he makes  with unfailing enthusiasm. The results of Thoreau’s exuberant yet rigorous investigatory activ- ities occupy a considerable portion of his book. Increasingly his work  has been acknowledged “in mainstream scientific literature” (Buell  363). He provides, for instance, “a model of forest succession as an  ongoing process with discernible rules upon which reliable predic- tions may be founded” and demonstrates “other properties of living  communities [that] pointed straight toward the modern science of  ecology” (Hoag 165, Wilson, ”A Letter” xix). Consistently he strives  “to observe, order, and describe natural phenomena in temporal se- quence’ and thereby produce “a theory or law that explains a natural  event” (Burbick 71). “Next to us,” he confidently asserts, “the grand- est laws are continually being executed” (W 135, author’s emphasis).  His interest in discovering the principles governing natural growth  and elemental processes sets him apart from numerous contempo- raries who celebrated nature far less rigorously and systematically.5  Acquainted with pre-Darwinian versions of evolutionary theory  (Sattelmeyer 78-92), he demonstrated predictable “receptivity to  Darwin’s Origin of Species,” reading it in 1860 and making “extracts  from it” (Buell 363, Sattelmeyer 89). “It seems clear,” as David M.  Robinson asserts, “that Darwin’s depiction of the development of the  forms of natural life tallied well with Thoreau’s sense of nature’s in- exorable process of change, death, and renewal” (78). Thoreau investigates a physical world largely tamed by human activ- ity and thus radically unlike the EEA in many ways; his predominantly  fearless attitude toward nature is keyed, realistically, to prevailing con- ditions. His exploration of nature includes appraisal, nevertheless, of  its potentially deadly powers. Even in the settled countryside around  Concord, long rid of bears and wolves, he reports struggles engendered  by competition between and within species. He muses on the spectacle  of “myriads” of creatures “suffered to prey on one another . . . tender  organizations . . . serenely squashed out of existence” (W 318). The  human race itself would be easily destroyed, he observes, by a small  decrease in global temperatures: “a little sharper blast from the north  . . . would put a period to man’s existence” (W 254). He acknowledg- es nature’s destructive potential, balancing its “less peaceful” aspects  against evidence of its “magnanimity” and “abundance” (W 228, 166).  Interpreting natural processes of decay and death from a “comprehen- sive perspective,” he emphasizes “the perpetual energy and dynamism  of nature” (Robinson 74, 78).   5 </page> <page sequence="6"> Judith P. Saunders Aesthetics and Cognition Much research in the field of evolutionary psychology begins with  the hypothesis that the ancestral environment exercised important  influence on development of human cognitive powers, including  development of the aesthetic sense. That hypothesis is generally  consistent with Thoreau’s understandings and assumptions. The ex- ploration of the physical environment to which much of his activity  at Walden is dedicated reflects his certainty that “the mind of man  thinks and develops by meeting and coming to terms with the world  he lives in,” that human perceptions conform to preexisting “cogni- tive frameworks” (Drake 90, Peck 82). Thoreau articulates such ideas  most directly in connection with his appreciation of nature’s beauty.  Frequently he insists that the aesthetic pleasure conveyed by natural  phenomena is as valuable as their practical utility. He gathers wild  grapes “more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food”  and cherishes the “brilliant fruit” of the barberry even though it pro- vides “food for [his] eyes merely” (W 238). He anticipates currently  prevailing cognitive theory, namely, that “the mind is innately pre- pared to receive [the] symmetry and power” of natural phenomena  (Wilson, Biophilia 61): admiring the “arching” grace of a local weed,  wool-grass, he remarks that plant and animal life supplies “forms  which art loves to copy” because of their “relation to types already  in the mind” (W 310). He assumes that our capacity to respond to art  is lodged “in our biology and in our relationship to other organisms”  (Wilson, Biophilia 63). Linking the human aesthetic response to natural designs, Thoreau  states unequivocally that “a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated  out of doors” (W 38). Moving his small assortment of “household ef- fects” outside whenever he scrubs his floor, he comments that these  “familiar objects” look “much more interesting” in this outdoor set- ting (113). This leads him to speculate that “these forms” (vines, leaves,  pine cones, and the like) “came to be transferred to our furniture” as  cherished embellishment because once we lived “in their midst” (113).  He argues that we choose natural shapes as ornaments because of our  long history of dependence on nature for everyday subsistence, that  our aesthetic preferences are shaped by our involvement, as a species,  with nature. Such comments are congruent with the theory that im- mersion in the ancestral environment exercised important influence  on development of human psychological responses.  6 </page> <page sequence="7"> South Atlantic Review Universal Kinship Foundational to Thoreau’s natural philosophy is the conviction that he  is biologically connected to all life forms. He expresses in the language  of his day the idea, soon to be articulated systematically by Darwin,  that humans are neither central nor special as a species, but part of a  vast, global network of kinship. Without knowing the precise mecha- nisms of inheritance and variation, or of evolution by natural selec- tion over time, he insists that he is organically related to everything on  earth. Geneticists in succeeding generations have proven the validity of  that claim: all life on the planet is descended from single-celled ances- tors, and a verifiable genetic relationship therefore links even seem- ingly distant species (Dawkins 11-12). Thoreau rejoices in the fact of  this profound and extensive connectedness, asking rhetorically, “am I  not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself?” (W 138). Such declara- tion of kinship with the vegetable kingdom is not mere hyperbole, a  pantheistically inspired figure of speech: throughout Walden he points  implicitly toward the biophysical basis of the interconnections he  describes. Lawrence Stapleton distinguishes Thoreau from Emerson  and other nineteenth-century transcendentalists in this respect,  noting that while his contemporaries base their philosophy upon “the  Platonizing idea of correspondences,” Thoreau maintains a naturalist’s  focus on “the minute, the unseen or unnoticed resemblances or dif- ferences among concrete objects” (167). Consistently he establishes “a  solid bottom,” a physical basis, for the “cosmic empathy” he expresses  (W 330, Christie 201).  Thoreau’s eccentric views on human agriculture can best be un- derstood in the context of cross-species kinship. Instead of lamenting  weather conditions unfavorable to farming, he takes an ecosystemic  perspective, observing that if flooding rains should “cause the seeds  to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands,” there  will be no cause to despair (W 131). Though destructive to potatoes,  such rain “would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being  good for the grass, it would be good for me” (138, emphasis added). He  is convinced, clearly, that he has a stake in the survival of wild grasses:  his well-being is bound up with theirs. Although he initially character- izes woodchucks as “enemies” and his efforts to eradicate weeds as “a  long war,” gradually he arrives at far less homocentric views (155, 161).  The bean plants he has sown and hoed “grow for woodchucks partly,”  he concludes, and his labor as a gardener has “results which are not  harvested by [him]” but, rather, by members of other species (166).6 He  similarly declines to value cultivated plants over wild ones. He regards  the agricultural revolution with ambivalence for many reasons, not  7 </page> <page sequence="8"> Judith P. Saunders least because it is founded on the faulty premise of human supremacy.  The fruits and vegetables tended so assiduously by farmers are not in- trinsically more valuable than the indigenous plant life they replace,  that “rich and various crop only unreaped by man” (158). Thoreau does  not hesitate to assert that all life forms have equal claim on the elemen- tal resources critical to plant growth, such as sun, rain, and nutrient- rich soil. “The sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and  forests without distinction,” he points out; “in his view the earth is all  equally cultivated like a garden” (166). If wild creatures eat his crops, or  if his crops should die and be replaced by weeds, “whose seeds are the  granary of the birds,” his loss will be compensated by the sustenance  gained by other, non-human animals whose survival is as important as  his own (166).  Thoreau is motivated, evidently, by the principle now defined as in- clusive fitness. As George Hamilton was the first to demonstrate, indi- vidual fitness cannot not be measured merely by personal, or direct,  reproductive success (i.e., number of offspring); rather, it includes the  reproductive success of all those sharing genes with the target individu- al (Daley and Wilson 28-32). The reproductive efforts of siblings, cous- ins, and collateral kin can raise appreciably the total number of genes an  individual passes on to the next generation. Nepotistic behavior results  from these facts: throughout the animal kingdom, individuals tend to  help relatives, exhibiting a wide range of altruistic propensities, because  assistance to relatives fosters the survival of shared genes. Thoreau  communicates an evolutionarily expansive version of this principle  when he identifies members of non-human species as kin: their fitness  contributes to his. His conviction that “what is good for” other living  things is also good for him demonstrates a highly developed sense of  what Wilson refers to as “the phylogenetic continuity of life” and dem- onstrates allegiance to a central principle of biophilia, namely, that “we  are literally kin to other organisms” (Biophilia 130). “From a molecular  point of view,” as Richard Dawkins emphasizes, “all animals are pretty  close relatives of one another and even of plants” (12).  Since “the relation between man and nature is reciprocal,” it follows  that one need not rely solely on members of one’s own species to enjoy  nepotistic benefits of community and companionship (Stapleton 171).  As a naturalist, Thoreau investigates “interdependencies among spe- cies” and “mutual dependencies that made nature work” (McGregor  4). As a writer, he employs a variety of rhetorical devices to lend vivid  immediacy to an idea that would be articulated by later generations  of ecologists, namely, “all of the environment is a social environment”  (Katcher and Wilkins 187); there is “continuous reciprocity between  humans and nature” (Kellert, “The Biological Basis” 54). Thoreau  8 </page> <page sequence="9"> South Atlantic Review moves to the woods, he tells readers, because he is “better known” there  (W 19). He develops an “intimate . . . acquaintance” with the weeds  he eradicates from his garden; he shares his habitat with “the squirrel  tribe” (161, 65). He hikes many miles “to keep an appointment with a  beech-tree,” and pine needles “befriend” him (265, 132). He packs his  book with instances of personification such as these, reporting on his  daily involvement with non-human others and conveying a “sense of  the neighborliness of nature” (Buell 211). As Thomas Pughe comments,  such “anthropomorphic tropes . . . may figure, even epitomize, our in- evitably intermingled and interdependent relations” with nonhuman  nature (256).7  Affiliating with life forms commonly regarded as insentient, like  beech trees or pigweed, Thoreau indulges in humorous hyperbole to  celebrate planet-wide familial ties, using metaphor “to relay not merely  intellectual, but total experience,” to combine “scientific interest, en- vironmental care, and aesthetic appreciation” (Drake 78, Pughe 254).  He lends human traits to elemental forces and processes as well as to  plants and animals, rejoicing in “the friendship of the seasons,” or find- ing his loneliness assuaged by the other planets in the Milky Way (W  131, 133). At times he reverses his strategy, describing human nature or  human occupations in terms of animal behavior, plant growth, or sea- sonal cycles. He compares the cellar of his house to the woodchuck den  it replaces, for example, emphasizing common features in the shelters  constructed by members of disparate species: “the house is still but a  sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow” (45). He enjoys having time  for his “thoughts . . . to take root and unfold themselves” organically,  like a sprouting seed (132). Metaphorically yoking human and non- human phenomena, he attempts to persuade readers that humans are  neither unique nor isolated in the ecosystem. Even in apparently “wild”  and “dreary” surroundings, he is supported by “the presence of some- thing kindred” (13). Walden Pond itself serves as the special focus of Thoreau’s figura- tive language: persistently he invests the pond with human character- istics. It is his “neighbor” and “bed-fellow” (W 86, 272); he refers to  its “face,” “lips,” “beard,” “skin,” “lashes,” and “brows” (86, 311, 181, 294,  186). He likens the annual freezing and thawing of its waters to sleep  or hibernation: in winter it “closes its eyes and becomes dormant,” and  in spring it “stretch[es] and yawn[s] like a waking man” (282, 301). It  commands the power, Thoreau asserts, of expressive emotion (“glee,”  “joy and happiness”) and of mental activity: “liquid thought is well- ing up to its surface” (311,193). He endows it, finally, with metaphysi- cal awareness, describing the annual thawing of the pond’s water in  terms of spiritual regeneration: “Walden was dead and is alive again”  9 </page> <page sequence="10"> Judith P. Saunders (311). At the core of his book readers encounter “an almost animistic  evocation of Walden as a living presence” (Buell 208). In portraying his  central symbol, Thoreau persistently harnesses the force of metaphor  to compel recognition of far-flung family, to insist upon equivalencies  and commonalities linking the human animal with other portions of  the biosphere. The Ecosystem as Living Entity Inclusive fitness theory typically predicts that affiliative and nepotistic  tendencies will be correlated with genetic closeness: the more genes  shared, the stronger the loyalties inspired. As discussion thus far has  made clear, Thoreau operates according to a generous construction of  kinship, egalitarian in spirit, one not regulated by mathematical cal- culations of relatedness. Humans regularly expand their perception  of kinship networks, in fact, when they begin thinking of a coalition,  tribe, or nation as a fraternity or brotherhood. A related phenomenon  is that of fictional or ascribed kinship, which anthropologists en- counter world-wide. It is necessary only to extend an appreciation of  relatedness slowly farther, step by step, to acknowledge even distant  life-forms as kin.8 We may begin with “selfish genes,” but we can uti- lize genetic ‘selfishness’ to widen rather than to narrow the range of  our affiliations; we can extend our nepotistic loyalties “progressively  outward until we end with the whole Earth” (Rolston 381). From the  perspective of evolutionary time, moreover, a narrow view of inclusive  fitness makes little sense: “selves survive a little while; but all the while,  really, the ecosytem in which the self lives is the fundamental unit of  development” (Rolston 394).9 Richard Dawkins describes “the river of  DNA flowing down through the generations, only temporarily housed  in particular bodies” (28). Taking the long view, “it seldom matters  whether . . . genes are inside me, inside my cousin, or inside a chimpan- zee. Indeed, it may not matter whether they are inside me or inside an  oyster or an ant” (Rolston 407). This is precisely Thoreau’s point when  he cheerfully relinquishes his crop to woodchucks, birds, or worms:  “ecocentrism replaces egocentrism” (Buell 155). He subscribes to the  notion that “selves have intertwined destinies with the landscapes they  inhabit” (Rolston 407). It was obvious to Thoreau, as Krutch maintains,  “that man was a part of nature, not nature a part of man . . . so that the  merely human was swallowed up in the natural” (186). Thoreau’s pronounced propensity to assign feeling and intention to  inorganic phenomena—water, ice, soil, rain, sun, wind—helps to dem- onstrate the holistic quality of his thinking. One species “merges into  10 </page> <page sequence="11"> South Atlantic Review another, groups melt into ecological groups until the time when what  we know as life meets and enters what we think of as non-life: barnacle  and rock . . . and rain and air” (Kellert, “The Biological Basis” 55). His  observations as a naturalist lead Thoreau to reflect upon resemblances  he discovers across three seemingly disparate kingdoms. Waxing elo- quent over the multitudinous shapes created in the flowing “sand and  clay” of a thawing sandbank, he perceives essential commonalities in  a wide variety of animal, vegetable, and mineral forms (W 304). He is  struck in particular by the insight that a single “principle,” or design,  appears to serve as the basis for thousands of structures, animate and  inanimate. “Citing foliation in all its forms as the essential type of natu- ral growth,” he exults to witness how the “idea” of the leaf repeats itself  with variations in a bird’s wing, a coral plant, a leopard’s paw, a bird’s  foot, and an ice crystal, as well as in a human hand, ear, or lung (Hoag  157, W 306). “Lava-like,” representations of all these forms are “burst- ing out” in ever shifting patterns of sand and clay: the base plan of all  organic design seems vitally manifest in the soil itself (W 305). He puts  forward a proposition resembling the Gaia hypothesis now garnering  attention from ecologists: “all living beings together (the biota) behave  as a single integrated system with properties more akin to systems of  physiology than those of physics” (Sagan and Margulis 352).10 Engaging in linguistic playfulness and baroque elaboration through- out his much admired encomium to the sandbank, Thoreau grounds  his conceit, like his insights, in observed physical similarities.11 “While  he does not speak the emerging language of natural selection or the  modern language of biocentrism,” Robinson comments, “he is clearly  beginning to conceptualize both these perspectives and consider their  implications” (“Thoreau” 74). Saluting the diversity emerging from un- derlying unity, he goes on to personify “the earth”: “inwardly” it “labors  with the central “idea” of leaf (W 306). Taking a panoramic view, as if  he were looking down at the planet’s surface, he concludes that such  a perspective would reveal “still vaster leaves,” with rivers forming the  veins (W 307). The planet as a whole appears to be a macroscopic ver- sion of the shape that is everywhere manifest in individual earthly phe- nomena: “Gaia is simply symbiosis seen from space,” the “global life and  environment, the planetary surface seen as body rather than place,”  Sagan and Margulis similarly contend (352, 352). Thoreau regards the  planet itself as a living entity: “the earth is all alive and covered with  papillae” (W 302). He presents a modern view of the ecosystem, which  is “as real, as ultimate, as any genetic self” (Rolston 396). Arguing decisively against a homocentric approach to existence,  Thoreau reminds readers that “the universe is wider than our views of  it” (W 320). Even the planet we inhabit is but one in “a system of earths”  11 </page> <page sequence="12"> Judith P. Saunders (10). From first to last he urges us to make peace with our personal  insignificance, to recognize the “somewhat inconsequential roles”  humans play “in the larger drama of which they are a part” (Robinson  80).12 Asking us to hoe our beans in the “light” of cosmic vastness (W  10), he demonstrates a “philosophical humility largely absent from  the predominant religions and philosophies of the day” (Robinson,  “Thoreau” 80). “All life, he feels, is one, and it is to the All, not merely  the small human segment, that he wishes to belong” (Krutch 188). The  recognition of universal interconnectedness can prove liberating, fur- thermore, because it reduces the importance of direct fitness. Since  so much of the DNA in any one individual, even that in members of  now extinct species, is passed on collaterally by all manner of distant  relatives, the earth’s inhabitants—past, present, and future—in effect  belong to a single, enormous gene-pool (see Dawkins 27-29, Wilson,  Biophilia 43-44). Regarded as a multifaceted yet coherent whole, nature  manifests an “unequalled fertility,” Thoreau avers, and thus “is likely  to outlive all her children” (W 176-38). He rejoices in the reproduc- tive success of his multitudinous kin, expressing implicit contentment  with the high degree of inclusive fitness that he, like every organism on  earth, inevitably enjoys. Taking this “wider . . . view” of lineage enables Thoreau to assume a  nonchalant attitude toward personal fitness and, significantly, toward  ensuing competition in the social arena (W 320). Struggles to accumu- late resources and achieve status may be motivated by proximate goals  of various kinds, but the ultimate goals such struggles serve are those  of direct fitness: mating and reproduction. Individuals who succeed in  building wealth and reputation enjoy enhanced mating opportunities  and command means to rear offspring successfully (Buss 22-27, 46-48,  59, 285-86). Thoreau’s indifference to individual reproductive success,  which reflects his perception of the extensive kinship network linking  all organic life, permits him to reject “the kind of life men praise and  regard as successful” (W 19). He need not seek to acquire elite employ- ment, prestigious alliances, luxurious furniture, imported foods, or  fashionable apparel. From the perspective of “ecological and then evo- lutionary change,” as Wilson observes, moment-by-moment concerns  of “biography and political events . . . shrink steadily in proportion”  (Biophilia 144). The sources of Thoreau’s disaffection with the materi- alism, technophilia, and professionalism dominating mid-nineteenth- century America are many-stranded, inevitably, but his biocentric  analysis of the human condition provides a firm foundation for his  stalwart rejection of social rewards and encumbrances.13   Inevitably his disparagement of community values includes unstat- ed defiance of typical life-history assumptions: he pays scant attention  12 </page> <page sequence="13"> South Atlantic Review in Walden to mating and parenthood, issues generally regarded as cen- tral to human endeavor. In his encounter with John Field’s large and  hungry family, he indicates that his principles for living might well be  consistent with providing for dependents, but he does not tackle the  question directly.14 Biographers have sought to account for his silence  on this topic, speculating that romantic disappointment, homoerotic  yearnings, or sexual squeamishness, for instance, might account for it.15  Such explanations, whether true or not, fail to place Thoreau’s attitude  toward marriage and children in the larger context of the “kindred- ship . . . in Nature” he consistently celebrates (W 159). As Joseph Wood  Krutch justly remarks, “Thoreau himself would have been astonished  at the suggestion that a passion for nature was inexplicable except on  the theory that it substituted for some other passion which had been  frustrated” (33). He constructs no argument against individual repro- ductive efforts; he adopts a perspective, rather, from which these may  come to seem relatively unimportant. Given the universal relatedness  everywhere manifest in the natural world, genetic continuity is inevi- table. It is planetary life as whole that is valuable, Thoreau suggests,  rather than the continued existence of any one individual or species.  The task of eco-proliferation is so broadly shared that the contribution  of any one organism is miniscule. Affiliating with the “great central  life” of the planet, he construes family and, by extension, fitness, in the  widest possible sense (W 309). In considering whether such insistence on universal kinship and  corresponding disinterest in personal fitness might prove to be adap- tive, prevailing environmental conditions must be taken into account.  During the nineteenth century, the human population was experi- encing such unprecedented growth that the species, together with its  technological modifications of habitat, was beginning to threaten the  well-being of the planet. Thoreau lived and wrote at a moment when it  became possible for persons with scientific knowledge and imaginative  sensibilities to realize the threat humans posed to the natural world  and, concomitantly, to their self-interest as a species (see Walls, Seeing  187-88). In the decades since his death, human activity has precipi- tated wide-scale extinctions, polluted groundwater, lakes, and oceans,  and punctured protective layers of ozone. Meanwhile human popu- lation growth has continued to accelerate. Modern environmentalists  consequently support principles that elevate planetary fitness above  personal fitness, emphatically endorsing the point of view Thoreau ad- opted on the basis of evidence available in his day (Wilson, “Biophilia  and the Conservation” 39-40, Kellert, “The Biological” 65). Rolston,  for one, argues that our species needs to be “released from an ethics  that is nothing but selection for maximum production of human off- 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> Judith P. Saunders spring” in order to affirm “biophilia and concern for environmental in- tegrity” (414, 412). From the perspective of twenty-first century readers,  a nepotism divorced from egocentric weighting looks more adaptive  than “fanciful” (Buell 128). Determined to “live deliberately,” Thoreau  in effect proposes a conscious reconfiguring of evolved mechanisms for  kin selection (W 90).  Competition and Conservation A sense of cosmic kinship tends to reduce the intensity of competition  between individuals and between species, at the same time fostering a  conservationist spirit. Thoreau clearly is committed to biodiversity, a  crucial component of twenty-first-century environmentalism, and he  manifests a concomitantly respectful and protective attitude toward all  life forms (Wilson, Biophilia 131-32, Rolston 410-11). His appreciation  of the intrinsic, intangible value in every insect, shrub, rodent, and  pebble dovetails as well with emerging awareness of the “nonmonetary  . . . value” of natural resources (Ulrich 115). Refusing to “carry the land- scape . . . to market,” he valorizes the non-commercial benefits it yields  (W 196). Wilson credits Thoreau with having articulated “the first ele- ments” of “a global land ethic” (“A Letter” xxiv, xxiii). Thoreau insisted,  moreover, that “nature is not elsewhere, but everywhere, and all the  land holy, not just a few last, best places” (Walls, “Believing” 24). His noncompetitive philosophy is further buttressed by his often  expressed confidence that nature’s plenty is inexhaustible, more than  sufficient for the needs of all the earth’s diverse inhabitants. He tells his  readers that it costs “incredibly little trouble to obtain one’s necessary  food,” even in a New England climate, if one adopts “as simple a diet as  the animals” (W 61). If one aspires only to self-sufficiency, losses sus- tained to other creatures during the growth or storage of crops become  manageable. The individual who can “do with less” is “richer” indeed,  better equipped for survival in a world of volatile natural forces, than  one who requires more (23). Biophilic philosophy accounts in large  measure for Thoreau’s conviction that the quest to accumulate resourc- es in excess of need (“more warmth . . . richer food, larger and more  splendid houses”) is unnatural and unsatisfying (15). Information he  obtained through his reading about diverse human cultures, ancient  and modern, further convinced him that “the basic necessities of man’s  physical life had not changed much over the long course of the centu- ries; even the means of acquiring them had changed less than might  be supposed” (Christie 215). In his discussions of railroad workers or  displaced aboriginal populations, he offers evidence that the human  14 </page> <page sequence="15"> South Atlantic Review animal’s pursuit of material luxury has led to the many miseries associ- ated with social and economic stratification, “the luxury of one class . .  . counterbalanced by the indigence of another” (W 34). Advocating a non-homocentric sharing of planetary resources,  Thoreau clearly is convinced that he will not lose everything to wee- vils or woodchucks: he can afford to share because there always will  be enough left for him. A committed locovore before his time, he ad- vises readers to minimize the effort needed to sustain themselves by  relying on locally available foods rather than “depend on distant and  fluctuating markets” (W 63). He points out that it is cheapest and most  efficient to plant those crops already adapted to regional growing con- ditions (63). Hence grains like rye and corn contribute significantly to  his diet, and he proves by experimentation that he can make or obtain,  on the spot, a number of foods that his neighbors import at consid- erable cost and inconvenience. He can make sweeteners from home- grown “pumpkins or beets,” for instance, or tap local maple trees for  syrup (64); he notes that he could get his own salt without traveling far.  Repeatedly he identifies unutilized local resources. He also makes use of wild foods, sustaining himself in part with  nuts, berries and wild apples he collects in the vicinity of his Walden  home; during his first year there he also eats fresh-caught fish. He is  a knowledgeable gatherer, utilizing his familiarity with his habitat to  exploit its resources effectively. Instead of regarding squirrels solely  as competitors, for example, he respects them as allies in the quest  for food and profits from their instinctive knowledge: he gleans their  “half-consumed nuts” because “the burrs they had selected were sure  to contain sound [centers]” (W 238). He locates groundnuts and acorns  in the vicinity, preparing sample batches in Native American fashion.  He does not adopt either as a staple in his diet, but he is glad to dis- cover that such food sources, currently unexploited, are readily avail- able.  His goal is to make plain the many unused or under-utilized food  sources all around us in the natural world, to recognize the “promise of  Nature to rear her own children and feed them simply” (239). He goes on to remind us that cultivated crops are far more vulnerable  to ecological disasters than are wild-growing plants. If “wild Nature”  were to “reign” again, he warns, “the tender and luxurious English  grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes . . . but the now  almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish . . .  and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter  tribe” (W 239). His cautions sound eerily like those E. O. Wilson would  make in the 1980’s: “we have come to depend completely on less than 1  percent of living species for our existence, with the remaining waiting  untested and fallow” (Biophilia 132). Thoreau is determined to under- 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> Judith P. Saunders take such neglected testing, to explore the extent of nature’s bounty. He  would be unsurprised by the statistics biologists currently have amassed:  they estimate the existence of “at least 75,000” sources of unutilized but  edible vegetation, “and many of these are superior to the crop plants in  use” (Wilson, Biophilia 132). For readers living in a natural world largely  “cut to pieces, mowed down, plowed under, gobbled up,” his experiment  in simplicity, with its emphasis on appreciative investigation of local re- sources, appears ever more prescient, an adaptive response to environ- mental deterioration (Wilson “A Letter” xxii). Nature’s Mysteries Despite the constant quest to investigate nature that has characterized  humans since hunter-gathering days, our species is dismayed by the  prospect of knowing or taming the natural world completely. This is  an intriguing aspect of the biophilia hypothesis, one Wilson considers  at some length. “The greater the knowledge” we acquire abut the natu- ral world, he muses, “the deeper the mystery” that remains—and we  would have it no other way: “Nature is to be mastered, but (we hope)  never completely” (Biophilia 10). Thoreau’s views on this point mirror  Wilson’s: “At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all  things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that  land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us be- cause unfathomable” (W 317-18). We require contact with “the vastness  and strangeness of nature,” he maintains (171). Life in towns and cities  is tenable only because the world of nature remains accessible. “Our  village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and  meadows which surround it,” Thoreau declares: “we need the tonic of  wildness” (317). Even the spectacle of violent interspecies competition assures us of  nature’s “inexhaustible vigor” (W 318). Luckily, Thoreau reminds his  readers, they need not go far from settled communities to find hidden  pockets of “strangeness”: “It is remarkable how many creatures live wild  and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain themselves in the  neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only” (227). Only our  own apathy can prevent us from investigating and enjoying nature’s rich  variety: “there is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we  tolerate incredible dulness” (332). Thoreau anticipates Wilson’s conten- tion that “our intrinsic emotions drive us to search for fresh habitats,  to cross unexplored terrain,” asserting that “we still crave the sense of a  mysterious world stretching infinitely beyond” (Biophilia 76). 16 </page> <page sequence="17"> South Atlantic Review Nature as Restorative Biophilia theory culminates in the proposition that humans need to  foster a relationship with nature in order to enjoy full psychological and  emotional health. “There can be no very black melancholy,” Thoreau  asserts, “to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still”  (W 131). Although we live daily lives that are very disconnected, for the  most part, from the natural world, Wilson reminds us that “the brain  evolved into its present form over a period of about two million years  . . . during which people existed in hunter-gatherer bands in intimate  contact with the natural environment” (Biophilia 101). From these an- cestors we inherit an inclination to involve ourselves with the natural  world, to learn about it, to grapple with its dangers, beauties, and mys- teries. Examining the adaptive value of close contact with the natural  environment from a “functional-evolutionary perspective,” Ulrich con- cludes that such contact fosters a “recharging of energy” and thus may  “enhance survival chances” (98, 99). Even simple enjoyment of “the  quiet motion of pond life,” research suggests, may promote “physiolog- ical relaxation” or “better problem solving” (Katcher and Wilkins 177).  Some of the most compelling research supporting the biophilia hy- pothesis explores the psychological and physiological damage caused  by humans’ increasing disconnection from nature, together with the  manifold benefits to be obtained by deliberate acts of reconnection.16 Predisposed to associate nature with vital, even curative, energies,  humans invest it with significance: “we are in the fullest sense a bio- logical species,” Wilson explains, “and will find little ultimate mean- ing apart from the remainder of life” (Biophlia 81). One of Thoreau’s  chief purposes is to communicate exactly this conviction. Persistently  he compares natural phenomena to celestial ones, investing nature  with transcendent significance by means of metaphor and analogy.  Declaring that “Olympus is but the outside of the earth every where,”  he assures us that the natural world we live in is, in very fact, super- naturally wondrous (W 85). “Reflecting the sky,” Walden Pond is “a  lower heaven” (86). Its water is comparable to “the sacred water of the  Ganges,” endowed by implication with holy and healing effects (298).  Associating a humble New England pond with regenerative potency,  Thoreau demands awe and reverence for the natural world in its most  commonplace manifestations. His strategy is to insist that the ordinary  is extraordinary: the ponds near his home are “great crystals on the  surface of the earth, Lakes of Light,” more valuable than “the diamond  of Kohinoor” (199). The common trees in his neighborhood, whether  pine, or black-birch, or dogwood, are “temples” or “shrines,” inspiring  “worship” (201, 202). 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> Judith P. Saunders Involving himself in natural cycles of regeneration, he, the human,  is reinvigorated: like the thawing pond, he finds that he is “alive again.”  Likening the “coming in of spring” to “the creation of Cosmos out of  Chaos and the realization of the Golden Age,” he places the re-making  of the natural world, which occurs each year, in a profound context  (W 313).17 Marveling at nature’s energies, Thoreau expresses “the ca- thedral feeling” Darwin described in response to seeing the results of  nature’s prolixy in a tropical forest: “wonder, astonishment, and sub- lime devotion, fill &amp; elevate the mind” (qtd. in Wilson, Biophilia 27).  Readers of Walden encounter the same expression of reverence and  awe in Thoreau’s evocations of the natural environment in Concord,  Massachusetts. Nineteenth-century versions of pantheism provide  him with a vehicle to exalt the regenerative organic interconnectedness  he discovers everywhere around him.18  Biophilia and Walden  Point for point, Thoreau articulates in his book ideas and values com- patible with those Edward O. Wilson would gather together under the  concept of “biophilia” more than a hundred years later. He expresses the  foundational biophilic conviction that every individual needs a close re- lationship with nature, in all its wildness and variety, in order to thrive,  and he further implies that this need is an inherent part of human  nature. He argues in passionate detail that “improved means” of agricul- ture, industry, and technology have disrupted the original relationship  between the human species and the natural world (W 52). As corrective,  he undertakes an experimental re-immersion in nature, demonstrating  how the experience contributes to increased emotional health, mental  alertness, aesthetic pleasure, and psychic renewal. Investigating his im- mediate environment closely, he offers evidence that all living organisms  and elemental phenomena are kin; he comes to appreciate his position  as an individually insignificant member of a coherent ecological whole.  He acts on these perceptions by extending nepotistic affiliations and loy- alties beyond himself and even beyond his species, concluding that all  life forms have equal claim on planetary resources. Thus he rejects the  idea of homocentricity. Instead he highlights conservationist principles,  particularly that of biodiversity; he models living simply and without  waste, relying on local resources. At the same time, he promotes the idea  of interaction and sharing across species. Adopting “wider . . . views” of fitness, he celebrates a planet-wide  network of ancestry and descent; in this larger context, he implies,  personal reproduction is an irrelevant goal. The individual organism is  18 </page> <page sequence="19"> South Atlantic Review merely “a sojourner in nature” (W 37). Thoreau’s evolutionarily expan- sive understanding of inclusive fitness not only supports ecosystemic  health, it frees him from competition for status and wealth in the social  environment. Ignoring or rejecting the reproductive goals motivating  so much human behavior, he extricates himself from a host of societal  constraints and directives.19 Biophilia provides the logical launching- ground for his socioeconomic philosophy, rendering explicable, in  fitness terms, behavior that otherwise might be labeled maladaptive.  Indeed, his powerful identification with the well being and continuity  of the biosphere as a whole serves as necessary context for his most  controversial social criticisms and personal renunciations. Notes 1. In The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the  Formation of American Culture, Lawrence Buell offers a detailed though “not  exhaustive inventory of Thoreau’s range of motives and analytical equipment  in approaching nature” (134). He notes the emergence of ecocritical and eco- feminist interest in Thoreau’s work, making only brief mention of E.O. Wilson,  biophilia, and “the evolutionary hypothesis” (9, 215-218, 386, 188). 2. References throughout are to The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau: Walden, ed.  J. Lyndon Shanley (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1971). 3. Sherman Paul discusses in detail Thoreau’s use of paradisiacal allusions to  invest Walden Pond with divine qualities (“A Fable” 109-110, 113-115). 4. Reviewing Thoreau’s revisions to the original draft of Walden, Buell in- dicates that these “show an irregular movement toward discovery, retrieval,  and respect for the realm of physical nature whose substantial reality must  be honored in the face of the desire to appropriate it for one’s own use” (178).  Commenting from a biographical perspective, Krutch similarly concludes that  Thoreau moved “away from the transcendental assumption that the meaning  of nature can be reached by intuition and toward . . . scientific observation”  (175). Walls confirms and supports this assessment (Seeing 115). 5. In his rejection of the notion of spontaneous generation, Thoreau distin- guished himself from contemporaries such as Horace Greeley, Louis Agassiz,  and Ralph Waldo Emerson (McGregor 190). 6. This recognition of kinship with woodchucks does not stop Thoreau from  later announcing a desire to “seize and devour” one “raw” (W 210). He ex- plains his urge as principally a symbolic one: he is “hungry” to assimilate the  “wildness” the animal embodies (W 210). Examining some twenty references  to woodchucks in Walden, John Bird concludes that “respect” for this animal  predominates (141).  7. Scott McVay defends the anthropomorphism often associated with biophilic  discussion—and obviously inherent in many of the rhetorical devices Thoreau  19 </page> <page sequence="20"> Judith P. Saunders favors—as a legitimate component of “acceptable science” (17). He contends  that “any kind of deeper truth about the fellow organisms with whom we share  space” requires some degree of “intimacy in observation and reporting” (17). 8. For detailed discussion of the implications of planet-wide extended kinship,  see Burghardt and Herzog: “Beyond Conspecifics: Is Brer Rabbit Our Brother?” 9. “Across a thousand years, the approximate threshold interval of evolutionary  time,” Wilson points out, “individuals lose most of their relevance as biological  units” (Biophilia 43-44, author’s emphasis). 10. The idea of Gaia initially was put forward by James Lovelock in Gaia: A New  Look at Life on Earth (New York: Oxford UP, 1979). Scigaj and Simmons point  out that Thoreau’s insistence on “the biocentric value of all life” proves “sur- prisingly congruent with the central tenets of ecofeminism” as well (124, 121). 11. This rich passage has generated comment from a variety of perspectives— psychological, historical, literary, linguistic, scientific, and religious; Gordon  V. Boudreau ably summarizes and categorizes many of these (see 125-131).  Andrew McMurry addresses the passage at some length (135-140), emphasiz- ing that “for Thoreau, what counts is the aliveness of the whole planet” (138).  According to Max Oelschlager, the passage illustrates Thoreau’s intuitive grasp  of “fundamental evolutionary principles,” namely, that complex forms evolve  from simpler ones” (164). Leo Marx discusses Thoreau’s “endless creation of  new forms” here in the context of pastoral defiance of the machine age (262).  Most intriguingly of all, perhaps, Boudreau points out that the passage seems  to anticipate the final paragraph in The Origin of Species, where Darwin ex- amines the teeming life represented on a single overgrown bank, noting the  different yet interdependent “forms” it assumes (127-28). 12. In her analysis of Thoreau’s response to emerging evolutionary science, Nina  Baym comes to different conclusions, arguing that Thoreau discerned and re- pudiated the negative implications of Darwin’s work: he refused to accept “the  irrelevance of man in the universe” (234).   13. See, for instance, discussions of Thoreau’s economic philosophy by Leo  Stoller and Michael T. Gilmore. 14. Krutch notes that “there is no evidence to suggest that Thoreau . . . advocat- ed universal celibacy.” Thoreau acknowledges that a person with dependents  “would need more than he did . . . . but such a man would also . . . need less  than he thought” (88).  15. Llewelyn Powys, for one, suggests that Ellen Sewell’s rejection of Thoreau’s  marriage proposal “helped to dry up his already somewhat sapless nature” (55).  Richard Bridgman also comments on Thoreau’s possible sexual timidity, “his  inability to come to terms with the quite powerful feelings that were torment- ing him” (119). Walter Harding points out that Thoreau “delighted in jibing at  women and at marriage,” speculating that he “was able to sublimate his love for  the opposite sex in a worship of the world of nature” (110, 104). 20 </page> <page sequence="21"> South Atlantic Review 16. Some of this research is presented and discussed in The Biophilia  Hypothesis; see, for example, essays by Katcher and Wilkins, by Ulrich, by Orr,  and by Kellert. 17. Many readers have discussed the centrality of the theme of rebirth in  Walden, analyzing the analogies and metaphors Thoreau invokes in this con- text. See, for example, commentary by Sherman Paul, Lauriat Lane, Jr. (74-76),  Stanley Edgar Hyman (28-29), and Walter Drake (72-74). 18. There is a discernible line of causal connection between Romantic philos- ophy, particularly its idealization of nature, and the changes precipitated in  Europe and America by rapid growth in industry and technology. Emerging just  as natural environments were undergoing radical degradation, Romanticism  expresses a collective response to thwarted biophilia. It forms a critical part  of the biocultural framework in which Thoreau’s views take shape. Robert  Sattelmeyer justly observes that “a thoroughgoing Transcendentalist naturalist  would find it easier to accept organic evolution than special creation,” includ- ing a “dynamic” rather than a hierarchical conception of nature (88). “Holism  . . . pervaded romantic science,” moreover, as William Rossi emphasizes (32). 19. Readers long have tended to dichotomize Thoreau’s ideas, attempting  to explain the “distance between the social and the natural” in his thinking  (Cameron 24). He enjoys “two separate reputations,” as social critic on the one  hand, and as nature writer on the other (Krutch 287). Exploring the supposed  “nature/culture opposition” in his thinking, readers wonder whether his work  “is meant as an appeal from culture for nature, or as a reproach from nature  against culture” (McMurry 121, 131). Viewed through the lens of biophilia, the  relationship between these two thematic strains in Walden becomes much  clearer. Thoreau “subordinates human presence” to an all-encompassing affili- ation with the natural world (Cameron 154).
