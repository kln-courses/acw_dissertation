<plain_text><page sequence="1">God, Trade and Worship A Glimpse into the Religion of Early Andhradesa by P. Krishna Mohan Reddy In the present article, an attempt is made to highlight some aspects of religion of early Andhradesa (from c. 300 B.C. to c. 250 A.D.) which have not received adequate attention from scholars. For this purpose the epigraphical material from places like Nasik, Karle etc., is also used, since they formed part of the S?tav?hana empire. There is no unanimity of opinion among scholars regarding the date of Buddhism in Andhra. Some scholars hold that Buddhism in Andhra was pre-Asokan (x). Though Buddhism was pre-Asokan in Andhra the idea of Buddha himself preaching Buddhism in Andhra was however criticized (2). How could the new religion of_ Buddhism invade' Andhra? What were the factors responsible for the people of Andhra accepting Buddhism so enthusiastically? There might have been several reasons. One of the reasons could be the 'megalithic background' of the Andhra people to which not much attention has sofar been paid. We mean by this that the worship of the stupas and symbols like circles, swastikas etc. was not new to the megalithic folk in Andhra (3). In Andhra megalithism was continuously practised for several centuries, running well into historical period (4). Its continuity in a somewhat modified form is also indicated by the occurrence of a cremation ground of Iksv?kus at Nagarjunakonda. Here each burial was marked by an erected stone reminiscent of menhirs (5). The period from c. 600 to 100 B.C. is termed as the active megalithic period in Andhra (6). It was during this period (around (x) K.R. Subrahmanyan, Buddhist Remains in Andhra and the History of ?ndhra Buddhism between 225 &amp; 610 A.D., 1932 (repr., Delhi 1989), pp. 1-2; B.S.L. Hanumantha Rao, Religion in ?ndhra, Hyderabad 1993, pp. 54-55. (2) Subrahmanyan, op. cit., p. 1; A.M. Shastry, 'Some Aspects of Buddhism in ?ndhra Pradesh', in A.M. Shastry, ed., Early History of the Deccan, Problems and Perspectives, Delhi 1987, p. 102. (3) This notion does not ignore the implications of the fact that megalithism was also practised in several parts of North India. But in South India, especially in Andhra, it was more profound. (4) See K.P. Rao, Deccan Megaliths, Delhi 1988, pp. 19-32. (5) Indian Archaeology 1958-59, p. 8, pi. VI A. (6) Rao, op. cit., p. 134. [1] 291</page><page sequence="2">300 B.C.) that Buddhism entered Andhra. The megalithic folk who worshipped burials like dolmens and menhirs easily accepted the new faith which was nothing but an extension of their custom. In other words the 'burials' (i.e., the st?pas) were more elaborate in size, shape, architecture and grandeur but the basic idea and theme were similar in both the 'st?pa' and the megalithic burial monument. Likewise, the symbols like the wheel, swastika etc., which were symbols of worship in Buddhism were also venerable to the megalithic folk of Andhra (7). They also followed the custom of erecting anthropomorphic figures (8). One cannot deny the role played by the Buddhist monks both 'historic' and 'humble' (unknown because they did not enter 'history') in the propagation of Buddhism. The megalithic background of the masses quickened and amplified this process generated by the monks. The fact that the megalithic culture succeeded and sometimes overlapped into the historic period in some of the sites in Andhra strengthens such a suggestion. Probably, the Buddhist religion of symbols and later of anthropomorphism was embraced by them, though the doctrines of Buddhist philosophy had little in common with their own understanding of the spirit, soul and life after death (9). Several works dealing with the early history of Andhra comment that Buddhism was a popular religion in Andhra and numerous Buddhist centres spread all over Andhradesa (10). This appears true only in the case of Coastal ?ndhra. The Buddhist centres are scanty in the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. The general remarks that Buddhism was a popular movement in Andhra perhaps needs some scrutiny. The large_ number of st?pas of the Coastal Andhra region are attributed to the whole of the Andhra region, which gives an incorrect picture of the spread and patronage of Buddhism in Andhra. (7) The symbols of the wheel and swastika are engraved on some megalithic monuments from Andhra. See V.V. Krishna Sastry, The Proto and Early Historic Cultures of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad 1983, p. 109, pi. 17 (b). These symbols are also drawn on a dolmen from Mallayapalli, Chittoor District, a recent discovery by K.P. Rao. The present author also had an opportunity to study them. (8) K.P. Rao, 'A Unique Iron Age Grave Complex from South India'. EW, 41, 1-4, Dec. 1991, pp. 366-67, figs. 3, 4, 5, 6; also see K.P. Rao, 'Beginnings of Sculptural Art in South India', Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, 53, 1992-93, p. 665. (9) This inevitably raises the question ? why did the st?pas spring up in large numbers in select pockets in Andhra in view of their relative paucity in Karnataka and Tamilnadu, though in all three regions megaliths are abundant. This may be partly due to the lack of propagation of Buddhism coupled with the prior presence of dominant non-Buddhistic religions. It is also probable that the chiefs in these regions were indifferent towards Buddhism. In this connection it may be noted that in spite of the tours taken by Asoka for the propagation of Buddhism, the Buddhist st?pas are scanty in Karnataka and South Andhra. Though his edict has been discovered in Erragudi-Rajulamandagiri in Kurnool district, not a single Buddhist monument is known in its vicinity. For further discussion on this aspect see below.

The works of Subrahmanyan, Gopalachari and Hanumantha Rao cited above contain a few of them. Krishnasastry and H. Sarkar, have improved upon them. See Krishnasastry, op. cit., map; H. Sarkar, 'Emergence of Urban Centres in Early Historical Andhradesa', in B.M. Pande &amp; B.D. Chattopadhyaya, eds., Archaeology and History. Essays in Memory of Shri A. Ghosh, Delhi 1987, pp. 631-41 and map. The present list of Buddhist sites in Andhra has been further improved. It is mainly based on R.

KumooI District: 1) Satanikota. Nellore District: 1) Ramatirtham.

Total number of Buddhist sites No. of Buddhist sites Percentage 52 12.2% 14 19.4% 6 8.3% 72 100.0% Not even all these Buddhist sites belong to the same period. Some belong to c. 1st century B.C. and some others to c. 1st century A.D. and still some others still to a later date. Some sites however were continuous from c. 2nd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D. It may be noted that, even in coastal Andhra (8 districts) accounting for 72% of total Buddhist monuments, over 60% i.e., 33 out of 52 Buddhist monuments are concentrated only in 3 districts viz., Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam (Fig. 4). This means that this zone was the heartland of Buddhism. So, taking the number of Buddhist sites in Andhra as a cue, one may not be justified in saying that Buddhism was a popular movement in Andhra. This in no way takes the credit away from Buddhism ? the role it had played in the spheres of religion and society of early Andhradesa. What is emphasized here is that its growth was phenomenal in Coastal Andhra and hence dominant. But its influence on the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions was marginal. This is what the map and table show. The above discussion naturally poses the problematic question of what was (were) the popular religion(s) in the Telangana and Rayalaseema areas? Obviously, this cannot be answered with certainty. Nor can it be stated that Hinduism was the popular religion in these areas. The answers, therefore, can only be conjectured. Some of the pre-Buddhistic religions involving the worship of trees, natural elements, animals and mother goddesses could have been popular. These beliefs were also amalgamated into Hinduism and became part of Hinduism in the course of time, some traces of which persisted into the historical period. It is proposed to treat these beliefs as Hinduism. An attempt may be made to ascertain the status of Hinduism in these regions. Though many st?pas were built between 3rd century B.C. and 2nd century A.D. not many temples are known. This may partially be explained by the fact that the Buddhist st?pas are somewhat easily detectable by their outward appearance. They are generally known to the villagers in Andhra as lanjakanumas or lanjadibbas (prostitute mounds) and hence can be easily located, whereas of the Hindu temples, [5] 295</page><page sequence="6">the early ones are mostly humble structures, flat roofed and unconspicuous in appearance and may thus easily escape our notice. The earliest Hindu temple (or rather place of worship) in Andhra, as is well-known, is the Parasur?meswara temple at Gudimallam in Chittoor district. If it is any guide, we may guess the mode of worship of the Hindus during this period. The linga along with the two ring stones of the pitha and the railing were put up during 2nd century B.C. 'This was a hypaethral temple devoid of any roof over the central object of worship' (13). The recovery of the bones of goat or ram from the corresponding layers suggests a ritualistic practice involving animal sacrifice to the principal deity, in the open (14). No abhiseka took place during this period as there was no provision for draining the abhiseka water. In the subsequent period (c. lst-2nd centuries A.D.) an apsidal temple in brick was built over the linga unit which served as the garbhagrha. It is also important that during this period no abhiseka appears to have been in practice (15). In other regions of Rayalaseema and Telangana also such humble roofless shrines in the open probably existed. A couple of shrines of possible Hindu affiliation are depicted in the Buddhist art from Coastal Andhra datable to c. 2nd century A.D. The Ghantasala plaque (2nd century A.D.) portrays the form of a storeyed structure from which probably the vimdna of the succeeding period "developed. A two-storeyed superstructure is also shown crowned by an octogonal dome and st?pi (16). Another shrine with two storeys is reported from a panel from Jaggayyapeta (17). These shrines are however depicted on the Buddhist structures. In this context, the evidence of Gudimallam is important in more than one respect. Firstly, as the temple and the place is devoid of any Buddhist vestiges, we may reasonably believe that only Hinduism prevailed here from c. 2nd century B.C. to 2nd century A.D. This should be, therefore, free from 'Buddhist' influence and fully 'Hindu' in its conception. This also means that whatever mode of worship (and partly the mode of architecture) performed here may be generally applicable to contemporary Hinduism. Further, no Buddhist sites have been reported from Chittoor district so far. So, we may safely say that Hinduism, i.e., Saivism was the only faith here during the early period. The argument can be extended to the other parts of Rayalaseema and some parts of Telangana. In this connection mention should be made of a group of brick temples at Veerapuram in the Mehboobnagar district belonging to lst-2nd century A.D. In all 14 units were found enclosed within a two-metre wide dry-stone pr?k?ra wall on the banks of the river Krishna. Most of the temple units (10 in number) were (13) I.K. Sarma, The Development of Early Saiva Art and Architecture, Delhi 1982, p. 48. (14) Ibid. (15) Ibid. (16) B. Rajendra Prasad, Art of South India: Andra Pradesh, Delhi 1980, p. 45. (17) Ibid. 296 [6]</page><page sequence="7">entirely in brick and square in plan. The linga in each case is a rolled river pebble of quartzite fixed into the floor of the cella (18). On the basis of equal size of the shrines, each possessing a linga on a pedestal it is believed that these were independent units raised variously by the devotees who frequented this tirtha-ksetra (19). Brick temples of a slightly later period {c. 3rd-4th centuries A.D.) are also reported from Rangpur, Gumakonda, Kudavelli, Sangameswaram in Mehboobnagar district and Siddeswaram in Kurnool district. What is important to note is that, in the areas where the early Hindu structures are encountered, there are no, or only meagre, traces of Buddhism, say, for example in the Chittoor District, Mehboobnagar and Kurnool District. On the other hand, in Coastal Andhra which abounds in Buddhist sites the corresponding Hindu structures are sparser. Does this suggest that the Hindu religious structures flourished only in the areas where Buddhist influence was marginal? As we do not have sufficient data, especially of an archaeological nature, at present, this can at best be hypothetical. One cannot however deny the fact that, during this period, the South Telangana and Rayalaseema regions were congenial to the growth of Hinduism. Probably, the regions of Banavasi and Sannati in Karnataka were also part of this region which also show traces of Hindu structures with a striking paucity of Buddhist structures. The affiliation of S?tav?hanas with these regions of Karnataka and Rayalaseema seems to have been responsible for the growth of Hindu vestiges. In this connection, a word may also be said about the condition of Hinduism during the S?tav?hana period. There seems to be a general notion that Buddhism was dominant and hence S?tav?hanas also favoured Buddhism (20). It is held that the Brahmanical ideology was adopted to legitimize their rule (21). However, it is unclear how the 'legitimation' was achieved by the kings of the Buddhist faith. Did the 'br?hmana legitimators' treat both the 'Brahmanic' and 'Buddhist' kings on a par? One of the latest authors on this subject, on the basis of the silence of sources about the gotra of the S?tav?hanas and the accounts of the Kath?sarits?gara and Dvatrimsatta Puttalika, considers that during those times, a family of such humble origin naturally preferred a non-vedic religion (22). He also remarks that following Asoka's death a movement for the revival of Brahmanism began in the North, spearheaded by the Sungas of Bh?radv?ja gotra. Srimukha and Kanha grew wiser by the example of their father and seem to have changed over to Bh?gavatism, as (18) Sarma, op. cit., p. 88. (19) Ibid., p. 89.

[7] 297</page><page sequence="8">suggested by their names (23). If there was a revival of Br?hmanism after Asoka, then even S?tav?hana (supposedly the first king) would have certainly opted for Brahmanism and not Buddhism (24). The king S?tav?hana, according to this view, finds no place in the Puranic lists because of his non-Brahmanical religion which was also the cause of his overthrow (25). If such were the case, can we ascribe Brahmanical faith to all the S?tav?hana kings mentioned in the Pur?nas} The Naneghat record of N?ganik? (26) describes the sacrifices the king S?takarni I performed and the daksinas he gave away, which indicate his personal faith in Hinduism. The Nasik inscription of Rsabhadatta mentions that he donated 16 villages to gods and br?hmanas, fed thousands of br?hmanas every year, had several of them married, visited ksetras like Dasapura, Govardhana etc., where he performed mah?d?nas, thereby suggesting the prevalence of Brahmanic religion centred around pilgrimage, d?nas and vratas prescribed by the Pur?nas (27). In the Nasik inscription of Gautami B?lasri, Gautamiputra S?takarni is compared with the epic and Puranic heroes R?ma, Kesava, Balar?ma, Arjuna, Bhima, Nahusa and N?bh?ga which reveals the presence and popularity of their worship. It also indicates the existence of Hindu mythology and theology during this period. Gautamiputra S?takarni is also described as the ekabrahmana and Vinivartita Caturvarna Samkara. This view has been criticized, as his son married a Saka princess and so showed 'how saka mlechhas and S?tav?hanas were getting mixed up' (28). Elsewhere the same author says 'the sakas were treated almost as Ksatriyas and local ruling families had marriage alliances with them' (29). It is also said that the 'few available records (only two) contain not even the slightest evidence in support of the high sounding Brahmanical titles conferred on him in the (Nasik) record' (30). The S?tav?hanas were no patrons of Buddhism, they could not ignore it as Buddhism was predominant in Deccan and supported by the 'rich peasant, artisan and merchant classes who formed the financial backbone of the S?tav?hana state'. 'Hence no S?tav?hana king could (23) Ibid. (24) According to Hanumantha Rao, the proud title of Gautamiputra S?takarni Ksatriya mana mardana would suggest that they were neither br?hmanas nor ksatryas (ibid.y p. 48). The grounds for such a conclusion are, however, not stated. (25) Ibid. (26) J. Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples and the Brahmanical and Jaina Caves in Western India, London 1883, p. 60.

(30) Ibid. 298 [8]</page><page sequence="9">therefore take any anti-Buddhist measures' (31). The S?tav?hanas did not take any such measure. But they did not conceal their personal faith. Gautamiputra S?takarni was not anti-Buddhist. But he must have been a proud practitioner of Hindu faith according to the Nasik inscription. This cannot be interpreted as mere boasting. Even if he could not take any 'anti-Buddhist' measure against the 'financial backbone' of the state, why would his mother paint him in 'Hindu colours' when Buddhism was 'predominant' in Deccan, that too in a Buddhist centre? Can we believe that his comparisons with the epic heroes; his titles of ekabr?hmana and Vinivartita Caturvarna Samkara and Dvijavara kutumba vivardhana would have been agreeable to the visitors of the Buddhist faith? Wouldn't it have been galling to the merchant, artisan and peasant classes who were the 'financial backbones' of the state? It would be reasonable to assume that though Buddhism was widely followed, Hinduism had also its own practitioners. The archaeological evidence may be scanty, partly because the Hindu religious structures were in an incipient stage. But this absence or paucity cannot be taken as an indicator of its trivial presence. The major difference that can be noticed is that Buddhism was enthusiastically expressed by its developed art and architecture while Hinduism was modest in the humble shrines, worship of animals and mother goddess as well as pilgrimage to ttrthas and d?nas, etc., imbued by the Pur?nas. The Buddhist st?pas starting from c. 2nd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D. were large and appealing. But the equally ancient Hindu temples were never of such magnitude. Even the Nagarjunakonda temples, with so great an interval between them and Gudimallam, did not produce any significant examples which could be boasted of as magnificent examples rivalling the Buddhist st?pas in art, architecture and grandeur. However, the Nagarjunakonda temples suggest, by this period, gods like Siva, Visnu, K?rtikeya, Devasena and Kubera were looked upon as forming the religion that we today broadly call 'Hinduism'. It may be assumed, from the evidence provided by Gudimallam, that during c. 2nd century B.C. to 1st century A.D., in Rayalaseema (probably also in South Telangana) the worship of the Hindu deities was performed in the open. Analogies of such worship may be drawn from the occurrence of such lingas on raised platforms, and lingas in the open in Mathura sculptures (32), as well as on some of the coins assigned to c. 3rd-2nd centuries B.C. from Taxila and Ujjain (33). Most of these Hindu structures, in the open, in the course of time were probably reshaped and grew in size. This can be ascertained through excavations, which unfortunately are not being conducted on the desired scale and right direction. (31) Ibid. (32) Sarma, op. cit., p. 60. (33) Ibid. [9] 299</page><page sequence="10">Despite the non-availability of archaeological data, the study of personal names of this period may throw some light on the status of Hinduism. The personal names occurring in the Buddhist inscriptions in places like Amaravati, Nasik, Karle etc., show the influence of Hindu deities like Siva, Visnu, Krsna, Skanda, and so on. As the personal names reflect the beliefs and customs of the contemporary society, they may be useful guides, to some extent, in measuring the influence of a religion. This can be illustrated by an example. An inscription from Kuda records the gift of one Sivama. His sons were Sivap?lita, Sivadatta and Sarpila. Significantly, Sivama's daughters were named as Sivap?lita, Sivadat? and Sarp?. This suggests that though Sivama's name is associated with a Buddhist donation, a profound impact of the God Siva can be suggested on his whole family (34). An attempt is made here to examine statistically the Hindu and Buddhist personal names from some Buddhist centres. This examination is however tentative. For this study, the names which betray unmistakable Buddhist influence like Budha, Budharakhita, Bodhisiri, Samgha, Dharma, Ananda, Siddh?rtha, Suj?ta, Indra, R?hula, etc., are taken as Buddhist names and the names like Kanha, Venhu, Siva, Nanda, Skanda, Candra, etc., as Hindu. Some names were indeterminate as regards Buddhist or Hindu classification and have not been taken into account, although they are very insignificant in number. Table 1 Personal names occurring in the inscriptions (from c. 2nd century B.C. to c. 3rd century A.D.)

In this context, it (34) The table showing the comparative frequency of Hindu and Buddhist personal names is based mainly on L?der's List of Inscriptions. H. L?ders, 'A List of Br?hmi Inscriptions from the earliest times to about A.D. 400 with the exception of those of Asoka', Epigraphia Indica, X, Appendix, pp. 101-57. 300 [10]</page><page sequence="11">may be pointed out that the G?th?saptasati refers to many Hindu gods and legends. It contains references to the marriage between Siva and P?rvati (35). It also refers to Samudramathana (36), R?dha and Krsna (37), Yasoda, Krsna and Gopikas (38). It is no surprise, therefore, that one finds a bulk of personal names, named after the Hindu gods who were worshipped during this period. We have also to look for other evidence of Hindu worship, which did not need any structures and could probably be performed at home. This involves the worship of mother goddess, animals and other objects which were often made in terracotta. The excavations at Peddabankur and Dhulikatta have yielded many terracotta figurines of humans and animals, both handmade and in double moulds. Archaic terracotta figurines were found at Peddabankur in large numbers in the Mauryan and S?tav?hana levels. They are handmade and 'their femininity may indicate the fertility cult' (39). The hands are pinched like pointed masses and the breasts are protruding and pointed. No garments are shown. This kind of figurine has a wide distribution as observed at Yeleswaram (Nalgonda district), Nelakondapalli, Dhulikatta and Peddabankur (Karimnagar district), and Nagarjunakonda (Guntur district) (40). The religious structures at Nagarjunakonda, although belonging to a later period, show some 'polarization' of Hindu and Buddhist structures. The Hindu temples grew up mostly around the citadel and on the bank of the Uttarav?hini Krsn?. Out of the nine temples situated around the citadel, five stood on its western side, verging on the river. Also, about ten temples were found further upstreams (41). The temples identified were built for Siva and Visnu. The important temples were Puspabhadrasv?mi, Sarvadeva, K?rtikeya, Astabhujasv?mi, Devasana and Kubera as well as the Navagraha temples. Even the Asvamedhav?tika was built in the citadel. It is curious that the northern reaches of the Krishna riverside, including the fortified zone, had only Hindu temples. Not a single Buddhist structure is built near the (35) G?th?saptasati, Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay 1915, I 69. (36) Ibid., I 42; II 17; II 51; IV 88. (37) Ibid., I 89.

An ivory seal (dated between c. 1st century B.C. and 1st century A.D.) from Dharanikota (Guntur district) is believed to contain the representation of a shrine of god K?rtikeya and his peacock vehicle. Parabrahmasastry reads the legend as Khamdasalasa. See P.V. Parabrahmasastry, 'Dharanikota Ivory Seal Re-examined', Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India, 12, 1985, p. 60. The excavations from Peddabankur have unearthed an oval structure (c. 1st century A.D.) which has been described by the excavators as a shrine (Indian Archaeology 1970-71, pp. 2-3, pi. III B).

Similarly, Hindu structures were absent amidst Buddhist structures which were built away from the citadel and the river. This separation of Hindu and Buddhist structures at Nagarjunakonda is taken as a 'deliberate intention to do so at the same time revealing the Royal tendency of patronage of all faiths' (42). If they treated Hinduism and Buddhism with equal reverence then why did they not build a single st?pa in the citadel? On the other hand the Iksv?ku kings were involved directly in the construction of Hindu temples and never directly with the Buddhist structures, though their women folk took an active part in Buddhist constructions. Further, Virapurasadatta endowed a village for the perpetual maintenance of the Puspabhadrasw?mi temple (43). Significantly no villages were endowed to Buddhist establishments. Furthermore, for the establishment of the Astabhujasv?mi temple by the Abhira Vasusena, a confederacy of rulers was set up. The latter included Sivasena of Peribi country, Yavana of Sanjayapuri, Saka Rudrad?man of Avanti and Visnurudrasival?nada S?takarni of Vanav?sa (44). The assemblage of rulers from places like Sanjayapura, Avanti and Vanav?sa indicates that not only the Iksv?kus but many other royal families were followers of Hinduism. The fact that they travelled from their respective countries to Nagarjunakonda on the occasion of the establishment of a Hindu temple reveals that they were inclined towards Hinduism and made sincere efforts to promote Hinduism. During this period no such direct participation or effort was made by the kings to construct Buddhist structures nor did the kings from far off places assemble for such a purpose. Only the queens of the Iksv?ku family took part in the Buddhist establishments, which were some distance from the citadel and river zone. These instances point to a situation where the Hindu and Buddhist establishments, 'in spite of the religious harmony', were somewhat segregated. We may also conjecture that a similar situation existed even during the pre-Iksv?ku period. Only a study of Buddhist monuments covering Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamilnadu as a whole can offer a clear picture of Buddhism vis-?-vis Hinduism. Now, let us turn to the economic aspects of the Buddhist establishments. Jouveau Dubreuil for the first time in 1931 traced the Buddhist monuments along the trade routes (45). His map was not prepared on the basis of any data from literary sources or foreign accounts and the routes were only assumed ones (Fig. 2). Several other (42) R.

The general notion that the Buddhist centres grew up on the trade routes and market centres, on closer scrutiny appears to be only partially correct. Firstly, we do not know the exact number, size and direction of these routes which covered India. The data from the literary texts refer more to north India and need to be corroborated by archaeology. A recent study of trade routes in Ancient India by Prakash Charan Prasad (47), based on literature, differs considerably from that of Jouveau Dubreuil (Fig. 3). And also, several Buddhist monuments are located at some distance from and are unrelated to these trade routes. If they had grown up on trade routes, they would have been located nearer to them. But in a map prepared by (46) Rajendra Prasad, op. cit., pp. 11-13; Amita Ray, op. cit.; Hanumantha Rao, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, 53, 1992-93, pp. 47-48; Sarkar, op. cit., p. 632; H.P.

[13] 303</page><page sequence="14">James Heitzman, we find that they were concentrated in select pockets away from the trade routes (48). In another map by Schwartzberg (49) we note that, in Andhra, not many Buddhist sites are found along the Coastal route or the route passing through the middle (compare with Fig. 3). In fact, most of them are located in the Guntur-Krishna region, far from these routes. Again, if rivers were used for navigation and trade, the Buddhist centres would necessarily grew up along the banks of the rivers, which is not the case (Fig. 4). By combining the two maps of Schwartzberg and Heitzman we can get a clear picture of the connection between trade routes and Buddhist centres (Fig. 5). We may assume that some of the Buddhist sites grew up along the trade routes. But all of them cannot be attributed to the trade routes and trade. While there may be some justification for the trade-route connection for the numerous Buddhist centres in Coastal Andhra, we cannot explain the paucity of these centres in the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. In fact the Telangana region, comprising Adilabad, Karimnagar, Medak and Warangal districts, formed an important route connecting Andhra with Madhyadesa and Uttar?patha. Yet we have only half a dozen st?pas from this area. The corresponding Prakasam-Guntur-Krishna region has as many as 30 such centres. The region of North Telangana was thickly inhabited during the S?tav?hana period and every other village abounds in early historic mounds. The region has been identified as the Mulaka country (50). It is difficult to believe that there was not much trade in such a thickly inhabited region. In fact, one_would expect to find more Buddhist centres in the Telangana than in the Coastal Andhra. The Rayalaseema region must have played an important role in trade. The gold and diamond mines of Anantapur and Chittoor districts are believed to have attracted the Mauryan emperor Asoka. Surprisingly the Buddhist centres are very rare in these regions. The Krishna river in the coastal Andhra is believed to have been used for trade and navigation, as indicated by the presence of Buddhist sites on its banks. But not many sites are reported on the courses of rivers Pennar and Swarnamukhi in Rayalaseema. The discovery of a magnificent sea port trading with both western and oriental countries from c. 3rd century B.C. at the mouth of the Swarnamukhi (51) reveals that the river was used for trade and navigation.

The solitary Buddhist st?pa at Ramatirtham at the mouth of the Pennar river, even according to the trade-route theory, indicates that this river was also used for trade. Then why there is not a single st?pa for the entire length of the Swarnamukhi? Even along the Pennar, except for Ramatirtham, no st?pa is reported. Another significant feature regarding trade routes, though from Tamilnadu, is that, despite the flourishing foreign trade, Arikamedu does not have a single Buddhist structure (53). The same may well be true of Kottapatnam, which has yet to be excavated. The Telangana and Rayalaseema regions are rich in mineral resources like iron, copper, carnelian, agate, beryl, besides forest produce including timber and agroproducts. Yet, in these regions, which account for 10 districts and 5 districts, respectively, there are only 20 Buddhist sites. Didn't the people exploit the rich resources in these regions? Didn't the trade routes exist there? Incidentally, not many Buddhist monuments are known along the route from Maharashtra to Andhra as shown by the map based on literary data. Many Buddhist sites appear where the so-called 'trade routes' do not exist. The above discussion, seems to indicate that the trade-route theory becomes inapplicable to the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. There were indeed many trade routes in these regions, but the Buddhist sites there are not abundant. The reasons for the growth of these centres are manifold and are not very clear at the present state of our knowledge. As we have seen, too much emphasis has been laid on the role of trade and traders in the promotion of Buddhist centres. Let us now examine 'traders'. It is held that Buddhist centres financed trade. They also served as resting places for traders (54). But of all the excavated Buddhist sites of Andhra there is no archaeological proof of any secular dwelling place that could be considered as a halting place for traders. Almost all of them consist of st?pas, caityas and ?r?mas and not secular or utilitarian structures. It is difficult to believe that any traders stopped off in the ?r?mas. In a study on the locational aspects of Buddhist monastic sites (55), it is commented that 'although Buddhist monastic sites were consistently associated with (52) K.P. Rao, Archaeological Investigations in the Swarnamukhi and Ponneri River Valleys, U.G.C. Research Project, Tirupati 1994 (forthcoming); K.P.

Heitzman, op. cit., pp. 131-32. 308 [18]</page><page sequence="19">non-monastic location and with two institutional components ? empire and trade ? which organized the network of permanent settlement, there is little archaeological evidence to suggest that the Buddhist sites themselves had any purely political or economic role. In the vast majority of the cases, monasteries are situated at a distance from the non-monastic structural concentration, e.g. Taxila, Nagarjunakonda, Vaisali, Sanci, Vidisa etc.' (56). There is, furthermore, no artifactual or structural evidence pointing to military storage or industrial functions inside the monasteries (57). This may well be true of some Buddhist sites in Andhra which are located on hill tops, far away from habitations. Aripalem, Kotturu in Visakhapatnam district; Kapavaram, Korukonda, Yerrampalem in East Godavari district; Jilakarragudem in West Godavari district; Mogalrajapuram in Krishna district; Peddamaduru, Rentala, Sitanagaram in Guntur district; Nandalur in Cuddapah district and Karukonda in Khammam district may be cited as examples (58). The contribution of the trader is also believed to be enormous. The collapse of Buddhism is generally attributed to the decline in foreign trade in Andhra. The traders are believed to have contributed significantly to the Buddhist monuments as is suggested by the epigraphs. No statistical study of inscriptions seems to have been made in order to check this notion. One article shows that at Amaravati, the representation of Gahpati Vaniya-Sresti class in inscriptions was 31%. But in other places their representation was insignificant (59) (see Table below).

The table is reproduced here. The analysis is based on L?der's list, Epigraphia Indica, X. [19] 309</page><page sequence="20">Further, in ?ndhra the monasteries did not have any mercantile function (60). Nor did traders donate cash to the Buddhist centres. They usually donated an architectural piece forming a part of a st?pa, caitya, etc. That this too is not as significant as believed is proved by the table above. These architectural pieces were also donated by the other sections of the society. Therefore, materially, traders did not do much more for Buddhist centres in Andhra than the other sections of society. The idea of trade and traders in Buddhist promotion brings two things together: 1) The construction of Buddhist centres, 2) Their logistic support. Clearly, the two things are unrelated. The traders might have played a role in the construction of Buddhist centres. But their logistic support can not be attributed to them because, for food supplies, clothes, etc. the residents of these centres were dependent on the surrounding populations. What we seek to demonstrate is that the wealth generated through trade by traders was not necessarily directed towards the functioning of a Buddhist centre. In may be argued that the support of these centres depended on the faith and belief of the masses around them ? their visits and worships and their hospitality and gifts. In this context it may be noted that the mode of worship in Buddhism was not much different from Hinduism. The Buddhists also offered gifts of clothes, flowers and food which obviously went to the monks. The evidence available at present (or rather its absence) tends to support the involvement of ordinary masses rather than 'wealthy traders' in the support of Buddhist centres in Andhra. Conclusions As noted, there had been many generalized notions on the religion of Early Andhradesa. The first among these is the notion that Buddhism was popular throughout Andhradesa and that Hinduism was inferior in status to Buddhism. The reasons given for this were the humble style of early Hindu architecture as well as the lack of any archaeological data, particularly pertaining to the early historic habitations in Andhra. In the present paper, I have tried to show that Hinduism was equally popular, as the study of personal names suggest. It is held that Buddhism was popular throughout Andhra. It must be noted that Buddhism was marginal in Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. There has likewise been much generalization concerning the 'trade route - Buddhist centres' connection and the role of traders. I have tried to disprove this theory with the aid of archaeological data and a statistical examination of inscriptions. Traders did patronize Buddhism, although not to the exaggerated extent claimed by some scholars. Even among the Buddhist centres, nobody knows how many were 'urban (60) Sarkar, op. cit. 310 [20]</page><page sequence="21">centres' which could support, besides the Buddhist establishment, the huge non? productive, 'trade dependent' populations living in these centres. Some like Amaravati, Dhanyakata, Salihundam, Peddabankur etc., were certainly urban centres. But, regarding many other centres serious doubts may be raised concerning such a suggestion. As pointed out by many scholars, the earlier archaeological work was guided by the zeal for the Buddhist st?pas, and totally ignored early historic habitations. As a result, the true nature of the origin, growth and support of a st?pa site, despite epigraphical evidence, remains somewhat hazy. A majority of the Buddhist centres could also be rural centres. The point is that a Buddhist centre could simply have grown up in a rural centre, unconnected to any trade route or trade. Can we rule out such a possibility? I am aware that this claim is highly provocative. As this is only the preliminary stage of research on this topic, the conclusions reached should be taken tentatively. Taking regional diversity into consideration, this hypothesis may be proved or disproved in other parts of India. It is hoped that a greater number of early historic habitations of Telangana and Rayalaseema can be excavated in order to find out more about the non-Buddhist religions in these parts.
