Looking back, it now seems pretty clear that the sixties belonged exclusively to neither Minimalism, post- Minimalism, nor Pop. From the long and, with hindsight, idiosyncratic list of artists Donald Judd praised in his 'Specific objects' survey article in 1965, to those encoun- tered in the pages of Jack Burnham's Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of This Century (1968), Udo Kultermann's The New Sculpture: Environments and Assemblage (1968), Albert E. Elsen's Origins of Modern Sculpture: Pioneers and Premises (1974) and Maurice Tuchman's American Sculpture ofthe Sixties (1967), it is clear that the bound- aries of modern sculptural practice at that time were quite elastic. H.C. Westermann is one of those since- marginalised figures that scholars and museums have lately turned their attention to as they begin to flesh out earlier accounts that privileged the position of the Minimal object above all others, in order, it seems, to incorporate those artists working in alternative sculptural idioms that drew instead upon alternative registers ofthe erotic, the anarchic and the anthropomorphic. Although Westermann was the subject of a large-scale retrospective in 2002, he has always proved rather more resistant to integration within histories of post-war art than his peers. Westermann's use of traditional craft- work, in particular carpentry, alongside his predilection for figurative objects, literary titles and jokey references earned him a reputation as a dada-joker, a so-called 'artist's artist' who nonetheless had a particularly hard time with art critics who tended to dismiss his work as retrogressive, rehashed surrealism and dada. John Canaday's scathing review of Westermann's large wooden assemblage, Memorial to the Idea of Man if He Was an Idea (1958), included in MoMA's New Images of Man show in 1959, is typical of such responses to his work. Canaday claimed that Westermann's 'stale dada concoctions add nothing to a movement that made its contributions long ago', describing Westermann as 'a guest who arrived in a clown suit, forty years late for a costume party, to find a formal dinner in progress'.1 Four years later, however, Judd closed a review of Reviews Westermann's work by calling him 'one of the best artists around'.2 It was precisely Westermann's refusal to fit, the resistance of his work to interpretation or formal categorisation that, for Judd, was the key to his works' success, stating, in his typically terse prose that '[i]t is obvious that Surrealist sources could be found for many of Westermann's ideas. It is just as obvious that the objects are something new.'3 In one of the best pieces of writing on Westermann, Max Kozloff wrote in 1968 of the inherent 'contradictions' within Westermann's work, demonstrating how he could appear simultaneously as a 'social critic, an obsessive, a "funk" artist, a Neo-Surrealist and laborious na'ive'.4 Both of the books under consideration here address this lingering image of Westermann as outsider to the contemporary art scene, as misfit and anachronistic odd- ball. Neither, however, attempts to explain away the complexities of his work; instead each seeks to situate Westermann within his contemporary milieu, although to rather different ends. Certainly, Westermann's biography is seductive, providing ample material for interpretation. Westermann had served as a marine in the Second World War, witnessing many horrific kamikaze attacks on ships, including his own, the USS Enterprise. He returned to America in 1946 after two and a half years at sea, and enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, only to enlist once again in 1950 for two years of disillusioned service in Korea. On his return from Korea, Westermann returned once more to the SAIC as a mature student on the Gl Bill. McCarthy focuses solely on those works that relate to Westermann's experiences of war and violence whilst the MCA catalogue is more expansive in its range of essays. Each of these books is alert to the various meanings of Westermann's work to contemporary viewers looking back at that moment of early sixties artistic production. McCarthy is more specific, claiming in his introduction that he considers his book on Westermann and war as written in two dis- tinct periods: pre- and post-9/11. H.C. Westermann, a lavishly illustrated exhibition catalogue published by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago to accompany the retrospective of Westermann's work that toured the USA between 2001 and 2003 (moving from Chicago to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Menil Collection, Houston), contains essays by curators Michael Rooks and Lynne Warren, as well as Robert Storr and Dennis Adrian.5 Each takes a specific theme or contextual approach to Westermann's work with plenty of original and engaging material that makes this an important book both for scholars of Westermann and those viewers new to his - at first glance bewilderingly diverse - body of work. This book asserts how very much a man of his time Westermann was, both artistically, with reference by Storr and Warren to Westermann's contemporaries and predecessors such as Elie Nadelman, Joseph Cornell, Eva Hesse, Donald Judd and Robert Rauschenberg, and Oxford Art Journal 29.3 ?

Storr's essay is 'a bid to reintroduce the critically com? plex category of the grotesque into discussion', particu? larly in relation to several of the artists mentioned above who, like Westermann, were working and exhibiting widely throughout the sixties but have subsequently dropped out of the wider picture. Storr mentions Lucas Samaras, Lee Bontecou, Charles Ray, Yayoi Kusama and Eva Hesse as examples of artists working within a grotesque idiom (this is an argument he has also pursued in catalogue essays on Hesse and Bontecou).6 Whilst I am not ultimately con- vinced by Storr's emphasis on the 'grotesque' qualities of these works, his attempt to wrest them from the strangle- hold of Minimalism is a useful contribution to the wider field of sculptural studies in the sixties. Unlike the wide-ranging approach of the MCA catalo? gue, McCarthy's H.C. Westermann at War: Art and Manhood in Cold War America is a slim monographic study illustrated with black and white images (which are unfortunately of rather poor, blurry quality and printed on flimsy paper, a real shame for a book published by a pres? tigious academic press). McCarthy seeks to locate both Westermann the man and Westermann the artist firmly within the context of his military and biographical experi? ences, and in relation to later post-war attacks on US mili? tary policy. The subsequent account is a fascinating insight into Westermann's formative experiences, viewed through the lens of Westermann's time spent in active military duty and more broadly in the context of the cultural and political climate of life in Cold War America. Chapter one, 'A soldier and a man', explores what McCarthy refers to as Westermann's 'performance' of gender in his guises as a marine, a body builder and an acrobat (in 1946 Westermann began a tour of US Naval Ships with the United Service Organisations as part of a two-man acrobatic team). Chapter two engages with the legacies of the literary category of the grotesque in Westermann's work, although McCarthy does not refer? ence Storr. Chapter three explores how the Cold War figures in Westermann's work, with particular emphasis on his 1959 metal and wood assemblage, Brinkmanship, which McCarthy skilfully reads as a critique of American foreign policy in the late fifties and early sixties. The final chapter addresses the ailegorical figure of the Death Ship, Westermann's most haunting motif, which was always signed, as were all his works, with his signa? ture 'anchor' symbol. McCarthy spends much of the book charting Westermann's military and personal experiences, and it becomes clear through his careful attention to the detail of the sculptures as well as to Westermann's illustrated letters to friends, family and colleagues, newspaper articles, military propaganda pamphlets and contemporary lifestyle magazines, that to avoid such information is to misunderstand this powerful body of work. 444 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 29.3 2006 Although he does occasionally refer to the war-related work by Westermann's peers, such as Ed Kienholz, Leon Golub and Roy Lichenstein, for McCarthy, Westermann's importance lies less in his connection to or engagement with the current art scene than his position as a com- mentator on contemporary cultural, social and political life. McCarthy's sources are frequently popular works from the period, for example novels such as Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5 (1969), Graham Greene's The Quiet American (1956), James Jones' From Here to Eternity (1951), feature articles and photographs from Life magazine, as well as Westermann's own reading and viewing habits (Herman Melville was a particular favour- ite: Westermann read Moby Dick twice, McCarthy tells us twice, and it was purportedly his favourite book). Such contemporary sources are fascinating and, serving as the basis for McCarthy's arguments around the themes of masculinity and violence in fifties American culture, they provide a compelling example of how per? forming one's 'manhood' was an integral part of estab- lishing military identity. Intimidating initiatory rituals, coarse, racist and sexist humour, tattooing, drinking, brawling and the portrayal at all times of a studied air of nonchalance rather than fear or anxiety were, McCarthy tells us, all important signifiers of one's survival as a marine at war, a brutal and traumatic lifestyle. During his time as a marine, Westermann was court-martialled for leaving his post, fighting and drinking on duty - well- known episodes in a colourful life that are re-framed in McCarthy's account as coded modes of behaviour. In chapter one McCarthy addresses the fascinating culture of masculinity and bodybuilding that was a large part of Westermann's early life. McCarthy reproduces a number of photographs of Westermann in classic weigh- tlifter poses, exploring the ways in which the staged male body opened itself to both the male and female gaze. However, McCarthy does not draw on the rich body of material available on the performance of masculi? nity which may have proved fruitful. Rather than develop a fuller argument around the 'gender performance' of Westermann, McCarthy draws only occasionally upon explicitly theoretical writings, quoting only a phrase or sentence here or there, rather than exploring them in any depth. For example, McCarthy briefly quotes Kaja Silverman and Susan Guber on masculinity, Roland Barthes on 'play', Mikhail Bakhtin on the carnivalesque and grotesque and Elaine Scarry on violence and pain, but only in a perfunctory manner, which does neither McCarthy's (convincing) arguments, nor these critical texts, justice. This is particularly disappointing in light of the subtitle of the book 'Art and Manhood in Cold War America' as it offers little in the way of a theorisation of, or an attempt to sketch exactly what the social, politi? cal, sexual and psychic implications of such a reading of gender performance, warfare and violence might mean in relation to this body of work in particular, and to studies of masculinity and violence in general.</page><page sequence="3">Where McCarthy excels in these sections is his close engagement with the wider field of visual culture, which makes for fascinating and illuminating reading. His assimilation of private letters to family members and close friends, sculptures made for public display in museums and galleries, articles from contemporary magazines and popular cultural sources such as war novels, films and newspaper cartoons does, however, seem to suggest at times a kind of equivalence of sources, although this is as much an issue to be grappled with by visual culture as a whole as it is of McCarthy's work in particular. This is particularly the case in relation to the section in chapter one where McCarthy compares those photographs from Westermann's family album of the artist posing in body- building poses with the highly public and staged photo? graphs of Jackson Pollock at work by Hans Namuth. Although the comparison is an effective one, there is a difference between the private and public that needs to be highlighted here. McCarthy is absolutely right to define Westermann first and foremost as a man formed by his military experi? ences. He does, however, occasionally run the risk of taking Westermann too much at his word, of isolating him from his artistic milieu and thus undermining his creative agency. McCarthy demonstrates real sensitivity to the historical circumstances surrounding and inform- ing the production of Westermann's work, but there are other motors at work driving Westermann's creative output that must also be taken into account. To make the obvious point, not every marine is an artist. These works are not simply related to Westermann's time at war, but are connected in complex ways with other artistic and social networks of signification. The original source of the Death Ship motif stemmed from Westermann's horrific experiences whilst serving in the Second World War. One incident, recounted by Westermann in a letter written in 1978, told a particularly unsettling tale. Having not set foot on land for over twelve months, Westermann went as part of a working party to a neighbouring ammunitions ship, only to return to the Enterprise for another six months. A few days later, he heard that the ammunitions ship had been bombed, with no survivors. Westermann wrote that, afterwards, 'I became a fucking coward &amp; was ready to come home immediately, to hell with the war and all that crap'.7 For all the horrific specificity of this encounter, McCarthy is right to understand the Death Ship in Westermann's work as allegorical, and his careful track- ing of its appearance throughout Westermann's career demonstrates evidence of close looking and a real con- cern for just what was at stake for Westermann in the creation of his war-related works. Just like the 'strange and beautiful' pine Death Ship Westermann carved in 1966 (after first running it over with the inked-up tyre of his father-in-law's Lincoln Continental), which he claimed to have handled ten thousand times before finally enclos- Reviews ing it in a glass vitrine, the Death Ship also persists in the mind of the viewer of Westermann's work, who is similarly unable to let it go, and it figures as a kind of 'fishhook' in the memory, as one perceptive critic so memorably put it in 1968.8 The apparently simpiistic, almost crude, form of Westermann's Death Ships camouflages the actual com- plexity of the motif, made manifest in its repetition throughout Westermann's twenty-seven year career as both a 'literal' and 'literary' category, as Adrian puts it in his essay for the MCA catalogue.9 With its trademark list and the always-present motif of a shark fin circling its base, the Death Ship signals both the very real situ- ation of a bombed-out ship sinking into the shark- patrolled Pacific and the capacity of the Death Ship to function beyond such specificities to allude to larger issues of death, memory and temporality. Its appearance is not diluted through time or repetition; as the ships lurch between black humour, political comment and the depiction of tragedy and loss, the importance of the Death Ship within Westermann's oeuvre becomes more and more pronounced. H.C. Westermann at War: Art and Manhood in Cold War America is an important counter to those accounts that strive, perhaps too hard, to accommodate Westermann within dominant art historical groupings or formal tropes. However, to privilege such experiences (formative as they clearly were) as the sole motors driving Westermann's creative output serves to allow only a descriptive interpretation of the works Westermann produced, as though they are clues to be decoded, as so many mnemo- nic signifiers of a life at war and at sea rather than endur- ing and specific art works that function outside of and beyond biographic or illustrative perimeters. The stories that Westermann's works seem to tell are highly autobiographical, yet, as Judd pointed out, they are oddly 'recondite' at the same time. Westermann's work functions as a 'fishhook' in the memory, a point of resistance to those accounts that assert the seamless continuity of art's histories. The Death Ship pervades Westermann's work as a restless and persistent pre? sence, just as Westermann himself continues to haunt and disrupt histories of post-war sculptural practice in which, thanks to these scholarly and timely publications, he is now anchored and no longer all at sea.
