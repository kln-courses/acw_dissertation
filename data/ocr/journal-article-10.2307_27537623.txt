<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS By HI SIMONS REVIEWING Parts of a World by Wallace Stevens in the Autumn 1942 issue of Accent, Mr. Horace Gregory ^ raised the question: "Is Mr. Stevens a philosopher? Can we hook ladders to his Pr?ster John's balloon with the hope of landing safely on a terrain peopled by Zeno, Plotinus, Socrates, George Santayana, William James, John Dewey and Professor Whitehead?" Gregory thought not. "I would go further," he wrote, "and insist that Mr. Stevens is not an intellectual, and that the value of his poetry cannot be measured in intellectual terms. . ." The same week when that criticism appeared, Mrs. Mary Colum reviewed the same volume in The New York Times Book Review. "The mind that the author projects into such careful and measured language," she complained, "is the philosophic speculative mind where the passions are of the intellectual rather than the sensuous order." She quoted as representative a short passage which she doubted had in it "enough sensuous delight to be poetry," and said: "It reads a little like a piece of Thomas Aquinas." It goes of itself, as the French say, that Gregory and Mrs. Colum cannot both have understood their subject-matter cor rectly and yet have construed it so differently. It is irresistible to try to set one or another, possibly both, of them right. Pre sumptuous as it will seem, the effort is worth making because it offers an opportunity to define the genre of Stevens's poems, something that has long needed doing. We cannot argue Mrs. Colum's strictures profitably because she did not give us their basis in reason. Gregory's premises, how ever, are clear enough. For him, "intellectual poetry" and "philosophical poetry" are interchangeable terms, and he uses</page><page sequence="2">HI SIMONS 567 "philosophy" in "the sense which implies the creation or the furtherance of a philosophic system." He grants Stevens's poems intelligence and evidences of "a finely tempered and inquiring mind." But he seems not quite to have exhausted those evi dences; for the only philosophic substance in Stevens which he discusses is the tendency toward skepticism which he finds in "Sad Strains of a Gay Waltz" and "Examination of the Hero in a Time of War"?this latter, a poem of affirmation if any such has been written in our distraught times. Even on his own grounds, we must dispute Gregory's position. Stevens's six books present consistently developing attitudes to ward at least four distinctively philosophic subjects; and for those to whom his poetry is worth the effort to comprehend it I list the four themes and, after each one, a few poems that mark the stages of its evolution: 1. The socio-esthetic problem of the relation of the artist to his environment. "The Comedian as the Letter C" (Harmonium) ; "Academic Discourse at Havana" and, by strong implication, "Farewell to Florida" and "Sailing af ter Lunch" (Ideas of Order) ; "The Man with the Blue Guitar," XII, XV, XVII and XXVIII; "Of Modern Poetry" (Parts of a World), and the fourth poem and the epilogue of Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. 2. The esthetic-epistemological problem of the relation of imagination to reality. "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt" and "Another Weeping Woman" (Harmonium) ; "The Idea of Order at Key West" (Ideas of Order) ; parts v and vi of "A Duck for Dinner" (Owl's Clover); "The Man with the Blue Guitar," I-IV, XXII, XXIX and XXXI; "Con noisseur of Chaos" and "Poem with Rhythms" (Parts of a World)-, and the poems on pages 12, 25, 29, 31 and 38-39 of Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. 3. The problem of belief, in both its metaphysical and theological aspects. "Sunday Morning" (Harmonium) ; "Sad Strains of a Gay Waltz," "Lions in Sweden" and "Evening without Angels" (Ideas of Order) ; parts ii and v</page><page sequence="3">568 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS of "The Greenest Continent" (Owl's Clover), "The Man with the Blue Guitar," V, XVIII-XXI and XXIV; "On the Road Home," "The Latest Freed Man" and "Asides on the Oboe" (Parts of a World) y in general, all of Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. 4. In connection with the preceding, a peculiar human ism most recently personified in "the hero" and "the major man." First clearly adumbrated in "A Duck for Dinner" (Owl's Clover) and "A Thought Revolved" (The Man With the Blue Guitar), the principal subject of "Mon trachet-le-Jardin" and "Examination of the Hero in a Time of War" (Parts of a World) \ re-sketched in the poems on pages 17-19 of Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. Any reader who will follow that outline as a guide for his own analysis of Stevens's characteristic preoccupations will conclude, I believe, that he is reading a poet quite as philosophical, in Gre gory's sense, as any in our language. Is it necessary to add that one need not "approve of" Stevens's ideas to recognize them as ideas? One need no more share all his thoughts in order to evaluate justly the independence, con stancy and intensity of ratiocination embodied in his poems, than one must believe in. John Donne's theology, ethics or astronomy to regard him as the classic type of the intellectual poet. II Yet if Gregory should ask me pointblank, "Is Stevens, then, a philosopher?" I would answer : "Certainly not?Mrs. Colum to the contrary. He doesn't purport to be one. He is a poet." Of course, he doesn't transport his readers to a terrain peopled by Zeno, or Santayana, or Thomas Aquinas. He keeps them al ways in the realm of poetry. This whole question of intellection and poetry was set in an illuminating frame of reference twenty years ago in connection with the revival of interest in Donne. A more realistic concep tion of the intellectual poet than Gregory's was worked out by</page><page sequence="4">HI SIMONS 569 Mr. T. S. Eliot in his essay on "The Metaphysical Poets." "In Chapman especially," he found, "there is a direct sensuous ap prehension of thought, or a recreation of thought into feeling, which is exactly what we find in Donne." Then, on the contrast between a passage by the elder Herbert and one by Tennyson, he remarked: The difference is not a simple difference of degree between poets. It is something which had happened to the mind of England between the time of Donne or Lord Herbert of Cherbury and the time of Tennyson and Browning; it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet. Tennyson and Browning are poets, and they think; but they do not feel their thought as immediately as the odour of a rose. A thought to Donne was an experience; it modified his sensibility. Those phrases so full of insight, "a direct sensuous apprehen sion of thought, or a recreation of thought into feeling," precisely define the quality of Stevens's poetry that has confused readers like Mrs. Colum and Gregory. According to Eliot's definition, Stevens is an intellectual poet. For that reason, though "the value of his poetry cannot be measured in intellectual terms" alone, neither can it be appreciated without an equal understand ing of both its intellectual component and its element of sheer sensibility. Most of those who have written about his work have assumed that he was a lyricist in the nineteenth-century tradition. To the contrary, not the least of his distinctions is that he created for himself a genre that was new in its time, except insofar as Ezra Pound and Eliot did likewise: a type of poem that may be called a lyric of ideas, an intellectual lyric. Stevens is one of the originators of the metaphysical trend in the poetry of our time. To illustrate that view of his work I should prefer to use his latest book, the Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. Instead, I restrict myself to one of the shorter pieces in the volume Gregory 5</page><page sequence="5">570 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS and Mrs. Colum reviewed. Any of fifty poems might be chosen: "Asides on the Oboe" is sufficiently representative. In our outline, this piece was listed as important in the de velopment of Stevens's attitude toward the problem of belief. Its thesis is stated in a short prologue: It is a question, now, Of final belief. So, say that final belief Must be in a fiction. If men's ultimate beliefs have always been in some fiction or another, the crisis of faith today may be due to the fact that our traditional myths have ceased to be credible. Thus, the fiction, of the wide river in An empty land; the gods that Boucher killed; And the metal heroes that time granulates? are all "obsolete." "The wide river in/An empty land" evokes vague religious associations?the Jordan, the river of light in Dante's paradise, a stream of spirit fructifying an otherwise desert world. Following the principle of reading each poem as in the context of its author's work as a whole, we may recall here "the struggle of the idea of god/And the idea of man," in "Mystic Garden &amp; Middling Beast." The present poem assumes a need to substitute some "idea of man" for "the idea of god." So there is presumptive warrant for taking the first of the obsolete fictions as the common current acceptation of religion. "The gods that Boucher killed" may be considered to refer to all anthropomorphic mythologies so familiarized and rationalized since the eighteenth century as to lose their force as objects of veneration. And I imagine that "the metal heroes that time granulates" are such ethical absolutes as Stevens satirized in "Lions in Sweden,"</page><page sequence="6">HI SIMONS 571 those sovereigns of the soul And savings banks, Fides, the sculptor's prize, All eyes and size, and galled Justitia, Trained to poise the tables of the law, Patientia forever soothing wounds And mighty Fortitudo, frantic bass. In contrast with those, or whatever other doctrines and deities the reader may regard as no longer efficacious for belief, The philosophers' man still walks in dew, Still by the sea-side mutters milky lines Concerning an immaculate imagery. This "philosophers' man" is a personification of "the idea of man," a prototype of Stevens's humanism. The three images by which he is presented?"walks in dew," "milky lines," and "immaculate imagery"?suggest pristine purity and thus empha size the antithesis that, whereas other fictions of faith are obsolete, this concept is new and unblemished. To say he "still walks in dew" implies that he is in the morning of his career. "The sea side" may be accepted as mere setting; but the sea as a metaphor for life is one of Stevens's oldest symbols, and the impression we get here is that of a contemplative person dwelling close to the common life of his time yet not engaged in the thick of it. He "mutters milky [sweet and sustaining, as well as fresh] lines / Concerning an immaculate imagery," that is, concerning an in violate, vital conception of life. Is the humanistic ideal, then, simply an apotheosis of the poet? Stevens is too realistic to think that. Ever since the winter of 1936-37 when he wrote "The Man with the Blue Guitar," he has held to the idea of total reality as a combination of the reality of things-as-they-are and the reality of imagination. Here, the poet is not to take precedence of ordinary men, but all of us are to live ever more and more by the imagination: as in every hu</page><page sequence="7">572 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS manism, the ideal is not humanity as is, but a regenerated hu manity. So, If you say on the hautboy man is not enough, Can never stand as god, is ever wrong In the end, however naked, tall, there is still The impossible possible philosophers' man . . . You may argue skeptically that man as god still remains man, yet there is an ideal of humanity to believe in and aspire to. "If you say on the hautboy" means "If you write in your verses" or "If you imagine"; for the oboe is one of many instruments? guitar, harmonium, piano, banjo, an old horn, and so on?in which Stevens has likened poetry and its source, the imagination, to music. "Naked" stands for stripped of superficial falsities; and "tall" is another metaphor, for moral stature or loftiness. Now, the gist of the concept having been given, further predicates are added. "The impossible possible philosophers' man" is The central man, the human globe, responsive As a mirror with a voice, the man of glass, Who in a million diamonds sums us up. "Central" as a metaphor for the essence, as distinguished from irrelevant superficialities, of humanity offers no difficulty. The next four images?"globe" (probably light-globe primarily, though spherical map, also, by second intention), "mirror," "glass" and "diamonds"?all suggest bright light, emitted, re flected or transmitted. Their meaning is summarized in the next line, "He is the transparence of the place in which'7He is"; and, lest there be any doubt that, the substance of the thought is spir itual insight, we may refer back to "The Greenest Continent," where it is said that, although "The heaven of Europe is empty" now, there was a heaven once</page><page sequence="8">HI SIMONS 573 in which the mind Acquired transparence and beheld itself And beheld the source from which transparence came . . . So the ideal man, embodying the essence of the finest in humanity, possessing especially a capacity for living by the imagination, would be a source of illumination for the rest of us. He would not live aloof, but would be "responsive^As a mirror with a voice." Responsive to our common impulses and aspirations. Like a mirror in reflecting them back, sharpened and clarified. Using his voice to keep before us the "immaculate imagery" of life at its best. In that complex sense, he would be an effulgent "man of glass,^Who in a million diamonds sums us up." The short second section of the poem, that expresses the satis faction inspired by belief in this humanistic fiction, scarcely needs such close analysis as what has preceded. Part III applies the conception to events current in the world of things-as-they-are, for "Asides on the Oboe" was written in the summer following the outbreak of the second World War. One year, death and war prevented the jasmine scent And the jasmine islands were bloody martyrdoms. "Jasmine" was chosen, 1 think, because of its sweetness: death and war expunged the sweetness of life, and the good lands of the earth were turned into places of slaughter. How was it then with the central man? Did we Find peace? We found the sum of men. We found, If we found the central evil, the central good. We have not over-idealized man?we recognize the inexpugnable evil?yet we insist no less on the inherent good. We buried the fallen without jasmine crowns. There was nothing he did not suffer, no; nor we. . . .</page><page sequence="9">574 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS But wherein is the efficacy of a belief so qualified by acknowl edgment of its antithesis? Merely in a hope that the good will some day return? No, But we and the diamond globe at last were one. We had always been partly one. It was as we came To see him, that we were wholly one, as we heard Him chanting for those buried in their blood, In the jasmine haunted forests, that we knew The glass man, without external reference. More clearly than ever before, we see the ideal in its failure. We know it now, not as a figment of speculation, but immedi ately, as a vital part of ourselves, that has failed through our failure, that must be restored through our reconsecrated belief. Ill Thus, "Asides on the Oboe" yields to (not exorbitantly diffi cult) analysis a meaning for which "intellectual" is the precise adjective. But the poem is not truly understood when those ideas have been abstracted from it: they must not only be known as ideas but also felt in the terms, the imagery, the poetryy in which they are given. Therein are both Gregory and Mrs. Colum confounded. For if ever a piece of writing fulfilled the description, "a direct sensuous apprehension of thought, or a recreation of thought into feeling," this one does. Intellectual intensity or, as Professor H. J. C. Grierson put it, a "strain of passionate paradoxical reasoning" is the quality which Donne introduced into English verse; and a similar "blend of argument and imagination" appears in some of the poetry of our time, that of Stevens included. Intensity of thought is evident in "Asides on the Oboe" from two different but, as the poem proves, not incompatible signs. The first is the directness and vigor of the rhetorical movement, and the "simple, sensuous,</page><page sequence="10">HI SIMONS 575 masculine" diction, especially noticeable in the three-line prologue and in the concluding section: How was it then with the central man? Did we Find peace? We found the sum of men. We found, If we found the central evil, the central good. No less indicative of passion in reasoning are the richness and deep feeling of the imagery, particularly that in which the idea of "the philosophers' man" is developed and that of "the jasmine haunted forests" of war and death. Passages like those are the expression, not of a mind in which rhetorical figures blur and dispel or re place ideas, but of one to which ideas come in such figures, so that to think them is also to feel them. In The Donne Tradition, a brilliant elaboration upon Eliot's essay on the Metaphysicals, Mr. George Williamson says: "This intellectual intensity derives its peculiar power from the unified sensibility which makes it im possible to isolate the faculties of Donne. . . . His unified sensi bility makes his images the very body of his thought, not some thing added to it. . ." Had Williamson been describing Stevens instead of Donne, he could not have chosen better terms. Gregory feared for Stevens the danger of "the reductio ad whimsy of his totally serious and critical consideration of the re lationship between two aspects of reality." I imagine such a line as "But we and the diamond globe at last were one" fairly rep resents what Gregory objected to as "stating an intellectual prob lem in terms of fancy." If so, he would probably find much of Donne and Vaughan, to say nothing of Crashaw, George Herbert and Cowley, equally frivolous. For the central images of "Asides on the Oboe" and of countless others of Stevens's compositions are conceits quite of the Metaphysical order. A useful definition of the conceit is, a figure in which two terms of a comparison meet on limited ground but are otherwise incongruous. The Metaphysicals used this device functionally, not decoratively. To quote Williamson again: "The conceit is</page><page sequence="11">576 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS one of the principal means by which Donne chained analysis to ecstasy." Exactly so, the figure of "the philosophers' man" and the others connected with it are not whimsies added to the rational structure of the poem, but the means, and the only means, of defining and conveying the essential conception. So far as this one poem is concerned, all we know of "the idea of man" is what that series of images tells us?and how adequate that is we have seen. Not only does this conceit serve the author as an instru ment of analysis, but we have been able to analyze its evolution from the simple personification, "the philosophers' man," to the paradox, "The impossible possible philosophers' man," on through the complex of "central man," "human globe," "mirror with a voice" and "man of glass/Who in a million diamonds sums us up," to the final symbolic paradox, "We and the diamond globe at last were one." Thus, the conceit is intellectual in intention and intellectual-imaginative in genesis and development. In addition, it performs the important function of investing the poet's thought with that "sensuous delight" which Mrs. Colum properly demands of poetry yet apparently fails to recognize sometimes when she has it before her. Much has been written of Stevens's wit. Too often the word has been used derogatorily, as if in total ignorance of the great tradition established by poets who were celebrated in their own day, though subsequently chided, as wits. At other times the intention behind the term is equivocal, as when Gregory refers to Stevens's "comic genius," yet leaves the net impression that he may amuse us as a funny-man but not seriously interest us as a "philosopher" who might "occupy Bishop Manning's pulpit or write a supplementary volume to Professor Whitehead's Reality and Process." (sic!) Stevens is a wit (as well as, occasionally, a humorist), and this would suggest that we might understand him the better by study ing his work in relation to our leading tradition of poetic wit. In discussing Andrew Marvel], Eliot defined Metaphysical wit</page><page sequence="12">HI SIMONS 577 as "a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace." Ex panding that idea, Williamson demonstrated the part of reason, first in the evolution of Donne's conceits, then in the construction of his poems: "Nothing is more characteristic of Donne than the way in which thought gives a mathematical basis to the music of his emotions." Hence, the ruggedness of his verse; hence also, in part, the difficulty, the occasional obscurity, of his poems: "It is a result of the reassertion of subject-matter in poetry." If our abstract of the meaning of "Asides on the Oboe" proves any thing, it is that intellection provides the whole basis and form for its structure. Similarly, we traced the element of reason in the elaboration of one of its principal conceits. And if this poem is typical of its author's work in confronting the reader with seem ingly cryptic obscurities, that is in consequence of what William son designates "the astringent effect of intellect on the facility of verse." Stevens's wit, like his rhetoric, is of the same general nature as that of the Metaphysicals. And thus it helps to define his genre: it is the factor of reasonableness underlying the lyric graces of his peculiarly characteristic poem of ideas. IV Every poem Stevens has written, not only in his latest period, but since about 1919 when his experimental phase finally issued in the first pieces definitely in his own kind and manner, is sus ceptible of the same sort of analysis we have applied to "Asides on the Oboe." Most of them disclose a similar content of ideas. The exceptions are pieces like "Variations on a Summer Day" and "The News and the Weather," in which the lyrical component takes precedence of the component of thought. Yet in these as well as the intellectual lyric, the same sensibility is at work, though upon a different kind of subject-matter: Stevens's unified sensibility accounts for the singular uniformity of tone that, as many critics have observed, prevails throughout his writing. All Stevens's poems do not equally exemplify all of William</page><page sequence="13">578 THE GENRE OF WALLACE STEVENS son's criteria of Metaphysical poetry. But neither do all those, for example, in Grierson's collection of Metaphysical Lyrics ?? Poems of the Seventeenth Century. As Eliot himself acknowl edged, "Not only is it extremely difficult to define metaphysical poetry, but difficult to decide what poets practise it and in which of their verses"?the more one reads of recent criticism of the school of Donne, the more one feels that it applies to Donne but not to any school. Yet we can say of Stevens that each of his mature poems exhibits at least one Metaphysical trait and all Metaphysical characteristics are present somewhere in his work. I know of no evidence, however, that Stevens has been in fluenced by Donne and his successors. In associating him with their tradition in order to emphasize his specifically intellectual quality, we should not minimize the differences between him and his distant predecessors in the line. There is, to begin with, a vast divergency of subject-matter and of psychology, grounded in all the differences between the epoch that was nearing its end when Donne wrote and the civilization that is committing suicide now. Scarcely less important are the dissimilarities of diction and prosody produced by the social and literary vicissitudes of two centuries. Also, there is a fundamental rhetorical difference, and, since its rhetoric is one of the prime features of the Metaphysical mode, this must be defined. Contemporary criticism has not yet agreed on a suitable name for the distinctive rhetorical device of contemporary poetry. It is the metaphor rather than the simile, but a peculiar usage of metaphor. The figure is employed not as an embellishment but as the means of discourse, and its communicative possibilities are stretched to the utmost?often, in fact, to the point of obscurity. Sometimes the emotive force of the vehicle, the written word, is stressed; again, the tenor, the idea to be conveyed. In either case, the latter is left to implication, and the distinction between traditional practice and the modern technic lies in the strictness with which that is done.</page><page sequence="14">HI SIMONS 579 Stevens was not a master of the rhetoric of implication from the beginning of his career as a publishing poet, but the style by which he is now known was not mature until he had mastered it. "Asides on the Oboe" is as good an example as any of both the technic and the style resultant from it. The metaphor, "the diamond globe," is logically engendered, and explained, by the associated figures that precede it. But "the wide river in/An empty land," "the transparence of the place" and "the jasmine islands" stand as pure metaphors, affording a minimum of support to inference. For the clues to precise interpretation, we must resort to earlier poems treating analogous subject-matter. Im plication could scarcely be carried further than it is in these figures; and this method of making ideas into images is a basic characteristic of Stevens's art. I doubt that there is any parallel to that in the practice of Donne and his followers; in the half-dozen volumes of their verse through which I have pursued the question I have not found a single instance of the extreme form of implication pe culiar to the more advanced poetry of our time. If we consider the simile broadly, as a comparison in which both terms are given, no matter in what grammatical relationship, that and not the metaphor is the chief rhetorical resource of the Metaphysicals, as of most English poets. It is generally accepted that what I would call "the radical metaphor" came into American poetry from French Symbolism, partly by direct influence, partly via the Imagists. Stevens is one of those who introduced and naturalized it. The combination, an intellectual lyric framed on the Symbolist principle of implica tion, is a twentieth-century extension of the Metaphysical tradi tion. No one did more than Wallace Stevens to create it; and no one has done more to manifest its potentialities as an expres sion of intensely felt thought and a medium of formal elegance. It is his genre.</page></plain_text>
