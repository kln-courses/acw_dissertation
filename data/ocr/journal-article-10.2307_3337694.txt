<plain_text><page sequence="1">4. Reliquary figure. Kota-Mahongwe, Gabon, begin- ning of the 20th century, acquired in 1992 from the art market. Wood, brass strips; 30cm (11.8"). SMV, Munich. Inv. no. 92-316-268. Bangwa royal arts. Labels for some of these objects identify the maker, including a veranda post by the Bangwa artist Ateu Atsa and two newly acquired veranda posts by the Yoruba artist Olowe of Ise (Figs. 2, 3). This section also deals with the crosscurrents of foreign influ- ences, especially apparent in excellent examples of "tourist," "export," or "syncretic" arts created from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. The third and last gallery is devoted primari- ly to themes of the supernatural: "Deities, Nature and Ancestral Spirits, Mythological Beings," "Represented Carriers of Magical Powers, Oracles," and "Animals and Combination Beings." It presents many "classic" representa- tions of local spirit powers, such as Kongo minkisi figures, Fang, Kota, and Mahongwe reliquary fig- ures (Fig. 4), and Luba bowl-beaers and caryatid stools. To these mostly central African examples, Kecskesi has added newly acquired figurative groups representing syncretic religious imagery, specifically a red-painted Igbo Mami Wata com- position and an Ibibio interpretation of the myth of the Indian god Hanuman. The selection for the theme "Animals and Combination Beings" focuses on animal iconography as empowering symbols and representations. The large variety of object types and materials, including wood, bark, ivory, cast metal, forged iron, gold foil, terracotta, oil paint, natural pigments, and stone, make this section the most visually compelling. A small portion of this last gallery, called "Utilitarian Objects with Figurative and Non-Figurative Ornamentation," takes advantage of the muse- um's ethnographic agenda. Here Kecskesi pays tribute to the decorative arts with architectural elements, furniture, objects of personal use, con- tainers, instruments, and textiles, among other items. Examples of the "utilitarian" arts from neglected areas of African art-such as decorated San ostrich eggs, Mangbetu barkcoth, and Haya basketry-are a welcome sight among the plethora of more celebrated objects. The newly acquired Luguru high-backed stool, Mbuti bark- doth, and Mangbetu anthropomorphic terra- cotta vessel demonstrate the more inclusive approach in current exhibitions of African art. Text panels provide brief information about each theme. Some of the panels, however, are vertically aligned on a single wall, while the thematic headings separating each section are placed well above the viewer's line of vision. As a result it is difficult to dearly discern dis- tinctions between thematic areas within a sin- gle gallery. Exhibition labels are extremely condensed, seldom longer than two sentences. The companion catalogue, on the other hand, provides collection history and a few para- graphs on each object. Because the valuable information provided in the catalogue does not appear in the exhibition, it is impossible for the museum visitor to distinguish between older and newer acquisitions or to learn about re- vised object interpretations or the use of recent research findings. The history of the object's 84 social life beyond its African context, which often conveys valuable information on Euro- pean colonial and postcolonial history, is there- fore unavailable at the exhibition. A number of objects in "Kunst aus Afrika" do not represent the level of aesthetic quality that one would expect from this museum. In "Chieftaincy, Aristocracy and Priesthood," some beautifill Benin royal artworks from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are fea- tured together with a few noticeably inferior examples of Bini artistry. One example, a gilded bronze pendant of a queen mother, seems a mis- match with its companion "masterpieces." If one turns to the exhibition catalogue, however, Kecskesi explains that the piece is a rare exam- ple of the local brass-casting method merged with a foreign gilding technique (p. 71). A brief mention of the pendant's rarity in the exhibition label would have clarified its inclusion here. Kecskesi notes that objects were chosen not only for their aesthetic quality and appeal, but also for their value in illustrating the exhibition's themes and in meeting its goals (catalogue, pp. 6-7). When such subtle yet crucial points are omitted from the label, an object's artistic short- comings can easily overshadow its informative, interpretative, or thematic worth. "Kunst aus Afrika" endeavors to get away from the ethno- graphic paradigm of dioramas, crowded display cases, and long, authoritative labels or text pan- els, and it also justifiably attempts to critique the notion of the "masterpiece" in African art It does so, however, in a manner that leaves the novice with too many generalizations, which can per- petuate stereotypes. The seasoned viewer, on the other hand, is left with more questions than answers about curatorial intention. Considering the exhibition's focus on the individuality of African artists, one would have expected more information on the "named" artists and workshops featured in the exhibition. The installation does not address the importance of patrons and the relationship between patron- age and the artist's control over theme and iconography. Seldom does an exhibition have such direct access to works by identified African artists. While some of this information is provid- ed in the catalogue, here too, the object labels in the exhibition are wanting. Despite a drastic reduction in the number of objects on display, the galleries still look crowd- ed and confused. This impression is created not so much by an overabundance of objects as by the use of large glass display cases in relatively small galleries in order to accommodate the par- titioning of the exhibition themes. The result, in some areas, is an incoherent visual layering of objects and cases. The installation layout also places works in dead comers. For example, a tall (over 6 feet high!) Vili ndungu drum is wedged into a narrow, dark, and all but hidden corer, as are some Asante okyeame staffs, thereby compro- mising one's appreciation of their three-dimen- sional quality. Insufficient lighting in these and other areas of the installation make it difficult to fully see an object's surface, texture, and subtle visual qualities. After the past decade of financial cutbacks and art-unfriendly national politics, one can rejoice about the reopening of the permanent African art installation in Munich. Although it is apparent, in "Kunst aus Afrika," that the ethno- graphic museum is still struggling with the dif- ficult task of paradigmatic transformations, the institution's willingness to attempt a critique of its own past is certainly well overdue. One wel- comes the opportunity to view some of the most superb artworks from sub-Saharan Africa; nev- ertheless, the new acquisitions are welcome sights to eyes that may be tiring of the same old pieces from the same old places. Indeed, this revision of the museum's past exhibition frame- works and the addition of objects from unfamil- iar, neglected, and rare areas of African art affirm the museum's continued interest in and commitment to the support of African art histo- ry and cultural studies. O The exhibition catalogue Kunst aus Afrika by Maria Kecskesi (240 pp., 80 b/w &amp; 200 color pho- tos, map, DM 48.00 softcover) is availablefrom the Staatliches Museum fir Volkerkunde, Munich, and Prestel Verlag, Munich. TRANSLATION/SEDUCTION/ DISPLACEMENT White Box Gallery New York, New York February 3-April 1, 2000 Reviewed by Mark D'Amato In the press release for "Translation/Seduc- tion/Displacement" curators Lauri Firstenberg and John Peffer stated their intention to make a "distinct break from recent survey museum exhi- alrican arts * autumn 2000</page><page sequence="2">bitions based on the broad category of 'contem- porary South African art.' " To do so, they pre- sented "two generations of contemporary artists, working through conceptual and photographic art strategies, who have critically influenced the contemporary art world, both locally and global- ly." The exhibition focused on work by two inter- nationally prominent artists-photographer Santu Mofokeng and conceptual artist Willem Boshoff-and traced how their "representational practices" appear in the more recent art by Siemon Allen, Aubrie Fourie, Kim Lieberman, Senzeni Marasela, Zwelethu Mthethwa, Rudzani Nemasetoni, Joachim Schonfeldt, Marlaine Tosoni, Andrew Tshabangu, and Hentie van der Merwe. Basing this exhibition on the concepts of translation, seduction, and displacement, the curators emphasized how the South African history of "techniques, technologies, and strategies of the visual" have been utilized by these artists to "comment upon and contest popularly received forms of [their] general historical experience" (introduction to the cat- alogue). This history had, until this show, been left unexplored. Ultimately, Firstenberg and Peffer asserted that there are "politically charged similarities between the worlds of South Africans (living at home and abroad) and the larger world outside of South Africa." Siemon Allen's Zulu for Medics (1994) addresses the issue of translating one lan- guage into another. This early audio piece uses an actual training tape for doctors who need- ed to be able to converse with Zulu patients. Left: Chasing Shadows (detail) by Santu Mofokeng, 1996. Gelatin silver print; 50.8cm x 61cm (20" x 24'). Collection of the artist. Right: White Diaspora (London, Brooklyn, Germis- ton) (installation detail) by Andrew Tshabangu, 1997-99. Gelatin silver print; 40.6cm x 50.8cm (16" x 20"). Collection of the artist. However, Allen disrupts not only the lan- guage of control in the doctor-patient relation- ship but also the apartheid power structure of white over black by imposing disjointed music from his own guitar playing. His Screen (2000) similarly disrupts one's understanding of this massive minimalist structure with its dark, woven, reflective surface that seduces the viewer within its fragmented appearance. By using videotape, the structure invites inscrip- tion beyond its form, shape, and surface, and encourages the need to access the information that might be stored on the tape. Santu Mofokeng's series of haunting black- and-white photographs, collectively titled Nightfall of the Spirit (1997-2000), explores, according to the accompanying artist's state- ment, the "landscapes associated with spectac- ular events of horror in Europe and in Asia." In the wake of such horrors, Mofokeng asks, can a "monument invite remembrance or through a kind of containment, forgetting?" These photographs document how nature deals with the "memory of the wounds in the landscape" and how we can learn "anything from nature." Adjacent to this was an earlier series of photographs, titled Chasing Shadows (1996), that represents the artist's search for his ancestral roots in Lesotho. This series poses another question about the exact nature of these so-called shadows and whether they can even be found after the tragedy of apartheid. Religious inquiry is also suggested in Rudzani Nemasetoni's photolithographs, Litany (1999), a series of portraits taken from his re- latives' passbooks. Issued by the Nationalist government, such books controlled not only the movements of black South Africans but also their identity. Nemasetoni's intervention is the placement of marks, including his own fingerprints, on these portraits, which dis- places the identification imposed during apartheid and reinvests them with a person- al meaning. Similarly, Andrew Tshabangu, a student of Mofokeng, who was represented by the White Diaspora series (1997-99), created photographs that record white-robed Africans who partici- pate in the religious services of the African- syncretic Christian churches in London, South Africa, and Brooklyn. Thus, he shows how Africa has spread its spiritual essence through- out the Christian world. In its own gallery was Willem Boshoff's book of visual poetry from 1977-80, Kykafrikaans. These poems consist of sheets of paper covered with letters and words typed on a manual typewriter. The letters and words become for- mal elements that take on a variety of shapes, not only visually but verbally, challenging the viewer to confront and deconstruct how words are used. This effect is even more relevant when one notes how the apartheid govern- ment used Afrikaans to maintain its control over South African society and culture. The very installation of this piece suggested the iconic power that language can hold. Kim Lieberman, a student of Boshoff, focuses on the transmission of information in two pieces-Blood Relatives (1999) and Inter- preting Surface Information (2000). Their seem- ing Mondrianesque simplicity belied the intricacy of their construction, which consist- ed of wrapping colored thread through the perforations of sheets of stamps. The delicate craft and material in the threadwork posit the precious object; yet this notion is dislocated by the use of stamp paper, which denotes transience, movement, and communication. But how can such communication take place in an era in which the personalized stamp has been replaced by the impersonal virtual reali- ty of the Internet? Senzeni Marasela's untitled piece of 1998 deals with the transmission of history; it con- sists of three silver serving trays, suspended, on which colonial tray cloths have been placed. The cloths display repeated photo- JOHN PEFFER 85 ''~~~~' _ ~??.- JOHN PEFFER 85 autumn 2000 ? african arts</page><page sequence="3">silkscreened images of grieving black women. This scene comes from the noted photograph- er Peter Magubane, who has documented the suffering caused by apartheid since the 1950s. Some of these images were inscribed by sewing into the cloth a text by a racist author who was widely read in South Africa. Together, the trays, which were served into the space, along with the images and text on the cloths, highlighted Marasela's effort to re- claim her personal history and reinvent her identity in relation to apartheid, since she was removed from that experience when she was young. Another type of personal history was offered in Hentie van der Merwe's untitled installation from 1997. Seemingly composed of white brick walls with a gate (as in a jail?), it contains a mirror in which nude male bodies are reflected, lined up one after another, row upon row. The physical characteristics of the photographed individuals have been cata- logued, recalling the scientific efficiency of the nineteenth-century photographs of Muybridge. By making such images accessible only through the bars of a gate, Van der Merwe shows how the white male can be categorized, classified, and even sexualized within a prison-like structure. This raises the questions: Has this process itself becomes a prison for us? and, more important, Who is constructing such categories? Con.struct (I and II), of 1998, by Aubrie Fourie, is an installation consisting of one slide projector on the floor; it casts alterating images of books, which sit on a tabletop in front of a white backdrop, low onto the wall. These books, bound in black leather with gold writing on the binding, are Bibles, in South Africa's different languages. There is one lone white one, in Afrikaans. This image alternates with one where a book is removed, causing the white Bible to seemingly disappear against the white background. Through this installation, Fourie comments upon the colonial attempt to impose identity, language, and religion. Marlaine Tosoni's audio piece titled STD'zzzz (2000), which was accessible through a headset, transforms the listener through a combination of voices, music, and other sounds. Caught within this cacopho- nous experience are certain phrases such as "You are what you buy" and "Are you an Afritan or an American?" These phrases seem to problematize identity construction within the global consumer culture, which at its core is American. In essence, this exhibition did move away from "survey shows" that depict contempo- rary South African art as a group construc- tion, by focusing on the identities and histories that are specific to individual artists. By virtue of being held in a New York gallery, it asked the art-viewing public to interact with contemporary African art within the current globalized art scene. South African contempo- rary art-or African contemporary art for that matter-can no longer be dealt with separate- ly from other artistic expressions. The quality of the work, along with what it reveals about the experiences of South African artists and their relationships with their environments, is relevant and translatable to our own con- cerns. The means by which these artists express themselves are an essential addition to the voices of other artists on the world stage. "Translation / Seduction / Displacement" offered an opportunity to continue this dia- logue among artists and viewers from around the world. O The exhibition is presently on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art, the Maine College Gallery of Art, Portland (August 10-October 20). The cata- logue, produced by the Maine College Gallery of Art in cooperation with FLR, and published by Artists Press, Johannesburg, will soon be available.
