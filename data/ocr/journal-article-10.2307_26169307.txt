Recent testing has utilized steer maneuver-induced furrow tripped rollovers to gain further understanding  of vehicle kinematics, including the vehicle's pre-trip motion. The current study consisted of two rollover tests utilizing instrumented test vehicles and instrumented ATDs to investigate occupant  kinematics and injury response throughout the entire rollover sequences, from pre-trip vehicle motion to the position of rest. The two  steer maneuver-induced furrow tripped rollover tests utilized a mid-sized 4-door sedan and a full-sized crew-cab pickup truck. The  pickup truck was equipped with seatbelt pretensioners and rollover-activated side curtain airbags (RSCAs). The RSCAs were a  prototype next generation design. The sedan was not equipped with these technologies. Each test vehicle contained two restrained  instrumented 50th-percentile male ATDs in the front outboard seating positions. The vehicles were accelerated using a tow system,  released, and then maneuvered onto a dirt test surface by an automated steering controller resulting in a passenger-side-leading  soil-tripped rollover. The RSCAs and seatbelt pretensioners in the pickup truck deployed prior to the first vehicle-to-ground contact.  Occupant kinematics and ATD injury metrics were evaluated for the duration of the roll events. The results of the study demonstrated two neck-loading events wherein the compressive loads in the upper neck and the Nij were well  in excess of the Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV). Both of these neck-loading events involved the driver ATD in the sedan.  The vertical deformation of the driver side roof structure at the time of the first neck-loading event that exceeded the IARV was 4.4 cm  (1.7 inches). The second of these events involved direct head-to-ground contact. Compressive neck loading events were preceded by a  pattern of a peak in the filtered axial head acceleration, followed by a peak in the filtered axial chest acceleration A statistically  significant positive correlation was observed between axial chest acceleration and axial compressive neck force. The interaction of the  RSCAs with the two ATDs in the pickup truck was also investigated. The ATD loading and airbag interaction differed between the  leading-side and trailing-side of the pickup truck. Occupant ejection was not observed to occur in this test. Both tests showed multiple incidences when the occupants' heads were in proximity to the roof. The current study provides insight into  occupant kinematics and injury potential during steer maneuver-induced furrow tripped rollover events, including the effects of RSCAs  and seatbelt pretensioners.

The highest Head Injury Criteria (HIC15) that occurred  Sedan Driver Kinematics and Loading during the first roll was 49.9, well below the IARV of 1000. The sedan was accelerated to a speed of 105 kph (65 mph) prior to  release and the subsequent steering maneuvers. After the right and  left steer inputs, the sedan's tires began to furrow into the soil surface.  The speed at trip was 55 kph (34 mph) and occurred 2.65 s after the  vehicle was released from the tow system. The sedan completed 3-1/2  revolutions in a passenger side leading direction over a distance of 29  m (95 ft) and came to rest on its roof. The average roll rate during the  event was 251 deg/s with a peak roll rate of 548 deg/s during the  second roll. An overview of the sedan driver kinematics during the steer  maneuver, soil furrowing, and at each 1/8th roll position of the  rollover sequence in provided in the Appendix (Figures 39, and 41,  42, 43, 44), with the latter illustrated in the context of the vehicle  dynamics (roll angle, roll rate, and vehicle acceleration). As the sedan  began to steer towards the right, the driver ATD moved slightly  outboard relative to the vehicle interior and the torso belt moved  closer to the ATD's neck. As the vehicle steered towards the left, the  driver ATD moved rightward (inboard), and the torso belt moved  towards the ATD's left shoulder. As the vehicle furrowed into the soil,  the driver ATD leaned inboard and the torso belt moved off of the  ATD's left shoulder. As the vehicle began to roll through the first  quarter roll and into the inverted position, the ATD moved outboard  relative to the vehicle, and the torso belt once again moved into a  position over the outboard shoulder towards the ATD's neck. The  ATD head became positioned against the underside of the roof rail  and against the glass. The driver's side roof rail and front window  glass made contact with the ground and onboard video showed that  the glass had fractured by 3.220 s. The glass likely fractured due to a  combination of occupant loading and contact with the ground. The  ATD peak compressive upper neck load of 4972 N (1118 lbf)  occurred shortly thereafter at 3.223 s with the vehicle roll angle at  190 degrees (0.53 revolutions) (Figure 7).

The  loading of the neck due to motion of the torso toward the head after  the head's motion has been arrested is referred to as “torso  augmentation” and has been well described in previous rollover  literature (e.g., Raddin et al., 2009). The peak Nij associated with this  event was 1.13 in compression-extension (Nce) with a compressive  force of 4964 N (1116 lbf) and an extension moment of 42.8 N-m  (378.8 lbf-in). The peak extension moment was 44.0 N-m (389.0  lbf-in) and occurred 3.9 ms after the peak compressive neck load.

Note that for head and chest  accelerations the downward direction relative to the ATD is positive,  and upward is negative. The axial head acceleration pulse lasted for  approximately 45 milliseconds with a FMA acceleration of 21.3 g  occurring at 3.205 seconds. The acceleration pulse acting on the chest  lasted for approximately 74 milliseconds, with a FMA acceleration of  17.1 g occurring at 3.211 seconds. There was a lag of approximately  5.6 ms between the acceleration pulses of the head and chest, which  corresponded to the compliance between the head and torso and the  resulting compressive neck load. The negative transient that occurs  during the pulse is due to the release of the head from the constraint  of the window glass as it fractured. Figure 9.

During the first roll, the vehicle traveled approximately 11.6 m (38 ft)  with an average roll rate of 333 degrees per second. Following  fracture of the driver door window glass, the ATD's head moved  outside the plane of the driver side window. As the vehicle completed  the first roll, it became airborne until the passenger-side wheels made  contact with the ground at approximately the 1 1/8-roll position. Just  beyond the 1 1⁄2-roll position, the ATD head stopped due to direct  contact with the ground and the torso continued to move, resulting in  a compressive neck load that also exceeded the IARV. The ATD's  upper neck was loaded to 5984 N (1345 lbf) at 3.970 s (Figure 10).

As the sedan came to rest at the 3 1⁄2 rolls position, the ATD  was inverted and supported by the lap belt, with the torso belt located  on the ATD's upper left arm. The HIC15 for the driver ATD remained well below the IARV of 1000  throughout the rollover sequence. The driver ATD experienced six  neck loading events that exceeded 1000 N (two of which exceeded  the IARV of 4000 N) that were further evaluated. The axial head  acceleration magnitude, axial chest acceleration magnitude and neck  compressive loading were plotted as a function of roll angle with the  use of polar plots (Figures 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). This technique,  first introduced by Croteau et al. (2010), is useful given the cyclic  nature of the vehicle roll position during a rollover event [7]. The  magnitudes of the accelerations and compression force are plotted  radially outward, spaced at 10 g/division or 1000 N/division,  respectively, with the zero degree vehicle roll angle (upright) at the  12 o'clock position. Due to the passenger-side leading nature of these  rollovers, demonstrative graphics show the 45-degree positions in the  CCW direction as viewed from the front of the vehicle. The polar plot  analysis revealed that neck-loading events were associated with axial  chest and head accelerations pulses. The accelerations and loading  events were also compared as a function of time (Figures 21, 22, 23,  24, 25, 26). In all six sedan-driver ATD loading events, the head FMA  acceleration occurred first, followed by the chest FMA acceleration,  and then the neck compression peak (Table 1). This pattern  corresponds to torso augmentation as described in [6]. Furthermore,  at or just proceeding the head FMA acceleration, there was alignment  of the head and chest axis, creating an environment in which inertial  forces from the torso are transmitted to the head and create a scenario  in which neck compression can occur.

The resultant chest acceleration during the  contact was 47.4 g, which was below the IARV of 60 g resultant  acceleration. The HIC15 associated with the head contact was 319.9,  below the IARV of 1000. As the vehicle came to rest after 3 1⁄2 rolls, the ATD was positioned  upside down in the vehicle, the torso belt was positioned closer to the  right shoulder, and the ATD head was in contact with the roof  structure of the sedan. The Nij remained below the IARV and the  HIC15 remained below the IARV throughout the roll sequence. The  passenger ATD experienced two compressive neck loading events  that exceeded 1000 N that were further evaluated using the polar plot  analysis as described previously (Figures 27 through 28 and Table 1).  As with the driver ATD, the passenger ATD loading events revealed a  timing pattern in which the head FMA acceleration occurred first, the  chest FMA acceleration occurred second, and the neck compression  peak occurred third. Furthermore, head-neck-chest body segments  were aligned during the events. The second event (Figure 28)  occurred near the 45-degree roll orientation. At that time, the  vehicle's right side tires impacted the ground and altered the vehicle  motion such that the ATD head moved into the passenger side roof  rail. This event demonstrates that neck loading can occur in non- inverted vehicle orientations as discussed in Heller, et al. [8]. Figure 13.

Safety / Volume 3, Issue 2 (July 2015) Pickup Driver Kinematics and Loading The pickup was accelerated to a speed of 116 kph (72 mph) prior to  release and the subsequent steering maneuvers. After the right and  left steer inputs, the pickup's tires began to furrow into the soil  surface. The speed at trip was 71 kph (44 mph) and occurred 2.55 s  after the vehicle was released from the tow system. The pickup  completed four revolutions in a passenger side leading direction over  a distance of 44 m (144 ft) and came to rest upright on its wheels.  The average roll rate during the event was 329 deg/s with a peak roll  rate of 617 deg/s during the second roll. The pickup driver kinematics during the steer maneuver, furrow and  rollover sequence are illustrated in the Appendix (Figures 40 and 49,  50, 51, 52). As the vehicle began to steer to the right, the driver ATD  moved slightly to the left (outboard) relative to the vehicle. As a  result, the torso belt moved slightly towards the ATD's neck. As the  vehicle began to steer to the left, the ATD moved back through its  nominal seating position and then continued to move to the right  (inboard) relative to the vehicle. As the right side tires began to  furrow and the left wheel began to lift off of the ground, the driver  ATD was located just inboard relative to the seat centerline, and the  torso belt was located on the ATD's left shoulder. This lateral ATD  excursion was limited by the tethering of the ATD torso to simulate  the effect of human counter-posturing. The vehicle's RSCAs deployed  at 2.439 s after tow release with the vehicle at the 32.3-degree roll  angle and roll rate of 128 degrees per second.

The activation of the seatbelt pretensioner and ATD tether release  occurred simultaneously to the RSCA deployment. Prior to the  pretensioner activation, the torso webbing load was 156 N (35 lbf)  and the lap belt webbing load was 89 N (20 lbf). Activation caused a  short transient spike in the torso webbing load that was approximately  81 ms in duration and had a peak of 1824 N (410 lbf). Similarly,  activation caused a spike in the lap belt webbing load that had a peak  of 727 N (164 lbf) and duration of approximately 67 ms. The string  potentiometer located between the D-ring and retractor mouth  measured 8.3 cm (3 1⁄4 in) of webbing movement, while analysis of  the onboard video indicated the torso portion of the seatbelt moved  approximately 5 cm (2 in) towards the D-ring with respect to the ATD  chest (Figure 15). At the time of RSCA deployment, the ATD’s head and left shoulder  were inboard of the airbag. The deployment event was associated  with a tensile neck load of 324 N (73 lbf) and a resultant chest  acceleration of 10.3 g, neither of which approached their associated  IARV. The resultant acceleration of the ATD head was less than 9 g. Figure 15.

This roof-to-ground contact resulted in the  driver ATD head impacting the RCSA/roof rail and was associated  with a HIC15 of 231.7 and an upper neck compressive load of 1681  (378 lbf). The vehicle completed the second roll by vaulting with four  wheels off the ground and with the driver ATD interacting with the  RSCA. The vehicle traveled 8.2 m (27 ft) during the third roll and  experienced an average roll rate of 438 degrees per second. The  inverted position (approximately 2 1⁄2 rolls) did not involve contact  between the vehicle roof and the ground until the driver's side hood  made ground contact and produced a HIC15 of 73.9 and a  compressive neck load of 592 N (133 lbf). The vehicle's fourth roll involved an average roll rate of 187 degrees  per second, and the vehicle traveled 11.9 m (39 ft) before coming to  rest. The fourth roll began as the two rear wheels made ground  contact while the vehicle was nose pitch up. The driver ATD  responded to the impact by moving rearward into its seat and the  head and neck moved into extension. In a production vehicle, the  neck motion likely would have been mitigated due to contact with the  head restraint, which was removed for testing to allow for camera  visualization from the rear of the vehicle. Again, the vehicle did not  make ground contact in the inverted position until approximately 3.6  rolls, when the driver-side hood contacted the ground. The ATD  moved into the curtain during this ground contact. The vehicle came to rest, wheels up, after impacting the ground with  the passenger-side wheels. The driver ATD moved inboard as the  vehicle came to rest and the torso belt slipped off the ATD's left  shoulder. The ATD came to rest leaning inboard with the torso belt  located slightly proximal to the elbow joint. The Nij never exceeded  the IARV of 1.0 throughout the roll sequence, and the compressive  neck loading never exceeded the IARV of 4000 N throughout the  crash event. Figure 16.

Eight such events were identified for the two pickup truck ATDs, with  the driver experiencing a single neck loading event and the passenger  experiencing seven compressive neck loading events. For the pickup  driver ATD, neck loading occurred at 155 degrees. Similar to the  sedan events, pickup driver event 1 showed a pattern of head axial  FMA acceleration occurring first, then chest axial FMA acceleration,  followed by neck compression (Figure 29 and Table 1). For the sedan  passenger (Figure 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36), five of the seven neck  loading events demonstrated a similar timing pattern. One of those  five events was associated with interaction of the head with the  deploying prototype RSCA. Review of the remaining two events  revealed that the head and torso were not aligned; the timing pattern  as described for the other fourteen events in the four ATDs was not  seen in these two events. DISCUSSION The current study involved two steer maneuver-induced furrow  tripped rollover tests using two vehicles, a sedan and a pickup truck.  The pickup truck was equipped with non-production, prototype  RSCAs. In each test, the rollover event was induced by a steer- reversal maneuver wherein the vehicle rapidly steered first to the  right and then to the left on a soil surface. The instrumented vehicle  and front seat ATDs utilized in each test allowed for a detailed  analysis of the occupant kinematics and injury response throughout  the pre-trip phase as well as the entire rollover sequence.

The lag of the  chest acceleration relative to the head acceleration demonstrated in  the current study, followed by the neck loading, supports the  conclusions of previous research that compressive neck injuries  occurring during rollover events are a result of neck loading produced  by motion of a torso mass toward a stopped head [4, 6, 8, 20].  Injuries resulting from this mechanism are often referred to as  “diving” injuries, and have been well established in the  Figure 18.
