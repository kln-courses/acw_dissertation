The two volumes of The Life of Reptiles by Angus Bellairs could well have been entitled The Natural History of the Reptiles, since his title does not seem to include the entire gamut of material he has incorporated into his work. Dr. Bellairs presents a very scholarly and basic study of the reptiles. He has obviously searched extensively into the available literature. The volumes are no doubt designed to reach a wide-reading public. The more techni- cal details are limited. Yet there is plenty of substance, even for the highly trained special- ist, in the field of herpetology. The reptiles, except in the case of devoted herpetologists, have been largely neglected by students of the vertebrates. University classes in Vertebrate Zoology study the reptiles in a cursory manner. This many, in part, be due to the fact that extreme anatomical variation occurs among modern reptiles, so much so, that the study of any one form cannot be used very well as a type for the entire class. This is well borne out in Bellairs' work. His The Life of Reptiles now provides students with a very excellent source of information on a comparative basis. Compiling the more recently published advances and summarizing the material, some of it into table form, was a major accomplishment. The work is divided into 13 chapters and goes well beyond the usual array of subject matter found in texts on specific vertebrate groups. For instance, in the chapter on Feeding and Cranial Mechanics, the various movements of the different types of jaws and jaw suspensions in biting, holding, and swal- lowing food are well described. The subject of thermal control is brought up to date in the chapter on Internal Economy (Physiology). Perhaps more detail could have been pre- sented regarding the early stages of embry- ology and organogenesis; however, this is well compensated for by his analysis of possible parthenogenesis. Although some question may be raised concerning the actual chromo- somal picture of parthenogenesis, the fact that the phenomenon of parthenogenesis occurs among the Aves, such as the turkeys, provides data that enable one to believe that the same can occur among the reptiles. A valuable chapter is the one on The Venom Apparatus and Venom. Bellairs discusses the physiological effects of these substances on other vertebrate groups. Something of the chemistry and a more detailed account of the physiological action of venoms would be a valuable addition. Perhaps the one minor criticism that can be leveled at Dr. Bellairs' work is his very frequent use of the anthropomorphic inter- pretation of the need and/or use of some of the unique anatomical and physiological features found among the reptiles. When he discusses the locomotor apparatus among snake-like reptiles, he states: "Many of the Squamata have found it advantageous to lose their limbs and move by wriggling, and this trend has necessarily been accompanied by the elongation of the body, etc." While survival requires, or is based upon, advantages, evolution is little concerned with advantages as such. Throughout, his statements or al- lusions seem to infer an anthropomorphic interpretation of causes, effects, and/or results. However, Bellairs may not have had this in mind. The work has the stamp of an abbreviated compendium of all the material relating to reptiles. It will serve well as a valuable reference for a wide variety of scholars and academicians as well as lay readers. The volumes are greatly enhanced by the nearly 150 excellent figures, mostly line drawings, meticulously done and printed. The editing of the figures is also very well done; the organi- zation and page arrangement is above reproach. References to the figures are easy to follow and the symbols used in labeling the figures are quite adequate. No doubt because of the international intent for the distribution of the work,, measurements are given in both the English and the metric systems. This writer fails to see the need for such duplica- tion. Very few errors in proofing were noted. The very extensive bibliography makes that portion of the volumes extremely valuable and easily worth the price of the entire work. Dr. Bellairs has done a very real service for herpetologists in particular, and for vertebrate zoologists in general. His method of describ- ing the various anatomical features of the reptiles and comparing them with earlier and later vertebrates puts his work in a class with some of the works of Georges Cuvier, Etienne Saint Hillaire, and others. As stated earlier, the present volumes bring the subject matter well up to date. This reviewer would like to commend Dr. Bellairs for his work, The Life of Reptiles, and recommend it as an extremely valuable reference source on almost any subject involving this large animal group. The volumes are well written, displaying the author's rare literary skill, and hence make very pleasurable reading. RAYMOND J. GREB R. F. D. #2, Box 110 St. Croix Fall, Wis.</page></plain_text>
