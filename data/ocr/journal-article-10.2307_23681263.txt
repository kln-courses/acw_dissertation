C. van Velsen, Zoetermeer Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence1 Abstract: This paper tries to solve the apparent contradiction between relativism and universalism by constructing a theory of human well-being and peaceful coexistence. It assumes that ail judgments are subjective. It is shown that Pareto improvement of well being is équivalent to récognition of the subjectivity-principle together with the right to be safeguarded from the conséquences of the activities of others. It follows that relativism and universalism do not exclude but complément each other. When the conditions are violated the réduction of well-being is minimised if a reciprocity principie is respected. Implications for human rights, collective decision-making, cultures, states and hierarchical organisations are explored. 1. Some Problems With Relativity and Universality.2 The Plan of this Paper The ultímate implications of relativity and universality don't seem to be intended by their proponents. Relativistic authors systematically neglect the phenomenon of cul tures that consider themselves superior to other cultures, and from their superiority Acknowledgments: This paper has been written in conséquence of three articles on relativism and universal human rights by dr P.B.Cliteur and A.Brand &amp; C.Bronsveld in Beleid en Maatschappij (Policy and society) in 1994-1995 (Cliteur, P.B., Relativisme en mensenrechten (Relativism and human rights), Beleid en maatschappij (1994) 143-153. - Brand, A., and Bronsveld, C., Het voor deel van de twijfel.

Relati vity fails to explain if and why such a norm should be excepted from relativity, and how one is to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable norms. Universalistic au thors seem to think only of widely shared norms and values, and not for example ways of life or musical tastes. How should relativism and universalisai be defined if they are not to be defined in an absolute sense? Neither relativism nor universalism is consistent. When stating the équivalence of cultures, relativism présupposés (or defines) a universal measuring-stick of which it déniés the existence. Universalism assumes the existence of objective norms and values, but does not explain how this can be reconciled with the subjective character of many (other) norms and values. Nevertheless, both seem to contain a kernel of truth. The criticism of relativism against the assumption of the existence of objective norms and values has not been refuted, and universalism is correct in pointing outthe existence of widely shared norms and values which nevertheless are not consistently respected by governments. The work on this paper was started as an analysis of relativity and universality. It has resulted in a synthesis. The synthesis begins with the observation that Pareto improvement is the only type of improvement of human well-being which is compati ble with the subjectivity-principle. It ends with the conclusion that such improvement is ensured only if every culture has the right to arrange by itself ail those affairs that have no conséquences for other cultures, and to be safeguarded from the consé quences of the activities of other cultures. In other words: activities which have consé quences for other cultures need their consent. This right respects the subjectivity and relativity of norms and values. Its universality is proportional to the agreement on human well-being as an inviolable value and about the subjectivity of norms and valu es.3 The synthesis takes the edges off both relativism and universalism, and makes them complementary. In order to be able to specify and argue the theorems in question, the concepts of the colloquial language are too multivalent and ambiguous. For this reason, para graphe 2-5 of the paper are devoted to the définition of the basic concepts. Relations with other concepts are elucidated. It is shown why the given définitions are préféra ble to some alternatives. Paragraphs 6 and 7 contain the argumentation for the most important theorems. In paragraphs 8-11 some conséquences of the theorems are analysed and compared with reality.

Inviolable norms should be distinguished from norms with a high priority (or weight). Priorities are only relative, and need not be décisive. If a norm of lower priority is sufficiently at stake this may turn the scales. Example: quality and appearance.</page><page sequence="3">90 J. F. C. van Velsen and articles describing relativity and universality. No effort has been made to give references for all the topics touched upon. The paper is an attempt to obtain meaningful results on the basis of explicitly defined concepts and logical reasoning. This may sometimes give the text a some what formal character. For this the author begs the reader's understanding. 2. Subjective, Objective, Consensus and Language Two of the most fundamental concepts in the discussion about relativity and universa lity are "subjective" and "objective". Subjective is understood to mean: depending on individual judgments, and not binding upon others. Objective means: independent of individual judgments. There are good reasons to doubt the applicability of the concept "objective" to anything, at least in an absolute sense, independent of the physiology, history and présent circumstances of the people using it. It is not known how the objectivity of anything might be proven. For this reason we shall never assume that something is absolutely objective. The same holds for the concept "true" and con cepts like "true proposition". However, saying that these concepts cannot be taken at face value does not mean that they are not useful. They will here be understood in subjective terms, namely in terms of consensus; and in a relative instead of absolute sense. The argumentation in this paper implies that a society can do without absolu tely objective concepts or truths, and that consensus is both necessary and sufficient. From a practical point of view absolute objectivity is not necessary. With regard to both relativity and universality it is important to note that the lack of (absolutely) objective norms and values does not exclude the possibility that there exist norms and values which are shared by (almost) all people; in other words, that there exists (almost) unanimity about these norms and values . Because of their subjective nature, normative Statements should always be inter preted in terms of human judgments. Their practical significance dépends on their argumentation and on the group of people sharing them. The most one can attain is consensus. Even if not possible on everything, consensus is not so utopian as some times imagined. Consensus présupposés communication, and communication pré supposés a certain consensus. The possibility of consensus is therefore related to the existence of a common language. A common language implies a lot of consensus. The existence and use of words implies agreement about their meaning and relevan ce. Furthermore there is agreement about the rules that expressions in a language should obey. As a resuit a language can be used to find out whether a message has been understood approximately as intended, or to falsify this hypothesis. The concept "objective" can be used to refer to matters that cannot be denied without giving rise to conflicts with the consensus about the language. Inconsistency of statements is an example of an objective concept. Statements are inconsistent if they are équivalent with statements which contradict each other. Which means that they are incompatible from the linguistic point of view. By asserting that a statement is simultaneously true and false the words true and false are stripped of their meaning. Something could be called more objective if more people agree with it, or if they agree about the irrelevance of personal opinions. The consensus about the language can serve as a basis for generating unanimity. The generating-process is made possible by reasoning (whether reasoning is implied by the language or not). Reasoning can be defined as a consensusmethod by which</page><page sequence="4">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 91 consensus-statements are derived from other consensusstatements.4 The observa tion that "objective" is a meaningful practical concept and that it seems possible to formúlate objective propositions can be interpreted as a conséquence of the fruitful ness of the combination of language and reasoning. Reasoning makes it relatively simple to generate new consensus-knowledge by starting from an arbitrary set of existing consensusknowledge. The observation that this process doesn't always or automatically yield consensus can be explained by reasoning-errors, by ambiguities in the language, and by the relative instead of absolute character of objectivity and reliability of the knowledge-set that serves as the starting-point. Though consensus is the maximum attainable, it gives no certainty. It is nevertheless important to note that objective propositions are possible, and that this possibility is a logical conséquence of the consensus about language and reasoning. When it is said in the following that something is objective, it is tacitly assumed that disagreement is only possible if (part of) the language is given up as a means of communication. In an analogous way the reliability of a proposition can be supposed to be propor tional to the agreement that exists about it in the présent and existed in the past, to the possibilities of falsification, and to the amount of rellable knowledge with which it is compatible. "True" can only be the theoretical extreme point of a scale which runs from "extremely spéculative" to "extremely rellable". It follows from the above that in principie it is possible to formúlate objective propo sitions about subjective concepts. With respect to norms and values quite a few things can be established without making value judgments. For example to what extent they are made explicit, whether they are consistent, which of them are rigourously respec ted, and how they are or may be ¡nfringed upon by governments, laws, jurisprudence and in practical circumstances. So the fact that concepts like "objective" and "true" are not applicable to norms and values does not prevent their applicability to propositions about norms and values. That norms and values are subjective might be an objective proposition. That is, a proposition intrinsically linked to the linguistic meaning of the concepts "norms and values" and "subjective". Where objective measuring-sticks are missing, and things nevertheless have to be measured, the subjective judgments of individual people will henceforth be taken as a starting-point. For several reasons it is not feasible to start from the judgments of groups. In general judgments of groups cannot be defined objectively. In the first place there is no objective way of selecting other "groups" than separate individuáis or humanity as a whole. In the second place there is no objective way to aggregate judgments, except by unanimity. 3. Norms and Values, Well-Being, the Use of Force, and Culture: Définitions Another fundamental concept in the discussion about relativity and universality is that of "norms and values". (For reasons of simplicity norms and values will here be con sidered as a single concept. Différences between norms on the one hand and values on the other are not of importance in the context of the présent paper). A system of norms and values is understood to be the system of measuring-sticks by which value Consensus-matters are matters that everybody considers as beyond doubt, fully reliable, or some thing similar. Methods and knowledge (Statements) are examples of "matters". Where applicable words like consensus-methods and consensus-knowledge will be used.</page><page sequence="5">92 J. F. C. van Velsen judgments are made. In particular it is used to range the conséquences of possible actions from the most positive or desirable (in a relative sense) to the most negative or undesirable. If there is more than one alternative, then the system of norms and values determines the outcome of the choice between them. Because decision-making is little more than choosing between alternatives, the result of a decision-making process is determined by norms and values. A positive judgment is équivalent to the value judgment "good" or "correct". An option with a larger value is "better" than an option with a smaller value. Where necessary to make decision-making possible the norms and values should be provided with weights. By a person's well-being will be understood a person's (relative) valuation of his own situation (with respect to other possible situations). The value is determined with the personal system of norms and values; in other words, with a personal measuring stick. The concepts of power and force will be used in the following sense. The use of force refers to human behavior 1) with respect to people who have done nothing of which the actors suffer negative conséquences; 2) that has a negative effect on people's well-being or results in such a change of their alternatives for action that they (have to) choose options that they find less good than the original ones; and 3) with which they don't agree. Power is the ability to use force. (The use of force is therefore syn onymous with the use of power). Force and power are subjective concepts. Whether force is used is determined by the ones who experience conséquences of another's actions, and not by the actor. By the given définition the use of force automatically leads to a réduction of the well-being of those it is applied to. In accordance with the subjectivity-principle the arguments in this paper always Start from personal norms and values. Some of these norms and values are used to evalúate the behavior of neighbors and other people. They express what is required of others, what is proper, reprehensible and so on. A "culture" can then be defined as a group of people sharing these norms and values. They agree on what is proper. In this définition of "culture" the word people can be replaced by cultures. In that way one can define a hierarchy of cultures. The "culture" at the top of the hierarchy is the system of norms and values shared by all cultures. It may be empty, but otherwise it represents universal norms and values. The concept of culture présupposés consen sus about certain norms and values. For this reason it is possible to speak of the well being of a culture. It is defined by the shared norms and values. Beside the shared norms and values a culture can include norms and values rela ting to topics about which disagreement is accepted. Such norms and values are considered a matter of taste. Note that this need not mean that all these norms and values ("tastes") are considered just as good. Preferences with respect to colors, vegetables, and musical instruments may be quoted as examples. A culture can comprise an arbitrary number of people. What this paper says about cultures and intercultural relations therefore also holds for individual people and their mutual relations. At least theoretically. For it is most remarkable that practice corre sponds better to the main theorems of this paper when the actors have more power. The purpose of this paper is to argue some theorems about coexisting cultures, and to analyse their implications. The terminology has been tailored to that purpose. The définition of the concept of culture given above is an abstraction. It is not preten ded to be a close approximation of a phenomenon in the real world. It differs from the empirical phenomenon studied in cultural anthropology for example. It is defined in such a way that it is clearly distinct from, and complementary to, concepts like state and hierarchical organisation. A person belongs to a culture because of personal</page><page sequence="6">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 93 notions. The choice of a State is hampered in practice by high costs and the (indirect) use of force, and it is far from clear that for every culture there exists a corresponding State such that this State functions in accordance with the norms and values of the culture. Cultures are defined in terms of voluntary agreement. Within a culture, enforcing obedience to its norms and values is excluded by définition. The use of force only makes sense if norms and values differ. That is, if there is disagreement about what is proper. In principie the concept of culture could be defined in such a way that all people who live according to a given system of norms and values belong to one and the same culture, irrespective of their motives for doing so. But such a définition is not compatible with the idea that people belonging to a culture share at least those norms and values that enable them to coexist peacefully. It would obscure the différence between the concepts of culture and State. Just like states, cultures would encom pass incompatible Systems of norms and values. If the définition would allow for this ail people could belong to a single culture. Otherwise subjective boundaries would have to be drawn between little and much use of force. This paper tries to analyse fundamental aspects of relations between cultures with différent norms and values in order to find conditions for peaceful coexistence. For such a purpose a concept of culture is needed that discerns several homogeneous cultures with différent Systems of norms and values. The boundaries should be defined by these Systems, and not by "spheres of influence". The use of force implies acting in contravention to the opinions of the people against whom it is directed. It might be defended on the basis of agreement on political insti tutions.5 It is clear however that there are many states where the constitution is forced upon the population and where such agreement does not exist. Therefore states will be distinguished from cultures. Using the word culture for a group of people whose behavior is partly determined by the use of force is only meaningful if a culture is ascribed a value independent of the well-being of the people who constitute this culture, and if the supplementary value is large with respect to the value of the well-being of the people. Against these assumptions at least two objections can be made. In the first place the idea that the value of the whole is more than the sum of the values of the parts présupposés aggre gation and comparison, and therefore one or more objective measuring-sticks. Accor ding to the subjectivity-principle such measuring-sticks don't exist. In the second pla ce there is an objection of a strictly logical character. It concerns the treatment of a derivative or composite concept like culture as an independent concept, separate from its constituents or sources.6 In a linguistic sense such a treatment is always possible. The new concept can always be said to have a supplementary value. But just because this trick always works it doesn't prove anything. The existence of a supplementary value has to be proven along différent lines. It has been said that some states were insufficiently involved in the formulation of the Universal Déclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (for example Brand and Brons veld in their paper mentioned in note 1). This can only be held as an objection against the UDHR if the use of force in or between cultures or states is rejected. If rulers may be considered as représentatives of a culture regardless of their use of force, then it is hard to see why this should be différent at the international level, and why mankind 5 Even ¡f this is at least paradoxical. 6 Other examples: the eoonomy, traffic.</page><page sequence="7">94 J. F. C. van Velsen may not be represented by the ruling states. In arguing a différent point of view it should be shown why the use of force is to be permitted in the national, and forbidden in the international case. On the other hand the procédure for making décisions about universal norms and values should be in accordance with these same norms and values. Of course, the human rights formulated in the UDHR of 1948 might agree with the rights that would have been formulated if use would have been made of a more reliable method of decision-making (see below). For the time being the agreement remains to be proven. 4. The Equivalence of Cultures. Cultures and Institutions The word équivalent and its derivatives are used here in the sense of having equal value. In that sense they présupposé a measuring-stick which is applicable to all objects of which the value is to be determined. In other words: a universal measure. A measuring-stick for values defines a set of norms and values. If a universal measu ring-stick exists, it defines a universal set of norms and values. As noted in the intro duction, this paper assumes that such a measuring-stick does not exist. It follows that the concept of équivalence is not applicable to cultures. It is impossible to find out whether two cultures have the same or a différent value. Application of the concept of équivalence to cultures suggests the existence of a universal measuring-stick for the value of a culture. People who deny the existence of objective norms and values can therefore better refrain from using it in connection with cultures. In the following we will also need to refer to the objects in reality which are called culture in colloquial langage. These cultures will be distinguished from the concept of culture as defined above by calling them "real culture". The concept of a real culture is not defined very precisely, but for the purposes of this paper this doesn't matter. Now it can be noted that it is not clear in advance that a real culture which uses its own system(s) of norms and values to evalúate and compare itself with other cultures will find itself the best. Such a verdict is self-evident only if the culture was chosen on the basis of a comparative investigation of consistent cultures. For the time being this seems impossible. Real cultures are created and defined by éducation and therefore defined only vaguely. They are not consistent, and often insufficient to enable people to cope with practical situations. For these reasons it is very well possible for mem bers of a given culture to prefer other (real) cultures. Cultures should not be confused with institutions. In general the relation between cultures and institutions is far from clear. As a rule there are contradictions between cultures and institutions. None of the present-day states, démocratie or otherwise, has mechanisms which ensure concurrency of culture and institutions. Majorities can propose changes in institutions at most through représentatives. Changes are effec ted only if the government (administration) as well as a majority of the représentatives agree with them. The science of public choice shows that one cannot rely on majority rule to provide the required general agreement.7 This theme will be pursued in §8. Mueller, D.C. (1989), Public choice II, Cambridge (U.K.), Cambridge University Press.</page><page sequence="8">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 95 5. The Development of Cultures and of Norms and Values Both relativism and universalism seem to take real cultures more seriously than ar guable on the basis of the norms and values of the culture itself. Cultures change under their own influence. They change under the influence of reflection on the con séquences of their norms and values, by élaboration, by getting to know other cul tures, under the influence of governments, and by thinking about all this. Not only through external circumstances upon which they exert no influence. Cultures aren't static but dynamic, even though évolution rates may differ. A culture in which people attach great value to the investigation of their environment, cultures included, and try to make the greatest possible use of their findings, is a learning culture. In general such a culture will show change (development). Part of the évolution of cultures can therefore be interpreted as the resuit of internal evolution-processes such as learning; another part as the resuit of changes in their environment. A culture can use its norms and values to define progress. It could call those changes progress that are valuated positively. One can speak of progress in a more objective sense if the number of inconsistencies within the culture, that is, in its System of norms and values, is redu ced. One of the différences between the concept of culture used here and real cultures concerns the définition of the common system of norms and values. In practice, at most, part of these Systems is made explicit. No system of norms and values has been accepted with unanimity, and it is rarely known who agréés with what. As long as norms and values have not been made explicit it is impossible to speak of consen sus. The consensus cannot be defined more precisely than the norms and values. Part of them may be embodied in the law, but there need not be consensus about the law. In practice we may encounter norms and values we consider good or bénéficiai as well as norms and values we consider bad or harmful. In terms of everybody's personal norms and values this situation is annoying or harmful. Réduction of such différences and the réalisation of a larger measure of agreement may be considered as progress. If not of the theoretical then at least of the real culture. Relativism seems to be somewhat ambiguous about spontaneous developments of cultures, and about the fact that members of a culture can be critical about their own culture. On the one hand it speaks about contingency, on the other hand cultures are équivalent. Universalism has its problems too. It seems to imply that the human rights as formulated in the UDHR represent the last word in a development of millen nia. This seems hard to reconcile with our empirical knowledge of history and law, and presumes more about our abilities in argumentation on social subjects than justifiable on empirical grounds. Real cultures are not consistent, and their development has not reached a stable State. Not every member agréés with ail or even its most important aspects. With regard to the (post)industrial states, one can refer to the use air, water, land, cars and planes, and to the organisation of democracy. Last but not least attention should be given to the relationship between éducation and the continuation and development of cultures. An important part of the norms and values is acquired. This shows that cultures can also change due to changes in the transmission of norms and values to the next génération.</page><page sequence="9">96 J. F. C. van Velsen 6. Compatible Cultures, Safeguarding and Pareto-Improvement Next one can ask for the conditions that have to be satisfied by the Systems of norms and values of neighboring cultures in order to ensure that the members of both cul tures will valúate their situation positively in terms of their own measuring-sticks. The question isn't trivial because différent cultures may have différent ideas about good behavior of and with respect to other cultures. Good behavior may require a passive or agressive attitude, for example. One culture may consider good what another consi dere annoying or harmful. An important aspect of the relation between cultures can be designated by the concept of "compatible". Two cultures will be called compatible if the activities of one of them don't have a negative effect on the well-being of the other, and vice versa. Cultures are compatible for example if their only contacts arise from agreements such as trade. They are incompatible for example if a culture considere neighbouring cul tures inferior, and from this observation derives the right to chase members of the other culture away or to extermínate them. Far too many examples of this kind of incompatibility can be given: compatibility is not self-evident. On the other hand the absence of visible signs of the use of force need not mean that cultures are compati ble. The answer to the question whether nuisance or harm gives rise to action against the perpetrator also dépends on the willingness and ability to undertake such action, and on the reaction it is expected to evoke. In the following it will be argued that compatibility is necessary and sufficient for peaceful coexistence. Compatibility is assured if ail those concerned are (perfectly) indifferent to ail that happens to themselves and others, and make no demands on anyone's behavior. In particular with respect to human rights. Consistent indifférence is not particularly com mon. Most people and cultures distinguish good and bad, and think there are grada tions. They do this in différent ways. In general, for cultures to be compatible, it will be necessary and sufficient that with respect to activities which can have conséquences for others, they recognise: 1. That norms and values are subjective, and that everybody may therefore valúate conséquences independently; 2. That everybody has the right to be safeguarded from these conséquences.8 In the chapter "De la religion civile" of his Contract social Rousseau makes the following remark: « Dans la République, dit le M[arquis] d'A[rgenson], chacun est parfaitement libre en ce qui ne nuit pas aux autres. Voilà la borne invariable; on ne peut la poser plus exactement» (Rousseau, J.J. (1964, original publication 1762), Oeuvres complètes III, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, Paris: Éditions Gallimard, p467). The same idea returns 27 years later in art. 4 of the Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen du 26 août 1789: «La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à autrui: ainsi l'excercice des droits naturels de chaque homme n'a des bornes que celle qui assu rent aux autres membres de la société la jouissance de ces mêmes droits.» (Oberdorff H. (ed.) (1994) Les constitutions de l'Europe des douze, Paris: La documentation Française). The validity of this article is confirmed by the preamble of the French constitution of 1958. In practice priority is given to freedom at the cost of safeguarding. The possibility of infringements was created by the second sentence of the article: «Ces bornes ne peuvent être déterminées que par la loi». This means that there are bounds only if explicitly mentioned by law. Incidentally it can be noted that Rousseau's wholehearted support of the right to be safeguarded does not mean that everything in the Contract social is compatible with this right. There are inconsistencies already within the chap ter "De la religion civile". The interest of the State is assumed to be an objective and inviolable value having the highest priority. It legitimises the réduction of rights of people. Rousseau does not note that his own notions are subjective and human too, and that in reality rights are not reduced by the State but by people who prétend to represent the State. The right to be safeguarded shows a strong resemblance with a principie of J.S. Mil) from 1859:</page><page sequence="10">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 97 The first condition means that an actor submits himself to the judgment of those who are affected by his actions. Agreement is needed of all those (potentially) affec ted. Everybody has the right to veto. In general this will mean that people who fear hindrance or harm from an activity will only agree with it if they are convinced that they will have at least as much benefits from the activity, or if they are properly compensa ted. The two conditions are sufficient because they restrict mutual interférence to acti vées by which no one fears to be affected in a negative way, and because actors always ask permission from everybody who might become affected by the consé quences. Those who recognise the subjectivity of norms and values and the right to be safeguarded restrict themselves to activées nobody objects to. The conditions are necessary because a compelling reason to ask permission only exists if both the subjectivity of norms and values and the right to be safeguarded are recognised. The result can be reformulated in the following theorem, the first of the two main theorems of this paper: Cultures are compatible if and only if they recognise 1 and 2. The theorem can also be formulated in terms of Pareto-improvement. Pareto-im provement of the situation of a group of people means that the well-being of at least one person increases and that nobody's well-being decreases. The concept is rele vant in the présent context because it is the only form of improvement compatible with the subjectivity-principle. According to this principie the well-being of différent people cannot be compared since an objective measuring-stick is missing. An improvement of the well-being of the one cannot be compared with a loss of well-being of another. The well-being of différent people cannot be aggregated. For this reason something like an "aggregate well-being" does not exist. In particular it cannot be maximised by redistribution. In the absence of an objective measuring-stick for human well-being Pareto-improvement is the only kind of improvement that is compatible with the sub jectivity-principle and has empirical meaning. From this discussion and the theorem it follows: If the subjectivity-principle is acknowledged and if improvement of human well-being is accepted as an inviolable value, then récognition of the right to be safe guarded is necessary. Improvement of everybody's well-being is only assured if the right to be safeguarded is respected in all human activées. Only if everybody's well being improves can one be sure that the benefits exceed the costs.9 Progress is only «That principie is, that the sole end for whlch mankind are warranted, indlvidually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of thelr number, Is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized Community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him or reasoning with him, or persuading him or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calcuiated to produce evil to someone eise. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign». Cited from: "On liberty", one of the essays in Levi A.W. (1963), The six great humanistic essays of John Stuart Mill.

C. van Velsen assured if everybody recognises the subjectivity-principle and the right to be safe guarded.10 In practice affected non-actors are rarely safeguarded. In general actors are sup posed to „take account of" non-actors, and no more. To a very large extent actors, authorlties and judges are allowed to settle what is good or bad, and whether benefits exceed costs. As if such matters could be established objectively or mechanically. In this regard the différence between safeguarding and "taking account of is essential. Safeguarding means that the values are determined by those affected; if those affec ted are taken account of the actor is implicitly allowed to decide what non-actors should bear. Note that non-respect of the right to be safeguarded amounts to the use of force. 7. Reciprocity The theorem of the preceding paragraph shows that cultures can only coexist peace fully if everybody recognises the subjective character of norms and values and the right to be safeguarded. But it doesn't tell us how to cope with situations where this assumption doesn't hold. The right to be safeguarded does not permit measures against offenders. Such measures should therefore be based on a différent principie. This principie should have priority over the right to be safeguarded. The following recipro city-principle turns out to be sufficient: nobody has more rights than the rights of others he respects, and no less than necessary to maintain those rights of others he had himself. This means that actors should undo or compénsate their infringements on the rights of others, and that the loss of rights is proportional to the infringements. Infringements of rights resuit in a loss of rights that is sufficient to undo or compénsate the infringements, and no more. Someone who violâtes another's right to be safe guarded can no longer claim this right for himself. However, he doesn't lose more rights than necessary to undo the effects of his past infringements and if need be to avoid future infringements.11 This argumentation leads to the following theorem: If violation of the right to be safeguarded is treated in accordance with the reciprocity principle, then the conséquences of the infringements of the non-actor's right to be safeguarded are minimised with a minimal loss of the actor's well-being. In fact, the reciprocity-principle has been formulated in such a way that this theorem is almost a tautology. As usual conséquences are valuated according to everyone's personal norms and values. The first part of the définition of the principie, nobody has more rights than the rights of others he respects, suspends the actor's right to be safeguar ded until his infringements are undone or compensated. The second part limits the loss of rights to an extent that is necessary to safeguard non-actors. The loss of rights corresponds to a loss of well-being. The least possible loss of rights is therefore équi valent to the least possible loss of well-being. It should be noted that in general there will be several options for the application of the reciprocity-principle within the bound ary condition that the conséquences of infringements upon the right to be safeguar Here it is assumed that everybody has the option of acting in such a way that nobody is affected more than unavoidable due to biological existence or agreed by unanimous consent. In other words: it is assumed that the earth is big enough for all of us. If this assumption doesn't hold the theorem does not as much guarantee improvement of well-being as minimisation of the loss of well being. The theorem concerns only changes in well-being that are conséquences of people's choices between différent options. "If need be": this may dépend for example on the repairability of the infringements.</page><page sequence="12">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 99 ded of non-actors are undone or compensated. The compensation can take différent forms, and future safeguarding can be guaranteed in différent ways. One can there fore choose the option that minimises the loss of well-being of the actor. By the reciprocity-principle offenders may be forced to redress or compensation, including the costs of maintaining the institutions which trace and try offenders. No less and no more. Only offenders can be forced to contribute. (Though everybody is free to contribute). In accordance with the subjectivity-principle offenders are treated as they treat others. A thief may complain for being robbed in return, but he has no grounds to Claim rights he withholds others. Note that the loss of well-being resem bles Pareto-improvement. Pareto-improvement means: nobody worse off, and at least one better off. Together with the the first theorem the second one implies: nobody better off, and at most one worse off, namely the actor. A system of norms and values may be inconsistent. This means that one and the same phenomenon can simultaneously have a (strictly) positive and negative value. With such a system consistent decision-making is obviously impossible. Alternatives with opposite effects may be given equal values. There are people who don't like that. The assumptions of this paper nevertheless allow cultures or individuáis to be incon sistent. But according to the reciprocity-principle inconsistent people should not requi re other people to be consistent. Or in terms of an inconsistent person: it may be required if inconsistency is required as well. The reciprocity principie requires a cer tain consistency with respect to other people. In this way it also sets bounds to the objections that could be made on the basis of the right to be safeguarded. Objections against activities need only be respected if they are raised by people who refrain from these activities. The right to be safeguarded can be seen as an expression of the equal-rights principie, and as an extension of this right to cultures. According to the first theorem the equal-rights principie can be founded on the basis of the subjectivity-principle and the right to be safeguarded. It cannot be based on the equality of people, for people are not equal. The same applies to cultures. The theorem shows that someone who believes that norms and values are subjective, rejects the use of force, and strives for the improvement of everybody's well-being will grant everyone the same right to be safeguarded. The notion that ail norms and values are subjective is not universal. Some people find subjective well-being less important than observing certain political or religious rules, or fancy that they are in a better position to determine what is good for people than these people themselves. This is équivalent with the assumption of objective norms and values. It is clear that such people don't respect the right to be safeguar ded. "Objective" means that personal opinions don't matter. The conviction that cer tain norms and values are objective therefore absolves someone from considering the opinion of people with other convictions. Moreover, from the objective character of norms and values they may derive the right to meddle with the affairs of people who Claim the right to be left alone. In principie cultures which do and do not recognise the inviolability of well-being and its subjective character are therefore incompatible. Un less the norm requiring everybody to observe the norms and values in question has a lower priority than the norms and values concerning for example tolérance and love of one's neighbour the relation between such cultures is fraught with the threat of the use of force or its actual application.</page><page sequence="13">100 J. F. C. van Velsen 8. Conséquences for Collective Decision-Making Collective decision-making is decision-making by a group of people. The concept refers to the process in its entirety. If applicable it also includes élections and election rules. Important catégories of examples are provided by governments and organisa tions. In general a rule for collective decision-making has conséquences for all parti cipants, and often for others as well. The right to be safeguarded therefore applies. It only permits activities which are supported by everybody who is affected by the consé quences. In short: it requires unanimity. It follows that under the conditions of the first theorem collective decision-making should take place by ail those concerned and with consensus. The support of a majority does not suffice. Deciding by majority öf ters the possibility of neglecting objections of minorities, which violâtes the right to be safeguarded. Note that one can also be affected by the conséquences of a proposed action by having to contribute to its costs. Decision-making by unanimous consent means that only those activities are possible of which everybody expects at least as much benefits as costs. As elsewhere in this paper, benefits and costs are measured by everybody's personal norms and values. Under minor additional assumptions it can be shown that every activity which brings a net benefit to a group as a whole can be amended in such a way that it brings a net benefit to every member of the group. As examples can be mentioned: differential taxes per collective activity12 and com pensation for moving house. It will be clear that récognition of the right to be safeguar ded requires quite a change in the functioning of governments. Majority government and decision-making allows decline, only unanimity can guarantee progress. In fact it is easy to see that only decision-making by unanimous consent is compa tible with the subjectivity principie. After all, the purpose of collective decision-making is to make a Statement like the following: this or that is good, this or that should be done. In other words: the purpose of collective decision-making is to make value judgments. But if such a judgment can never be objective, nobody can be bound by the opinion of others, even if he were the only one to dissent. In other words: everybo dy can only be bound if everyone agrees. The inconsistency of majority decision making and the subjectivity-principle can be shown in a similar way. As point of depar ture we take a remark made at the end of paragraph 2, saying that apart from individu al persons and mankind as a whole no objective subgroups can be specified. Sub groups can only be selected in a subjective way. Since a judgment in general dé pends on the (sub)group by which it is made, the nonexistence of an objective sub group or relative majority means that there is no objective foundation for the proposi tion that a judgment becomes an objective judgment if supported by a subgroup of a given relative size. Objectivity is not obtained by any relative majority whatsoever. This means that the support of a subgroup in itself is no reason for others to comply. Decision-making requires the information of all decision-makers. Decision-making can be called optimal if its conséquences are optimal if measured by the norms and values of those (potentially) affected. Optimising is only possible if the information is as complete and reliable as possible. All decision-makers should therefore be infor med equally well; authorities and managers no better than others. In other words: with respect to subjects of collective decision-making the right to be safeguarded creates an obligation to inform and a right to be informed. This is clearly incompatible with the 12 Wicksell, K. (1896), "Ein neues Prinzip der gerechten Besteuerung", Finanztheoretische Unter suchungen, Jena.

In particular, civil servants should not only have a personal right to provide all relevant information, but should even be obliged to do so. In this paper it is assumed that human rights cannot be established objectively. By définition a culture has norms and values about which there is consensus. Différent cultures may have norms and values in common. This means that it is possible to distinguish between more and less universal norms and values. Rights can be coun ted among norms and values. The most universal are those rights which are shared by all cultures, and about which there is worldwide and possibly historical consen sus.13 For peaceful coexistence it is necessary that différent cultures respect each other's right to be safeguarded. In their mutual contacts they should therefore respect each other's norms and values. (Note that in international trade this has been the custom since days of oíd). Apart from this they are only bound by the internal right to be safeguarded, and not by the norms and values of other cultures. Contacts between cultures should not however be confused with contacts between states by way of governments. Neither should respect for norms and values of other cultures be con fused with respect for governments. 9. The Right to be Safeguarded and Human Rights The right to be safeguarded is both more and less than the human rights in the UDHR. It is more because everything that might affect members of a culture needs their agreement. It is less because it does not necessarily imply social rights, and because cultures are free to waive rights. Différent cultures need not claim the same rights. But among themselves members of a culture should agree about rights; otherwise they don't form a culture. The meaning of human rights obviously dépends on their formulation. A more open formulation means less rights. By clauses like "except restrictions and excep tions established by law" the actual content of a human right is made to dépend on (national) procédures for législation and élections. As long as the UDHR is allowed to dépend on such procédures without subjecting them to norms which are compatible with the human rights, the System may turn out to be quite leaky. The formulation should moreover make quite clear what risks are permitted when, and under what conditions. In this respect as well it should not make itself dépendent on laws. Modem activities threaten human rights, including human lives, in ways which differ from tho se of two centuries ago. Before 1800 there was nearly always a direct connection between action and effect, and the effect could be established easily. At présent hu man rights are also and quite often threatened by risks due to human activities. They may cause the risk of accidents, increase the incidence of cancers and other illnes 13 The mention of historical consensus is meaningful because for example the Romans had a highly developed science of law, and produced a large body of learned books in this field. The develop ment of Roman law has culminated in the Codex Iuris Civilis. This work has been translated in several modern languages, The most recent translations in English are: Birks, P. and McLeod, G., Justinian's Institutes translated with an introduction, Duckworth, London, 1987 and Watson, K., The digest of Justinian, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia (Pa), 1985. A (new) Dutch translation is in progress. As of April 1999 four volumes had been published: Spruit, J.E., Feenstra R., and Bongenaar, K.E.M. (eds.), Codex Iuris Civilis, part I Instituten (1993) and parts III and IV Digesten II and III (1994, 1996 and 1997), Zutphen: Walburg pers and Den Haag: Sdu juridische en fiscale uitgeverij.</page><page sequence="15">102 J. F. C. van Velsen ses, etc. But what seems to be no more than an increased risk for individuáis means more untimely deaths for society. If human rights were taken at face value such risks could not be permltted. Motivating the absolute necessity of exposure to increased risks and the permissibility of specific increases ¡n risks, for example in terms of the number of years of life lost per year, seems no simple task. The more so if the expo sed people have not been asked for permission, and have not been asked whether they believe the actors or authorities who say that their proposais will ultimately bene fit everybody. Regulation may set bounds to risks, but this does not imply setting bounds to harmful conséquences. In any case, régulation limiting risks means allo wing risks and violation of human rights. The continuai changes in standards clearly show that they are not based on reliable argumentation. Permissiveness only makes things worse. Permitting risks is the more questionable if they are not shared equally, and if some people run more risks than others. Open formulations of human rights quite simply mean less rights. The treatment of risks seems to be a rather serious example of the time-lag between law and ethics and other developments in society. There are very few states where more people die for political reasons than in road accidents. The human rights have been formulated for a world which was much sim pler than ours. By observing road traffic one can conclude that within the "car-culture" the integri ty of the human body is not treated as an inviolable right. The integrity of the human body is subordinated to the freedom to drive a car. The problem is that car drivers don't only victimise each other. Per 10 million people and per year they cause hund reds of dead and thousands of wounded among other road-users. Nevertheless the inviolability of the human body is not seen as a sufficient reason to restrict car-driving to roads which are not accessible to other people. Of course this is justified on the basis of démocratie décisions and ("objective") comparison of costs and benefits. But the UDHR does not set the price of human life. It does not make exceptions allowing some to benefit from the loss of rights of others. Not even a majority. Something similar applies to alr traffic. Even the most dangerous parts of air rou tes are permitted to cross such densely populated areas as Amsterdam, Ascuncion and Kinshasa. Of course permission is given only by the public authorities. The per mission of the population most concerned is never asked, and those using and flying planes don't seem to note or care. Using the culture-terminology defined above, one notes that the public authorities and the members of the culture of the (fréquent) fliers don't respect the human rights of the population. This goes to show that even in countries recognising the UDHR there are (sub)cultures which have higher priorities than respect for human body and life, and ignore the opinion of those thinking other wise. Art. 29,2 of the UDHR can be construed so as to permit activities entailing risks. The article reads as follows: «In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpo se of securing due récognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public Order and the general welfare in a démocratie Community». Art. 30 however seems to forbid such an interprétation. It states that «Nothing in this Déclaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein». Interpreting this text in ways that permit activities creating risks seems contrary to the just requirements of morality, to say the least. Furthermore, if it is left to public authorities to weigh rights and freedoms against any "just requirements" we are back to where we started. After</page><page sequence="16">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 103 all the UDHR was intended precisely to safeguard against infringements of human rights by public authorities. As in other places the procédures for collective decision making are crucial. In the meantime it seems that the structural violations of human rights noted in this paper can only be justified on the basis of art. 29,2, even if art. 30 seems to forbid such a use.14 10. Social and Economic Justice. Tolerance Just like human rights and standards for risks, social and economic justice cannot be established in an objective way. Social and economic justice are subjective concepts about which différent cultures may have différent ideas. Their subjectivity is perhaps best shown by the observation that they are elastic. Objective quantification is impos sible. In practice, social and economic justice isn't only about a qualitative principie, but also and foremost about quantities. Agreement on the principie does not mean agreement about the quantity. Those who recognise the subjectivity-principle lack a basis for requesting, let alone forcing, people to contribute a prescribed amount. As regards redistribution of income or possessions there are only two possibilities: volun tary or by the use of force. There is no argumentation which should convince someo ne who respects the right to be safeguarded of the reasonableness of any given amount or percentage. The right to be safeguarded nevertheless offers better perspectives for social and economic justice than might seem at a first glance. One should realise that at présent most activities are based on decision-making of actors alone. If others are allowed to particípate at ail, they rarely have more rights than the right to give an opinion. For quite some time laws have put the right to be safeguarded in a second place and given priority to freedom of action. Ail too often this goes at the cost of minorities or other people who are effectively kept out of the decision-making process. Major ex amples are the unchecked discharge of C02 and other gases in the atmosphère and the immeasurable threat this poses to life as we know it, the extinction of species (sometimes in collaboration with the public authorities: EU vs Canada, whaling), and the exhaustion of minerai resources. The norms and quota employed in this connec tion are no more than forms of "taking account of" which do not respect the right to be safeguarded. If this right were respected, a physical situation shared by a group of people may only be changed with the agreement of ail members of the group. Natural resources may only be used with consensus. Actors are not allowed to impair anyone's well-being. So if the right to be safeguarded forbids Stripping "the rieh", it also forbids the use of riches at the cost of "the poor". Since it requires making décisions by una nimity, it gives minorities and people kept out of decision-making processes the right and power to influence outeomes. If someone's lot is not improved, at least it will not worsen. The right to be safeguarded and consensus are the only known guarantees for general (i.e. Pareto-) improvement. 14 A UDHR could help protecting human rights against infringements by excluding or reducing the possibility of their (re)definition by states. For this reason it should not contain articles that enable governments to reduce the significance of other articles to an unlimited extent. The présent UDHR does not seem to satisfy this condition. The subordination of rights and freedoms to the just (=?) requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in art. 29,2 and the lack of présenti ons for procédures for législation create opportunities for arbitrariness that do not seem to be checked by art. 30.</page><page sequence="17">104 J. F. C. van Velsen Tolérance is a concept with at least two meanings. In the first place it may mean non-interference in another one's affairs as long as one doesn't feel affected in a negative sense. This implies acceptance of différent ways of life, and sets bounds to what is acceptable. From the first theorem it follows that this kind of tolerance is ne cessary for peaceful coexistence. The second meaning of "tolerance" requires acceptance of the hindrance or harm caused by the actions of others. The following discussion is about tolerance in this sense. Just like social and economic justice this kind of tolerance is a subjective and elastic concept. People who agree about the desirability of tolerance can have very différent opinions about the nature and amount of hindrance or harm that should be tolerated. The difficulty of giving a generally acceptable answer to this question may be related to another question: namely the question as to the grounds for demanding, instead of only asking, a specific form of tolerance. Why is someone to be blamed for being "intolerant"? Or isn't he? Perhaps tolerating unintended hindrance or harm that cannot be compensated or restored can be considered a virtue: a value that has positive conséquences for others but is not required by the right to be safeguarded. But why should hindrance and harm be tolerated if permission could have been asked beforehand, if hindrance can be compensated, or if harm can be repaired or compen sated afterwards? Many décisions about activities for which tolerance is requested, and about the admissibility of such activities, are made by public authorities. This would be an acceptable alternative to consensus if it were the only option, and if public authorities would act in accordance with those affected. Neither of these condi tions is satisfied. Two centuries ago it may have been reasonable to assume that progress would be served by giving priority to freedom over the right to be safeguar ded. Towards the end of the 20th Century this belief cannot be maintained, neither on empirical nor on theoretical grounds. Someone who recognises the subjective character of norms and values cannot require tolerance. Requiring incompatible cultures to coexist peacefully is a contradic tion in terms. Différent customs may be considered troublesome or even unaccepta ble: slaughtering cows, repuaiating one's wife, circumcision. Even people who think that everybody should be free to live his life as he likes need not agree with the specific way of life of his next-door neighbour. There is an essential différence be tween tolerating a différent culture far away and close by. Close neighbourhood of members of incompatible cultures reduces everybody's well-being, and may for that reason lead to conflicts and the use of force. Someone who considers human well being as the most important value, and wants everybody to have the opportunity to live according to his own norms and values, will try to avoid creating situations where people will annoy one another by doing so, and will therefore try to avoid mixing incompatible cultures. Instead he will try to create a situation in which people can live in a neighbourhood with compatible cultures, and try to keep incompatible cultures as far apart as necessary to let each live without hindrance to the others. In this way everybody can arrange his own affairs without bothering others. It isn't only unrea sonable to ask Hutu's and Tutsi's to tolérate each other, it also diverts attention from alternative solutions. Discussion and dialogue are often mentioned as methods for solving conflicts be tween cultures. On the basis of the subjectivity-principle some relativising remarks can be made about this idea. For the sake of brevity the word discussion will hence forth be used for both discussion and dialogue. It can then be noted that a discussion between cultures in general cannot concern subjective norms and values. It can only be about inconsistencies in Systems of norms and values and about ways to coexist</page><page sequence="18">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 105 with as much mutual benefit or as little mutual hindrance as possible. Someone who recognises the subjective character of norms and values will only discuss them on the basis of the theorems formulated above. Furthermore it should be noted that agree ment about matters of which the subjective character is recognised need not be at tainable. Those who recognise the subjectivity-principle will not set their hope on agree ment about subjective matters. They will rather look for more realistic solutions. In the last resort the other culture can be confronted with the conséquences of the reciproci ty-principle. Discussion présupposés a measure of agreement about norms and values. Reli ability is an important example of such a norm. But reliability with respect to members of other cultures cannot be taken for granted. A truiy différent (incompatible) culture may consider cheating as a legitímate means to repress or destroy the other culture. The notion that discussion is an important method for solving conflicts represents a subjective value which is not shared by ail cultures. One concludes that from the subjectivistic point of view discussion is not always an obvious method for solving conflicts between cultures. Too much reliance on discussion may resuit in the neglect of fundamental limitations of this and other methods for problem-solving. Note that the argumentation of this paragraph can also be interpreted as an explanation of the fréquent failure of intercultural discussions and negotiations. 11. States and Hierarchical Organisations In the context of relativism, universalism and peaceful coexistence the presence of power-structures is the most important property of states and hierarchical organisa tions. As a rule both types of organisation consist of members of différent cultures. The functioning of organisations is nevertheless determined only in part and indirectly by the cultures of the employées and Citizens. The functioning of states is determined in part by power-structures, the functioning of organisations by internai power-struc tures and the institutions of the surrounding state. The use of power is meaningful only if there are important différences of opinion. States and organisations are no cultures. They don't have a single but many Systems of norms and values. In addition to this the state and the organisations themselves create normative frameworks. Of these, the distribution of authority or power is probably the most important. The well-being of people and cultures has been defined in paragraph 3 as their own valuation of their situation by their own system of norms and values. In principie this System is consistent, and at least it could be. Consistency implies single-valued ness: every situation is valued in precisely one way. In organisations this is différent. There, multivalency and inconsistency are the rule. There are just as many situations as there are people. Even if only the situation of the organisation is considered, assu ming that it can be defined uniquely, it can still be valued differently by différent peop le. There simply is no single agreed (objective or consensus) procédure for the valua tion of every possible situation of organisations. Hierarchical use of power may redu ce the significance of personal norms and values while working as a member of the organisation, but it does not set aside the personal valuation of the things that are going on in the organisation. It follows that the définition of the well-being of people cannot be applied to hierarchical organisations, and that it is not possible to define a concept of well-being for hierarchical organisations that is comparable with that for human beings. The same conclusion could have been drawn directly from the subjec tivity-principle. After all this principie implies that there is no objective measuring-stick</page><page sequence="19">106 J. F. C. van Velsen for human well-being. In general, aggregation of the well-being of a group of people is therefore impossible. So the concept of well-being as defined for human beings and cultures has no comparable counterpart for organisations. In practice the financial perspective of an organisation, its "interest", is its most important value. As such it is supported by law and jurisprudence. In any case a positive financial perspective is essential for independence. The use of the word "in terest" corresponds closely with the internal functioning of organisations, where it plays a dominant role. But although its interest is the most important value of an Organisation, it does not define a system of norms and values from which policy and activities can be derived unambiguously. An organisation's interest is just as important in law and jurisprudence. Authorities and judges are regularly asked to weigh interests against each other. But while the word "interest" appropriately Covers the norms and values of most organisations, it cannot be considered appropriate in representing the most important norms and values of natural persons. For example the right to decide for oneself how important (other) norms and values are in relation to what other people consider as one's interest can only be understood as an interest after a substantial redéfinition of the meaning of "interest". In this connection it may be noted that the increased use of the word in law and régulation can be interpreted as evidence of systematic favouring of organisations, and of the increase of their power as compared to that of natural persons. Clearly the interest-terminology is being used because both people and or ganisations have interests, and only people norms and values. Money and financial interests are the only known measuring-stick by which both human beings and orga nisations can be measured. But the refusai to recognise other norms and values be side financial interest, or the inability to take them properly into account, has the side effect of reducing the role of norms and values of a non-financial nature, and of lea ving better ways of decision-making out of considération. Most organisations have competitors. If not for a market, then for part of the bud get of the State. Partly because of their multicultural composition states and hierarchi cal organisations are aware of the subjective and therefore relative character of norms and values. Together with the priority given to their interests in the presence of com petitors this explains why states and hierarchical organisations tend to adhéré to no more than the most common norms and values as embodied in the law. Moreover, since acting otherwise might benefit competitors, their respect for the law will not be greater than necessary to prevent costs to exceed benefits. In other words: the enti ties in our society that have the greatest capacity for causing trouble and harm subject themselves to the least constraints. Compétition is only compatible with the right to be safeguarded if all participants agree with it, and if non-participants are safeguarded. This condition is fulfilled for tennis, but not for football, where the costs for repairing trains and shops are passed on to the general tax-payer, at least in the Netherlands. As regards agreement: due to différences in régulation and import- and export-duties this can certainly not be consi dered international. As regards the safeguarding of non-participants: resources are being consumed, the environment is being changed and is made to run immeasu rable risks, within organisations force is used against employées, and product-infor mation is purposely incomplète, as in the case of producís of genetically manipulated organisms. The above shows that it cannot be assumed that the interest of hierarchical orga nisations coincides with that of the well-being of the people involved. Even if use of the word "interest" in this connnection would be justified, the interest of organisations</page><page sequence="20">Relativity, Universality and Peaceful Coexistence 107 cannot be identified with that of people. This situation is to be contrasted with that of cultures. Cultures are defined in terms of shared norms and values. These norms and values provide a définition of the well-being of a culture which is consistent with that of its members. The argumentation of the theorems on compatible cultures and Pareto-improve ment show how the right of human beings and cultures to be safeguarded can be founded. A similar argument does not apply to states and organisations. The right of a state or organisation to be safeguarded can easily clash with the corresponding right of human beings. (Note that the right of a person to be safeguarded can never clash with this right of another person). Only at the cost of inconsistency and human suffering can it be extended from natural persons to natural persons plus corporati ons. Consistent extension is only possible if the well-being of organisations is defined and équivalent with the well-being of people. At présent this condition is not satisfied, so that in general human well-being is not served by safeguarding states and hierar chical organisations. In the past two centuries the incompatibilities only seem to have grown. Human rights can be founded on the right to be safeguarded. If the right to be safeguarded cannot be extended to organisations without generating inconsisten cies, then the généralisation of human rights to organisations (corporations) is un founded as well. The above shows that anthropomorphic treatment of organisations is far from self-evident. In principie, permitting hierarchical organisations to use politi cal means to further organisational ends is contrary to the well-being of people.15 Only if organisations recognise the right to be safeguarded of people within and wit hout the organisation, and therefore take décisions by unanimous consent, can it be assumed that their interest agrees with the well-being of people. In that case they can no longer be called hierarchical organisations but rather consensus organisations. For states something similar can be said. Récognition of the right of self-determina tion is compatible with (universal) human rights only if states internally recognise the right of people to be safeguarded (and not that of hierarchical organisations). It is clear that the incompatiblities mentioned in the présent subparagraph have not yet been eliminated from international law and by the United Nations.16 The above shows that the law and jurisprudence on organisations leave much to be desired. Organisations and human beings are dissimilar, even if neglecting the dissimilarity seems the easiest practicable. Giving equal (classical) rights to people is very différent from giving equal rights to both people and organisations. The définition and applicability of the concept of equal rights to human beings and organisations should obviously be thoroughly revised. Of course, in practice people and organisa As political activities of organisations can be mentioned: lobbying tor projects, contracts, specific régulation, subsidies and exemptions. Note that constitutions give political rights only to human beings. Freedom too is attributed only to people, not to corporations. So for this reason as well political activities of organisations are questionable. The only organisations mentioned in constitu tions are the organisations of the State. To put it otherwise: even after two centuries of discussions about the political role of organisations it has not been possible to draw conclusions that can be incorporated in constitutions. Note that in general articles of (international) law should be compatible. Admitting Incompatible norms and values (articles of law) brings high theoretical and practical costs. Incompatible norms and values need non-standard procédures or behavior in order to create seemingly consistent decision-making. As a solution décision theory suggests a procédure in which outcomes are quan tised, and norms and values are given weights. The practical conséquence of refusing to harmoni se the right to self-determination of states with the right of human beings to be safeguarded con sists in the (justified) use of force by freedom movements, terrorism and war.</page><page sequence="21">108 J.

Human beings have to insure themselves against calamities; if organisations fail, it is the creditors and tax-payers who pay the bill. Some organisations are more equal than others: there are important différences in subsidies and duties between branches of industy, if not between organisations within a given branch. At least in Europe organi sations that do worst can often count on the greatest favours. For example the United States' law knows the "class action", but for example in the Netherlands and France only organisations have the right to defend other values than their own financial in terests. Even if giving such a right exclusively to organisations is forbidden by art. 7 of the UDHR, which says that «Ail are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Déclaration and against any incitement to such discrimination».18 Authors address: Dr. J. F. C. van Velsen, Ministerle van OCenW, Directle WO, Kamer E450, Postbus 25000, NL-2700 LZ Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. 17 The remark that this is because people and organisations are incomparable is correct and supports the thesis being expounded. 18 The objection that the UDHR says nothing about organisations or the rights of corporations only proves a fundamental deficiency of the UDHR.</page></plain_text>
