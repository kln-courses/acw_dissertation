<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shi- Nyi Lon-: Great Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu) of North Thailand By ANTHONY R. WALKER National University of Singapore INTRODUCTION This article describes three major ritual occasions in the annual cere- monial cycle of the Lahu Nyi, or Red Lahu, hill people among whom I lived for a number of years in the late 1960s.1 It also presents, both in the original and in translation, the texts of the prayers recited on such occasions.2 The occasions in question are called shi- nyi lon-3 or " great merit days." In a previous publication (Walker 1981b), I described in some detail the twice-monthly shi- nyi or ordinary " merit days." These days of the new and full moon are occasions when Lahu Nyi villagers make a special effort to restore good relations with the supernatural world, both by accumulating aw_ bon " merit, blessings," and by ridding themselves of ve' ba- " demerit, sin." At the same time, through ritual, these Lahu Nyi villagers reaffirm their village-wide communal identity and so modify, to some degree, the intense household orientation of everyday life. In my previous paper I also noted that many of the ideas under- lying the Lahu Nyi celebration of merit days can be traced to their lowland neighbors, the Theravada Buddhist Tai4 peoples. Nevertheless, both the Lahu ritual practices and their supporting ideology constitute a distinctively Lahu adaptation of Tai custom. The Lahu practices relating to the three " great merit days " are likewise much influenced by lowland Buddhist custom and, like the earlier-described shi- nyi rites, provide a fascinating example of how non-Buddhist hill people in this part of northern Southeast Asia adopt and adapt aspects of the lowlanders' Buddhist culture without necessarily themselves becoming Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 43, 1984, 275-302.</page><page sequence="2">276 ANTHONY R. WALKER fully integrated into that culture. The Lahu are one of many culturally distinct minority peoples inhabiting the rugged hill country where China's far southwestern province of Yunnan meets the Southeast Asian states of Burma and Laos, with Thailand only a few hundred kilometers away (see Map).</page><page sequence="3">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI Originally located wholly in Yunnan (still their population center),5 some Lahu during the nineteenth century-if not earlier-began moving southwards into territories which are now part of Burma and Laos6 and, subsequently, into what is now the northern region of the kingdom of Thailand. The desire to escape imperial Chinese "pacification" measures directed at them as " barbarians " of the frontier regions, and a need for new farming lands, seem to have been the principal motives for the move (cf. Walker 1975a: 332-33; 1975b: 113-114). Today there are some 37,500 Lahu living in Thailand, of whom about 48 per cent are Lahu Nyi or Red Lahu (Lewis and Lewis 1983: 4). These people are scattered through about 160 hill villages whose economic base is, for the most part, the shifting cultivation of a sub- sistence hill-rice crop and a number of cash crops, of which opium and chillies are probably the most important (cf. Walker 1976h). Lahu Nyi villages are led by headmen called hk'a^ sheh hpa " master" (sheh_ hpa) " of the village" (hk'a^), whose authority is supported or modified by that of the village elders and ritual practi- tioners. Such village communities are usually quite small, averaging only seventeen households per village. The average number of persons per household is just over six (Lewis and Lewis 1983: 13). In Thailand the overwhelming majority of Lahu Nyi follow a traditional ideology of the supernatural world which includes belief in the existence of a great number of spirits, generically termed ne'. Many of these are associated with natural phenomena such as hills, streams, sun, lightning and rainbow (cf. Walker 1977b: 63; 1976g: 437438; 1976c: 167-168; 1977c: 212-213; 1977d: 227-229). Lahu Nyi do not regard such powers as invariably malicious but, because they are sure that nature spirits can attack people, they propitiate them either to prevent or to remove misfortune (cf. Walker 1976a for examples of prophylactic rites and 1977a for a remedial one). Other spirits have the capacity to guard people, their houses, their crops and their animals. Most important of these guardian spirits are the yeh_ ne' or house spirit (cf. Walker 1977e) and G'ui_ fu, sometimes called ne~ lon- " the great spirit," who is said to protect the village (cf. Walker 1981b: 668-669, n. 7). Other spirits important to these Lahu Nyi are those of the ancestors who have passed peacefully into the land of the dead (cf. Walker 1972b) and those of people who, because they suffered a " bad" (unnatural, violent) death, are thought always to be trying to bring others to the same miserable end (cf. Walker 1976a: 381). Besides the spirits or ne~, the Lahu Nyi believe in a supreme and creating divinity called G'ui. sha (etymology obscure, cf. Walker 1980d: 56, n. 12). Among the Lahu Nyi I studied, G'ui, sha is conceived 277</page><page sequence="4">ANTHONY R. WALKER sometimes as an anthropomorphic deity, appropriately addressed in prayer as A pa G'ui. sha " Father G'ui. sha ", and at other times as a category of supernatural being which embraces a number of named divinities like, for example, Ai ma, a goddess and creator of the earth (cf. Walker 1981b: 669 and n. 9). The crucial ideological distinction which Lahu Nyi make between G'ui sha and the ne- is reflected in the ritual organization of many villages, where the offices of priest and spirit specialist are quite distinct. Priests, of whom there are several grades (cf. Walker 1982b), mediate between the people and G'ui sha. The most important of these priests is called the to bo pa (probably, to from aw_ to " body" and bo from aw_ bon "meritorious," hence "meritorious body"; pa is the male suffix). His principal concern is to lead the villagers in worshiping G'ui sha in the village temple (cf. Walker 1981b: 671-79). The office of priest, of whatever grade, is always held in higher esteem than that of spirit specialist or ne' te sheh hpa~ (ne' " spirits," te "to do, to be concerned with," sheh hpa- "master, expert"). More often than not, in my experience, these spirit specialists are addicted to opium; Lahu say none but an opium addict would be so foolhardy as to make a regular practice of dealing with the ne'. Nonetheless, Lahu tradi- tionalists cannot conceive of life without the assistance of their spirit specialists. GREAT MERIT DAYS Each of the three shi- nyi lon- not only marks a phase of the moon, as do all other shi- nyi, but also is associated with a particular event in the annual agricultural cycle: the completion of the burning of the new swiddens, the harvesting of the first crops of the year and the be- ginning of the rice harvest, the major domestic crop of these people.7 The three "great" shi- nyi, each of which is a two-day affair, encompass all the ritual activities of an ordinary, single, merit day, as well as others specific to themselves. Because, as mentioned above, I have already published a detailed description of the rites of an ordinary shi- nyi, I will do no more than adumbrate them in this paper. The rites associated with a merit day begin on the eve of that day with three events: a ceremonial mixing of water and handwashing by women and girls, the presentation of uncooked rice grains to the wife of the village's senior priest or to bo pa, and ritual dancing in the haw- yeh, or village temple. The elaborate and important water-mixing and handwashing rite (cf. Walker 1981b: 681-683 for details) is in the charge of a female ritual official called the la shaw ma (etymology obscure). From every house- 278</page><page sequence="5">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI hold a female representative brings her own vessel of water and pours some into the common vessel held by the la shaw ma. This mixing of water symbolizes the unity of the village community. The la shaw ma now pours the " mixed" water onto ritual paraphernalia both in the headman's house and in the temple, thus purifying these ritual objects and so making them acceptable to the supernatural world. Finally, the la shaw ma with the " mixed " water, and each woman or girl in turn with her own water, wash each other's hands. This reciprocal handwashing symbolizes the cleansing of the community's sins. Sometime during the eve of shi- nyi, each household presents a little uncooked rice to the to bo pa's wife, who later cooks this, to- gether with her own household rice. On the next day the to bo pa will offer this " mixed " rice-again symbolizing the unity of the village community-to G'ui. fu_, the guardian spirit of the village. After darkness falls on shi- nyi eve, the village temple becomes the center of dancing in honor of G'uit sha. On shi- nyi itself, food offerings are presented to G'ui_ fu_ in the temple, as well as to the protective spirit of every household, its yeh_ ne- (yeh " house "). Some of the villagers make special ritual objects to be offered to G'ui sha in the temple, and there is more water-mixing, handwashing and dancing. Before the to bo pa eats his morning meal, he takes cooked rice (the " mixed " rice from all the households), water and beeswax candles8 to the temple. Here he places a little rice and water in the small porce- lain cups which sit on G'uit fu 's altar at the right-hand corner of the temple, lights beeswax candles and beats the temple gong, as he formally offers these gifts to the spirit (cf. Walker 1981b: 684-691, Texts 1-A, 1-B, 1-C). About the same time as the priest is praying to G'ui fu, each household head makes offerings to his own house spirit. Those who know the ritual words-usually the older men-will also recite a prayer while making the offering (cf. Walker 1981b: 692-695, Texts 2-A, 2-B). After the morning meal, the womenfolk repeat the water-mixing and handwashing rite, while some other villagers occupy themselves in making special offerings for G'ui sha. These include replica flowers and offering-baskets made of split bamboo, cones of sun-baked mud, and ordinary stones (cf. Walker 1981b: figs. 3, 5). The flowers and baskets are, Lahu say, just like those real flowers and silver bowls which lowlanders offer in their Buddha temples. The stone and mud offer- ings, on the other hand, symbolize the donor's desire that his life, or the lives of his family members, will be as strong and enduring as rock 279</page><page sequence="6">ANTHONY R. WALKER and soil. Apart from ritual activity, a merit day is mostly passed in rest or pleasant talk with friends and neighbors. Sometimes people will take the opportunity to visit their relatives in other villages. Some people may occupy themselves with odd jobs around the house, but work in the fields and hunting are positively forbidden (cf. Walker 1981b: 679-681, esp. n. 17). In the early evening, the womenfolk perform the water rite for the third and final time and the to bo pa_ and household heads, respec- tively, again honor the village and house guardian spirits. Later in the evening the to bo pa goes to the temple and formally offers all the special ritual gifts from the boon-seekers to G'ui sha, using a special offertory prayer as he does so (cf. Walker 1981b: 696-703, Texts 3-A, 3-B). The rites of the ordinary shi- nyi end, sometimes late in the night, with more dancing in the village temple. With these rites of an ordinary shi- nyi in mind, we may now turn to the detailed report of the special rites associated with each of the three " great shi- nyi." 1. Sheh' Kaw- Shi- Nyi The first of the annual great shi- nyi festivals falls on the full moon of the seventh month of the Northern Thai (Tai Yuan) calendar (March- April), after the Lahu Nyi villagers have fired their new swiddens (cf. Walker 1976h: 160-161). This is the last full moon before the Northern Thai celebrate their New Year (songkran), and the Lahu festival takes its name from one of the rituals which Tai perform during songkran. Sheh' means "sand" and kaw " to make into a heap," the whole referring to the Tai New Year custom of carrying sand from a river- or stream-bed to a temple courtyard and there modelling it into miniature temples (cf. Tambiah 1970: 154 for a description of the practice in northeastern Thailand). The Lahu Nyi also use sand for their festival, but for them a totally different idea is represented. Sheh' kaw shi- nyi is the time of the year when they pray to G'ui. sha, the highest of all the supernatural powers in which they believe, to cleanse them of the sins or demerit which they have amassed by being the agents of death for so many small animals and insects trapped in their burning swiddens. The idea that the taking of life is demeritorious is clearly derived from Buddhist neighbors rather than from among the Lahu themselves, for the Lahu accept proudly the name " Mussur," " the hunters," which the Tai people give them and they honor most highly 280</page><page sequence="7">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI their baw^ sheh hpa~ or " expert gunmen " (baw^ ve "to shoot," sheh_ hpa " master, expert "). The ritual activities associated with sheh~ kaw shi- nyi begin on the eve of the day before the new moon day (those of an ordinary shi- nyi begin on the eve of the new moon day itself). At this time the to bo pa, or senior village priest, supervises the preparation and erection of new kaw mo' taweh_ in the temple courtyard. These kaw mo' taweh (etymology obscure) are wooden posts, roughly carved and incised at their tops, which the Lahu interpret in several different ways (cf. Walker 1981a: 673-674), but which may well be derived from the Tai lak muang, or city posts, which symbolize high political authority (cf. Terwiel 1978). In the Lahu context the posts may symbolize the supreme authority of G'ui sha. (The temple itself, it should be remembered, is called haw- yeh_; haw-, " a Shan prince's palace," signifies the spiritual "royalty" of G'ui_ sha.) Each kaw mo~ taweh is fashioned from a single tree trunk (Fig. 1), Fig. 1. Preparing a new kaw mo" taweh_ or temple post. 281</page><page sequence="8">ANTHONY R. WALKER Fig. 2. Decorating the newly-erected kaw moY taweh_. from which the bark must be stripped. In this way, Lahu say, the earthly kaw mo' taweh symbolizes G'ui_ sha's white (or golden) stone kaw moo taweh_ in the heavens (cf. Walker 1981b: 637; also text 1-A, verse 3 and 1-C, verse 5 below). Once the posts have been erected in the temple courtyard, a bamboo stake is set up beside each one and to this bamboo the villagers attach foliage and paper streamers (Fig. 2). Beyond their decorative function, I could discover no explanation for the foliage and paper streamers. While a number of the menfolk are thus engaged in preparing the kaw mo~ taweh_, women representatives of each household perform a ritual exchange of water and handwashing as on the eve of an ordinary shi- nyi. Once the kaw moo taweh_ are in place, a representative from every household in the village brings offerings on a woven mat tray or enamel basin (Fig. 3). These comprise beeswax candles, a few husked but uncooked grains of rice and a plate of puffed rice mixed with grains 282</page><page sequence="9">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI Fig. 3. Bringing offerings of rice grains and puffed rice to the temple courtyard. of sand. A little of the sand and puffed rice is placed at the base of every kaw mo' taweh_ (Fig. 4) and every temple flagpost (cf. Walker 1981b: 671, 673 concerning the latter). The sand particles and the grains of puffed rice, my Lahu informants told me, represent all the ve' ba- or " demerit" they have incurred and which they hope will now be removed from them. At this same time, those villagers who so desire may present a new bamboo flag pole with streamer on top, either to the temple or to the house of one of the ritual specialists as- sociated with the temple: the to bo pa , sa la pa or la shaw pa (cf. Walker 1981b: 670-671). Around 7 p.m., as the light begins to fail, representatives from every household in the village gather in the temple courtyard, each with a handful of raw rice. Now the village headman and the to bo pa_, often accompanied by other village elders, collect the beeswax candles brought by the villagers and, squatting in front of the new 283</page><page sequence="10">ANTHONY R. WALKER Fig. 4. Placing mixture of rice grains and sand at the base of a kaw mo' taweh_. temple posts, each holding a bunch of lighted candles in his hand (Fig. 5), they pray for the prosperity of the whole community. As the elders begin to pray, everybody else who is present throws some of his or her rice grains into the air. This is said to be an offering to G'uiW sha, expressing the hope that the donors will receive an abundant yield from the padi seeds they will soon plant. The beating of a gong ac- companies the elders' chant. Texts 1-A, 1-B and 1-C record three versions of this prayer. TEXT 1-A9 1. Sha! O!

The prayer finished, everyone throws the remainder of his or her rice grains into the air. The crowd now disperses, but some people, especially the younger ones, return later in the evening to dance inside the temple in honor of G'ui sha, as on ordinary shi- nyi days. On the following day, the first of the " great" shi- nyi days, the ritual activities follow the same pattern as for an ordinary shi- nyi. Before eating his morning meal the to bo pa makes offerings in the temple to G'ui fu, the village protector, while household heads make similar offerings at their house spirit altars. After their morning meal female representatives from every household again perform the water exchange rite, and most households prepare and take ritual offerings to the temple. In the evening the to bo pa again prays to G'ui, fu and the household heads propitiate their house spirit, while the women repeat the handwashing rite. Later in the evening, the to bo pa_ ritually presents the villagers' offerings to G'ui. sha and there is likely to be more dancing in the temple. The second day is the main day of the sheh/ kaw, festival, but 289</page><page sequence="16">ANTHONY R. WALKER Fig. 6. To bo pa_ praying in front of vegetarian foodstuffs inside the temple. the rites are almost identical to those of the previous day. There is, however, one important addition. Each household prepares a noon meal of rice and vegetarian relishes, which it sends to the temple. The to bo pa_ and headman light beeswax candles and pray to G'ui_ sha for the prosperity of the village community, using the same prayer recited previously in front of the kaw mov taweh_ in the temple court- yard (Fig. 6). Then anyone who wishes may eat the vegetarian meal inside the temple. Afterwards, young people request their elders to bind their wrists with cotton string (a- mo hkeh). This rite (Fig. 7) symbolizes the passing of the elders' blessings to the youngsters.31 2. Hkao% Shi- Nyi The second great lunar festival falls on the full moon of the tenth month of the Northern Thai calendar (June-July) and is associated with the first harvesting of certain side crops. Like sheh' kaw_ shi- nyi, hkao, shi- nyi derives its name from a Buddhist festival celebrated by the Tai lowlanders at about the same time. This is khrao phansa, the beginning of what is popularly known as the Buddhist " Lent" (Thai, phansa), when the monks " enter " (Thai, khrao) the temples to remain there for the duration of the rainy season (cf. Kingshill 1960: 111; Tambiah 1970: 154-155). But, once again, the Lahu attach an en- 290</page><page sequence="17">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI Fig. 7.

This is the occasion on which they celebrate the first harvest of subsidiary crops, parti- cularly maize but also chillies, sweet potatoes and several others. The festival is organized in much the same manner as sheh' kaww shi- nyi. On the eve of the first of the two festival days there is no renewal of the temple posts, but a representative from each household brings beeswax candles, new maize cobs, a few chillies and some sweet potatoes to the temple (Fig. 8). Later in the evening the to bopa comes to the temple and offers these gifts to G'ui- sha, praying for the villagers' health and prosperity. An example of his prayer is recorded as Text 2 below. 291</page><page sequence="18">ANTHONY R. WALKER Fig. 8.

May the big and the small, each one to the same degree, enjoy nothing but untroubled thoughts. 3. Aw^ Shi- Nyi The last of the shi- nyi lon- festivals falls on the full moon of the first month of the Northern Thai calendar (September-October). It takes its name from the lowland festival of awk phansa, marking the end of the Buddhist " Lent," when the monks are permitted to come out of (Thai, awk) their temples (cf. Tambiah 1970: 157). For the Lahu Nyi villagers, the festival signifies the maturation of the main rice crop. The rites associated with this festival are identical to those of hkao shi- nyi, except that the offerings taken to the temple include newly- harvested rice (Fig. 9) in place of the maize, etc., of hkaov shi- nyi. Text 3 below records the prayer when the priest ritually presents the offerings 293</page><page sequence="20">ANTHONY R. WALKER Fig. 9.

This particular example, apart from a passing reference to aw" shi- nyi, does not differ in content from the to bo pa_'s offertory prayer on an ordinary shi- nyi (cf. Walker 1981b: 700-703 for an example). Possibly another ritual specialist's prayer would be more topical. TEXT 3 1.

CONCLUDING NOTE The preceding account of the three annual " great merit days " among the Lahu Nyi I studied in north Thailand is important, I suggest, not only as an addition to the ethnographic record of these people, but also because it suggests the extent to which non-Buddhist, non-Tai, hillmen in this part of northern Southeast Asia have adopted and adapted lowland ideology and custom. So great an impact has Tai culture made upon these Lahu that even if they did not at present enjoy any contact with Tai (in fact, of course, they do), one could not really begin to understand Lahu social and cultural norms without reference to the Tai background. The texts which I have presented here provide, I hope, some insight into the rich oral literature of these mountain folk. As usual, I have given the original texts to ensure their preservation as well as to allow retranslation and reinterpretation in the future. NOTES 1. My fieldwork among the Lahu Nyi in the districts of Phrao (Chiang Mai province) and Wiang Pa Pao (Chiang Rai province) was from 1966 to 1970. My thanks are due especially to Khun Wanat Bhruksasri and his staff at the Tribal Re- search Centre in Chiang Mai. I thank my wife, Pauline Hetland Walker, for her help in preparing this manuscript. 2. This paper is best studied in conjunction with my other publications on Lahu Nyi ritual life, which are listed in the bibliography at the end of this article. Walker (1969, 1970b, 1974d, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c, 1983a) contain introductory ethno- graphic data on the Lahu people. 3. Lahu words in this paper are transcribed according to a romanization devel- oped by American Baptist missionaries in Burma and China. (The ethnonym itself is an exception; "Lahu" rather than La' hu_ is common usage in the ethnological literature.) This orthography, still the most widely used among Lahu outside China, has supra- and sub-script marks after each syllable to indicate six of the seven tones of Lahu. There are five open tones (long vowel) and two checked (short vowel ending in a glottal stop), indicated as follows: 296</page><page sequence="23">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI suprascript straight line (ca-): high-rising open tone subscript straight line (ca_): very low open tone suprascript wedge (ca)): high-falling open tone subscript wedge (ca_): low-falling open tone unmarked (ca): mid-level open tone suprascript circumflex (ca^): high tone, checked subscript circumflex (ca^): low tone, checked 4. " Tai" is used here to refer to any group speaking a Tai (or Daic) language; "Thai" is reserved for citizens of the modern nation state of Thailand. The Tai people with whom the Lahu Nyi are associated are mostly Shan (in Burma and Thai- land's Mae Hong Son province) and Yuan, or Khon Muang (in the rest of northern Thailand). 5. Some 300,000 Lahu live in China's far southwestern province of Yunnan (BR 1980; CP 1981). 6. Reliable demographic data on the Lahu in Burma and Laos are impossible to find. Recent figures are 106,000 for Burma and 6,500 for Laos (Lewis and Lewis 1983: 4); I have no means of determining their accuracy. 7. A detailed discussion of the agricultural technology of my principal study community is to be found in Walker (1970b: 348-445). A summary is in Walker (1976h: 155-174). 8. Beeswax candles are of major importance in Lahu Nyi ritual. Indeed, these people frequently label themselves peh~ tu- pa or "beeswax burners" (peh- from peh- haw. " beeswax", tu- from tu- ve " to light," pa, the male suffix). For further comments on Lahu Nyi use of such candles, see Walker (1981b: 679 n. 16). 9. The Lahu texts, as in all my previous publications, have been broken into verses. This facilitates cross-reference between the Lahu original and my English translation. No such divisions are recognized by the Lahu themselves. 10. These Lahu Nyi conceive every important office (and thing) on earth to have its divine prototype in heaven (Walker 1981b: 671, 673, n. 13). It is appropriate on this occasion for the village headman to seek the aid of his heavenly prototype, G'uiv ma a dawv, the Divine Headman. 11. Words appearing in brackets in the English translation are those which are understood but not given in the original Lahu text. 12. " Nine lives, nine lenten seasons (k'awv co leh k'aw va_ sha-) " is a poetic couplet suggesting " a great length of time." The Lahu va sha- is from the Pali, vassa, the rainy season. For three months, from the end of July to the end of October, Buddhist monks must " cease their wanderings and take up residence in their monastery, going out only under unusual circumstances (e.g., serious illness of a relative) from which they must return within seven days" (Lester 1973: 52-53). This period of retreat, known as phansa in Thai, is frequently termed the " Buddhist Lent " in English. 13. "Merit," Lahu aw_ bon, could also be translated here as "blessings." 14. Hkaw- lu- hkaw- tan- is a couplet indicating all the ritual offerings together. 15. " Father, Creator of the Heavens (A pa mvuhv hpa sheh_ hpav) " is a re- ference to G'ui. sha as personified deity. "Ai ma, Creator of the Earth (Ai ma mi_ hpa sheh ma)" is his female counterpart. For the myth of creation see Walker (1981b: 669). The term G'ui_ sha is also used to refer collectively to several named deities. 16. As creator of our earth, and as female, Ai ma is particularly associated with fertility. Here, "the nine baskets of fertility (hkui- yawv nu_ yawv k'awv hk'a_ jaw) ' is simply poetic usage to indicate " all fertility." 297</page><page sequence="24">ANTHONY R. WALKER 17. " Carefully once again follow our footprints and our handprints (hkui taw_ la^ taw hk'av suh hk'a deh_ k'aw^ je) " is a poetic way of saying " wherever we go, whatever we do, please look after us." 18. " Seventy-seven kinds of sickness (na_ beu_ suh_ chi suh_ ceu,)" means simply " all sickness." See also verse 4. 19. Here I have chosen to translate hpu as " pure." Its first meaning is " white "; and it also means "silver." 20. According to the man who recited this prayer, Sha- ca^ here refers to G'ui_ sha, the personified, male, creating " Father God." But Sha- ca^ also is the name of a culture hero who entered G'ui, sha's heaven (and so partakes in G'ui, sha as the diffused divinity) without first having to die (cf. Walker 1981b: 679-681, n. 17 for the Sha- ca^ legend). 21. " Shielding and precious " is how I translate the couplet taw_ ti_ taw_ shehn-. Taw_ ve means " to impede," in this case " impede misfortune "; shehn means " jewel." 22. Here I have translated hpu as "white," but "pure" or "silver" would be equally appropriate. 23. See note 20. 24. " Silver and golden haw- yeh, (haw- hpu haw- shi-) "is a couplet suggesting "precious, valuable, rich, beautiful." 25. I do not understand the meaning of Pa_ la_ here. According to the context, it should refer to the personified Father G'ui_ sha, Lord of the Heavens. But the man who recited this prayer said he was referring to " the Great Paw hku-'s temple." This " Great Paw hku' " (in Lahu, Paw hku- lon-: paw hkuv from Shan, paw " father" and hkuv [khun], a title of respect; lon- " great ") is a particular Lahu religious leader who had messianic pretensions (cf. Walker 1974e: 703-705). He died in 1980. 26. To " cry out for nine lifespans (k'awv co bvuh_ ve)" means to " pray that all the villagers live for the number of years equivalent to nine lifetimes." 27. The "right-hand group (la^ sha mo_ la) " comprises the menfolk, the "left-hand group (la, meh_ mo_ hi-) "the womenfolk; mo_ la . . mo_ hi- is a couplet. 28. " To plant the kaw mo- taweh (kaw mo' ti g'a ve)" means to set up the new posts in the temple courtyard. 29. " The ten kinds, the nine kinds (chi ceu_ k'aw' ceu_)" means " all kinds (of misfortune)." 30. A meh. taw_ le^ is a two-pronged metal fork mounted on a roughly-carved wooden shaft (see P1. lh in Walker 1976a and Fig. 1 in Walker 1981b). It is used by spirit specialists to expel malicious spirits (cf. Walker 1976a: 416-417; 1981a: 144- 146; 1981b: 699 n. 60). 31. For a description of this ritual wrist-binding in connection with a " Merit Feast " (aw_ bon te ve), see Walker (1972b: 359-360). There, the object was for guests to pass "blessings" or "merit" (aw, bon) to the household which had sponsored the feast. On shi- nyi lon- the object is for elders to pass aw_ bon to younger people; the rite is otherwise identical. 32. Hkao. is the Lahu form of Thai khrao " to enter ". Hpa, sha. is the Lahu form of Thai phansa " the lenten season" (See n. 12 above). 33. In fact, the offerings are placed in the temple on both sides of the G'ui_ sha throne. 34. See above, n. 25. 35. See above, n. 16. 36. That is, "all things." 37. "All ways (hk'a hk'a' chi hk'a) " means " all modes (ways) of livelihood," 298</page><page sequence="25">GREAT MERIT DAYS AMONG THE LAHU NYI viz., the way of farming, the way of animal husbanrdy, the way of hunting, etc. 38. That is, "all the menfolk." See verse 3 for " the whole group on the left- hand side ", meaning "all the womenfolk." 39. Li- tsuh, (from aw_ li- " custom" and tsuh, ve "to bind together ") are bundles of bamboo sticks with cotton wool on top (cf. Walker 1981b: 677-678; 1982b: 109). They are offerings given with the hope that sins (ve" ba-) will be cleansed (keh_ ve); but beyond this statement of their purpose, I could not discover the sym- bolism of these li- tsuh,. 40. The hpeu_ k'o_ is another kind of offering (cf. Walker 1981b: 677), com- prising a loosely-woven bamboo basket with slender sticks of bamboo topped by cotton wool fixed to it. The hpeu, k'o_, Lahu Nyi sometimes say, represents a bowl of flowers such as Buddhists offer at their temples. 41. "Ai ma's li- tsuh." are those li- tsuh_ especially offered to Ai ma. 42. That is, " all the offerings." 43. See n. 25. Once again, the context clearly suggests that Pa_ la_ is synonymous with G'ui- sha. But again, this was not the interpretation of the one who recited the text. 44. Keh_ teh, literally "purification bench" (keh_ ve "to purify, cleanse," teh " bench"), is a small wooden bench on which is placed a bamboo cup called li- kaw" or " custom cup." This cup is filled with water as part of the shi- nyi offerings. 45. Since Pa_ la_ here appears in conjunction with Ai ma, once again the name seems to refer to G'ui_ sha, despite the reciter's view that it refers properly to the "Great Paw hku-"; see above n. 25. 46. That is, the divine prototype li- tsuh^, see n. 10 above. REFERENCES CITED BR (Beijing Review) 1980 Population and major areas of distribution of Chinese national minorities. Beijing review 9, p. 17.
