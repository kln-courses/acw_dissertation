<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS confidently. To Hoist, his friend and contemporary, he returns several times. He admires him for his zest, his courage and his integrity. " Holst does nothing by halves," he writes in an essay of 1920; " he never falters or gropes," he adds in 1934, the year of Hoist's death. Finally, in 1950, comes this interesting tribute at the end of' A Musical Autobiography' (an account of V. W.'s student days): " Overscoring has always been one of my vices ... I must hide my nakedness with an apron of orchestration. Hoist's orchestra could be naked and unashamed." Then there is ' Shrubsole '. To discuss this paper would spoil the reader's fun, but I should like V. W. to know that ' Shrubsole' has appreciably lightened the winter skies for at least one reviewer. Experience, wisdom, independence, forthrightness, vision-the whole seasoned with a wit that manages to be teasing without being unkind-these are the ingredients of this valuable and most interesting book. I find it difficult to write a review. How can one take a detached view of a favourite uncle ? And V. W. is the uncle of us all. P. L. Concerning Music. By Wilhelm Furtwangler. Translated by L. J. Lawrence. pp. 96. (London: Boosey and Hawkes. 8s. 6d.) This book is dominated by an intense belief in music as a moral and ethical power. Twenty years ago or less it would have been dismissed in the most cultivated circles as " ponderous " and " German ". Nowa- days, I think, few readers will feel repelled because Furtwangler is in- terested not merely in how things happen in music but also in why they happen; because he has no truck with the puerile notion that music is an end in itself; because he unambiguously condemns the fear of senti- mentality, the fear of oneself, as the motto of a whole generation, and states that " music should be a glorious affirmation of self, if it is to have any sense at all ". Since the book is in the form of recorded conversations, taken down by Freda von Rechenberg, it cannot lay claim to the com- prehensiveness of Hindemith's ' The Composer's World '; but it is worthy to stand beside that great book as an expression of fundamental truths about music's nature. Furtwangler bases his musical values on the classics, and in particular on Beethoven. He does so not through spiritual timidity, but for cogently argued reasons. Music is nothing if it is not human experience; and human experience is insignificant unless it is apprehensible by other human beings. The music of the classics expresses a totality of experi- ence which can be communicated to listeners because it is expressed with the utmost clarity. The experience may be complex; its effect appears to be simple because the parts cohere, even when, as is the case with Beethoven, they embrace the maximum variety, even contradictoriness, of mood. Since Beethoven there have been other composers and other works which have achieved such a totality of experience; but they have undoubtedly become rarer. It may be extravagant to say that in Liszt and Strauss there are isolated moments of sensation and merely the literary programme to provide continuity; yet one sees what Furtwangler has in mind. " Composing from bar to bar " has aptitude as a description of the compositional processes of a man such as Reger, however large-scale his designs. The change is not, of course, to be explained in terms of the 149</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC AND LETTERS wilfulness of particular composers; it is an historical and, indeed, a philosophical process which is reflected in every aspect of music-making. Works composed during the last hundred years or so may contain bits which are technically more difficult than a Haydn or Beethoven sym- phony; but they are much easier to play because the relationship of one bit to another is comparatively unimportant. Modern performers enjoy making an effect with such music; the effect, however, is momentary, like the experience. Which is why so much recent music is fundamentally unsatisfying. The most profound and rewarding sections of this book deal with Beethoven. Furtwangler starts with a distinction between Bach's state of Being, as contrasted with Beethoven's Becoming; and he makes the point that to play off the greatness of one composer against the other is nonsensical, since they express radically different philosophies. One may find Bach's mind and world more congenial than Beethoven's; but to deplore Beethoven's "rugged individualism ", as opposed to Bach's "objectivity ", is to lose our grasp on reality. Maybe we should like to share Bach's mind and world if we could. We cannot, however- unless we ignore all that has happened between Bach and us. Whether we like Bach or Beethoven better is irrelevant to the fact that Beethoven is inevitably closer to the conflicts and perplexities in the wake of which we still live. An appreciation of Bach which is based on a wilful rejection of what has happened subsequently is in any case unlikely to do Bach justice; and in this respect Furtwangler is severe on the exponents of historical authenticity in performances of Bach, in so far as authenticity may become a substitute for creative understanding. He does not say that the historical approach is undesirable, only that it is not an end in itself. This is true in general of a " scientific " age which has given such importance to the writing of art-history. It may be important, if it is an aid to understanding. But there is a danger that it may usurp the function of the artist. In " bygone productive ages " the artist told us " who we are and we could find ourselves reflected in him. Today the expert historian tells the artist what manner of man he should be, and dictates to him on the strength of his knowledge how he should feel, think, and create ". When one has a creative culture one does not talk about it; still less about the culture of those long dead. Since most of this book is written in a pseudo-philosophical language liable to arouse mistrust on a superficial acquaintance, it is important to state that almost every judgment of Furtwangler's is strictly referable to the technique of music. The most remarkable examples are perhaps the discussion of Beethoven's use of apparently irreconcilable antitheses, and the stimulating suggestion that the introduction of human voices into the last movement of the Ninth Symphony is necessitated by purely musical, not literary, considerations-by the nature of the theme itself, which is the goal towards which the whole work had been aspiring. That this is strictly so is confirmed by the masterly analysis by Rudolf Reti in his book ' The Thematic Process in Music '. Furtwangler gives the " philo- sophical " justification of Reti's analysis; Reti gives the technical con- firmation of Furtwangler's philosophy; and the two accounts are com- plementary and indivisible. To these recorded conversations Furtwangler has appended a final 150</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS chapter in which he states his own view of the most fundamental problem of modern music-that of tonality. After reading this no one could maintain that Furtwangler's adherence to the classics was the product of unimaginative conservatism. He rejects atonality for much the same technical reasons as does Hindemith; because music is an art which depends on tension and relaxation in time, and without tonality tension and relaxation are not apprehensible. (" We cannot escape from the conclusion that a type of music which dispenses with a device to regulate tension and relaxation . . . must be considered as biologically inferior ".) At the same time, when Furtwangler goes on to give his philosophical account of the reasons for the growth of atonality he gives credit to its integrity and creative force. Tonality, for him, corresponds to the anthropomorphic, Ptolemaic-Christian view of the world; and the laws of tonality are biological, not physical facts, whereby each note " is referred to the whole range of human emotion, and man as listener is unreservedly made the centre of the whole ". Atonality, for him, represents the ultimate triumph of the Copernican view " which con- siders man as nothing more than a speck of dust within a huge universe which is beyond the scope of human measurements and concepts ". For Furtwangler the masterpieces of tonal music are the " last and sweet- est flower of the creative cultural genius of Europe ". Nonetheless he can understand how the two tendencies can co-exist in the world today; for the human spirit " would fain exchange the narrow garden of what is merely human (tonality) for the dread liberty of cosmic space, although it feels that it is thus endangering its biological organic nature ". This attitude to atonality may of course be questioned; but it is a serious approach. At least it is encouraging to find a musician who hopes for the survival of humanity, while not being scared of atomization. W. M. Mendelssohn. By Philip Radcliffe. pp. 208. (London: Dent. 'The Master Musicians ' Series. I954. 8s. 6d.) Mendelssohn was of all the composers of his generation the most prominent public figure. His life was packed with musical and social incident in several countries, and more than a few of his many friends were moved to record their impressions of him. Moreover he was an indefatigable letter-writer himself; a large number of the letters have been preserved, and rank amongst the most vivid ever to have come from a musician's pen. His biographers, therefore, are uncommonly fortunate in the amount of material available to them, though the task of com- pressing it all into a volume of the modest size of the ' Master Musicians ' series is no enviable one. By rigidly keeping his eyes front, and by means of admirably clear, succinct prose, Philip Radcliffe (in his replacement of an earlier volume by S. Stephen Stratton) has succeeded in presenting all the salient, out- ward features of the life in sixty pages, which is even less than is customary in this series. His information is trustworthy, save for a few trivial errors such as 1839 instead of 1838 for the birth of Mendelssohn's first child and the attribution of an Oxford professorship to Mendelssohn's grandson. Moreover he deserves gratitude for making it very clear that besides Vol. XXXV S I5I</page></plain_text>
