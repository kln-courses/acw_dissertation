<plain_text><page sequence="1">688 A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture. By Marguerite Feitlowitz. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Pp. 302. Illustra- tions. Notes. Index. $30.00.) December 10, 1983 saw the end of an eight year military dictatorship in Argentina that left some 20,000-30,000 dead, and many more the victims of torture and terror. The integrity of social and political institutions, individual psyches, and Argentine culture itself still bear scars from the Dirty War. The depth of these scars and how Argentine society is coping with them is the subject of A Lexicon of Terror. Of these legacies, Feitlowitz has a special interest in language. Words such as desaparecido (one who has disappeared), chupar (to suck up-a reference to kidnapping), comida de pesca (fish food-a reference to prisoners thrown in the ocean from helicopters), and parrilla (grill-a reference to the table on which prisoners were tortured) have been tainted with new meanings by the Dirty War, and cannot be used without conjuring up disturbing memories. According to Feitlowitz, in so far as torture has affected language, it has scarred all society. ("When a people's very words have been wounded, the society cannot fully recover until the language has been healed." (p. 62)) Feitlowltz not only wants to document the linguistic impact of torture, but also wants to help heal its wounded language. ("We must pay attention to this disease, we must document its signs. We must make an artifact of this Lexicon of Terror, so that it will no longer be a living language.") The latter goal is left unexplained (and, one might surmise, unpursued), but the former, that of documentation, is accomplished in an original and penetrating analysis found mainly in Chapter 2, which follows a concise introductory chapter on the 1976-83 regime. Feitlowitz even includes a ten page "dictionary" of tainted words (pp. 51-60). The idea of a lexicon of terror is ingenious, and is certain to captivate readers regardless of their background on the Dirty War and Argentina. But surprisingly, little is heard of this lexicon after Chapter 3. Chapter 3 discusses the torture system and the totalizing impact it had on those tortured. Subse- quent chapters enlarge the focus and examine the impact of terror in the Jewish community (Chapter 4) and in the countryside (Chapter 5), and ex- plore how Argentine society today is coping with the physical artifacts (e.g., detention centers, places of torture, and confiscated property) of the Dirty War by creating memorials and reclaiming public spaces (Chapter 5). Work- ing from an impressive assortment of interviews that range from the tortured and the torturers, campesinos and urbanites, social movement leaders and government officials as well as military officers, Feitlowitz was perhaps over- whelmed with the consequences of the Dirty War beyond language. Despite the unexpected thematic movement, Feltlowitz's analysis of other effects of the Dirty War is done with such a thoughtful narrative that the reader remains</page><page sequence="2">689 engaged. After the concluding chapter, which both updates and continues discussion of Dirty War ramifications, the reader is left with a penetrating portrait of a society struggling to cope with its own past. A Lexicon of Terror succeeds in its attempt to capture the sociological and cultural impact the Dirty War. It is less successful when it moves from the societal level to that of the state. Too often, the state is portrayed as some anthropomorphic entity. In emphasizing that "the regime" used language (e.g., "Words were still a precious weapon in the arsenal of the regime" (p. 32)), Feltlowitz overlooks the bitter rivalries among regime leaders. It was this rivalry, rather than some carefully conceived plan, that was the real impetus behind the repression, and the lexicon associated with it. Terror, in so far as it was viewed as a means toward order, was all that regime rivals could agree upon in the face of opposing political and economic plans. Lacking a unifying "offensive project," officers could only look to a "defensive project" of order and stability to legitimate rule. In this twisted manner, terror became part of the very raison d'etre of the regime. Unfortunately, Feitlowltz seems to have difficulty shedding this portrait of the state under democratic rule. President Menem's effort to "turn the page" on the Dirty War at the cost of impunity, continued military service by known torturers, and obstacles to information on the disappeared is due to be criticized. But these efforts stem from Men- em's political opportunism. Feitlowitz actually uses them to imply complicity. Most disturbing is the implication that Menem uses Dirty War memories to scare the population into place (e.g., pp. 171-72, 187-88, 197). The image is one of a state largely unmoved by the democratic transition. The actors have changed, and terror has declined, but the state continues to dominate society and refuses to acknowledge "its" past atrocities. The image is belled by the fact that political halls in Argentina are filled with past detainees and civilian supremacy over the armed forces is higher in Argentina than in most of Latin America. There is much to redress, as Feitlowitz documents, but this struggle will continue to take place just as much within the state as outside it, by actors with a multitude of motives.
