<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phase 10 at Shahr-i Sokhta: Excavations in Square XDV and the Late 4th Millennium B.C. Assemblage of Sistan by Pierre Amiet and Maurizio To si With an Epigraphic Note by Piero Meriggi The seventh excavation campaign at Shahr-i Sokhta, the capital city of protohistoric Sistan, was carried out by the Italian Archaeological Mission to Iran from 10th September to 1st December 1975. The present writer's task was to continue the research in the Eastern Residential Area, the northeastern portion of the site whose exploration has been conducted uninterruptedly from the very first season (1). The aim of this paper is to deal only with the operations that have been carried out in squares XDV and XDW, directly adjoining the western side of the House of Stairs (fig. 1), a residential complex first excavated in 1968 (2) and located approximately 80 m. from the steep eastern edge of the site. On the surface of these squares erosion had washed away most of the structural remains later than phase 8 (c. 2800 B.C.) and the gently lower? ing slope offered us a surface suitable for testing for a more extensive exploration of the earliest period at Shahr-i Sokhta. Pottery from Period I (phases 10-8) has been collected only on the surface and in excavations within the Eastern Residential Area (hereafter ERA), to the north of the Burnt Building (3). Test trenches excavated to the west of the ERA, both in the Central Quarters beyond the NE depression and in the presumed Craftsmen's Quarter (square EWK) on the western edge of the site, have confirmed the absence of any stratified material earlier than phase 7 (c. 2700 B.C.). The layered debris of Period I is partly responsible for the higher position of the ERA in relation to the rest of the site which was built on the tabular top of a Pliocene terrace.

The test-pits carried out in the past through rooms of later date suggested that the earliest horizon known at Shahr-i Sokhta, namely phase 10, was spread over an area between 10.5 and 15.5 ha. in extent. The trenches excavated in rooms CIV and CI of area RYL (5) and those in rooms IX, XI and LIV (6) reached phase 10 at the bottom of the cultural deposit, which was in all cases on top of the gravel sediments of the natural terrace. Until 1975 the results of these excavations were our only source of information on the earliest recorded pottery assemblage of Sist?n, with a significant collection of anthropomorphic figurines and seal-impressions. If on the one hand pottery and figurines exhibited marked connections with the southern Turkmenian assemblage in the Namazga III period, the glyptic material, then documented by a few seals and mostly by impressions on clay door-stoppers, could be related to the production at Susa in phases 16-13 at the ""Acropolis" (7). This correlation and a single C-14 determination from the Tehran University Nuclear Center (TUNC-61: 3222 + 95 calibrated 5730 hL) have sug? gested a dating of phase 10 to the last quarter of the 4th millennium B.C. Moreover, ever since 1972, as these data were more extensively considered in a joint article with C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, it has been proposed that the culture of the earliest period at Shahr-i Sokhta resulted from a synchronism of different phenomena of interference among local, Central Asian and western components. As a result we could assert that Shahr-i Sokhta was the first place where a Central Asia oriented painted pottery and figurine assemblage had been found in the same stratigraphical context of ascertained proto-Elamite materials such as the archaic sealings identified by P. Amiet (8). Among other things, the aim of the 1975 campaign was also to enlarge and detail our basic information on this early horizon, in order to test the assumption that we are facing a phenomenon of cultural interference and economic exchange which occurred between the Iranian Plateau and the Turanic depressions at the eve of their urbanization. The Stratigraphic Evidence Squares XDV and XDW are separated along their E-W axis by street 1, a 2-3 m. wide alleyway, along which runs in phases 6 and 7 the northern side of the House of Stairs with the outer door (fig. 1). This alleyway reached an empty space in XDV, meeting in a T-junction another lane, street 3, that in phase 5 was the western limit of the block, A good part of XDV was an open space filled by the microstratified deposits of daily wasters. The southern section cut this dumping ground and provided us with the best sequence of the successive cuttings for the N-S lanes from phase 9 onwards (figs. 2, 8). (4) Tosi, op. cit., 1976, fig. 4.

Street 1, as it appeared at the end of the 1972 season, was laid in phase 7, and had been cut into thinly-layered trash sediments of phase 8, following an earlier and slightly different track. Houses had an access to the street through a door opening in the court? yard wall. At extensive fire destroyed all buildings of the area, south and north of the lane, marking the end of phase 7 in our sequential scheme. Reconstructions in phase 6 were limited to the buildings at the side of the street which resulted somewhat narrowed by c. 0.50 m., leaving intact behind the new houses the earlier structures or parts of them underneath the charred debris. Such a stratigrapbical coexistence of standing buildings and semicollapsed walls has allowed the unexpected recovery ever since the first season of excavation, of the well preserved roof beams and straw mats of rooms LXV, LXIX, CCLXXXVII in the block north of street 1 (9). In 1975 we were able to establish that the western side of the House of Stairs (rooms XVII and XVIII) was built as part of the phase 6 reconstruction, against a house of phase 7 left partly standing after the collapse of the ceilings and filled with its own debris, as evidenced by the N-S section of room XCVII and the E-W section of room LXXXVIII (9) Tosi, op. cit., 1969, p. 302, fig. 18. 13</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 4 a)</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 4 b) mm yellow Fig. 4 c) Fig. 4 - Shahr-i Sokhta.

This earlier house has a rectangular plan and four rooms have been located by the excavations (XCIX, XCVIII, XCVII, LXXXVIII) plus a staircase (XCV) re-used as a foundation bench in phase 5. The fire that marked the end of phase 7 is best evidenced in room XCIX whose roof, that had neatly collapsed within the four walls, appeared in an out? standing state of preservation below an artificial fill of sherds probably packed into the room during the re-adjustments in phase 5. The arrangement recalls that found in room LXIX: the roof was flat, made of five parallel logs of poplar, set N-S at an average distance of 0.40 m. The covering was made with reed matting coated with clay on the outer side. The phase 7 house is located in the eastern half of XDV and was built on top of a thinly-layered trash deposit, sedimented in what appears to have been an open space for? merly (fig. 8). As previously stated, street 1 was here met by another lane, street 3, which, according to the southern section in XDV, cut several times through the trash deposit in slightly different positions (fig. 2). Before phase 5 no walls seem to have been erected along the western side of this lane. The fallen walls on the western side of the phase 7 house, layer ?, seem to have stood along a lane c. 3.5 m. wide whose opposite side sliced into the phase 8 trash deposit ?. The E-W southern section of square XDV was combined with those of XIB and XIG, providing a comprehensive picture over 25 m. long of the archaeological sequence in the highest part of ERA. Excavations were deepest in the western half of XDV, where the space was kept free of walls from the end of phase 10. Natural soil was reached at a depth of c. ?3.20 m. and the maximum thickness of the phase 9-8 trash deposit is c. 2.10 m. In XIB and XIG excavation was interrupted at the floors of phase 7. This eastern half of the section consisted mostly of fallen mud-bricks and artificial fills of sherds. This makes an evident difference from the trash deposits in XDV with their brown humus rich lenses of daily wasters, crammed with charcoal, ashes and layered dung. This sharp difference in the formation of the sediments requires a separate description for each com? plex. The following is a schematic list of the layers identified in the eastern portion of the section, cutting through the western wing of the House of Stairs. The E-W sections across rooms XIX and XVIII were already given in the 1968 report (10) and have been here joined to that of room LXXXVIII, probably the courtyard of the phase 7 house, with the 0.70 m. wide staircase built against its western wall: ? - ? Layers of clayey soil, rich in sherds with few interspaces marked by charcoal/ ash lenses. These are to be related with the levelling of the area carried out at the beginning of phase 5. ? Compact clay from fallen bricks on top of floor of phase 6. ? Destruction level and floors of phase 7. Sparse remains of foundation walls stratigraphically rdatable to phase 5 occur on the very top of the deposit above the House of Stairs. Erosion has left very little of what was built on top of the sherd fills and the foundations in this part of ERA. Anyway (10) Tosi, op. ciL, 1969, figs. 16-17. 18</page><page sequence="18">19 20 Fig. 7 - Shahr-i Sokhta. Seal-impressions 19 and 20 with composite animals, from XDV 14 and 15. Scale 1:1. (Drawing P. Amiet). it is ascertained that in phase 5 the Shahr-i Sokhta settlement was extended over a surface of 80 ha. (X1). The characteristic Black-on-Buff pottery of this phase has been found on the very top of square XDV as marked with layer ? on the western portion of the cross section. A few low^standing walls in XDU to the west of street 3 (rooms LXXIII, LXXVI, LXXIX in fig. 1) suggest that the former open space in XDV was filled with a block of rooms. Below the sherd-rich layer ? the southern section of XDV is composed of the above-mentioned trash deposits. The stratigraphical sequence is articulated in the follow? ing groups of sediments: ?

The excavated area at the level of phase 10, within layers ? and ?, had the shape of an irregular quadrangle of approximately 8x4 m., over a total surface of 15 sq. m. Parts of three rooms were uncovered (CCXC, CCXCI, CCXCII) as well as the open area border? ing them along the SW side. CCXCI and CCXCII were joined by very irregular brickwork probably produced by later adjustments that concerned room CCXCII. This would sug? gest the existence of two sub-phases that might also explain the interruption in the wall sticking out of the western side of the building, and joined only to the lower course of bricks of CCXCI. Brick size slightly exceeded in length the standard of phases 8-3 (12), measuring 45X20-22X10 cm., but they were identical in shape and manufacturing tech? nique. The trash layers in the open space appear laid in an uphill fashion rising from the bottom of the walls. We have here the eastern flank of a dumping mound that filled the back yard of the building. Layer ? is instead related to a later stage, when this dump was extended eastwards to cover room CCXCI; meanwhile the adjoining room CCXC remained in use. The dump was probably the rear of a building whose central rooms should be found below the insula of the House of Stairs. According to the superimposition of brick? work and the position of layer ?, we suggest that phase 10 in XDV can be divided into two distinct sequential sub-phases. Anyway there are no elements at present to go beyond the stratigraphical consideration and suggest any absolute dating. Almost certainly the proto Elamite tablet, found at the very top of layer ?, could be assigned to the later of the two. The cylinder-sealings are on the contrary found in both sub-phases, being recorded (12) Tosi, op. cit., 1969, p. 304. 20</page><page sequence="20">also in the western dump of layer ? (see Amiet's nos. 19, 20, 21) and in layer ? on top of the earliest floor of room CCXCI (see Amiet's nos. 17-18). On the basis of these stratigraphical considerations we shall regard all the remains of material culture unearthed from layers ? to ? (i.e. cuts 10-15) as relatable to a single cultural horizon, namely phase 10 Period I, and identify it as the eariiest complex so far documented at Shahr-i Sokhta as well as in the whole of Sist?n. Due to the extension of the site and even of the ERA alone, we cannot assume that the lowermost levels of XDV document the earliest settlement at Shahr-i Sokhta. The evidence from the regions sur? rounding Sist?n to the north, south and east suggests that everywhere by the end of the 4th millennium B.C. the populating of the best irrigated areas was well advanced, with nowhere less than 2000 years of intensive exploitation of the natural resources by village clusters. The lacustrine-riverine environment of Sist?n wTas too favourable for the area not to have been settled earlier than Shahr-i Sokhta I. The Pottery Assemblage A large amount of sherds has been recovered from the layers of phase 10. Buff Ware is largely predominant with a high incidence of painted surfaces in red/brown, brown and black. From the viewpoint of their cultural significance the sherds have been divided into groups of wares: I. Painted pottery decorated with the characteristic chess-board patterns and bichrome stereometric combinations of triangles and squares, all morphologically related to the sou? thern Turkmenian production of the Tedzen delta in the Namazga III period (13) (fig. 10). Three sherds are particularly interesting as they might be related also to materials from the very early Namazga III assemblage in both the Tedzen delta and the Kopet Dagh foothills strip of southern Turkmenia (fig. 11). Two of them are red-slipped and come from cuts 14-15, the other is buff-slipped and comes from CCXCI 15. Notwithstanding their very fragmentary state these bichrome sherds can be paralleled with specimens from the earliest Namazga III assemblage of the Kopet Dagh as documented from levels la-lb at Kara depe, near Artyk (14). Most significant is also the connection with the Tedzen delta that can be drawn for the sherd from CCXCI 15 whose combination of hatched bands and obliquely radiating lines on the bottom of the bowl is not only frequendy recurrent in southern Turkmenia (15), but at Geoksjur 1 was found in the furnishings of tholos A, a square plan funerary structure (16).

Painted pottery of local tradition (figs. 12-14), related to an area that includes the whole of the Hilmand basin and parts of northern Baluchistan. This is the well-known Quetta Ware, first identified by S. Piggott and described in detail by W. A. Fairservis (17), now documented with a high degree of uniformity also outside the Quetta valley and the Hilmand basin, beyond the Bolan pass, in the Kachi plain (18), as well as in Waziristan (19) and on the Indus flood-plain on the northern edge of Sind (20). The analogy between Shahr4 Sokhta and Mundigak, near Qandahar, is well established on the basis of the distri? bution of this characteristic Buff Ware, accounting for over 70% of the painted sherds from XDV ? - ?, so that we can propose the existence in c. 3000 B.C. of an interaction sphere that went well beyond southern Afghnistan and the basin of the Hilmand and included northern Baluchistan and the western bank of the Indus at least as far downstream as Multan. The other two groups are represented by a handful of sherds, but their discovery in a safe stratigraphical association with the predominant ones is instrumental in proving the cultural interference occurring in Sist?n around 3000 B.C. They represent one of the most important achievements of the excavations in XDV for the evidence of synchronism made available to our ceramic assemblage. III. It is made up of two Grey-Ware trumpet-shaped streak-burnished sherds with a black slip and a grit-tempered paste, found in CCXCII 12-13 and 15 (fig. 3). This class of ware and the peculiar shape had not been recorded at Shahr-i Sokhta before, but are recurrent at Tepe Yahya in Periods IVB and IVC, the latter being the well-known proto Elamite horizon (22). The two sherds from XDV are remarkable as being the only repre? sentative items of basic material culture that point to a western connection, apart from the adoption of the most sophisticated means of registration and control of goods of the time, represented by the tablet and the cylinder-seals. Anyhow, it is noteworthy how little can still be compared in the phase 10 assemblage of Shahr4 Sokhta with southern Iran and Khuzistan. It seems that in Sist?n the adoption of the writing system and the glyptics elaborated in the west produced no significant alterations in the basic material culture which continued in the line of the Central Asian-Turanic tradition, but remained a device for a more efficient administration. IV. Three polychrome sherds have been recovered in the XDV and XDW sectors. They have little to do with the later polychrome ware of Shahr-i Sokhta used from phase 8 (17) S. Piggott, ?

The in? terspaces between the black bands were filled with a yellow paint, probably limonite. In all features the sherd can be related to types from N?l (23), the most characteristic pottery of southern Baluchistan in the early 3rd millennium B.C. (24). Regarding its distribution in Pakistan our only reliable source of information is at present the survey of R.L. Raikes (25) who reports that this fine buff-pinkish painted ware is territorially restricted to the Jha? lawan region in Kalat (26). No traces of it are reported in the more northern region of Sarawan, where we have instead the southernmost sporadic finds of Quetta Ware. These sherds as well as the following ones were then related to an area just to the south of the Quetta Ware distribution sphere including Sist?n, Qandahar and northern Baluchistan as far as present-day Sarawan. b) y c) Two yellow painted sherds from squat biconical jars. These specimens are from phase 9 contexts: rooms LXXXIX 10 and XCIIa 8 (fig. 4b-c). These three sherds of N?l Ware at Shahr-i Sokhta are not isolated items. In fact three pots have also been found in the graveyard in G. 10 (27), G. 55 inf. and G. 62 (28). Once we consider that both the N?l Ware and its type-site in Baluchistan are very poorly dated at present owing to lack of reliable interrelations, the finds of XDV/XDW assume a significative importance. They can in fact be well bracketed in the Shahr-i Sokhta se? quence. Considering the evidence from both the settlement and the graveyard, N?l sherds in Sist?n can be located between phase 10 (XDV 11) and phase 6 (G. 10). As material from XDV 11 can safely be associated with the latest sub-phase of 10, we can propose for both the N?l Ware and the graveyard of Sohr Damb that first yielded it, a dating be? tween 3000 and 2600 B.C. The mere discovery of these four groups of pottery in direct stratigraphical association will safely imply a good degree of synchronism and will represent not only a more reliable chronology for the Indo-Iranian borderland, interfingering it with southern Iran and ulti? mately Mesopotamia, but also a confirmation of our earlier assumption that the deltaic ba? sin of Sist?n, as a protohistoric centre of demographic concentration, acted like a hub in the earliest identified system of interregional exchange involving economic and cultural relations between Mesopotamia and southern Iran on the one hand, the Turanic depressions and Baluchistan on the other (29).

This was brought about in the last two centuries of the 4th millennium B.C., when the exchange of raw materials and finished goods between Mesopotamia and the East was stabilized in some kind of permanent circuit. In a forthcoming article on the archaic glyptics of Shahr-i Sokhta I, P. Amiet (30) has already pointed out that the earliest specimens of cylinder-seals, all referable to phases 9 and 10, can be considered according to the syntax of their decorative patterns as an integral part of what he defines ? the Jemdet Nasr Irano-Mesopotamian koine ?, a cul? tural-geographical concept also advanced by others to explain convergences in different clas? ses of archaeological materials (31). Tablets and seals appeared as complementary devices for registration and control in the transactions and redistribution of goods and services at the end of the 4th millen? nium B.C. At this time they must have been regarded as a handy means for a safer admi? nistration of economical output by all the emerging state societies. By pinpointing the distri? bution of their find-spots in c. 3000 B.C., we hatch on the map an area of cultural con? vergence, extending from the Syrian Euphrates to the Hilmand, the same as we have pro? posed above as the place of a stabilized volume of interchanges, somehow moving towards a certain integration of administrative practices and various technologies among the different regional systems emerging from the segregated late-chalcolithic traditions (fig. 5). The Shahr-i Sokhta tablet is roughly rectangular, pillow-shaped, with straight sides, as is recurrent at Susa 16-13. It was made out of a lump-free clod of greenish clay (for the measurements see below, catalogue no. 22). The study of the text was entrusted to P. Meriggi who gave the following report: ? The inscription runs from left to right and is restricted to a single line, along the top edge of one face (fig. 16). The first sign recalls 322 h (32) known at Susa from three different texts, twice as an isolated item followed by the digit 1, and once grouped with sign 32 which might reproduce ideographically a tree or a branch. The second sign on the Shahr-i Sokhta tablet is still to be properly identified. It is followed by the numeral 5, written in the standard calligraphy of Susa. Anyhow we are not able to establish whe? ther the group of two signs here indicates a ware, an agency, or both (33) ?. (30) Amiet, ? The Archaic Glyptic... ?, cit. (31) C.C.

Amongst them there was only one piece of evidence, extremely coarse, which could be related more specifi? cally to Elam. The 1975 excavation yielded up all at once evidence which is much richer in its variety: a fragment of cylinder-seal with animal decoration which is specifically proto Elamite, a tablet inscribed in proto-Elamite script and a series of sealing fragments in unfired clay, each bearing a different seal-impression. These sealings are worth a prelimi? nary examination. Some of them (nos. 10, 11, 12, 13) are in coarse clay and of irregular shape, and were certainly not intended to go round an object such as the neck of a vase or a knob. They bear the impressions of cylinder-seals and of a stamp-seal (no. 12). Doubtless they must be considered as sealings made on irregular objects, diverse from those which were usually treated thus ? doors, for example. With these can be compared a large fragment of sealing (no. 18) which has the form of a convex plaque, on the back of which are preserved the fingerprints of the person who shaped it, and next to these the impression of a smooth circular moulding that could have been the rim of a vase of which our sealing would have been the lid. The face of this sealing, which is unique of its kind, has preserved the impression of the rolling of a cylinder and, beside this, of the cylinder base. This last find, like the other sealings, is in fine clay, pink or yellowish, used on ac? count of its plasticity. The sealings which are not too fragmentary seem to have been ring-shaped with the section at times in the shape of a portion of a sphere or a plump cushion and at times in the shape of a more or less truncate cone. A first series (nos. 1-7), collected in XDV 10, south, is distinguished by the fact that they were not sealed, or else the seal-impression was very faint. The largest (no. 1) is in the shape of a plump cushion whose underside preserves the impression of the smooth surface to which it was applied. On the inner, vertical face there is at the bottom a hori? zontal groove, corresponding to a raised moulding. The outer face bears as is usual the impression of a coiled string, and at the top there have been preserved traces of a brown organic matter among which can be distinguished particles of wood charcoal. This would seem to indicate that the cylindrical object enclosed by the sealing was made of wood (?). Another, very small fragment in the same series (no. 3) has mat impressions preserved on its base. Yet another (no. 5), almost shapeless, has preserved only two parallel impres? sions left by smooth cylindrical objects. It resembles a fragment of the coating applied to wickerwork or to a thatched roofing. Several sealings have on their irregularly mamillated bases the impression of a string perpendicular to the cylindrical object around which it was wound (nos. 8, 16, 21). The (34) Amiet, ?The Archaic Glyptic... ?, cit. 25</page><page sequence="35">most noteworthy (no. 15) is in the shape of a concave truncate cone, with the lower part irregular, as in the foregoing specimens. It is pierced near the base by a hole which doubt? less corresponds to the string whose end was wound around the sealed object. This object, in no. 20, was smooth, cylindrical and at the base, at a height of approx. 2 cm., a string was wound about it in 5 superimposed threads. The unevenness of its lower part probably does not correspond to the shoulder of a vase, but it seems more likely that these sealings were placed on bolts or on knobs around which was wound the string, stopping a door or some undetermined object. Another, smaller sealing (no. 17) also has an uneven base, and the sealed object must have been smooth and cylindrical. There is no string around it and it has been pierced obliquely; its function remains obscure. What is remarkable, in our opinion, is that except for the presumed lid (no. 18) none of the sealings examined seems to have fitted a vase. ?k "k "k Apparently the most archaic seal used was a flat, square stamp-seal (no. 12) with a labyrinthJike rectilinear decoration. Now there is no site of the 4th millennium, Susa in particular, which has yielded up anything quite like it, whereas in the very site of Shahr-i Sokhta, but in a later assemblage (Period II), as well as at Mundigak III and IV, plaque shaped stamp-seals in chlorite have been found with a quite similar decoration (35). In these circumstances the impression on no. 12 is certainly evidence of the survival of the stamp-seal at a time when the cylinder-seal had out-placed it, a time of Elamite influence. But at the same time this impression figures as the first specimen in a series of plaque-stamps and is without doubt the forbear of the partitioned stamp-seals which spread in the second half of the 3rd millennium. It can also be taken as a further indication that Period I lasted longer that the 4th millennium. Among the cylinder impressions we shall begin by examining the very incomplete ones belonging to the largest group, which is already known from previous finds. Thus no. 13 has a geometric pattern which is linked with that on the cylinders in glazed steatite (36). It is hard to turn to account the other, very faint impressions (nos. 10, 11, 14) which, however, refer to the same horizon. On account of its irregularity the decoration on no. 11 is perhaps related to that of the Susian impressions which are apparently later than the proto-Elamite period (37) but it is not very wise to base an assertion upon such fragmentary data. On the other hand, the bordered oval in no. 9 can easily be associated with the floral pattern of which there is a good deal of previous evidence (38). Other impressions are more original. No. 15 is more closely related than no. 12 with (35) Tosi, op. cit., 1969, p. 375, figs. 269-274; Lamberg-Karlovsky, Tosi, op. cit., p. 46, figs. 32-40; Casal, op. cit., p. 256, pi. XLV.

No. 16 has a more elaborate decoration; it associates curved lines, and even ovals which are so frequent in the Jemdet Nasr period, with four squares forming a large lozenge of which we do not know the like, although it is linked with the Jemdet Nasr tradition. The meanders in no. 17, however, pose a difficult problem, for they do not resemble anything known to this last-named period except, perhaps, for the small, flat rectangle (on the left) which may be related to figures in flat relief encountered on glazed steatite cylinders (40). These meanders, it seems, are more closely linked with geometric figures en? graved beside stylized animals, at Susa, in a manner which recalls that of Early Dynastic I or II (41). But in the absence of these animals it is difficult to be more positive. And yet animals resembling those summarily represented in Susian evidence (42) appear on the im? pression of a very small cylinder, no. 18, applied to what was presumably the lid of a vase. There are a scorpion and a bird flying with outspread wings, beside curved shapes which are impossible to identify. The bird is drawn better than the one which, in the same attitude, appears on the first impression with figured decoration found at Shahr-i Sokhta (43). All this does not constitute proof, but can be taken as presumptive evidence in favour of a spreading out over a fairly long time-span, covering the initial phase, and indeed the beginning of the second phase, of the Early Dynastic period. The most highly finished pieces of evidence can be related without difficulty to proto Elamite art. The first (no. 19) is, however, very much effaced. We can distinguish parts of a wild beast with a long, wavy beard and clawed paws held out in front of it in the exaggerated attitude often noticed at Susa (44). All the same, the heavy lines of the muscles are characteristic. The second seal (nos. 20-21) is revealed to us by a series of impressions made on two sealings. Thus two monsters facing each other can be reconstructed. They have a lion's body attached to what resembles a fish's tail, but as the creatures are winged it should most likely be taken as the ambiguous rendering of an eagle's tail. Indeed, it is clear that these monsters are related to the griffon class ? half eagle and half lion. They had made their first appearance in the contemporary Uruk IV period, essentially in Elam (45), and had assumed new aspects in proto-Elamite glyptics ? at times that of a monster with an eagle's head and a lion's body, as in the foregoing period, and at times that of a bird of prey with a lion's head, of which we know three variants, sometimes (39) Amiet, op. cit., 1972, nos. 42, 43, 46.

The best result, of which the photo is given here (fig. 33) clearly shows the stylization of the feet which are exaggeratedly thin, as they are the feet of a bird. In these circumstances we may admit that the tail is very likdy that of an eagle, with a strange sinuous attachment as well, perhaps a lion's tail superimposed? The jagged rectangular tablet (no. 22) has the characteristic moulding of the proto Elamite period and differs notably from those of the previous period (Susa 17) which have the form of a plump cushion. As is usual, it was impressed with a seal before being in? scribed, but this latter operation seems to have been preceded by handling which led to the deformation of the tablet while it was still soft and, above all, which effaced the im? pression. The horizontal direction of the inscription is in accordance with the proto-Elamite custom, with two signs placed to the right of the numeral 5 which they specify. We can distinguish a trapezoidal sign and a second, made up of two triangles, whose equiv? alent we have not been able to find in the repertoire established by Mecquenem (4?). There are hardly any impressions of the cylinder-seal left, except for some elements in flat relief, one in the form of a volute and the other an angular strip and, on the re? verse, two lozenges (?). Such badly effaced figures compel us to be extremely cautious in our judgement, but at least they appear to be quite different from those which charac? terize proto-Elamite repertoire and style (48). Great care is necessary in judging such badly effaced figures which at all events appear to be quite different from those which characterize proto-Elamite repertoire and style (48). We do know that the Susians of this period sometimes used cylinders of a different, coarse style (49), but it is exceptional on tablets. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the cylinder-seal fragment (no. 23) is pure proto-Elamite, for it has the forepart of an animal whose upright position imitates a human one; such a figure has equivalents only in the refined glyptic art met with in levels 16-14 of the "Acropolis" at Susa (50). The animal is carved in flat relief, with slender forms and short ears. As it is, it is hard to identify (a dog?), but it appears frequently on the cylinders and impressions at Susa (51). The linear elements which surround it are more unusual, but are too incomplete for us to be able to interpret them. However, the very fact that they cannot be identified by referring to Susian glyptics is significant, for it is accordance with other original details, such as the "fish tail" of the griffon (no. 20) and the unusual appearance of the lozenge decoration (no. 16). We are thus led to believe that Shahr-i Sokhta was not merely a stage on the route to the east, (46) L.

Its existence must have continued alongside the initial part of the Early Dynastic period. But the uncertainty which still prevails about the development of the Susian civilization, which is still our main point of reference, prevents us from being more precise. There are some indications that allow us to envisage the possibility of its con? tinuation right up to the beginning of Early Dynastic II. Catalogue 1.
