<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Angelology and Demonology in the Septuagint of the Book of Job* JOHN G. GAMMIE The University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma I. Methodology. Assessment of the translator's ideology/theology in this study is based only on a consideration of the unasterisked text. II. Angels. In many passages the άγγελοι of the LXX of Job perform func tions virtually identical with the מלאכים of the MT. In the LXX of Job 33:23-24, however, the angels are conceived to be "death-bearing." Further, the LXX occasionally renders άγγελοι on the basis of an MT that contains no obvious reference to angels (Job 20:15—19; 40:11) and the translator adhered to, or found himself at home in, a universe in which angels were believed to function (Job 40:19; 41:25). III. Demons. Although there is evidence that ό διάβολος is viewed by the translator as an angel (LXX Job 1:6), the latter term was probably deliber ately chosen to avoid the clearly demonic ό Σατανάς. The enigmatic 'θηρία and δράκων of the second speech of God (Job 40:19-41:26) have mythic dimensions in the LXX since both were "made to be mocked at by his (my) angels." The mythic-demonic aspect of the former, however, is not devel oped. The treatment of δράκων paradoxically shows both a de-mytholog ization and an intensification of mythologization (cf. Job 26:13). In sum, the demonology of the LXX of Job is rather bland. It is the purpose of the present essay to examine how angels and demons are portrayed in the Greek translation of the Book of Job. Part I will set forth certain methodological considerations. Part II will examine the various passages where άγγελος, άγγελοι occur, ordering the discussion on the basis of the probable Hebrew words underlying the Greek ren dering. Part III will examine the passages where διάβολος, δράκων and other such words occur which suggest the translator was thinking in terms of a power rebellious or hostile to the divine.

Nor will we seek to draw conclusions as to the ideology of the translator based on putative omissions, as Dillmann and Gard have argued. Instead, when it comes to describing the translator's attitude toward angels and demons, we will leave aside the question of the Hebrew VorlageVorlage utilized by the translator. Our conclusions as to the viewpoint of the Greek translator will thus not be based on what he has supposedly omitted but, rather, on what he has rendered in the unasterisked text and on how he read the Hebrew text that was probably before him. C. Primacy of the Greek Translation for this Study. In his studies, Harry Orlinsky has repeatedly warned against assuming that the Hebrew text before the Greek translator was the same, or nearly the same, as the Masoretic text. The warning is well taken. Accordingly, our focus will be primarily on the Greek and, insofar as we can intelligibly tell, what it says and means. Secondarily we will look at the Hebrew and consider why and how the translator probably arrived at his translation. D. Deciding What the Hebrew Text Was Before the Translator. We take it as a sound methodological principle that the student of the LXX must presume the translator had before him a text similar to, if not identical with, the Masoretic text in accordance with the following guidelines: (i) when all of the words in a Greek clause or sentence may be explained on the basis of the Masoretic text, a similar or nearly identical Hebrew text should be assumed; (ii) in instances of an unusual rendering in Greek, a metathesis of Hebrew letters may be posited provided there is some supporting evi dence elsewhere in prior Hebrew textual transmission; (iii) in instances of unusual renderings in Greek, minor emenda tions of the Masoretic text to explain the reading (or to recover the Vorlage)Vorlage) may be made on grounds of similarity in sound of letters, e.g., an 1,Aleph for an cAyin, or of similarity of shape of letters, e.g., a Kaph for a Beth, provided there is some supporting evidence elsewhere in Hebrew textual tradition.13 ( 13) Since these words were first written Emanuel Tov has published his sane and very useful The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Jerusalem Biblical Studies 3; Jerusalem: Simon, 1981). The statement above is but a crude primer in comparison to Tov's careful articulation of principles. Tov has accepted Orlinsky's insistence that method of translation must be analyzed prior to any thought of recovering the Hebrew Vorlage (pp. 50-53).50-53). James Barr takes matters even further in urging the necessity of probing the trans lators' attitudes toward their tasks (The Typology of Literalism in Ancient Biblical Translations, NAWG, I. Phil.-Hist. Kl. 1979, 11; Gôttingen, 1979) 279-325. On the difference it makes that the translators regarded the Bible as a sacred text, see Harry M. Orlinsky, "The Septu</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN G. GAMMIE [4] .E. Avoidance of Assuming in Advance a Tendenz of the Translator. A number number of general and specialized studies of the Septuagint have sought to show that the translators were advocates of one or another theological or ideological position. Some scholars have thus adduced passages to show that the Septuagint was monotheizing,'4 Platonizing,'5 and/or and anthropomorphic,16 whereas others have adduced passages — some times even from the same book or genre of books — to show the oppo site, namely, that the Septuagint was secularizing,17 anthropocentric18 and/or mythologizing.19 In the present study we have endeavored to eschew the defense of one or the other of these positions prior to an examination of the relevant passages. II.II. Angels in the Septuagint of Job A. In some passages άγγελος is used to render the Hebrew מלאך, "mes senger, angel." In Job 1:14, 16, 17 and 18 the άγγελος in question is clearly human. In Job 4:18 άγγελοι is in parallelism with παίδες and thus possibly also human messengers, but the context and especially the con trast with vs. 17 supports, rather, the contention that the translator had in mind heavenly beings. Eliphaz the Temanite is speaking: 14 A rustling and tremor encountered me; my bones shook severely. 15 and a spirit (πνεϋμα) came before my face; my hair bristled and (my) flesh (shuddered). 16 I arose and did not recognize it; I looked and there was no form before my eyes, instead I heard the air in motion and a sound. agint as Holy Writ and the Philosophy of the Translators," HUG A 46 (1975) 89-114, esp. 103-110.

A mortal cannot be pure in the Lord's presence, can he, nor can a man be blameless in his deeds? 18 For if He does not trust His servants and Finds some wrong with His angels,2" 1g Does He not also smite as a moth those who dwell in clay houses from which clay we also come? (LXX: Job 4:14-19). A final place where the LXX renders מלאך with άγγελος is Job 33:23. The being or beings are unmistakably heavenly. If there were a thousand death-bearing angels not one of them would wound him if he should take it to heart to turn to the Lord. On the contrary, He proclaims to man his fault and shows him his senselessness. He will withstand his falling into death. He will renew his body as ointment on a courtly wall. His bones He will fill with marrow (LXX: Job 33:23—24). What is especially interesting about this passage is not so much that the singular מלאך is rendered in Greek as a plural, for this can be fairly easily explained,21 but, rather, that the function of the άγγελοι appears to be death-bearing (θανατόφοροι) to man and not that of spokesmen in behalf of man's righteousness, as the Masoretic text most naturally means. It is difficult to determine, on the basis of the Masoretic text, what Hebrew the translator had before him. The phrase "but if he should take it to heart to turn to the Lord" seems to have no basis in the MT. The translator thus here seems to be paraphrastic. And if para phrastic, thus expressing something of his own interpretive views. It could be argued that the translator did not any longer conceive angels capable of being מליצים, "spokesmen" in behalf of men, as happens, for example, in the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch 15:2). Such a tack, however, would be in error, in my judgment. The translator may rather be recalling the Prologue where the Adversary, ό διάβολος, is also a death bearer in the sense that he bears intermediate responsibility for the death of Job's children. What is said in these verses thus more probably (2ο)(2ο) The second hemistich in Job 4:18 is also found in Codices Alexandrinus and Sinaiticus of Job 9:7. (21) A Mem follows מלאך in the MT which would, of course, permit reading the noun as a plural.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN G. GAMMIE [6] reveals the translator's taking into account the Book as a whole. In the term θανατόφοροι "death-bearing" he may be simply reiterating a role already assigned to one of the angels called "The Adversary" earlier in the Book. That ό διάβολος was considered to be an angel is a point to which we will turn in the next section. B. In other passages άγγελοι άγιοι (Job 5:1) or simply άγιοι (Job 15:15) is used to translate קדשים. In Job 5:1 the speech is that of Eliphaz, a few lines below the citation we previously made from Job 4:14—19. Eliphaz addresses Job: Call out [to ascertain] if anyone will obey you or if you can see any one of His holy angels. In Job 15:14—15, again in a speech of Eliphaz, language is used simi lar to that already encountered: For who being mortal will be blameless, or how can one born of woman be righteous? If He does not trust His holy ones, heaven is not pure before Him. In a third passage, Job 36:14, άγγελοι is used to translate what appears in the Masoretic text as קדשים, "snares," when a Holem was obvi ously understood rather than a Sere. Job 36:12, 14 thus reads in the Greek:*2 The impious He does not save from their not wanting to know the Lord. And for this reason they were considered disobedient. Therefore may their soul die in their youth, and their life be wounded by angels. In these passages the invisibility, relative purity and punitive func tions of the angels are underlined. The translator makes no significant advances, retrogressions or deviations from the conceptions in the Hebrew text. C. In the Prologue o'l άγγελοι τού ϋεοΰ is twice used to render בני האל'היםהאל'הים (Job 1:6 and 2:1) and in the first speech of God πάντες άγγελοι μου is used to render כל בני האלהים (Job 38:7). These renderings are not surprising. The Codex Alexandrinus of Genesis 6:1 also translates בני האל הים as οί άγγελοι τοΰ θεού. I do not see how these renderings, in (22) In the Greek these verses follow one upon the other. Vs. 13 was supplied by Origen using Theodotion's translation.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 7 and of themselves, can very convincingly be held to constitute evidence of a monotheizing tendency in the Septuagint, as C.H. Dodd has argued.23 Belief in angels, however translated, is already in a sense compromising of a strict monotheism. Accordingly, it would be a mis take, in our judgment, to place too great theological significance on the fact that the translator of Job chose "angels of God" rather than "sons of God." The Greek rendition of Job 1:6 suggests perhaps a bit more forcibly than the Hebrew that the Adversary is one of the angels, for he enters with them: ήλθεν μετ' αύτών. The Hebrew is more ambiguous. ויבוא גם השטן בתוכם may indicate that the Adversary entered with the sons of God and then came up into their midst, or it may suggest the Adversary is to be disassociated from the angels: "Satan for his part (גם) also came into their midst" (cf. the use of גם in Gen. 32:19). In any event, the translator delicately preserves the ambiguity of the Hebrew by rendering the same Hebrew phrase differently in Job 2:1 than he (or she) does in Job 1:6. Another passage where בני אל הים is rendered άγγελοι is Job 38:7-8. In the course of God's address to Job, he says: When the stars were begotten all my angels praised Me with a loud voice. I fenced the sea with pillars when it struggled upon coming forth from its mother's womb (LXX:(LXX: Job 38:7-8). There is no significant difference in this rendering from the Hebrew. It is important only to point out that, for the translator of Job, the angels here are presumed to function as agents of praise who kerygmatically announce the creative acts of God. D. Of the fifty odd times the term אל "God," occurs in the Book of Job, the Septuagintal translator renders it rarely with ό θεός (8:13 [A]; 27:2 [Β]; 27:9 [8א]) and most frequently with κύριος. In one instance alone is אל rendered as άγγελος. Extreme caution must accordingly be exercised not to squeeze too much ideological juice out of this isolated instance. Toward the end of the second cycle of dialogue, in chapter 20, where the translator already seems to be drawing the orthodox position of retribution in even starker terms than the Hebrew (cf. esp. vss. 5-7), the following lines show the same tendency: Wealth unjustly gathered will be vomited forth, an angel will drag it from his house. (23) The Bible and the Greeks, 22-23.</page><page sequence="8">JOHN G. GAMMIE [8] May he suckle on the wrath of serpents may the snake's tongue destroy him. May he not behold the milking of herders nor pastures of honey and butter (LXX: Job 20:15—17). With two exceptions, these three verses are fairly faithful renderings of the Hebrew found in the Masoretic text: (i) "unjustly gathered" in the Hebrew is rather "swallowed" (בלע) and (ii) "God" (אל) is rendered as "angel." The more significant and characteristic change of the translator is the first. The concluding two verses in the chapter bear out that the translator hardly sought to avoid attributing destruction to God, as some have averred is the case for earlier chapters in the book.24 May destruction drag his house to its end, may the day of wrath come upon him. This is the lot of the impious man with the Lord, and his ultimate possession from his Overseer (LXX: Job 20:28-29). E. The three final instances where the translator employs aYyeXot are found in the final speech of God (Job 40:6-41:26). In each instance the apparent underlying Hebrew term is not one of the usual or expected terms. In two of the clauses where the term ayyeXoi occurs the translator has created virtually identical Greek refrains based upon quite different Masoretic texts. The passages may most conveniently be considered in reverse order, starting with the most baffling.25 In the Hebrew of Job 41:25 we read: There is not his likeness (or his ruler) upon the dust, one made to be without fear. In the Greek this verse is rendered: There is no one on earth like him since he has been made to be mocked at by my angels. (24) Cf. esp. H.S. Gehman, "The Theological Approach of the Translator of Job 1—15." For a detailed critique of Gehman in other regards, see Harry Orlinsky HUCA 30 ((1959)(1959) •53-67; 32 (196• ) 239-68. (25) Ziegler lists seventeen instances in the translation of the Book of Job where the same tendency is to be found, namely, that of repeating words and expressions based upon different Hebrew words. He does not, however, make reference to the refrain in Job 40:19 and 41:25; cf. Sylloge, 18-19 {Miscellanen Biblica 2, 286-87). Ziegler's insights into the trans lator's "anaphoric" style have been carried forward by Heater. Heater does discuss the common refrain (Septuagint Translation Technique in the Book of Job, 126-28), but see my comments below in n. 27 on his treatment.</page><page sequence="9">[g] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 9 The second hemistich of this verse in Greek is: πεποιημένον έγκατα παίζεσθαι ύπό τών άγγέλων μου. The first word is a legitimate reading of the Hebrew, an archaic form of the Qal passive participle of עשה. The second word in the Hebrew is ΠΠ; it was evidently understood to be the Qal infinitive חת which means "to be filled with terror." Thus the Hebrew clause translated thus far means "made to be filled with terror." "By my angels" appears to be a reading of the Hebrew as לכלי instead of לכלי· A Kaph has been read or understood or was present instead of a Beth. Because the translator had already translated the phrase כל־בני אל הים אל הים as "all my angels" in Job 38:7, so here, it would seem, he read כלי and thus "my angels." The presence of the Yodh suffix in Hebrew and the first personal possessive pronoun in Greek lend support to our con tention that the translator read what is now in our text as לכלי, literally "for (or by) my all" as if כל were a synonym for some such word as צבא "host" and, hence, "angels."26 The next previous occurrence of άγγελοι based upon an enigmatic Hebrew is found in Job 40:19. The Hebrew may be rendered in English: He is the first fruits of the ways of God, the One who made him brings near His sword. In Greek the translator renders: He is the first principle (άρχή) of the form of the Lord, made to be mocked at by his angels (LXX: Job 40:19). The second hemistich in Greek, πεποιημένον έγκαταπαίζεσθαι ύπό τών άγγέλων αύτού, is nearly identical with the second hemistich cited above from Job 41:25. The underlying Hebrew, however, is quite different. There is no difficulty in understanding how the translator arrived at the perfect passive participle, πεποιημένον. The underlying Hebrew was, again, read as a Qal passive participle. How can we explain the rest of the clause? נגש in the Niphal means "to be hard pressed." Without any changing in consonants יגש means, disregarding for the moment other syntatic factors, "he will be hard pressed." The sentence in Hebrew thus (26) In a private communication John W. Wevers made an alternative suggestion on the parent text here: "Would simply בני be possible (short for בני אל)?" My interest is not so much in positing how a putative parent text might have appeared as in seeking to recon struct how the translator might have read (or have chosen to misread!) a text fairly close to the present MT. In terms of orthography, understanding בלי as כלי is both understandable and explainable without requiring any emendation. On the other hand, positing בני as a parent text instead of בלי does call for emendation and goes beyond what seems to me to be necessary — esp. in view of what we know the translator does with difficult passages (cf. H. Orlinsky, HUCA 29 [1958] 270 [mannerism #18]).</page><page sequence="10">ΙΟ ΙΟ JOHN G. GAMMIE [10] reads so far: "made so that he will be hard pressed." That leaves us with חרבו which, as Gard and others have rightly suggested, should be under stood by metathesis (a reversing of the order of the Resh and the Beth) to be חברו, literally, "his company," and, hence, "his angels."27 This reconstruction fails to account for the preposition Beth but goes a long way in showing that the Septuagintal translator did not necessarily have before him a Hebrew text so very different from the Masoretic.28 The third passage where the Hebrew rendering as άγγελοι is at least at first sight enigmatic is Job 40:11. God is speaking to Job a challenge. The Hebrew in translation reads: Pour forth the wrath of thy fury, behold every haughty one and bring him low. The Greek of the Codex Alexandrinus may be translated: Send forth angels in thy wrath. Humble every proud one. The chief source of perplexity is that the Hebrew רות:??? is read as άγγέλους and again the preposition Beth appears to be lacking. If, how ever, we take it that the translator read or heard רות?!?, "companies," instead of רות???, "anger," then our problem is solved, or nearly so. In view of our discussion of Job 40:19 above, such a reconstruction once again has the advantage of explaining how the translator may have arrived at his translation on the basis of a Hebrew text fairly close to the Masoretic. The one snag is this: ח?ר does not occur in biblical Hebrew with the feminine plural ending ־ות. This ending, however, is common for segholate nouns29 and thus is not altogether objectionable. Further, the understanding of the MT cAyin as Heth is found Several times in the Samaritan Pentateuch.3" (27) Η. Orlinsky understandably does not mention this verse when he lists Greek ren derings of חרב (cf. HUCA 29 [1958] 271.) H. Heater, in my judgment, has failed in this verse to probe the translator's use of the Hebrew text. He has thus missed the probable metathesis and has been led to make a mistranslation of έγκαταπαίζεσθαι as "to kill" (Λ Septuagintal Translation Technique in the Book Book of Job, 126-127). (28) Neither Orlinsky nor Heater makes this point for this verse, but they do often reach, and stress, a similar conclusion for many other passages.

To that question we turn in the next section. At this juncture it will be appropriate to draw together a few summary observations on the translator's angelology. 1. The range of functions attributed to angels in the Septuagint of Job faithfully reflects that of the Hebrew text: of standing before God's presence (Job 1:6; 2:1), of praise of the divine creative acts (Job 38:7), of being purer than man and yet not altogether pure (Job 4:18; 9:7 [A]), and of being hidden from ordinary human gaze (Job 5:1; cf. 5:15—16). 2. Whereas in the Masoretic text there is an intercessory activity on behalf of the righteous, attributed to the angels (Job 33:23—24), in the Septuagint repentance takes the place of angelic intercession as the deci sive factor in effecting the divine decision to prevent harm of the peni tent. In this same passage the translation not only lacks angelic interces sory activity, it explicitly stresses a quite different angelic role of being death-bearers. This passage is not altogether idiosyncratic, for in three other instances the Greek translation clearly views angels as instruments of death (Job 36:14) or of judgmental wrath (Job 20: 15-17; 40:11). In the latter two of these instances the Masoretic text before us does not obviously mention angels. It may therefore be suggested that the trans lator had readily in mind the judgmental function of angels as agents of divine anger. 3. In two other instances the Greek translation found reference to angels where the Masoretic text does not obviously contain mention of them. Both of these instances occur in the second speech of God. It therefore seems safe to conclude that the Greek translator of the Book of Job himself adhered to, or else found himself quite at home in, a universe peopled with angels. This conclusion is further borne out by the studies of Joseph Ziegler who, in his magisterial essay on the Greek text of Job, showed that in a number of instances the translator reiter ates identical or similar Greek phrases in different parts of the book, which phrases were based on different underlying Hebrew.3' The recurring refrain πεποιημένον έγκαταπαίζεσθαι ύπό τών άγγέλων αύτού (μου) may thus clearly be identified as a refrain which the translator himself acknowledged to be in a special way his own, that is, a refrain where he allowed to be expressed, however slightly, his own desire to make of the translation a literary production in its own right. The refrain, however, contains an important clue that the translator himself and useful volume by Rudolf Macuch, Grammatik des Samaritanischen Hebraisch (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1967) 32, § 12 i).

GAMMIE [12] did not think that angelic activity should be viewed too separately from the divine activity. They are said, after all, to be "His angels" (i.e., God's: Job 40:19) and, indeed, "My angels" (i.e., God's: Job 41:25). One of their functions was to mock the beast or dragon who had been made by God. To this strange creature or creatures we will turn in the next section. 4. A final comment may be made on the relation of ό διάβολος to the angels. As Foerster has convincingly shown,32 in the light of the transla tion of the term הסטן in Zechariah 3:1-3 also as ό διάβολος, the latter term should not be translated as "Slanderer" or even as "Accuser," but rather as "Adversary" or perhaps (less ambiguously) as "Opponent." No further embellishments are added to describe ό διάβολος in the transla tion of Job, except, as we have seen above, ό διάβολος is perhaps slightly more clearly in the Greek than in the Hebrew associated with the com pany of angels in that he enters "with them" (LXX: Job 1:6). We also observed that the translator may have had the diabolos in mind when he refers to angels as θανατόφοροι "death-bearers" in Job 33:23. For in the Prologue the diabolos is, after all, instrumental in bringing about the death of Job's sons and daughters (Job 1:19). Nonetheless, the overall reticence and restraint puts us on guard that the translator does not, on the face of it, have a very advanced demonology. III. Demons in the Septuagint of Job. Α. ό διάβολος a Demon? The term ό διάβολος occurs thirteen times in the Septuagint of Job. Each time it is a rendering of the Hebrew הסטן. The translator did not choose to transliterate through rendering ό Σατανάς, a term used some six times in the Testaments of the Twelve Patri archsarchs as a synonym for Beliar (TD 3:6; 5:6; 6:1; TG 4:7; TA 6:4). Nor did he choose to use the phrase τό πονηρόν δαιμόνιον, "the evil demon," used by the translator of Tobit in application to Asmodeus the death bearing demon (Tobit 3:17; cf. 6:8; 8:3). He chose instead a Greek term ό διάβολος, used in the Septuagint not only of a heavenly figure (Zecha riah 3:1-3) but also of a human adversary and enemy, Haman (LXX: Esther 7:4 for הצר and 8:1 for ציו־ר). In Esther, Haman is explicitly called "evil" in both the original and the Greek translation (Esther 7:6). Thus διάβολος is brought into association with a human who is πονηρός. It is also of interest that, as late as the Greek translation of 1 Maccabees, an allusion is made to a διάβολον πονηρόν, "an evil foe," who is evidently the human ruler Antiochus IV, who attacks Jerusalem and sheds blood around the sanctuary (1 Maccabees 1:36). Thus the term διάβολος, as (32) Werner Foerster, "διάβολος," G. Kittel ed., TWBNT 2 (1935) 70-71</page><page sequence="13">[13] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 13 late as the translation of 1 Maccabees,33 was not ipso facto taken to be a non-human figure nor sufficiently evil in connotation so that the adjec tive πονηρός, "evil, wicked," was no longer needed to modify it. "The Adversary" of the Prologue of Job is, as we have seen, clearly angelic and most likely one of the angels to whom the translator would not hesitate to apply the term "death-bearer." "The Adversary," however, equally as clearly in the Septuagint of Job as in the Masoretic text, remains a heavenly agent whose duties take him to earth, who engages in dialogue with God and to whom God grants carefully circumscribed destructive powers. "The Adversary" in the Septuagint of Job, accordingly, may by no means properly be classified as an entity hostile to the divine will or as one whose function is significantly antithetic to divine intention. B. A Demonic Dimension to πνεύμα in the Septuagint of Job? The word πνεύμα34 occurs eighteen times in the unasterisked Septuagint of Job and not once in the plural. In seven instances it is used in relation to discussion of the breath of life (Job 7:7; 10:12; 12:10; 27:3; 32:8; 33:4; 34:14); in three instances it is used in connection with human speech (job 8:2; 16:3; 32:18); in four instances it is used as "wind" (Job 1:19; 13:25; 30:15 and 41:8); and, in one instance, the term is used to signify human "understanding" (Job 15:2). In the three occurrences of the word that remain it is used once of the spirit of God's wrath (Job 4:g), once of a mysterious nocturnal spirit in a passage cited above (Job 4:15) and once (Job 17:1) in an ambiguous phrase όλέκομαι πνεύματι φερόμενος which may be rendered "I perish since I am being carried away" either "by a spirit" or "by the wind." In short, there is not the slightest indication in the Septuagint of Job that there came within the translator's purview a demonology of hostile or evil spirits. C. The Extent of the Mythic-Demonic Aspect of ,θηρία and δράκων. In the second speech of God the translator has created a twice repeated refrain which clearly indicates he attributed to the creature or creatures θηρία and δράκων some mythic and demonic aspect (LXX: Job 40:19; 41:25). These creatures were made not simply for the divine or his angels to "play with" (έμπαίζειν) as in Psalm 103 (104): 26 but "to be mocked at, scoffed at, or ridiculed" (έγκαταπαίζεσθαι). Some opposition is implied, (33) Klaus-Dietrich Schunck, 1 Makkabaerbuch (Judische Schriften aus hellenistisch romischer Zeit 1/4; Giitersloh: Gerd Mohn, 1980) 2g2, puts the composition of the original at 120 b.c.e. A date shortly thereafter for the translation into Greek seems appropriate, i.e., ca. 100-50 b.c.e. (34) For a thorough and helpful discussion of this term in classical, Hellenistic, Philonic, Qumranic, rabbinic as well as in NT usage, see "The Background and Biblical Usage of the Term πνεύμα" in David Hill, Greek Words and Hebrew Meanings: Studies in the Semantics of Sotenological Terms (SNTSMS 5; Cambridge: University Press, 1967) 202-293.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOHN G. GAMMIE [ 14] some enmity, some lack of agreement and concord between the divine and these creatures. In the present section we propose to examine the extent of the mythic-demonic dimension of θηρία and δράκων in the second speech of God. A few other potential mythic-demonic features of the translation elsewhere will also be probed in the course of this section. 1. The word θηρία is found five times in the unasterisked translation of Job; in each instance the plural is employed. Four times it is used to render חיה, "wild beasts" (Job 5:22), "beasts of the field" (Job 5:23) or "beasts" (Job 37:8). Once it is used to render the MT אלים (most likely for אילים, lit. "deer") (Job 41:17). In the second speech of God, and here only in the Book of Job, θηρία is used to render בהמות (Job 40:15). The usual rendering for בהמות elsewhere in the Septuagint is κτήνη, "cattle" (Pss. 8:8; 48 [491:13, 21; 49 [50]: 10; Joel 1:20; 2:22; Micah 5:7; Jer. 12:4; cf. also Ps. 73 [72]: 22). Occasionally מהמות is rendered τετράποδα: Isa. 30:6 and Job 12:7; cf. Job 35:11. Outside of Job 40:19 the plural form בהמות is rendered with the plural θηρία only in Deuteronomy 32:24 and Habakkuk 2:17.35 In both instances the Hebrew seems clearly to be referring to wild beasts. Almost, but not quite, the same reference obtains in Job 40:19. A close attention to the syntax of the Greek of Job 40:15-233 soon shows unmistakably that the translator has in mind a single θηρίον instead of many. He employs the singular possessive pronoun in vss. 16, 17 and 18 as if a single wild beast were being thought of. Similarly, in vs. 19 the neuter or masculine singular perfect passive participle πεποι ημένον is used and not the neuter plural πεποιημένα which agreement with θηρία would seem to require. Most surprising of all, the masculine singular participle έπελθών is employed in vs. 20 and not the neuter, singular or plural, as one would expect. (Holmes and Parsons do list two minuscules which carry the neuter singular.) The verse may thus be translated: And when he had arrived at the edge of the hill he brought joy among the four-footed beasts in the deep.36 It is as if the translator no longer has in mind wild beasts or a wild beast in general but a single wild beast, the gender of which is masculine. Contrary to the ingenious and imaginative reading of the Hebrew text in (35) ΰηρία does, however, render the singular 3המת הארץ in Deut. 28:26; Isa. 18:6; Jer. 7:33l '5:3; !6:4; 19:7; and 41(34):20, and בהמת השךה in 1 Sam. 17:44 (Cod. A). (36) A reference according to Gerleman to the nether world (see the next note). For a recent discussion on this subject, see Sidney Jellicoe, "Hebrew-Greek Equivalents for the Nether World, Its Milieu and Inhabitants, in the Old Testament," Textus 8 (1973) 1-19.</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 15 which Gerleman engages,37 there is nothing in the Greek rendering of vs. 20 or of any of the other verses in the strophe which suggest anything other than a normal, sexually potent, river animal. The verb έπέρχομαι (aor. part, έπελθών) is, to be sure, usually used by the Greek translator of the Book of Job to connote the arrival of impending disaster (Job 1:19), catastrophe (Job 21:17), darkness (Job 23:17) divine judgment (Job 23:6) or day of wrath (Job 20:28) (cf. also Job 2:11; 3:4; 19:29; 20:22; 25:3; 27:9; 31:12; 37:9). The arrival of "the beast" at the cliff or river ledge may thus connote, for the translator, the arrival as a sign of impending doom. The suggestive mythic-demonic overtone is all but lost, however, in the overall pastoral tone of the rest of the verse ("he brought joy to the four-footed beasts in the deep") and especially of the next two verses. The context makes it plain that the "deep" is a poetic hyperbole for the river where grow the "papyrus" (πάπυρος), "cane" (κάλαμος), "sedge" (βούτομον), "rushes" or "shoots" (φαδάμνοι) and "willows" (κλώνες άγνου) (Job 40:21-22). Our examination of the θηρία has shown that the most mythic demonic aspect of the passage is, for the most part, confined to the enigmatic refrain "made to be mocked at by his angels." 2. The word δράκων is used six times by the translator of Job to render five different Hebrew nouns. Three of these renderings do not have obvious mythic overtones. The reference is to a serpent or formi dable sea-creature in Job 4:10 and 38:39 where δράκοντες is used to translate כפירים ("whelps") and placed in parallelism with λεόντες, "lions." The parallelism of λέων and δράκων (i.e., of the lion and proba bly the crocodile) is also found in Ezekiel 32:2. The translator's choice of δράκων in Job may, therefore, have been influenced by the Ezekielian passage. In a third passage, Job 20:16, δράκων is used to render פתן, which the translator seems here to understand as a variation or kind of snake because the term is in parallelism with όφις, "serpent." Accordingly, in this passage and in the two referred to above, the translator has in mind not a mythic but, rather, a harmful and potentially lethal serpentine creature. The mythic dimensions of δράκων is unmistakable, however, in the next three passages to which we turn: Job 7:12, 26:13 and 40:25 where δράκων is used to render, respectively: נחש ,תנין, and לדתן· In Job 7:12 the Greek translates the Masoretic text fairly closely: Am I the sea or the dragon (37) Cf. G. Gerleman, Studies in the Septuagint I. Book of Job, 21—22.</page><page sequence="16">16 JOHN G. GAMMIE [16] that you have appointed a guard over me? In this verse the translator seems to have more in mind than the sand or seashore, that is, the appointed limits of the sea to which reference is made in the first speech of God (Job 38:10-11). He seems to draw, rather, on the mythology of divine opposition to the sea such as is found in Isa. 27:1; 51:9; Ps. 74:13; 104:26 and Job 26:4, 12-13. The latter three verses are contiguous in the Septuagint of Job and read in transla tion:38 To whom have you proclaimed deeds? Whose blast is it that has gone out of you? By His strength He caused the sea to cease; by His understanding He wounded the sea monster (κήτος). The bolts of heaven fear Him; by his decree He put to death the rebellious dragon. The translator at the same stroke both de-mythologizes and intensifies the mythologization of these verses. First, by bringing reference to the blast (πνοή) going "out from him" (MT, vs. 4) into closer association with causing "the sea to cease" (MT, vs. 12), the translator more surely allows the reader to recall the mythic use that Marduk put to the wind blasts in the Babylonian Creation Epic when he subdued the Sea Monster, Tiamat (Enuma elis IV 93 ff.). Second, he seems to reverse this tendency when he allows the mythological name Rahab to be dropped. The Hebrew רהב is not transliterated as it is in Psalm 86 [87]: 4, for example, but translated κήτος, "sea-monster" (cf. also Job 9:13). Third, as if returning to the mythicizing tendency, the sea-serpent Leviathan, who in the Masoretic text is described as fleeing, בריח, is now seen to be "apos tate, rebellious" (άποστάτην). The overall effect is that the mythic dimensions of the Dragon have been enhanced. In particular, the translator has underlined that the opposition of the Dragon to God is like, if not identical to, the opposition of the Sea-Monster (κήτος) to God. The correctness of this assessment is borne out by the fact that in Job 3:8 κήτος and not δράκων is used to translate לרתן "Leviathan." In the second speech of God the same almost contradictory thrusts may be observed. On the one hand there appears to be a de-mythologi zation. Thus, the Masoretic text reads in Job 41:17: (38) Slightly over 50% of the stichs in chapter 26 of the Masoretic text do not appear in the LXX.</page><page sequence="17">[17] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 17 Upon his arising the gods attack:39 through smashing they free themselves from sin.4° The Greek renders: When he returns there is fear among the four-footed wild beasts which jump upon the earth. On the other hand, there appears to be an enhancement of the mythologization, for the Dragon is brought into closer association with the water in the Greek. In the Masoretic text the poem concludes: There is not his likeness on the dust. Made to have no fear, he surveys every proud creature. He is the king of all majestic wild beasts (MT: Job 41:25-26). The Greek rendering, even more plainly than the Masoretic text, mythologizes: There is no one on earth like him; (yet) he has been made to be mocked at by my angels; He surveys every exalted being, and is king of all creatures in the waters (LXX: Job 41:25-26). In the Greek the translator at once underlines: (i) the amphibious nature of the Dragon, (ii) his supremacy over creatures on land and sea, and (iii) his enmity with God's angels. We have already seen that the translator considers the Sea to be apos tate. In the poem on the Dragon, the relationship of the Beast to the Sea is not only reiterated, as in the Masoretic text (vs. 22), but underlined (vs. 26). The poem in the Greek is eleven hemistichs shorter than in the Masoretic text. One of the most outstanding features of the Greek trans lation is that even though it sustains some of the mythic overtones of the Masoretic text (cf. e.g., Job 41:11a, 13b),41 or enhances them, as we have (39) Is this half verse the origin of the Greek translator's enigmatic phrase, "made to be mocked at by his/my angels"? (40) The Hebrew of this half verse is notoriously difficult. See the commentaries. (41) For a discusson of the extent of the mythic overtones attached to Leviathan for the Hebrew author of Job, see the commentaries and my essay, "Behemoth and Leviathan: On the Didactic and Theological Significance of Job 40:15-41:26," John G.

GAMMIE [18] shown, at the same time it draws the reader's attention to the similarities of this mythic beast to the crocodile. The descriptions of the Dragon in the Greek of Job 40:25-31 and 41:1-8b seem quite applicable solely to the crocodile. In the latter part of the translation the mythic proportions of the Hebrew, although partially muted by his rendering of vs. 17, are overall considerably enhanced. It does not seem to us correct, however, when Gerleman sees in Job 41:22 evidence of the AEsculapius saga motif of the serpent guarding or brooding over coffers of gold.42 The Greek of Job suggests rather a disdain or apathy to the gold beneath him. His couch is sharp obelisks and all the gold of the sea beneath him as so much (lit. untold) mud. In Egypt, obelisks of old were covered with gold. The rendering of this verse, instead of being an indication of the translator's mythologizing rather serves as a good illustration of how much the translator has in mind his Greek-speaking audience and, in the interest of making a translation of poetic merit, is paying attention to the overtones and nuances of the Greek words he employs. This evident desire on the part of the translator to make of his translation a piece with poetic appeal is a subject which merits further attention but will not be pursued here.43 The subject of the demonology of the translation of the Book of Job may now be summarized. 1. 1. Contrary to previous studies which have stressed a mythologizing activity in the Greek translation of the Book of Job, the present inquiry has pointed to evidence to show that in its portrayal of the demonic the translation in some places de-mythologized and in other places intensi fied the mythologization. 2. The avoidance of a transliteration of the Hebrew הסטן as ό Σατανάς and the rendering instead by ό διάβολος may well have deliber ately been made by the translator in order to obviate an association between the Adversary of the Prologue and mythic leaders of evil forces such as Beliar. Instead of having a clear demonic overtone, the choice of translation ό διάβολος on the contrary probably represents the trans 84-87; reprinted in James L. Crenshaw, ed., Studies in Ancient Israelite Wisdom (New York; Ktav,Ktav, 1976) 341-74. (42) Cf. G. Gerleman, Studies in the Septuagint I. Book of Job, 41. (43) On this subject see my forthcoming article "The Septuagint of Job: Its Poetic Style and Relationship to the Septuagint of Proverbs," soon to appear in the Catholic Biblical Quarterly.</page><page sequence="19">[19] THE ANGELOLOGY AND DEMONOLOGY 1g lator's desire to utilize a term still relatively neutral and not yet associa ted in the public mind with a leader of forces in opposition to the divine intentions. 3. Chiefly because of the translator's more advanced angelology, the creatures Behemoth and Leviathan are cast into a general, albeit rather ambiguous, opposition to the divine. In a twice repeated refrain, largely the creation of the translator, both creatures are said to have been "made to be mocked at by the angels [of God]" (Job 40:19; 41:25). Behe moth, however, is not transliterated, neither is it rendered by a noun in the singular but, rather, by the relatively bland and mythically jejune plural, ΰηρία, "wild beasts." Syntactically, this creature is treated as one; and a specifically evil aspect of either creature is nowhere brought out. The Leviathan as δράκων, "Dragon," at the same time is, however, portrayed like the crocodile and also, in a subtle fashion, as more demonic than his Hebrew counterpart. Because the translator earlier in the poem has drawn a clear relation between the δράκων and the sea as a "rebellious, apostate" creature in opposition to God (Job 26:4, 12-13), it seems natural to conclude that when he later stresses the relation of the δράκων to the waters (Job 41:26) he is also, however subtly, calling to mind the apostate, rebellious nature of the same sea monster. 4. In sum, the Greek translation of the Book of Job may be seen as a clear, though rather modest and restrained, advance toward a dualistic demonology. In contrast to other works of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid era, however, such as 1 Enoch, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, and Jubilees its demonology is exceedingly bland and undeveloped.</page></plain_text>
