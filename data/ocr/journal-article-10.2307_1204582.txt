This volume is a compilation of eight of Eberhard Jiingel's theological essays, which have appeared in either German theological journals or festschriften. The compiler and translator is E. B. Webster who hitherto has written the only pub- lished introduction to Jiingel's thought. This present volume merits careful attention for several reasons. First, it adds an additional book to the steady flow of recent translations of Jiingel's writings, indicating that this important conti- nental thinker is wielding some influence in English-speaking theological circles. Second, this book will help English readers who are unfamiliar withJiingel's Ger- man corpus compare some themes ofJiingel's work prior to his book God as the Mystery of the World (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1983) with this, his magnum opus, as well as explore avenues that Jiingel has taken since the publication of his major text. Finally, each essay clearly stands on its own as not only exhibitingJiingel's characteristic noncorrelationalist theological method but also as presenting his viewpoint in various disciplines, such as truth theory, metaphor theory, ontol- ogy, theological anthropology, theological ethics, ecclesiology, christology, and natural theology. Hence, thinkers from several theological disciplines will bene- fit from the essays translated in this book. The essays clearly attest to Jiingel's guiding supposition that judgments about God and humanity can only be made on the basis of the event of God's identity with the life and death of the one man Jesus as revealed in Jesus' resurrection from the dead. Hence, Jesus Christ is the basis for proper speech about God, humanity, and their interrelationship. WhileJiingel is clearly indebted to Barth, these essays show how Jiingel has expanded these Barthian themes in novel ways into a variety of fields. A glance at some of these fields will provide a hint about the directions that these essays take. In ontology, Jiingel defends the priority of possibility over actuality (contra Aristotle) on the basis of the doctrine of justifi- cation. In metaphor theory, Jiingel shows that metaphor can be literal and thus disclosive of truth. In ethics, he shows that divine gratuity does not create a mor- ally debilitating dependency on God but, rather, summons people to responsible lives corresponding to the event of God's love. In ecclesiology, Jiingel thinks that the church is best pictured as living from Christ who is himself the only true sac- rament. And in language theory, Jiingel defends anthropomorphism as not anthropocentric but as a way of openness to the world as such. In each field, Jiingel is certain that the proper distinction of God from the world, which is fer- 444</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews reted out from the belief that Jesus is truly God and truly human, is also the proper way of relating God to the world. Jiingel's confidence that both true God as such and true humanity as such are revealed in Jesus Christ leads him to a greater confidence in proposals for dog- matic theology than other contemporary thinkers. It is this confidence that makes his work both stimulating and puzzling for contemporary theologians. MARK MATTES, Antigo, Wisconsin.</page></plain_text>
