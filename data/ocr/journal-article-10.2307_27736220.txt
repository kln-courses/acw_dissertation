Loos Bloemgracht 150, 1015 TS Amsterdam, The Netherlands Received: August 2006; accepted: November 2006 Abstract This essay discusses Ovid's poetic rendition of Hellenistic astronomy in the Phaethon myth. In Met. 2.63-75 Sol presents his diurnal and annual movements as separate, but the first instruction (127-8) to his son in his second speech refers to the \)7to^8i\(/i?-theory; so far Ovid has followed Geminus Isag. 12. Met. 2.129-33 telescopes the Milky Way (via quinqu? per arcus) and the ecliptic together, the sectus in obliquum limes zonarumque trium contentus fine reflecting the Aratean system of three imaginary circles connected by means of the fourth (Phaen. 526 ? Se x?xpato?) circle, the ecliptic; Nonnus D. 38.256-9 points in the same direction. In the last instruction utrumque (Met. 2.140) refers to the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. In 2.116 I adopt quam, the reading of Par F (Tarrant, OCT 2004), instead of quern, thus making Aurora the subject o? petere terras, which makes excellent sense since she carries the passage Met. 2.112-44. In late Antiquity both Nonnus (D. 38.424-5) and Claudian (VI. Cons. Hon. 172) catasterise Phaethon into Auriga; this paper offers some fresh viewpoints, based on e.g. Ov. Am. 3.12.31, 37 and Hyginus Astr. 2.42.1324-7, that could defend the presence of Phaethon's catasterismus in the Metamorphoses. Keywords Phaethon, Aratus *} I wish to thank Sjef (J.A.R.)

Met. 1.754) SolesatusPhaethon (751) runs to his mother Clymene and demands clarification concerning the doubt cast on the divine charac ter of his DNA (760-1): at tu, si modo sum caelesti stirpe creatus, I ede notam tanti generis meque adsere caelo. She reassures him, and encourages him to see his father face to face; immediately Phaethon... concipit aethera mente (777) patriosque adit impiger ortus (779). In this final line of Book 1 the combination patrios ortus, recapitulating patrios... Penates I unde oritur domus (773-4), sets the tone for Sols essential duality in the Phaethon story in Book 2.1) More often than not the anthropomorphic character of Phaethon's father and the cosmographical qualities of the sun merge into Sol's double nature. Sol addresses Phaethon as his progenies... haud infitianda parenti (2.34)?which should have settled the matter once and for all?and, swearing by Styx, makes him ask any favour (44-6). Phaeth on's reaction is so rash that there is no time to mark the 7iepi7??xeia with the usual cum-inversum construction in 47-8:2) vix bene desierat, currus rogat ille paternos I inque diem alipedum ius et moderamen equorum. Now "the father is trapped into giving what he knows will kill his son" (Anderson 1997,234). Within Phoebus' first speech (50-102) lines 63-83 make up a cosmo graphical unit in its own right. Although meant primarily to help dis suade^ Phaethon from his foolish4) desire, this passage has obviously been designed as a lecture on astronomy (63-9):5) ardua prima via est et qua vix mane recentes enituntur equi; medio est altissma caelo, unde mare et terras ipsi mihi saepe videre 65 sit timor et pavida trepidet formidine pectus; ultima prona via est et eget moderamine certo: tune etiam quae me subiectis excipit undis ne ferar in praeceps Tethys solet ipsa vereri. 1] For a discussion of this double nature ("dubbele essende") brought about by a coalition of mythology and the scientific description of natural phenomena see Schrijvers 1978, 9-10. 2) Anderson 1997, 235. 3) See Met. 2.51-3 utinampromissa liceretlnon dare;... dissuadere licet. 4) See Met. 2.102 sed tu sapientius optai 5) Met. 2.63-9 is quoted by Sen. de Providentia 5.10; see Anderson 1997, 237.</page><page sequence="3">J.X.

As usual, the transition formula adde quodG) seems to introduce a new point?but does it here??in 70-1: adde quod adsidua rapitur vertigine caelum sideraque alta trahit celerique volumine torquet. Not only the Sun rises, crosses the meridian, and sets (63-9), but all sidera (71), i.e. the fixed stars and all planets including the Moon and the Sun, are pulled upwards (71 alta used predicatively) by the daily rotation of the universe (70 caelum) and, after culmination, carried westward (for 70 rapi tur = rapitur in occasum see Loos 2006, 145; the 7ip(o9t)axepov suggests the endless repetition of the daily rotation). In the geocentric system the Moon and the Sun were considered planets,7) along with the five planets visible to the unaided eye.8) Hill (1985, 198 ad 129-33) finds fault with 70-5 since "there would be no need for Phaethon to do more than cling to one point if he is to drive the chariot for only a single day (see the note on 2.70-5)"; this criti cism, however, rather bears on 63-9 or indeed on 63-71.

If it had been for Geminus, or indeed for Hill, Sol would be just one of the rcavxcov ?ax?pcov borne along by the relentless rotation of the koguoc, clinging to one point'. Since this text book presentation was not going to impress Phaethon, Ovid has made Sol remythologize his diurnal movement as frightening and difficult. Not even Jove will be able to drive the sun-chariot (60-2). How difficult then will it be for Phaethon to control the horses (84-6 nee tibi quad ripedes... inpromptu regere est), who are potentially unruly in living up to their fiery names (153-4 Uupoeic/Hcpoc, A?Ocov, OX?ycov). Especially the arduous way up (63-4) and the steep descent (67-9) demand moderamine certo. Not even for Sol is this all in a day's work: 86-7 vix me patiuntur, ubi acres I incaluere animi, cervixque r?pugn?t habenis. Phoebus concludes the description of his diurnal movement with the verb vereri (69), and at the point of culmination no less than four words denoting fear express Sol's dizziness; Anderson (1997, 237 ad 65-6) comments: "If even the Sun admits his terror, then Phaethon should know how frightened he can expect to be". Having presented himself as an alert and active teamster in 63-9 Sol goes on (70-5) to dissociate himself from the passive role of the sidera (71),9) to which category, however, he himself belongs, for the kckjuo? spins with 7t?ai xo?? ?cp' a?xoi) u?peai, i.e. with both the fixed stars and the seven (five + two) planets,10) clinging to their respective points from East to West. 9) Le Boeuffle (1977, 15-21) begins his discussion of sidus with the general statement: "Sid?ra... peut concerner globalement ?toiles, plan?tes, lune, soleil".

The passage Met. 2.70-1 has prepared the ground for Sol remythologiz ing what Geminus (12.5) has to say about "le mouvement propre du soleil", cited from the text and facing translation by Aujac (2002, 64): "En revanche le soleil se d?place du couchant au levant en un mouvement inverse de celui de l'univers".?Notice that these words are a carbon copy of what headlines Gem. 12: oxi xt^v ?vocvx?av xco K?ajicp k?vt|oiv o? 7uX?cvrjT?c 7roiouvTou.?"C'est visible d'apr?s les ?toiles qui se l?vent avant le soleil." ?aoi y?p ?v up? xfj? xou ti??ou ?vaxo?ij? 9e pr\0Gxnv ?ax?pe? rcpoavax?xa?,Koxe? iox&gt; riXioi), "on les voit, les nuits suivantes, se lever, sen siblement, bien avant lui", koc! xo?xo yivexou Kax? xo s?;fjc ?nl rcaocov xcov vuKxcov. 12.6 e? ox) (pavepov oxi ei? x? ?n?\iEvan) xcov ?co?icov ? t??iio? jiexa?aivei, a7co ?uaeco? en ?vaxo?iiv Kivo\&gt;|i?vo?

Note that this presentation of the Sun's planetary, annual, movement is inextricably bound up with that of his daily movement, much the same as in Met. 2.72-5: nitor in adversum, nee me, qui cetera, vincit impetus, et r?pido contrarius evehor orbi. finge datos currus: quid ages? poterisne rotatis obvius ire polis, ne te citus auferat axis?

Andersons (1997, 238) cin the reverse direction' is to the point ad 72-3, being less than elucidating ad 70-1. Avienus 917 represents the planets as nitentes in summa poli, elles (the planets) montent avec effort vers les hauteurs du ciel', on which Soubiran (2003, 228 n. 5) comments: "M?taphore classique: les plan?tes semblent gravir avec peine l'?tendue de ciel qui s?pare l'horizon ouest du m?ridien (summapoli - leur point culminant au-dessus de l'horizon sud)".

Loos ?Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 257-289 who is the only12) Aratean author to discuss the astronomy of the planets (908-29), may well have interpreted evehor (73) {OLD s.v. 4, go up, ascend') in this way. Sol puts up a heroic struggle against the impetus (73) that overcomes cetera (72). By means of this deliberately vague cetera, which could only be accurate here if denoting the fixed stars proper (see n. 10), Sol gets away with passing over in silence the Moon and the five planets, thus misappropriating their planetary movements for the sake of representing his own struggle against the r?pido orbi as unique in the universe. In 74-5 the two rhetorical questions are to intimidate Phaethon into abandoning his fatal ambition: nihil ages! rotatis obvius ire polis non valebisl For citus axis being equivalent to rotatis polis see Le BoeufHe 1977, 86 s.v. axis. For auferri = rapi in occasum (as opposed to ire) see the quotations of Plin. Nat. 2.33, Sen. Nat. 7.21.4, Ov. Ars 2.91 in Loos 2006, 145.

This has prompted Hill (1985, 197 ad 70-5) to criticise "these instruc tions1^ ..., since the distance the Sun would need to travel backwards through the stars on a single day17) would be negligible". But observing the sky from solid ground (Met. 2.147) is not for Phaethon. It is the real thing Phaethon affects (58), which in any viginti quattuor horarum spatio means travelling an arc of Sol's annual path around Earth measuring 27tR : 365.25, which must be a considerable distance if the radius18) is as astronomical as is suggested by 178-9 summo despexit ab aethere terras I infelix Phaethon penitus penitusque patentes.

Figure 1 proves Ovid right in these two respects,20) showing 16) Only in his second speech will Sol give instructions to Phaethon, pace Hill. 17) Similar objections in Anderson 1997, 239 ad 80-1: "Strictly speaking... the course of the Sun in a single day would not pass through the entire Zodiac, but through one prevail ing sign", and in Simon 1999, 36: "On peut se demander si Ovide ne s'inspire pas d'un mod?le o? le pr?t du char d?passerait la dur?e d'une journ?e, ? moins que Ph?bus?et Ovide?ne soient n?gligents". 18) Arat. 541-3 visualises the enormous circumference of the ecliptic by means of the inscribed hexagon (Fig. 3 in Kidd 2004, 372); the radius of the ecliptic circle measuring a distance as far as the eye reaches (541 ??pGaXjio?o ?oAfjc... cc?yri) is equal to each side of any of the six equilateral triangles, in other words the radius equals a chord subtending (542 i)7ioop?uoi = 543 7iEpvc?uveTcxi) two Zodiacal Signs; cf. Kidd 2004, 373 ad 543. 19) Bowen &amp; Todd 2004, 117: "So since the heliacal circle is determined... as 390,000,000 stades, each of its twelfth-parts... is 32,500,000 stades. So if the latter too are divided into 30 degrees... each degree will be 1,083,333 Vs stades"; they (78 n. 2) decline to translate the seven-digit figure into feet, kilometers, or miles. 20) Figure 1 (designed by Edo W. Minne) shows the Sun in Aries on March 21 in classical Antiquity; this vernal equinoctial point has now shifted westward, by one Zodiacal Sign in two millennia, to Pisces; cf.

As we have seen above, no day goes by without the Sun performing his diurnal and (part of his) annual motions simultaneously (Fig. 1), and therefore it seems natural enough (pace Hill 1985, 197 ad 80-3) that Sol should alert Phaethon to the insidias... formasque ferarum (2.78) lying in wait for him along the ecliptic (78 iter, 79 viam). The five most frightening Signs, Taurus (80), Sagittarius (81), Leo (81), Scorpios (82-3), and Cancer (83), represent the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, which lie on either side of the Sun's path, the ecliptic; as a consequence it will be difficult for Phaethon to resist the temptation to turn off to the celestial Land of Plenty (76-8), the location of which will be discussed below.</page><page sequence="10">266 f.X.

It is a matter of common observation, however, that the Moon will have slowed down by eight degrees relative to the stars accompanying her at sunset when, after the more than twelve hours mentioned above, she finally sets. This apparent slowing down of the five planets, the Moon and the Sun relative to the daily rotation of the sky is the basic idea of the so called imo?-eiyi?-theory, dealt with, and refuted, by Gem. 12.14-27.22) This rival theory denies the existence of the individual planetary motions of the seven (five + two) planets, postulating instead that the planets are slowed down by their respective dimensions (12. 14 ?iot x? U?y?9r| \)7io???7uea9cu) and thus overtaken by the spinning universe (12.15 KaTCCTa%oDu?vo'u? vno xov k?ouo\)) "avant d'avoir fait le tour complet" (Aujac 2002, 66).

Since time is precious between Dawn and sunrise Sol has to squeeze five separate flying instructions into a mere fourteen hexameters. The first two lines (127-8) parce, puer, stimulis et fortius utere loris: sponte sua properant, labor est inhibere volentes seem to express in a nutshell the contents of Sol's first lecture on astronomy (63-75 in particular), with a difference, however. In 63-75 Sol presented his two motions as antagonists, whereas in 127-8 the volentes horses who sponte sua properant reflect the daily rotation of the universe, and Sol, remythologizing his apparent slowing down, i.e. his apparent VKoXzvyxq by one degree per day, urges his young son to restrain the volentes horses, to hold them back from their movement {OLD s.v. inhibere 2). So far we have followed Geminus closely, and if Aujac (2002, xxii-xxiv) is right to identify the Rhodian author23) with Magnus' cliens Cn. Pompeios Geminos, his Eiaaycoyri d? x? Oaiv?u?va may well have been Ovid's most important model concerning the planetary motions, which Aratus declines to deal with {Phaen. 454-61). What's more, Ovid's audience may well have been amongst the readership Geminus had in mind,24) according to Aujac (2002, seven (five + two) planets have their individual movements in the opposite sense, i.e. from West to East. As Wyatt (1977, 177-8) explains: "Any planet... moves slowly eastward most of the time, on or near the ecliptic, but occasionally turns about and moves westward rela tive to the stars. After a time the planet resumes its easterly motion once again. Unlike the sun and moon, which are always in easterly or direct motion through the stars, each planet spends a minority of its time in westerly or retrograde motion against the stellar background. Figure 7.2 [= Fig. 3 in this paper] shows the motion of Mars through Gemini during 1960 and 1961. The position of the planet on September 1, 1960, is labeled S. Positions are shown until May 1, 1961. Retrograde motion lasted from late November until early Febru ary."

This path of the sun, which we call the ecliptic, runs at an oblique angle in a broad arc across the three central zones, avoiding the extremes at north and south". The three zones meant by Anderson (and Hill, and Borner (1969, 274)) are the torrid zone between the Tropics of Cancer and Cap ricorn and the two climatic belts with moderate temperatures both in the heavens and on Earth; for the celestial parallels of declination, parallel to the celestial Equator, correspond to the terrestrial parallels of latitude,26) in 25) For the manoeuvre see Hdt. 8.84.1 7?p?uvr|v ?cveicpo?ovxo (Sitzler 1896, 142: "r?ck w?rts rudern", jedoch so, da? der Schiffsschnabel dem Feinde zugekehrt bleibt), and the Scholiast ad Thuc. 1.50.5 rcp?uvccv ?Kpo'?ovxo, cited by Gomme (1971, 187): x? kcxx' ??iyov ctva%cope?v ut] axp?\|/ctvxa? x? nXo?ov kx?,.

The misunderstanding consists in OLD failing to mention s.v. zona the extra meaning given by Housman (1937, 30 ad 3.319) "zonae, circuli, ut I 555, 689, III 625"; and what's more, OLD assigns Man. 3.319 and Ov. Met. 2.131 to zona 3, any of the imagined bands encircling the earth, a celestial zone'. A similar misunderstanding applies to Borner 1969, 274 ad2.129: "Die Bezeichnung arcus f?r 'die Zone' begegnet, nach dem Vorbild dieser Stelle, nur noch Manil. III 318 f. quamquam per tris signorum circulus arcus obli quos iaceaf\ which Goold (1977, 187), however, translates: "although the zodiac (signorum circulus) lies aslant (obliquos=obliquus) through the three tropical circles", apparently following the lead of Housman (1937, 30 ad 3.318) "tris arcus, aestivum, aequinoctialem, brumalem".27) Housman compares Man. 1.675 "per tris gyros inflexus ducitur orbis zodiacus", this time with the support of OLD s.v. gyrus 4 (astron.) b, one of the imagi nary circles in the heavens'. In the light of the two Manilius passages 1.675 and 3.318-2028) we may be confident that in Ov. Met. 2.130-1 the sectus in obliquum limes zona rumque trium contentus fine answers to the system of four (three + one = three + ecliptic) circles shown in Fig. 4:29) the three tropical circles, the Oepiv?c TponiK?q/aestivus circulus/Trop?c of Cancer and the %eiU?pivo?

This is not in the Greek source, and it is likely that V. alludes to Varro of Atax: at quinqu? aetheriis zonis accingitur orbis, p. 96 Morel." 27) Remarkably, OLD s.v. arcus 5c, one of the five zones into which the sky is divided', quoting Ov.

Obviously in Met. 2.129 the quinqu?... arcus are to be conceived not as belts or zones (as suggested by Hill (1985, 198 ad 129-33), Borner, Anderson and as OLD classifies them (s.v. arcus 5c)) (see n. 27), but as imaginary circles.33) But what is meant by this mysterious directos... via quinqu? per arcus7. 30) Martin 2002, 32: "Ces cercles-l? sont parall?les entre eux, et perpendiculaires ? l'axe du monde, qui s'en entoure et les tient tous les trois par leur centre.

Fig ure 5 corresponds to Fig. 2 in Goold 1977, xxxii-xxxiii. 32) Ovid uses circulus only twice, in Met. 2.516 and Tr. A3.G (in either case = ?pKxiKo? k'OkXo?). 33) Remarkably, the (first five editions between 1934 and 1951 of the) Dutch gram marschool anthology of Ovid by (Slijper &amp;) Hondius (1943, 49 ad 129) comments: "quinqu? arcus (=zonas), de 5 parallele cirkels". (Schuursma (61955, 47) has allowed the erroneous "5 parallele gordels" to slip in.) In Avienus 930 quattuor zonae (= the four (three + ecliptic) circles depicted in Fig. 4) = quattuor istis zonis (932-3) contrast with zonam (944) = belt = balteus (945; Milky Way).

Manilius is one of the few authors to mention all constellations traversed by the lacteus orbis (753), starting with the sidera Cassiepiae (686) and completing in Cassiepia the circuit (696-8) .34) Furthermore, he men tions all imaginary circles crossed: 684-5 alter &lt;gyrus&gt; in adversum positus succedit ad Arctos I et paulum a boreae gyro sua fila reducit, ?the other &lt;belt&gt; (sc. the Milky Way) is placed crosswise to the Zodiac.

Manilius goes out of his way to intertwine the belts of the Zodiac and the Milky Way, in 1.699 presenting the four (three + one) imaginary circles (discussed above and represented in Fig. 4) crossed by the Milky Way twice (700), and in 666-8, with 684 complementing 668, presenting the two belts as obliquos adversaque fila trahentis I inter se gyros, quorum fulgentia signa I alter habet per quae Phoebus moderatur habenas... alter in adversum positus succedit adArctos. Ovid has likewise twisted together the two belts in Met. 2.129-33. We now have the following instructions in Sol's second astronomical speech: apply the brakes! (Met. 2.127-8 = 2A), forget about the Milky Way (Met. 2.129 = 2B), but travel along the Zodiac and keep to the beaten track! (Met. 2.130-3 = 2C) Notice that the clever use of effugit causes polumque I effugit australem iunctamque aquilonibus Arcton (131-2) to refer to both the Zodiac and the Milky Way.

Ovid's idea to describe the two interwoven belts twice (in Met. 2.76-83 and in 129-33) possibly springs from the observation that the two do cross one another twice in the sky, as described (above) by Manilius. Presumably, however, the two poets have modelled their presentations of the Zodiac and the Milky Way after Aratus. Ovid s discussion of the Sun's planetary motion in Met. 2.70-5 and 127-8 corre sponds to the five planets {nevie oxrcepec) in Phaen. 454-61; that of the Zodiac (or rather the ecliptic) and the Milky Way twisted together in both Met. 2.76-83 and 129-33 corresponds to Phaen. 462-79 as follows: the Milky Way (469-79) is framed by the x?acapa (463; three + one) circles, which are apripoxec a^ArjXoiai n?vieq (467-8),40) and by the very same 7UG\&gt;pcuv (three + one)4l) circles in 478-9. Again, in Phaen. 511 the Milky Way finds itself embedded in the detailed discussion of the two Tropics (480-510) and the Equator (511-24); 525-44 discusses the four (three + ecliptic/Zodiac) circles.

In 116 quern must refer to Lucifer, but after his exit followed by a full stop at the end of 115 any addi tional information on Lucifer seems superfluous, and quern petere... terras looks odd indeed, in the words of Haupt (1966, 91 ad 116): "untergehn, astronomisch unrichtig". It seems attractive to adopt the reading o? Par F (Tarrant, OCT 2004) = n F (Anderson, Teubner 1993), so that we get quam petere ut terras mundumque rubescere vidit (116)... Titan (118), when Sol saw Aurora making landfall and the whole sky turning red'. This interpretation fits in with Aurora carrying the whole passage 112-44. The extreme end of the last phase of the Moon (117 cornua extremae... Lunae) acts as a second Morning Star (see n. 48), making Sol no less nervous than do Lucifer and Aurora, and probably a lot more. Ursa Major, ?pocKcov (Serpens), and Bootes are the first constellations (2.171-7) to suffer from the sudden heat when Phaethon veers off the tri tum... spatium (167-8) crosswise to the North, flouting instruction 2E (Met. 2.138-40). Far worse are the consequences (209-303) of his flouting instruction 2D (Met. 2.134-7): his quadriga collides (204-5) with the alto(que) sub aethere fixis... stellis, and modo summa petunt, modo per declive viasque I praecipites spatio terrae propiore feruntur I inferiusque suis fraternos currere Luna I admiratur equos (206-9).

Kidd 2004, 370 ad Phaen. 539-40: "The arc of the western horizon along which sunset points oscillate is equal to the arc of the eastern horizon..., i.e. between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer". The Ocean (Phaen. 537) of course has served as the horizon ever since Homer (cf. Aujac 2002, 42 n. 3). Plin.

This is feasible only at one of the two points where the Milky Way crosses the Zodiac; needless to say it will take a science fiction like increase in speed, in easterly direction along the Zodiac, for Phaethon to reach one of these junctions in just a day. The two crossings are dis cussed by Manilius in Astr. 1.695-6: Geminos{que) per ima I signa secat (sc. lacteus orbis) (between Gemini49) and Taurus according to Fig. 7)50) and, diametrically across (cf.

The latter crossing corresponds to Ovid's description in Met. 2.198-9 hunc (Scor pion) puer ut nigri madidum sudore veneni I vulnera curvata minitantem c?spide vidit. This is the point when Phaethon mentis inops g?lida formidine lora remisit (200), flouting instructions 2A {Met. 2.127-8; cf. 202 nulloque inhibente) and, as we saw above (in 204-9), 2D {Met. 2.134-7). Here (in Met. 2.195-200),51) if anywhere, it is that we must assume Phaethon flouts instructions 2B-C by leaving the frightening Zodiac (Haupt 1966, 97 ad 202 {exspatiantur equt)\ "Sie brechen aus aus dem Tierkreis") in favour of the Milky Way?where, as will be tentatively argued below, our charioteer {auriga in Met. 2.312 and 327) is to meet with his catasterismus into Auriga, which constellation lies in the Milky Way (Fig. 7). In Amores 3.12.37 Ovid seems to refer to Phaethon's catasterismus into the constellation Auriga: flere genis electra tuas, Auriga, s?rores, where s?rores - Heliades {Met. 2.340), but Diggle (1970,195) thinks otherwise: "Am. 3.12.37 proves nothing: Kenney (OCT) is right to print auriga without capital".

Warum Ovid ihn" (this catasterismus) "in den Metamorphosen nicht verwendet, ist eine offene Frage: Sicher geh?rten Katasterismoi nicht eigentlich zu den Metamorphosen (A. Rohde 24)." It seems odd that Borner should disqualify the catasterismus as a type of meta morphosis, apparently in tandem with Rohde (1929, 25): "plerumque igitur catasterismus non est transformado, sed quaedam quasi migratio commutatioque loci". Of course Hollis (1970, 56 ad Met. 8.177-82) gets it right: iUCatasterism' is a favourite type of metamorphosis in Hellenistic poetry. This was the mythological reflection of increased interest in astron omy, exemplified by such as Aratus and the poet-scientist Eratosthenes." Phaethon's aircrash generates the metamorphoses of the Heliades and Cyc nus {Met. 2.340-66 and 367-80), and the inferno (209-303) is the a?xiov for the Aethiopum populos nigrum traxisse colorem (235-6), the otmov of the genesis of the Libyan desert (237-8), the a?xiov why Nilus in extremum fugit perterritus orbem I occuluitque caput, quod adhuc latet (254-5). An a?xiov and a catasterismus are related phenomena (Condos 1997, 217 n. 8), but so far the catasterismus ofour primaria persona seems to hang in the balance. As we saw above, Simon (1999, 35-6) has related to Ovid's instructions 2B-C {Met. 2.129-33) the passage Nonnus D. 38.256-9: unSe Tcapunte? aeia? ?6r|uovo? ?vroya kuk?,od / un?? xavam??icxc?v ??iic v Tto?DicauTt?i ?eouxp, / rc?vxe 7iapa?Xr|Xc?v 8e?oicr|U?vo? ?vroya kvkX??v, I oicxpov ?'xoi?

" 129-33... So that the correspondence of Ovid's quinqu? per arcus and Nonnus' rcevxe napaXXr\Xayv... kiSk^cov is important. But this, though it sug gests, does not prove, direct imitation, since Nonnus' phrase has appeared earlier at 2.278 and may therefore have been borrowed from a different source."

The source of "Nonnus' phrase", different or not, is not a literary work of art, but just any astronomy textbook, e.g. Cleom. 1.1.193, D.L. 7.155 (= SW7 2.651), or, discussed earlier in this paper, Gem. 5.1.

D. 38.260 is rather to be compared with hoc sit iter, manifesta rotae vestigia cernes, the last line of instructions 2B-C, Met. 2.129-33. Diggle finally compares (190): "and with Nonn. 261-6 may be compared Met. 138f.". However, instruction 2E {Met. 2.138-40) is to do with Sol's daily movement from East to West, Nonn.

Dewar's (1996, 176) comment "sodalis also refers to Cycnus location near Auriga in heaven" tallies with Olorem lying in the Milky Way in Man. 1.687 (cf. Fig. 7). The Heliades lie in the Milky Way as well, for "fratris and germanae make it clear that Claudian identifies the Hyades with the Heliades...; the Hyades shine upon the forehead of the Bull" (1996, 175); cf. Fig. 7. As to "Auriga: the Charioteer ('Hvioxo?)", Dewar comments: "The identification with Phaethon seems suspiciously late, and may even be Claudian's invention, unless Nonnus {D. 38.424?F.) and he are drawing on the same lost source". The reference to a lost Alexandrian model is a tried and tested method of putting a stop to an open-ended discussion. Nevertheless this paper offers some fresh viewpoints that could defend the presence of Phaethon's catasterismus in the Metamorphoses. Nowhere does Dewar mention Ov. Am. 3.12.37, on the basis of which Borner (1969, 320) testifies to Ovid's knowledge of Phaethon's catasterismus into Auriga (discussed above); in this same elegy line 31 de virgine fecimus ursam (we poets have turned a virgin into a bear') refers to the catasterismi of Callisto and Areas into Ursa Major and Arctophylax,61) dealt with by Ovid in Met. 2.405-530, i.e. immediately after the Phaethon episode. The point where Phaethon's chariot ride goes wrong is marked by his ignoring instruction 2E {Met. 2.138-40), as we saw above, in 171-7; the distress (176-7) of the Ox-Driver Icar(i)us, catasterised into Bootes and tied to his Plaustra (UMa), is complemented by 171-2, where the Triones (UMa), who vetito frustra temptarunt aequore tingi, remind us of the catasterismi of Callisto into UMa and Areas into the Bear-Keeper (see n. 61).

The adjoining halves of these two Signs, TaCpo? in Phaen. 714 and Ai?\)jioi in 717 (cf.

In other words, Germanicus presents us with the ccmov why Auriga represents just the driver.^ Perhaps it is to remind us of a similar telltale incompleteness of this same constellation that Ovid treats us to a detailed report on the d?bris of Phaethon's chariot in Met. 2.315-8 colla iugo eripiunt abruptaque lora relinquunt; I illic frena iacent, illic temone revulsus I axis, in hac radii fractarum parte rotarum, I sparsaque sunt late laceri vestigia currus.

This passage seems to have been neglected by recent commentators. The omission of the constel lation involved (Auriga) parallels e.g. Met. 9.271-2 quern (sc. Herculem) pater omnipotens inter cava nubila raptum I quadriiugo curru radiantibus intulit astris, where the constellation involved is Engonasin according to Hyg. Astr. 2.6.294-5 Engonasin. Hunc Eratosthenes Herculem dicit supra Draconem collocatum. As for Claud. VI. Cons. Hon. 174 lacteus... circulus Dewar (1996, 176) comments: "Ancient mythology and science offered a variety of ways in which to explain the Milky Way and its origins. These are conveniently summarized by Manilius (... 1.718 fF.) and discussed by... Goold (... 1977), p. XXXV. The most relevant for Claudian is the Pythagorean account, which held that it marked the disastrous passage taken by Phaethon in his father's chariot." Recognising instructions 2B-C {Met. 2.129-33, which matches Nonnus D. 38.256-9) as such and at Met. 2.198-9 (which matches D. 38. 264-5)65) realising that Phaethon was going to prefer the 64) Cf.

Loos ?Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 257-289 Milky Way to the frightening ecliptic (or Zodiac), Ovid's audience must have related Met. 2.129-33/instructions 2B-C to the Pythagorean66) theory about the Milky Way; it is possible that they took auriga (Met. 2.312 and 327) as a hint at Phaethons catasterismus into Auriga. "Hiding the face in grief equals going into eclipse" is Andersons (1997, 265) comment on Met. 2.329-31: pater obductos luctu miserabilis aegro I condiderat vultus et si modo credimus unum I isse diem sine sole ferunt, add ing: "Ovid exploits the double view of the Sun, as a heavenly body and as an anthropomorphic deity". After describing Clymene s grief (333-9) and that of the Heliades (340-66) and Cycnus (367-80), Ovid continues to depict how the mourning Sun suffers his loss of brilliance, thus remytholo gizing the natural phenomenon (381-5): squalidus interea genitor Phaeth ontis et expers I ipse sui decoris, quali cum deficit orbe I esse solet, lucemque odit seque ipse diemque I... I ojficiumque negat mundo. Notice the miniature word-play odit seque ipse in 383, where the two aspects merge.67) The temporary disappearance of Sol does not come as a complete sur prise, for in 117 the cornua extremae... Lunae foreshadow the possible recurrence of a solar eclipse within hours, on astronomical grounds.68) We may go even one step further. Since Sol's going into eclipse equals his grief, the very last hours of the waning Moon (117) and his son's headstrong and burning desire for the chariot (103-4) conspire to prefigure Phaethons crash. The predicted (117) and actual eclipse in 330-1 unum I isse diem sine sole and in 381-5 has been designed to help sustain the idea that the whole Phaethon episode does not exceed the duration of one (48 in diem) day. 66) por Pythagorean discussions of the Milky Way see Arist. Mete. 1.8.345al 1-26 (cf. Kidd 2004, 352-3); Pythagoras of course plays a major part in Ov. Met. 15.60-478. 67) Schrijvers (1978, 9) discusses a number of similar mergers in (Book 2 of) the Metamo rp hoses. 68) Wyatt (1977, 167) explains: "When the moon changes from a waning to a waxing moon, it usually passes a few degrees north or south of the sun. Occasionally, however, it is close enough to one of its nodes to block off the sun partly or completely; we then experi ence an eclipse of the sun. The conditions necessary for the occurrence of a solar eclipse are therefore that the moon be new and that it lie on or near the ecliptic."</page><page sequence="33">J.X.
