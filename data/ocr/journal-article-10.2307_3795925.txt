<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT VOLUME 12 OCTOBER, 1948 NUMBER 4 IN APPRECIATION OF ALDO LEOPOLD Paul L. Errington Professor Aldo Leopold, Chairman of the Department of Wildlife Manage- ment of the University of Wisconsin and a Past-President of The Wildlife Society, died of a heart attack near his summer home at Baraboo, Wisconsin, April 21, 1948, after two hours of fight- ing a bad grass fire on a neighbor's land. I shall not here write of his personal life except in relation to his career in the professional field of wildlife manage- ment. It is proper that he be singled out for the attention of the profession's mem- bers. Without belittling in any way his numerous contemporaries, it may be said that he, more than anyone else, has been responsible for the expansion and refinement of wildlife management as such is known today. As a measure of this, we need only consider the strategic positions that he held, the astounding amount of work that he did on com- mittees, the insight and diligence with which he pioneered in the field, his honesty of purpose, and his inspiring and leading of youngsters and the ma- ture alike. At a conference a couple of years ago, he was introduced as a speaker with the words, "Dean of Deans" of the profession, which might have sounded trite if applied to an- other, yet for him seemed wholly ap- propriate. I met Aldo in the spring of 1929, when he was conducting a game survey of the north-central United States for the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute. He was like- wise the Institute's representative for a series of graduate research fellowships on game birds that it was financing at land-grant universities. I held one of these fellowships for three years, be- ginning July, 1929, and it happened to be with the University of Wisconsin at Madison--also the city of the Leopold home and office. As Aldo was not ap- pointed to the University of Wisconsin staff until 1933 (a year after I had left the campus), I was never formally his student. Informally, I moved in on him, his home, and his library for hours at a stretch, talking "shop" or anything else. I wasn't a restful satellite and sometimes argued in an evening until neither of us could sleep long after going to bed, but he was gracious toward me and patient with my ex-trapper's social deficiencies. And he was kindly in- sistent that, as concerned complex nat- ural phenomena like animal fluctua- tions, one should first gather an abun- dance of facts to study rather than to put forth opinions based chiefly or solely upon outdoor experience. He appreciated the ability and sci- entific outlook of H. L. Stoddard and W. L. McAtee (notably as manifested 341</page><page sequence="2">ALDO LEOPOLD 1886-1948</page><page sequence="3">342 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 12, No. 4, OCTOBER 1948 by the southeastern researches on bob- whites and associated species), of Charles Elton, the British ecologist, of the late P. S. Lovejoy of Michigan, and of creative thinkers wherever he found them, in person or through their pub- lications. He was one of the first in the field really to see the exceptional vir- tues and promise of the untalkative young Franklin J. W. Schmidt, who died in a fire just as his work on central Wisconsin prairie chickens was becom- ing recognized. Aldo's own alertness and powers of synthesis were very evident from the beginning of my relations with him. Even when beset by great fatigue, he could somehow continue to think effec- tively. To me, one of his most impres- sive intellectual performances was dur- ing hospitalization for an unrecalled ailment: under stimulus of an impend- ing deadline, he dictated whole chapters of his "Report of a Game Survey of the North Central States," published by the Institute in 1931. Later, he was characteristically dissatisfied with its loose ends, but, irrespective of these, it stands as a remarkable achievement. In retrospect, I think not only of his personal qualities, as of the time when I knew him best, but also of his virtu- ally undertaking, at middle age, a new profession and making this his dis- tinguished life work after what are commonly a man's most plastic and productive years. Aldo was born on January 11, 1886, at Burlington, Iowa, and became in- terested in ornithology and hunting during boyhood and youth along the Mississippi River. He was trained in forestry at Yale, receiving the degree of Master of Forestry in 1909. Thereupon, he entered the U. S. Forest Service as a Forest Assistant and worked with that organization in southwestern United States until 1924, meanwhile rising through several grades to that of Chief of Operations. If we look over the first dozen titles (1916-19) in the Leopold bibliography compiled by J. J. Hickey (University of Wisconsin Wildlife Research News Let- ter, No. 35, May 3, 1948), we may see that his earlier publications were much like those any able young field natural- ist might write. They were mostly notes in The Condor and a couple of papers on game in the Journal of Forestry. One of the latter dealt with the National Forests as the last free hunting grounds of the nation. In the second dozen titles, we may see more ornithological notes and articles on game and game refuges but the future crusader against politics in conservation and misuse of resources is showing up more clearly. The listed titles from 1920 through most of 1925 are predominantly of short articles on ornithology, hunting and game management, forestry in re- lation to game management, erosion control, ecological consequences of forest fires, and wilderness values. Included is the one that I regard as his first great paper: "Wilderness as a form of land use," Journal of Land and Public Utility Economics, 1: 398-404, 1925. The latter was not his first expression of views on wilderness protection. He had published "The wilderness and its place in forest recreational policy," Journal of Forestry, 19: 718-721, 1921, and it is plain from other of his pre- vious writings that he was becoming much aware of the pricelessness of un- exploited outdoor areas. The paper on</page><page sequence="4">IN APPRECIATION OF ALDO LEoPOLD-Errington 343 wilderness as a form of land use was more than a statement or plea; it was both solidly informative and a literary contribution. I cannot say how influ- ential it proved to be, of itself; but to it, among the others, surely should be credited some of the prominence Aldo attained as an early protagonist of wilderness areas in National Forests. I read in a University of Wisconsin memorial resolution that the U. S. Forest Service subsequently designated a total of 14,000,000 acres as such areas, which are considered to "represent the most visible evidence of his [Aldo's] in- fluence on the American scene." The Leopold writings on wilderness of around a quarter-century ago are cer- tainly in the historical picture. They still nourish movements for the preser- vation of wildernesses, not alone in the United States or in North America, but over those parts of the rest of the world where men try to retain irreplaceable natural remnants. The years, 1924-28, with a transfer to Madison, Wisconsin, to become As- sociate Director of the U. S. Forest Products Laboratory, comprised some- thing of an interlude. He wrote rela- tively little for publication in this period, and what he did write usually dealt with forestry techniques and utilization or may be classed as carry- over from his life in the Southwest. Without knowledge of the details be- hind the selection of Aldo Leopold by the Sporting Arms and Manufacturers' Institute for its game surveys in 1928, one may perceive how he qualified for the job. He was experienced in admin- istration and public contacts, his in- terests in game and hunting had long been demonstrated, and he had a record of constructive accomplishment in what was then known as game management. Considering the stage of development of management as a field, he was singu- larly informed. Already, he had con- tributed to the reversal of the trends toward artificial propagation or tight- ened legal protection as panaceas for conservation ills; he did not seek com- plete abandonment of either propaga- tion or protection but rather a judicious balance for them in an incomparably more promising system based upon the ecology of the species concerned. He differentiated between passive con- servation and active management and identified management with a desirable type of husbandry of the earth and its mineral and biotic resources. He was an ecologist and a specialist in his own branch of ecology. Despite his background, the transi- tion from his old profession to his new one had its abrupt aspects. During the 20 years that he lived as a full-time practitioner of the new profession (and particularly during the first few years), he changed emphasis in several fairly distinct ways. The changes did not occur in sudden steps. They reflected his accelerating professional growth and the growth of the new field in applied ecology in which he was a "key" worker, the impacts of the man and of the field, of one upon the other. His game surveys had left him with friends among game administrators, sportsmen, and conservation workers of differing creeds and purposes over the continent. As a man of reason, he kept building on the factual foundations that he had at hand-constantly trying to uncover pertinent researches that had</page><page sequence="5">344 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 12, No. 4, OCTOBER 1948 been done or were in progress, encourag- ing further research, and doing what he could by himself. He did a tremendous amount of reading on conservation history and methods, on the long- established systems of game manage- ment of the Old World. Always com- paring systems, he tried critically to separate the desirable from the objec- tionable features of each, to dissociate sound fact from traditional assumption, to understand more of the workings of natural mechanisms. As chairman of a large committee, he did much of the work of preparing the "Report to the American Game Con- ference on an American Game Policy," Transactions of the American Game Conference, 17: 284-309, 1931, which mentioned the incompatibility of the English and American systems of game management. "Game methods; the American way," American Game, 20: 20, 29-31, 1931, was written "to express a personal view of what the policy means in its references to the Euro- pean practices." In this, the theorem was advanced that "to supply any given pro- portion of the population with any given amount of game, Europe must raise a denser stand of game per acre, and hence practice a more intensive form of game management than Amer- ica." Quoting further: "The recreational value of a head of game is inverse to the artificiality of its origin, and hence in a broad way to the intensiveness of the system of game management which produced it.... A game policy should seek . . . between the evident necessity of some management and the aesthetic desideratum of not too much .... There is nothing to prevent us from adopting the European technique for producing a game crop, and at the same time rejecting the European customs governing the intensity of the opera- tion and the European system for its harvesting and distribution. The game policy, by and large, proposes just this He went on in the same article to challenge "the ruthless suppression of predators which goes with game man- agement in most European countries. W. T. Hudson has voiced his protest over the disappearance of one predatory species after another, and his resulting contempt for the aesthetic horizon of sportsmen and sportsmanship... American protectionists mortally hate and fear the impending (?) American counterpart of this sacrifice .... "I am no prophet. I would point out, however, that stringent predator con- trol is usually unnecessary save in the upper scale of intensive game manage- ment.., .we do not need that kind of management.... This is not to say that no predator control is needed. It does mean that extensive or low-grade management--enough, let us say, to quintuple our crop--can best be achieved by light, local, seasonal and selective handling of the predator- factor. ... Is it too much to hope, then, that the group-cooperative wild life enterprise advocated by the game policy may ultimately evolve an American at- titude toward predators, based on the new biology, and recognizing the na- ture-lover and farmer, as well as the sportsman, as joint partners?" In what could almost be called a companion piece--"Game and wildlife conservation," Condor, 34: 103-106, 1932-he drew other important distinc- tions that the reader could afford to</page><page sequence="6">IN APPRECIATION OF ALDO LEOPOLD-Errington 345 study. Very significant is that between the "schools" of "hardened sportsmen" in this country, exemplified by moder- ate and extreme factions. But perhaps nowhere so well as in the concluding paragraphs of the cele- brated textbook, "Game Management" (Scribners, 1933), does he clarify his reasoning. From his pages 420-423: "The game manager manipulates animals and vegetation to produce a game crop. This, however, is only a superficial indication of his social significance. What he really labors for is to bring about a new attitude toward the land. "The economic determinist regards the land as a food-factory. Though he sings 'America' with patriotic gusto, he concedes any factory the right to be as ugly as need be, provided only that it be efficient. "There is another faction which re- gards economic productivity as an un- pleasant necessity, to be kept, like a kitchen, out of sight. Any encroachment on the 'parlor' of scenic beauty is quickly resented, sometimes in the name of conservation. "There is a third, and still smaller, minority with which game management by its very essence, is inevitably aligned. It denies that kitchens or fac- tories need be ugly, or farms lifeless, in order to be efficient. "That ugliness which the first faction welcomes as the inevitable concomitant of progress, and which the second re- gretfully accepts as a necessary com- promise, the third rejects as the clumsy result of poor technique, bunglingly applied by a human community which is morally and intellectually unequal to the consequences of its own success .... "Herein lies the social significance of game management. It promulgates no doctrine, it simply asks for land and the chance to show that farm, forest, and wild life products can be grown on it, to the mutual advantage of each other, the landowner, and of the public. It pro- poses a motivation-the love of sport- narrow enough actually to get action from human beings as now constituted, but nevertheless capable of expanding with time into that new social concept toward which conservation is groping. "In short, twenty centuries of 'prog- ress' have brought the average citizen a vote, a national anthem, a Ford, a bank account, and a high opinion of himself, but not the capacity to live in high density without befouling and denuding his environment, nor a con- viction that such capacity, rather than such density, is the true test of whether he is civilized. The practice of game management may be one of the means of developing a culture which will meet this test." His other writings for this period contain other syntheses of complex sub- ject matter, other pace-setting thought, other excellent composition; and two "heavy" essays, "The conservation ethic," Journal of Forestry, 31: 634- 643, 1933, and "Conservation eco- nomics," Ibid., 32: 537-544, 1934-two of his greatest papers. Among the major changes in professional emphasis to be detected in his publications, 1929-35, is one from the survey to the intensive method of research and another from game management for shooting to far broader versions of management in- volving native prairie flowers and song- birds as well as game and game habitats. These changes doubtless may be</page><page sequence="7">346 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 12, No. 4, OCTOBER 1948 ascribed partly to changed conditions of employment, notwithstanding which there is plenty of evidence that Aldo's own inclinations led him into them. In 1935, he studied German game and forest management under a Carl Schurz Travelling Fellowship, publish- ing his comparisons and conclusions chiefly during the next year: the two- part paper, "Deer and Dauerwald in Germany," Journal of Forestry, 34: 366-375, 460-466, and semipopular articles in Bird-Lore and American Wildlife. This trip, by its contrasts, in- tensified his concern for threatened out- door values-see, for example, the in- troduction to the Bird-Lore article, "Naturschutz in Germany," in which he depicted the "nostalgia of the Ger- man for wildness, as distinguished from mere forests or mere game.... We Americans yearn for more deer and more pines, and we shall probably get them. But do we realize that to get them, as the Germans have, at the ex- pense of their wild environment and their wild enemies, is to get very little indeed?" We have in 1937 the appearance of superbly written short essays, combin- ing ecology and management and a philosophy of esthetics. "Conserva- tionist in Mexico" and "Marshland elegy," both appearing in American Forests (43: 118-120, 146, and 472- 474), are, I feel, among the first of the fully mature Leopoldian essays of this type. More came out in subsequent years, such as: "Conservation esthetic," Bird-Lore, 40: 101-109, 1938, "A biotic view of land," Journal of Forestry, 37: 727-730, 1939, "Escudilla," American Forests, 46: 539-540, 1940, "Song of the Gavilan," Journal of Wildlife Manage- ment, 4: 329-331, 1940, "Cheat takes over," The Land, 1: 310-313, 1941, "The last stand," Outdoor America, 7(7): 8-9, 1942, "The Flambeau," American Forests, 49: 12-14, 47, 1943, "Wildlife in American culture," Journal of Wildlife Management, 7: 1-6, 1943, "The green lagoons," American Forests 51: 376-377, 414, 1945, and "The ecological conscience," Bulletin of the Garden Club of America, September: 46-53, 1947. A book of his essays, in- cluding his revisions of some of the above, is to be published in 1949 by Oxford University Press, N. Y. To some degree, his later publications reflect changed emphasis, as from ad- vocating monetary or other economic incentives for management to attempt- ing to inculcate appreciation for cul- tural values. They also indicate a change in emphasis from training of specialists to liberal education as a means to management ends. Aldo worked for long-term "deep-digging" research up to the time of his death, but he saw long before then that the prob- lems of sane land use required more than the attention of professionals. There had to be better motivated, bet- ter directed, and better sustained par- ticipation by the public if what was good in management was to become a living practice. As scientist or educator, he was any- thing but jealous of professional prerog- atives. From "Wildlife in American Culture" (his page 5): "Wildlife research started as a pro- fessional priestcraft. The more difficult or laborious problems must remain in professional hands, but there are plenty of problems suitable for all grades of amateurs.... Ornithology, mammal-</page><page sequence="8">IN APPRECIATION OF ALDO LEoPOLD-Errington 347 ogy, and botany, as now known to most amateurs, are but kindergarten games compared with researches in these fields. The real game is decoding the messages written on the face of the land.... "Few people can become enthusiastic about research as a sport because the whole structure of biological education is aimed to perpetuate the professional research monopoly. To the amateur is allotted only make-believe voyages of discovery, the chance to verify what professional authority already knows. This is false; the case of Margaret Nice proves what a really enterprising amateur can do. . . . " (He delighted in the ornithological investigations of Mrs. Nice, which in volume and quality surpassed so much of the work of the professionals.) Long ago, he had likened the titles of academic courses to labels on bottles having highly variable contents; and, coming from him as a teacher of academic coursework, his paper, "The role of wildlife in a liberal education" (Transactions of the North American Wildlife Conference, 7: 485-489, 1942) has quotable paragraphs: "Liberal education in wildlife is not merely a dilute dosage of technical edu- cation. It calls for somewhat different teaching materials and sometimes even different teachers. The objective is to teach the student to see the land, to understand what he sees, and enjoy what he understands. I say land rather than wildlife, because wildlife cannot be understood without understanding the landscape as a whole. Such teaching could well be called land ecology rather than wildlife, and could serve very broad educational purposes. "Perhaps the most important of these purposes is to teach the student how to put the sciences together in order to use them. All the sciences and arts are taught as if they were separate. They are separate only in the classroom. Step out on the campus and they are immediately fused. Land ecology is putting the sciences and arts together for the purpose of understanding our environment .... "There is no need to persuade the student of land ecology that ma- chines to dominate the land are useful only while there is a healthy land to use them on, and that land-health is possibly dependent upon land-member- ship, that is that a flora and fauna too severely simplified or modified might not tick as well as the original. He can see for himself that there is no such thing as good or bad species; a species may get out of hand, but to terminate its membership in the land by human fiat is the last word in anthropomorphic arrogance." From the paper, "Wildlife in Ameri- can culture": "Ecology is now teaching us to search in animal populations for analogies to our own problems. The ability to perceive these, and to ap- praise them critically, is the woodcraft of the future." Aldo's personal contacts with stu- dents were quite evidently similar to what they had been with me during his game survey years. I learned from "grapevine" that he exhorted them to write carefully, to revise their manu- scripts over and over until organized and smooth, to strive for the maximum simplicity consistent with the subjects written upon. The summer after leaving Wisconsin, I brought back to him a</page><page sequence="9">348 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 12, No. 4, OCTOBER 1948 medium-length manuscript on the dif- ferent versions of which I had labored for four months and which I considered ready for the editor; we worked for two days at high pressure, and it took six weeks more of revision to incorporate his suggestions-and that wasn't any too long! His students, too, could hardly have missed his fairness and what Elton (letter of May 4, 1948) called a "special sort of integrity." My data were always mine, and I have no doubt that his students were assured that their data were theirs and that they could as a matter of course expect a reasonable amount of professorial guidance in handling the same-actually, he was generous with his time to the extent that it frequently meant hardship to him. Nor do I doubt that at least his more mature students respected his in- tellectual humility. I remember other things about him from the earlier years. I remember him as a man in the personal crisis of being without income for months during 1932 and 1933 in the worst of the De- pression. He took this punishment most creditably, kept up the standard of living of his family as well as cir- cumstances allowed, worked on the manuscript of "Game Management," and made plans with courage and real- ism. He was offered desirable positions, including a professorship at a prominent state college, but these would have en- tailed moving his home from Madison, which he was reluctant to do. Then, the University of Wisconsin established its first Chair of Game Management, later becoming the Department of Wildlife Management. In appraising Aldo's accomplish- ments, I would rate the literary essays as the greatest. They reflect him and his thoughts, what McAtee (letter of May 3, 1948 to R. A. McCabe) referred to as "his lucid and stimulating discussions in the conservation field. . . his ever growing power as a writer." In this, his own field of excellence, I don't think that anyone else may be compared with him. His scientific best is, I think, illus- trated by his papers on forest game and land use. These have appeared in widely scattered journals, but the Journal of Forestry drew the larger proportion. His personal inspiration of others is hard to do justice to, whether this was in routine dealings with students or public, or in strategic committee work. As regards his committee work alone, one must consider not only the dozens of committees of scientific societies and conservation organizations to which he was appointed but also those of extraor- dinary prestige and importance, such as his chairmanship of the committee on wildlife studies of the National Re- search Council. Shortly before his death he had been asked by Secretary of State Marshall to be a discussion chair- man at the Inter-American Conference on Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources and by Secretary of the In- terior Krug to serve on the Advisory Committee on American Participation at the United Nations Scientific Con- ference on Conservation and Utiliza- tion of Resources. In order to write this memorial as re- flectively as I could, I waited until my vacation to do it, to do the writing in a simple log dwelling house near one of National Forests.</page><page sequence="10">IN APPRECIATION OF ALDO LEoPOLD--Errington 349 A porcupine-girdled pine top may be seen through the front windows, and just out of sight hang the remaining sticks of a goshawk nest that had young in it twelve summers ago. Three species of grouse live along the creek that comes down out of the canyon. If one looks, one may easily find deer and bear "sign" and, in the hours of darkness, coyotes howl. The air smells richly of pine and sage. The property on which the log house is situated contributes to the livelihood of people. Along with the "sign" of native animals is some of horses and cattle. Some land is tilled and some yields hay. Yet, the tract surrounding the house is wild and it is intentionally kept so. We are getting rid of the old stumps and other axe-marked wood; our two boys bring it in to burn in the box stove. A large yellow pine with weakened base that we once had to take down to protect the house is an excep- tion: its trunk will be left where it fell, axe and saw cuts and all, ungrudgingly. For a ruffed grouse has accepted it as a drumming log, and, in the twilight of evening or early morning, if careful, the family may watch and hear the muffled beating of wings-that "numenon" of northern woodlands. This, I am sure, Aldo would have approved as hus- bandry. To the west, the National Forest be- gins. Less than ten miles away is timber- line and, below that, are still-occupied retreats of those much reduced prize fur-bearers, the martens. In the can- yons farther below, glacial waters pour over and between boulders, and there are bobcat or lynx tracks in the mud where a game trail leads around a beaver pond. Deep in the forest are said to be a few grizzly bears and even cougars. The thought of Aldo in connection with this mountain wilderness seems ap- propriate, though I doubt that he had ever seen it. The love he felt for the out- of-doors and the things that belonged in it was not a matter of geographical boundaries, nor confined to particular settings. In his essay, "Conservation esthetic," he wrote: "To those devoid of imagination, a blank space on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part. (Is my share in Alaska worthless to me because I shall never go there? Do I need a road to show me the Arctic prairies, the goose pastures of the Yukon, the Kodiak bear, the sheep meadows behindMcKinley?)" Very probably one so distinguished will be honored posthumously in many ways. There is talk of a memorial fel- lowship and there may be other move- ments to perpetuate his name and ideals. Assuredly, these should be en- couraged and supported to the extent that they are well-conceived. We must not mock honesty with gestures. I can imagine his gentle scorn at the thought of anything like elaborate statuary in his memory while despoliation and wastage of the land and its biota con- tinue as usual. For, his greatness, as I regard it, lay in the fact that he loved and worked and fought for something greater than himself or any other man. He knew of the peace that outdoor values may give to receptive minds and he wanted those values safeguarded and increased for others as well as for himself. However else it may be designated, his concept of what is worth living in human life</page><page sequence="11">350 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 12, No. 4, OCTOBER 1948 has a certain agelessness to it, a solidar- ity beyond the creative power of any one man. His sense of responsibility and decency is likewise much more than the byproduct of any one man's thinking. Let no one do him the disservice of fostering Leopoldian legends or Leo- poldian dogmas. Knowing him as I have, I can say that he would not wish them to arise from his having lived. He would not wish to have imputed to him any qualities or abilities that he did not possess. He was only a mortal man, but a highly civilized and intelligent one withal, literate and--most fortunately --articulate in those ways necessary to convert intentions into leadership. In some respects, we might look upon wild beauty, as such, whether in back yard or in remote places, a most fitting memorial to him and to his kind. As his professional colleagues, let us recognize our obligations to a philosophy of living that has goodness in it beyond selfish objectives; and, moreover, that we honor him according to the way we, ourselves, live and lead.</page></plain_text>
