Of course, writing is normally regarded as humanising rather than animalizing, since it is language that supposedly distinguishes the human species from dumb animals and mindless mechanisms. Or so we like to think, despite increasing evidence that primates can communicate symbolically, or that computers can out-verbalize their own inventors. My contention is that 'Circe' opens up another scene, comparable to the Freudian unconscious, in which language coalesces vs ith the animal and the mechanical. In the topsy-turvy dreamscape of `Circe', human beings change places with animals and machines, each of which 'speaks in its own way', as Bloom says of the printing press in the 'Aeolus' episode. Human superiority is exposed as a delusion, based on the repression of the animal and the mechanical. repressions that return with a vengeance in 'Circe' to overthrow the baseless fabric of humanity.

I Men with tough flesh do not have much intelligence. I The flesh is the intermediary for the sense of touch.' In the last phrase Joyce substitutes touch for though[t], which is crossed out. 11 Tim Ingold, ed., What is an Animal (London, 1988), 3 consciousness, free will those 4wideawake' attributes supposed to elevate the human over the inhuman give way to animal drives and mechanical compulsions, while language, rather than transcending those automatisms, dances to their epileptic rhythm,6 If language automatizes, it also annualizes insofar as it subjects the mind to the body, to the muscles of the mouth and hand, as well as to mechanical prostheses such as pen or type that make machines out of those muscles. In Joyce's 'Circe', as in Lacanian psychoanalysis, the speaking subject is seized in a function whose exercise grasps it', entrammelled in the blind machinery of language, which goes on speaking whethe there is anyone to mouth the words or not.7 But 'Circe is not the only episode to challenge the supremacy of man; throughout Ulysses, machines and animals encroach upon the heroes' consciousness, fraying the edges of the human universe. Among the animals that Bloom and Stephen encounter or imagine on 16 June 1904 is the sacrificial ox, whose image haunts Bloom's reveries throughout the day. The ox is not a newcomer to Joyce's fiction.; remember that Stephen Dedalus's journey in A Portrait of the Artist begins with the story of baby tuckens and the moocow.. Moreover Joyce's surprising solicitude for oxen extends beyond his fiction, inspiring two of his rare forays int0 journalism, both concerned with contemporary farming practices, whose brutalities evoke an undercurrent of disquiet in Ulysses. Such practices, according to Jacques Derrida, reveal the 'unprecedented proportions of the subjection Of the animal' that has transpired in the last two centuries. Derrida's point is made in different terms by 1. M. Coetzee's fictional novelist Elizabeth Costello, the militantly vegetarian author of a modern classic called 7 Eccles Street, described as a re-writing of Ulysses from the perspective of Molly Bloom. Making use of Derrida's and Coetzee's work on animals, the first part of this essay attempts to re envisage Ulysses from the perspective of oxen. Next to be consiclet-ed is the, role that Joyce assigns to cats arid dogs, those pets anititaux familiers that 'blur the ,bound'ati, between human and itihumau. challenging this boundary, Joyce is joining a, `theri-ophilic' or beast-admiring philosophical tradition stretching back through Rousseau arid VoVaire;to Renaissance scholars such as Montaigne and Giovanni Battista Gelli, the author' of a series of dialogues called' 'Circe' (1549; English translation '17(2), in which the men that Homer's Circe converted into animals insist on the superiority of beasts to hurnankind.8 After a brief sketch of Montaig,ne's and Gelli's defences of the animal, the final section of this essay retairris. to Joyce's 'Circe', in which language is revealed as the witch that changes human beings into animal-machines. Most readers, when asked about the role of animals in Ulysses, immediately think of Bloom's cat, who is given the first speech in the Calypso' episode: `Mrkgnaor This unpronounceable transliteration of the cat's meow accentuates the otherness of aninials, their resistance to the anthropomorphic impulses of Bloom, who sweet-talks his pet car in lieu ofhis unfaithful wife upstairs. Through this displaced tenderness. Morn transforms the cat into a sphinx, half-cat, half-woman, while also revealing a desire to transform his women into cats. The latter transformation takes place in Ithaca', when the narrator identifies Mitty Bloom with a `neckarching mousewatching earwashing hearthdrearning car'. U, 17.896-9061 Moreover, the cat's 'Mrkgnao', placed at the beginning of Bloom's odyssey, alerts the reader to the fact that the 'gelid light and air' of 7 Eccles Street are fess transparent than they seem.

I U, 3.456-571 'Mrkgnao' could therefore be understood as a password to the 'semiotic' underside of Joyce's novel, to the sounds that threaten to overwhelm the sense of words, dissolving meaning in a swell of wavespeech.9. Inhuman. voices the waves', the cat's reveal that words themselves are sphinxes, hybrids of the animal, the human, and the inorganic, for speech is fashioned out of an acoustic substrate that we share with animals, as well as with machinery and waves. Unliving voices the sea howl arid the sea yelp, the 'slit' of paper spewed out of the printing press all these speak in their own way, yet participate in the same orchestration as the human voices of Ulysses. Joyce's interest in the murky division between man and animal reaches back to his Paris notebooks of 1904, where he makes careful notes on Aristotle's theory of the animals, especially the philosoPher's idea that good minds depend upon thin skin, the human mind growing stronger in proportion to the weakness of the human hide, its naked porosity to influence.10 With this ingenious case for the cognitive benefits of furlessness, Aristotle launched philosophy on a ceaseless quest for the quintessence of humanity, the unique endowment that ensures man's superiority over the animals, be it reason, language, consciousness, free will, or opposed thumbs. In the history of philosophy, Tim IngoId has observed, 'Every attribute that it is claimed we uniquely have, the animal is consequently supposed to lack; thus, the generic concept of 'anitnal' is negatively constituted by the sum of these deficiencies.'it Nonetheless, a theriophilic counter-tradition in philosophy, epitomized in Montaigne's Apology for Raymond Selland, relentlessly attacks this human arrogance. This tradition persists in. animal rights philosophy today, which tends to blame Descartes's conception of the animal machine for all the crimes inflicted by humanity on other species, crimes that now endanger the survival of the planet, not to mention the welfare of our fellow beasts.a The proposition I shall test, however, is that Joyce's 'Circe' out-Descartes Descartes, in so far as it endorses the Cartesian conception of the body as an animal-automaton, but extends this automatism to,the human mind, laying bare the animal-machinery of consciousness .11 fl Aker smoviiqr Owen in Ulysses In challenging the distinction between the human and the animal, Joyce is revisiting a theme in Homer's Odyssey, where this distinction has to be reinstated every time Odysseus arrives at a new island and must determine whether the inhabitants are men or beasts or something monstrous in between. The litmus test is hospitality: strangers who feed their guests are human, whereas those who eat their guests are monsters. What makes them monsters, however, is the fact that they are cannibals, which means they must be human, not animal. In the land of the Lestrygonians. Odysseus sends forth scouts to determine 'what rnen, eaters of bread, might live here ill this country', but the inhabitants prove to be eaters of men; their king wastes ,ito time in barbecuing Odysseus's men for 'ioylo6 feasting', while their queen has grown big as a mountain peak' on this barbarous diet.1.4. Yet despite their gigantism, the Lestrygonians are depicted as humanoid; so are the Cyclops, despite their monocrilarity: and even Scylla is humanized, in that she is named and endowed with motiveless malignity, which identifies her as .a cannibal rather than a random terror of the sea.

Photograph: Neva Johnson 0 RTE Stills Library In The Odyssey this riddle might be restated in the following terms: when is a man-eater not a cannibal How monstrous must a man-eater become in order to be changed into an animal, a carnivore rather than a cannibal Homer's monsters are liminal figures, neither human nor inhuman, which undermine the boundary between these categories. In Joyce's Ulysses, this boundary is undermined by animals, whose constant incursions into hearth and mind compromise the integrity of homo sapiens. In the words of the catechistic narrator of 'Ithaca', 'the door of egress' that expels the animal from human life becomes a 'door of ingress' for Bloom's cat, and for many other animals that oscillate across the threshold between human and inhuman. [U, 17.1034 351 Animals get under Bloom's skin almost literally in his crises of compassion for them; when he thinks about 'pain to the animal' the famished gull, the bleating sheep, the 'staggering bob', the tortured circus animal he suffers their agonies by proxy. [U, 8.722-241 Thus animals invade the human body, infecting it with their afflictions and desires: in 'Hades' we learn that Rudy Bloom was conceived when Molly was aroused by the sight of two dogs copulating.

M. Coetzee, Elizabeth Costello (London, 2003), 102-03. 17 JJ, 476. In Finnegans Wake, Shem inherits Joyce's aversion towards beef: 'None of your inchthick blueblooded Balaclava fried-at-belief stakes ... all aswim in a swamp of bogoakgravy for that greekenhearted yuder. [FW, 170.32 171 .11 A `greekenhearted cosmospolitan', brokenhearted by Ireland's self-betrayals, Shem refuses to swallow the steak of Irish nationalism, or to be burned at the stake for such beliefs. Shem's abstinence from steaks also harks back to Bloom, another `greekenhearted yude', who suffers nausea at the sight of beef and beefeaters in the `Lestrygonians' episode. the 'Cyclops' episode, the Citizen's dog Garryowen is the only nationalist in the pub who understands his master's Irish. In Bloom's case, animality becomes contagious: he can scarcely contemplate an animal without becoming one. In this sense he resembles Joyce himself, who felt that 'Circe' was changing him into an animal. The only episode besides 'Circe' to give Joyce so much trouble was the fourteenth chapter, 'Oxen of the Sun' it has given lots of trouble to his readers too. In both chapters, Joyce attributed his difficulties to the animal: to the animalizing magic of the 'Circe' episode, and to the 'moving moaning multitude' of cattle unleashed in the 'Oxen of the Sun'. Prior to their eponymous episode, oxen make many cameo appearances on 16 June 1904. In 'Telemachus', oxen feature in the form of breakfast milk, delivered by a bovine peasant woman; in 'Nestor', Mr. Deasy ropes Stephen into his campaign for vaccinating.oxen afflicted with foot-and mouth disease; in 'Hades' a drove of cattle brings the funeral cortege to a halt, reminding Bloom that 'tomorrow is killing day' in the 'dead meat trade'; in Testrygonians' Bloom fantasizes about ghostly oxen pursuing their devourers into eternity. Finally, 'Oxen of the Sun' revisits Homer's fable of imperialism in which Odysseus's men invade the island of Thrinacia and exterminate all the brutes that is, the oxen sacred to the sun-god Helios.16 [U, 14.326-28 On 25 February 1920 Joyce told his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver that the 'Oxen of the Sun' was 'the most difficult episode in an odyssey ... both to interpret and to execute'. [SL, 249 Judging by his complaints to correspondents, Joyce found the labour of writing 'Oxen' almost as unbearable as Mina Purefoy's labour, which takes place off-stage in the Holles Street Maternity Hospital, while Buck Mulligan and his medical cronies crack jokes about 'woman's woe' in childbirth. Joyce laboured like the proverbial ox to narrate this skimpy story in all the literary styles of the English language, although notably excluding any female authors only the 'eared wombs' of the male imagination feature in this stylistic parthenogenesis. By his own account, Joyce was so possessed by his theme that he felt the oxen were everywhere, virtually stampeding on his consciousness, while he was being forced to eat them. It was difficult to sit down to a meal without feeling his stomach turn.17 Exhausted by the thousand hours he had devoted to the episode, he insisted that Budgen visit him in Trieste, promising to make him sick with oxen too: 'You will hear (till you get sick the bloody Oxen of the bloody Sun.' It is curious that this statement could refer either to the writing or to the slaughter of the oxen, as if the act of writing were a form of bloodletting. `Bloodys' continue to bespatter Joyce's comments on the episode: in May of the same year he announced to Budgen that 'The oxen of the bloody bleeding sun are finished', a message that could be read as a graphic rendition of the sacrilege committed on the island of Thrinacia. [Jj, 476 Of course, the reader is likely to object that Joyce's oxen are metaphors, not animals, while his bloodys are meaningless expletives, but his visceral reactions suggest otherwise. Do metaphors stampede Nietzsche might say yes, since he famously defined truth as a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms but Joyce's oxen strain to be taken literally, in all their bloody bleeding physicality.18 The idea of the episode, according to Joyce, was 'the crime committed against fecundity by sterilizing the act of coition'. [SL, 251 Are we to conclude that Joyce was pro-life, like the current bloodthirsty president of the United States No, because Joyce's reverence for life includes the living, not just the unborn and the undead. In 'Oxen of the Sun' Stephen jokes about 'those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise', referring to the millions of potential lives wiped out with 79</page><page sequence="7">HELD DAY REVIEW 18 See Nietzsche, 1-.)st Troth and Lies in allonimral Sense', itr'Nietzsche4 Philosophy and Truth: Selections from Nietzsche-'s Notebooks of the Early 1870s, trans.

[U, In 1906 Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a horrifying expose of the Chicago Meat industry, in which huge mounds of rat infested rotting,flesh were regularly recycled, into sausages, along with human fingers frequently cut off in the production process. 'It was from the Chicago stockyards that the Nazis learned how to process bodies,' claims Coetzee's Elizabeth Costello.11 In 'Hades', Bloom also ponders the 'byproducts of the slaughterhouses', the soap and margarine extracted,out of 'hide, hair, horns', after the finest specimens of Irish oxen have been processed into `Roastbeef for old England'.' 6.393-97 Jacques Derrida-, whose lifelong critique of the anthropocentrisin of Western culture culminated in a passionate meditation on the sufferings of animals, argues that the last two centuries have swept away traditional methods.of farming, breeding, fattening, working, and killing animals. Those techniques have now been superseded by the industrialization of animal meat, mass-production of animdls for the laboratory, increasingly audacious manipulations of the genome, ubiquitous artificial insemination, genetic cross breeding, and cloning. All these practices could be described as crimes against fecundity, committed 'in the service of a certain being and the so-called ',human well being of man'. Whatever conclusions one draws, Derrida insists, 'no one can deny the unprecedented proportions of this subjection of the animal'.21 This is true, although Derrida overlooks the fact that this subjection has been accompanied by an equally intensified concern for animal welfare, evidenced by the foundation of the ASPCA in the United States (1866), the RSPCA in Britain (1892), along with countless campaigns against cruelty,</page><page sequence="8">ULYSSES 23,Derrida,`Animal that Therefore I Am', 394 24 Coetzee, Elizabeth Costello, 65 25 Steil, 326; Letters, vol. 2, MA-James Joyce, 'Politics and Cattle Disease' (1912), in James Joyce: The Critical Writings, ed.

ILl, 7.403f Yet iust as Ireland is described by Stephen as an 'old sow that eats her farrow', so. ihe Irish are depicted in Ulysses as Icine-eating kin, or oxen-eating oxen: hence the beef-eaters in gurton's restaurant are portrayed as cannibals, the latter-day equivalent of Homer's Lestrygonians.Z7 If the Engtish are characterized by 'beer, beef, business, bilks, bulldogs, battteships, buggery arid bishops', the Irish are portrayed as cannibal cattle, like the mad cows of the recent BSE crisis. !U, 14.1459 601 Was Joyce an animal-rights activist before the fact -Far from it: apart frorn-his. two articles on cattle, his mild curiosity about the family cat, and his phobias tOwards Perche&amp;On high stocis,by-the bar, hats shoved,badc,ar the 'tables calling for rnore-treatl.tio charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of5Sloppy foOd, their eyes bulging; wiping , wefied. moustaches.

Patricia Meyerowiti (Harrnondsworth, 1984), 149. Michael Moon informs me that Stein's spin on the Cartesian cogito derives from a disturbing nursery rhyme, which was quoted by Josiah Royce in a lecture on Kant that Stein attended as an undergraduate at Radcliffe. In the nursery rhyme, a little woman goes to the market to sell eggs, but falls asleep in the road, where a pedlar cuts off her petticoats. When she wakes up, she no longer knows who or where she is: 'Lawk a mercy o me, This is none of But if this be I As I do hope it be, /1 have a little dog at home And he knows me; If it be I, He'll wag his little tail, I And if it be not I He'll loudly bark and wair When she returns home, the dog barks, and she concludes, This is none of P: Iona Opie and Peter Opie, eds., The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford, 1997), 514. In other words, I am not I because my little dog does not know me. alimentary virtues of vegetarianism while continuing to consume animal flesh, and inveighs against the iniquities of hunting while extolling the virtues of the hunter. Particiilacly Bloomian is Rousseau's argument that human pity originates in the ability to change into an animal: 'how do we let ourselves be moved by pity', he demands, 'if not by transporting_ourselves outside of ourselves and identifying with the suffering animal, by leaving, as it were, our own being to take on its being. It is not in ourselves, it is in him that we suffer:ZS In the same way, Bloom changes into every animal he pities; compassion is his passport to metempsychosis. The case of Rousseau .belies the assumption, promulgated in much literature on animal ethics, that Descartes's notion of the animal machine has stifled every other philosophical conception of the animal. In literary criticism, Descartes-bashing remains a popular sport among poststructuralists and our successors, the cogito being vilified as the root of every misconception of the human subject. Not only does this vilification rely on a limited understanding of Descartes, but it grossly exaggerates the influence of philosophers on human lives. A seventeenth-century farmer was more likely Tot to beat his horse because he knew the biblical proverb 'a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast' Wroverbs 12.10], than to beat his horse becaus'e he had accepted Descartes's doctrine of the animal-machine; indeed, it could be argued that Descartes's doctrine might prevent such cruelty, since no purpose could be served by inflicting blows on an insentient mechanism. Even in his own day, Descartes's disciples were greatly outnumbered by those who found his views on animals preposterous, including the Catholic Church: For every Cartesian who denied consciousness to animals, a dozen others insisted on animals' capacity to love, to learn, to feel, and most of all, to suffer. 'What a pitiful, what a sorry thing to have said that animals are machines bereft of understanding and feeling,' Voltaire expostulates in his entry on Beasts' in the Philosophical Dictionary: Barbarians seize Ethel dog who so prodigiously surpasses man in friendship. They nail him to a table and dissect him alive to show you the mesenteric veins. You discover in him all the same organs of feeling that you possess. Answer me, mechanist, has nature arranged all the springs ot feeling in this animal in order that he should not feel Does he have nerves to he impassive Do not assume that nature presents this impertinent contradiction," Here Voltaire, like animal-rights advocates today, blames the Cartesian 'machinists' for the horrors of vivisection, hat this is to mistake the symptom for the cause In Voltaire's era, as in ours, economic interests, rather than the lonely meditations of philosophers, probably account for most barbarity to animals. Returning to the twentieth century, _Joyce's contemporary Gertrude Stein counters Descartes with a theriophilic version of the cogito: am 1 because my little dog knows me:31 If the depends upon the knowledge of a little dog, this is not a neuter, neutral, universal I, but a contingent subject rooted in relations with human and inhuman others Stein may be thinking of the recognition scene in Book XVII of Homer's Odyssey, when Odysseus returns to Ithaca disguised as a beggar, and his old dog Argus, having waited rwenty years for this homecoming, wags his tail and dies. What the .dog knows is also the subject of Virginia Woolf's Hush (1933), her biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's much-kidnapped pooch, while Kafka writes himself into the body of a hug, a rodent, and a singing dog. in the urban fictions of modernism, the most prevalent representatives of animality are pets and vermin, although the oxen in the streets of</page><page sequence="11">HELD REViEVY Joyce's Doiblin indicate the ,persistetice of a ilfrA 1 NOM ittvi raiTconomny, within-,t he capitaL )fet pets and vermin:, like Homeric monsters. are lintinal figure.s that confound the distigctitotchotween the krunnati and the animal.

Like a player piano, the ataxic body dances by itself, shaken by its own machinery, defying the governance of consciousness. Ataxic symptoms present themselves as soon as 'Circe' begins, when 'a deaf mute idiot, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance'. Soon afterwards Bloom walks stiffly onto the stage, convulsed by an ataxic cramp: The stiff walk. ... That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. ... Why Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (he closes his eyes an instant Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. [U, 15.207-10 Here Bloom attributes 'that awful cramp' to 'something poisonous I ate', 'probably lost cattle', meaning cattle slaughtered illegally or horsemeat marketed as beef these representing modern versions of the sacrilege against the sacred oxen. Eating this 'lost cattle' has branded Bloom with the 'mark of the beast', singling him out for punishment like the killers of the oxen of the sun. Feeling 'a bit light in the head', he attributes this dizziness to a 'monthly or effect of the other', in which the noun 'monthly' could refer either to a menstrual period (an effect of the other gender or to a lunar irruption of lycanthropy (an effect of the other animal). 'The stiff walk' refers to Bloom's spastic locomotor apparatus, as well as playing on the notion of a `stiffy' or erection. But the phrase could also mean the dead come back to life. In this episode, 'the stiff' do indeed rise again, but as in Bloom's daytime vision of the resurrection of the body, with 'every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps', the 'rusty pumps' that operate the body's animal machinery are all 'bunged up'.

In 'Circe', Bloom's earlier observation, that 'everything speaks in its own way', erupts into a nightmare, in which dead mechanisms and dumb animals seize the power of speech, elbowing human speakers off the stage. Any rigid separation between man and beast is overthrown in the opening scene, when lovers tryst among the animals, heading 'round behind the stable'. 1U, 15.10-131 Whistles call and answer. THE CALL Wait, my love, and I'll be with you. THE ANSWER Round behind the stable. Socrates', picturing the great men's wives as shrews and hens, and claims that 'the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love', becoming animal in order to be ridden by a dominatrix. 1U, 353.111-121 In the psychodynamics of this episode, to be -changed into an animal is equivalent to being changed into a woman, born to be bitted, bridled, and mounted. Thus Bloom turns into a pig-woman in order to be whipped as a circus animal by Bello, the whoremistress who turns into a man. In these sadomasochistic performances the world turns upsidedown, yet although men change places with women and humans with animals, the hierarchy of cruelty and suffering remains intact. The image of the stable recalls Christ's nativity among the animals, a myth suggesting that the saviour is comprised of beast as well as man and god. Meanwhile the lovers' calls and answers become dramatis personae in their own right, independent of the callers and the answerers. The implication is that language speaks itself, like a player piano, whether there is anyone to mouth the words or not. Recalling Lacan's appropriately convoluted formulation, the human speaker is seized 'in a function whose exercise grasps it,' reduced to the status of an actor in a script, or the dummy of a maniac ventriloquist. Nora Barnacle Joyce once said of her husband's anxiety of influence: `Ah, there's only one man he's got to get the better of now, and that's that Shakespeare!'" In 'Circe' Joyce gets the better of Shakespeare by changing him into an animal. Shakespeare grows antlers, his beardless face appearing in the mirror crowned by the antlered hat-rack in the brothel; Bloom and Stephen, gazing in this mirror, merge into Shakespeare's physiognomy, putting on his cuckold's horns. Stephen speaks of `shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked It is not clear that Joyce intends to overthrow this hierarchy; in fact it could be argued that he reaffirms the supremacy of man by enabling Bloom to purge himself of fantasies of subjugation. 'Circe' could be read as an exorcism in which Bloom and Stephen externalize their femininity in a desperate effort to get rid of it, Bloom by acting out the role of the humiliated pig woman, Stephen by digging up his mother and promptly digging her back in again. At the climax of the episode he raises his phallic ashplant like a wand to shoo his mother's spectre back to hell. Yet the ritual element of 'Circe' suggests that this exorcism must be constantly repeated in order to maintain the boundary between man and woman, man and beast for the transcendence of the human over the inhuman is always incomplete. In particular, 'Circe' demonstrates that language, supposedly unique to human beings, is always fastened to a dying animal. This animality reasserts itself in metaphors, which are taken literally in 'Circe', in accordance with the Freudian principle that dreams treat words as things. Animal metaphors trigger off Circean transformations: a phrase like `go the whole 90</page><page sequence="18">ULYSSES 49 Freud, 'A Difficulty in the Path of Psycho Analysis' 119171, Works, vol. 27, 140 50 Ella Sharpe, 'Psycho physical Problems Revealed in Language: An Examination of Metaphor', in Collected Papers on Psycho Analysis (London, 1950), 158 hog' conjures up a hog; brutish men materialize as brutes.

THE MALE BRUTES (exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro Good [U, 15.2014-20 This passage relies on the reader's memory of 'Wandering Rocks', where Bloom's wandering eye is arrested by the steamy novel Sweets of Sin, with its memorable image of the sable-wrapped woman's 'heaving embonpoint'. [U, 10.616 While reading this soft porn, Bloom undergoes a kind of mental orgasm, culminating in the choked ejaculation 'Sulphur dung of lions!'. [U, 10.623 'Circe' punishes Bloom for these sulphurous fantasies by presenting them as lions, 'faintly roaring'. This animalization gives literal form to the 'brutishness' of sexuality, which reduces man and beast to the same level. But it also reveals the animality enshrined in metaphor, bringing forth the literal 'brute' ramping in the loosebox of metaphoric 'brutishness'. The implication is that human supremacy over the animal is constantly sabotaged by metaphor, by the bestiary of figurative speech; hence the language of reason is obliged to banish metaphor in order to cordon off the beast. animal, and the mechanical. Language, far from transcending the body, is presented as a form of discharge, comparable to the hallucinations of the Freudian dream, in which impulses discharge themselves as spectacles. As in `Circe', these spectacles arise out of the metaphoric substratum of language, which retains the 'mark of the beast,' memorializing our rejected animality. 'A child', Freud points out, 'can see no difference between his own nature and that of animals ... Not until he is grown up does he become so far estranged from animals as to use their names in vilification for human beings.'49 Metaphor recalls the period before this estrangement has occurred, when children still perceive themselves as animals. The psychoanalyst Ella Freeman Sharpe has proposed that metaphor, as the earliest form of figurative speech, develops in tandem with control of bowel and bladder, providing a substitute avenue for discharge. Yet metaphor retains the imprint of the bodily experiences that it displaces, experiences that human beings share with animals. Hence Sharpe argues that a patient who says, 'I have been bleating about my own lamentable condition', is asking the analyst to perceive him as a bleating lamb.S This is the same kind of metaphoric magic that operates in 'Circe', where brutislr men materialize as brutes. At the level of metaphor, we remain the brutes we always were, animalized by the same words that supposedly exalt the human over the inhuman. Moreover, those words are governed by mechanics overriding the distinction between mind and body, man and beast, propelled by the autonomous pulsation of the drives. By making the locomotor apparatus the organ of the episode, Joyce exploits the Cartesian notion of the body as an animal machine, not to differentiate the body from the mind but to expose the animal automatism of the human psyche. In 'Circe', as in the Freudian dream, the mind reveals itself as a confluence of the linguistic, the After Man 'When is a man not a man?' According to Shem the penman, this is the 'first riddle of the universe', prior to the riddle of the sphinx, who asked which creature walks 91</page><page sequence="19">FIELD DAY REVIEW 51 Cited in Alan Bleak The Animalizing Imagination: Totemism, Textuality and Ecocriticism (London, 2000), 64 52 See Harold Skulsky, Metamorphosis: The Mind in Exile (Cambridge, Mass., 1981). 53 Margot Norris, Beasts of the Modern Imagination (Baltimore, 1985), 6 with four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening.

Shem was a sham and a low sham. ... otherworld of animal spirits a journey that requires animal courage to accomplish.51 In 'Circe', Bloom performs the role of shaman, becoming beast in order to confront the beast, to inoculate himself with animality. Note that Stephen, unlike Bloom, retains his human form throughout the 'Circe' episode; he has 'a shape that can't be changed', in Joyce's words, but it is also a shape that can't be `semisized', transformed into a work of semes, a seminal monsterpiece. In other words, Stephen never writes the great work, nor accomplishes the exile that writing necessitates exile from ego, homeland, and the monumental sham of man himself. Stephen represents the younger self that Joyce left behind in Ireland, the promise of a writing and an exile evermore about to be. Joyce, on the other hand, allows Circe to change him into an animal in order to become a shaman and confront the otherworld of beasts. In this passage, Shem's 'yungfries' clamour to provide the answer to his riddle. One wittily suggests that a man is not a man 'when lovely woman stoops to conk him'; another, 'when he hath no mananas' (bananas, matianas, or tomorrows); another, when he has just been semisized that is, circumcised, castrated, cut in half, semenized, disseminated, and transformed into semantic units, seme-sized. All these answers, Shem declares, are wrong, so it is left to the penman to answer his own riddle, 'the correct solution being ... when he is a ... Sham'. [FW, 169-70 So a man is not a man when he is a sham that is, a fake, fraud, or forger, like Shem himself: 'Shem was a sham and a low sham. ' But if Shem is a sham, he is also a shaman, an intermediary who crosses the boundary between man and beast. Michael Taussig has argued that the shaman confronts animality not to 'eliminate but to acquire it'. This acquisition enables him to travel to the land of the dead the Yet the animals in Joyce's 'Circe', as in Ovid's Metamorphoses, are human beings trapped in alien bodies, minds in exile.5 They retain the capacity for human speech, unlike Wittgenstein's lion, whose language if he had one would be inaccessible to human thought. For this reason Joyce differs sharply from the writers Margot Norris identifies as `zoocentric', such as Nietzsche and Lawrence, who reject the whole idea of being 'like' an animal in quest of an unmediated animality, innocent, violent, implacable, and always masculine. Joyce, on the other hand, is 'the consummately domestic writer, who, in spite of his coziness with the libido, never ventures into the ontological wildernesses' of the zoocentric writers.53 His beasts, therefore, tend to be heimlich the cat, the dog or unbeimlich, like the rat that Bloom encounters at Glasnevin Cemetery; even the lions in 'Circe' are confined in looseboxes. Bloom, by identifying with the animal, partially overcomes its otherness, its mystery; to this extent he is the sentimentalist who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship of a thing done. 92</page><page sequence="20">ULYSSES It is not the animal as such, but the machine and the animal-machine, which defy the anthropocentric worldview in Ulysses. When Bloom says that 'everything speaks in its own way' it is important that he is referring to the printing press, a writing machine that reproduces texts regardless of the 'aura' of human authorship. In one sense Bloom's perception that 'everything speaks in its own way' suggests an ecological awareness of the dependency of human life on other forms of being, both animal and inorganic. But on the other hand, Bloom's catchphrase could be understood to mean that language is a mechanism, mindless and inhuman as the printing press, which speaks in its own way, seizing the speaker in its merciless automatism. _Joyce claimed that Circe was changing him into an animal, but he also hinted that she was changing him into a machine, entrammelled in a form of automatic writing that grew ever 'worse and wilder and more involved'. Seized in a function whose exercise grasped him, Joyce felt enslaved to the animal-machinery he had set in motion. This authorial predicament seems drastically at odds with Stephen Dedalus's view that literature is the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man. But Bloom 'tacitly dissents' from Stephen's conception of literature, for Bloom has learned in Circe's den that the spirit of man is compounded of the animal and the mechanical. Traditionally the affirmation of the spirit of man has entailed the denial of the body, the woman, and the animal, all of which are governed by the laws of mechanics that Bloom struggles to remember throughout the day. While Stephen, the arrested artist, dreams of affirming the spirit of man, Bloom affirms the animal-machinery of life, machinery that goes on playing whether man is there to press the keys or not.</page></plain_text>
