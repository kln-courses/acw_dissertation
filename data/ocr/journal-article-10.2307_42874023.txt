<plain_text><page sequence="1">ÍRole of Science in 3i oáetn Society UÌ. *Jl . &lt;SHavalankat £)URS is an age of science. It is also known by other names such as the "Age of Anxiety1" or the "Unsuccessful Age". But all such names derive principally from the '¡Scientistic' character of our times. It is the birth and progress of modern science that has raised all our questions and created all our anxiei.cs». Since the times of Bacon, science has been making continual progress. That this has resulted in man's mas- tery over nature has been well-known and obvious to everybody. The application of science to industry has also resulted in raising the material standard of the people. The world today has a bigger population at a higher standard of life than at any time in the past. But, as has been well said, in changing nature men change themselves. In the process ot establishing new relations with nature, men alter their relations with one another. This latter change has largely been unconscious in character. Men were so absorbed in studying the secrets of nature, that they had neither the time nor the inclination to study changes in their social relations. The story of the transition from medieval to modern times has often been told. Laski treats of it in his scintil- lating essay on The Rise of European Liberalism. The medieval society was essentially a static, more or less homogeneous society. It was other-worldly in character dominated by visions of life after death. Customs and traditions and the injunctions of the Church ruled men in every sphere of their life. ¡Status determined a man's rights and duties with respect to those of other men. Everyone had his fixed role to play in the social order. There was no social ladder and everyone had to stay where he was born From the cradle to the grave every important occasion in life had its appropriate rules and regulations.</page><page sequence="2">2 The birth of modern society is marked by a complete overthrowing of this authoritarian order. With the decline of the authority of the Church by the end of the 13th cen- tury, and the subsequent flowering of the Renaissance and the Reformation a veritable revolution took place. The Humanists preached a new view of life. Men rediscovered a fresh joy in life. This earth was good and worth living for. Scepticism was abroad and men began to question old values of life. Everything was subjected to the test of reason. To this restless spirit of enquiry are to be traced the beginnings of modern science and philosophy. Within a couple of centuries, the old authoritarian, traditional, con- servative order was replaced by a dynamic aggressive society, making every new experiment with its growing powers. The impact of the progress of science on modern society may be summed up in one phrase : the emancipa- tion of the individual. The discovery of the New World and the Industrial Revolution with their unlimited possi- bilities of exchange and production made a secular view of life imperative. The possibilities could not be exploited to the full unless subsistence production gave way to unlimited production, production for the market. The Church could not be allowed to stand in the way of the pursuit of worldly gain Inde )d, worldly success was proof positive that He approved of the ways of His flock. Religion after all was entirely a personal affair between man and his Maker. The individual was thus left free to pursue his happiness unhampered by the restrictions of the Church. The rapid and phenomenal progress of industry was due to the initiative and enterprise of the private capitalist. The medieval rules and regulations governing trade and industry had speedily become obsolete. The era of guilds was at an end. Free competition became the necessary condition of progress. The State whioh had stepped into the seat of authority vacated by the Church was confined within the narrowest</page><page sequence="3">3 limits by the rising capitalist class. Adam Smith gave characteristic expression to the optimism of the 18th cen- tury when he asserted that th9 individual left free to pursue his own self interest would as by an indivisible hand promote social good. The best government was thus that which governed least. Thus the authoritarian structure that had cribbed, cabined and confined the individual during the middle ages slowly gave way as science transformed religion, industry, politics and social life. But there is another side to this picture. Men win freedom only to become slaves to new masters. Freedom sometimes is a greater burden to bear than the humiliations of slavery. We must understand the dialectical nature of individual freedom and social progress to realize the full significance of the role that science has been playing in modern society. It is no doubt true that science freed the individual from spiritual, economic and political bonds ; it is, however, equally true that it has reduced him to the position of an atom, swayed hither and thither by the vast, impersonal, incalculable forces which he is unable to understand, much less to control. While medieval society restricted a man's freedom, it gave him a secure and unquestioned place within its structure from the moment of his birth. So long as a man performed the duties which belonged to his status, he was also guaranteed his rights. The individual today has freedom to worship God according to his own conscience ; but he must face him all alone, without any protective guidance or fellowship. Economically speaking, a man is free to make millions by his cunning and deftness, his initiative and enterprise. But if he fails to make way he has himself to blame. He has a vote and feels himself master of his political destiny, but in reality he is a victim of the huge party organization and its propaganda machi- nery. Economic emancipation of women has led to broken homes and neglected children, to the disintegration of the family, the last resort of the shattered, frustrated individual. Freedom to the modern man spells isolation and moral loneliness.</page><page sequence="4">4 This phenomenon characteristic of modern society, has been called 'spiritual civilization' by Röpke. According to him, "during the last hundred years, society has disinteg- rated into a mass of abstract individuals who are solitary and isolated as human beings, but packed tightly like termites in their role of social functionaries."' Men living like competitive ants in giant urban ant-heaps as complete strangers to one another, can hardly form a community. 1 here is no warmth of direct human relationships, no shar- ing of purposes, feelings or actions. It is this lack of human fellowship, of the consolations cf religion, of the support of the men of their caste or guild that makes the men of our time yearn for many of the values of medieval society. Wo yearn for the continuities, securities, certairtics of that humbler time which now seems lost for ever. A similar process of disintegration has affected the world of thought as well. The fundamental unity of medieval life had informed men's thinking of the scene. It was not possible to understand economic or political events without studying their interrelations as well as their con- nections with religion, art, morality etc. The only way to get a knowledge of anything was to see it in relation to the polydimenaional structure of the whole social process. With the destruction of medieval homogeneity, the thinkers of the modern era quickly adjusted themselves to the new life pattern. The different sciences developed as independent disciplines. The world of thought was divided into water-tight compartments and there came into being a pure science of economics, a pure system of psychology, of ethics, of political science etc. This process of specializ- ation undoubtedly contributed greatly to the progress of the individual sciences. But this progress has not been achieved without paying its price. While each group of specialists is engaged on the study of its special subject, it is no one's business to study the hinterlands that divide any two separate disciplines. It is a kird of no scholar's land-in the world of knowledge. One result of this has been the'increasing remoteness and irrelevance of each specializ- ed discipline to the immediate urgencies of our life. This is one of the principal causes of the present crisis in the world of thought. It raises tne scientist's dilemma : ehould</page><page sequence="5">5 he carry on his good work of scientific investigation and research when its foreseeable consequences are war and the destruction of civilisation? Are the economist's solutions politically practicable? Is the politically expedient morally right? There is hardly any one competent to resolve these dilemmas. But science has been responsible for more dangerous consequences still in the field of social sciences. Max Scheler has distinguished three kinds of knowledge : Beherrschungswissen, Bildungswissen and Erlosungwissen. 3 Physical science has all along been the first kind of know- ledge, knowledge for the sake of control, power or action. It has been essentially instrumental in character. It is not an exploration in the field of values but a technique for better and fuller realization of whatever values happen to exist. It has taken long strides in the understanding and control of physical nature but is unable to meet Lynd's challenge, Knowledge for What?4 Western man has been so absorbed for the last few centuries in the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of controlling nature that he has almost lost the faculty for spiritual experience of any kind. That is the tragedy of modern Western civilization which ilabindranath 'L'agore has symbolised in the picture of the giraffe. The phenomenal success of physical science and its consequent prestige have led to a mechanical and uncritical application of its methods in the study of social sciences with disastrous consequences. It is this procedure which Hayek has called scientism/' It must be remembered that Science itself had to fight in its early stages against the anthropomorphic interpretations of natural phenomena It could make progress only when it studied objective facts independently of what men thought about them. The same procedure was uncritically adopted in the social sciences and facts were studied, emptied of all their meaning and value. Some social scientists show the same preconception with the means and the neglect of values characteristic of physical science. Grandiose projects have been designed for controlling human behaviour by planning the growth of reason and of the human mind itself. Fascist totalitari- anism was the l isi word in the latest technique of social</page><page sequence="6">6 control for enchanting the individual mind adrift from its medieval moorings. Such is the tragedy of the modern individual which victorious science and its methods have brought about. In making use of the discoveries of science we must never lose sight of the fact that ultimate value lies in the freedom and happiness of the individual mind. If we bear this in mind and alter our habits of thinking in accordance with the new material environment science lias created, there is still no need to despair. The medieval unity was imposed from above ; it was secured by repressing the individual personality in the interests of society. It is idle to hope that the individual freed from the medieval shackles, will once again submit himself to be suppressed even in order to tide over a great crisis in the society of which he is a member. Fascism tried that reactionary experiment and failed ignominiously. What we wish to achieve is a fresh synthesis, a conscious integration of the individual and society. Science has been creating the material conditions in which such a new type of equilibrium will be possible, when 'individual fulfilment will also be the fulfilment of the society. ' By triumphing over time and distance it has constituted the different countries into one world. While the relative independence of the countries cannot be denied, the fundamental fact is that of interdependence. Peace and Prosperity, it is increasingly being realized, are indivi- sible. Poverty and crisis anywhere threaten the whole world. The scramble for raw materials points to the necessity of a world communism of resources. Hence also the various plans for the development of backward economies. To translate this fact into the daily life of individuals, two things are necessary : We must change our habits of thinking and we must build appropriate institutions for the new behaviour pattern of individuals living in an interdependent world. According to Mannheim there are three stages in man's thinking, viz. chance discovery, invention and planned thinking. We have now to make transition from the second stage to the third, "from the deliberate invention of single objects or institutions to the deliberate regulation and intelligent mastery of the rela-</page><page sequence="7">7 tionships between objects At the second stage the pattern of thought is a linear one ; it takes the form of a circular flow where the first elements in the causal chain are in our new model of thought supplemented by further elements, the movement of which tends towards an equili- brium, and in which all the factors act upon each other simultaneously instead of in an endless succession."" It is this lack of interdependent thinking which is responsible for many of our problems today. I t was thought in the 19th centui*y that the device of the vote would solve all the problems of political society ; it has led, as we now see, only to 'the private ownership of government by business'. As already noted, technological progress has led to spiritual and moral atrophy. For every problem solved, half a dozen fresh ones have arisen. It is the aim of interdependent thinking to take into account the multi- dimensional structure of society and to realize and provide for not merely the immediate effects of individual actions • in single spheres, but also their long-run effects affecting society as a whole. It is of course of the utmost importance to organize institutions for this new type of behaviour pattern of individuals. So far the philosophy of Liberalism, cha- racteristic of the modern scientific age, has only served to destroy certain medieval institutions ; it has done nothing to construct new ones in their place. When the state takes over the functions of the family, or of the caste or guild, it is necessary to link the individuals to the larger social unit through organizations involving new habits of behaviour. It is no use merely condemning the caste or the family as being parochial or even nationalism as the nucleii of anti-social loyalties ; the problem of supra- national unity, or of an interdependent world is just the problem of building up appropriate interrelations between the people of the different nations as at present exist bet- ween the people of the same nation. It is clear that a competitive capitalist economy has no place in such a world. In such a community the indi- vidual will is free just ¡.ecause it is blind to the total result of the actions of many millions of separate wills. A farmer is free to produce what he wishes, just because he does not</page><page sequence="8">8 know the final state of the supply in relation to effective demand. As every one knows, the assumption of perfect knowledge renders choice illusory. We may ask ourselves how far we would have felt ourselves free to make the choices we did in 1918, had we foreseen even* vaguely in advance their consequences in the present state of the world. In an individualist economy, the individual is only 'functionally rational'. He knows only so much of the total social process as is necessary for the efficient pro- gramme of his own function ; he has very little knowledge how his function dovetails with those performed by the other individuals in the community so as to form a com- plete social whole. He is not 'substantially rational'. It is the function of interdependent thought and action to make men as far as possible conscious makers of their own his- tory. What we have to create is a new functional, homo- geneous society, without the rigidity of the caste and guild system. And in place of the medieval sanction of religion, which repressed individuality we must substitute the cons- cious cooperation of the 'substantially rational' individuals. Our hope lies in the growth of intelligence and radius of foresight of the common man. It is when we succeed in forming new habits of such cooperative endeavour that the individual will lose his sense of moral isolation and realize the freedom secreted in the recesses of human fellowship. In such a second Renaissance, bread will lose its present inflated significance and free will will attain its true mea- ning of self-realization. References 1.
