It does so in an attempt to disprove claims that Dillingham's talent lay in criticism rather than in original composition, and that his Latin verse shows his complete independence of the old school of classical imitation. It has the twofold aim of highlighting both the classical and the contemporary intertexts with which this hitherto neglected poetry engages. It argues that far from constituting the leisurely product of a gentleman in rustic retirement, this is highly talented verse that "sports" with the classics in several ways: first in its self-consciously playful interaction with the Latin poets of Augustan Rome, chiefly Virgil and Ovid; second in its appropriation of a classical world and its linguistic medium to describe such seventeenth-century sports or pastimes as bowling, horticulture, and bell-ringing. It also foregrounds the pseudoroman- ticism surprisingly inherent in the work of a late-seventeenth-century poet, who, it is argued, discovered in his twilight years a neo-Latin inspirational Muse.</page><page sequence="6">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS wish to thank the Queen's University Research and Scholarships Committee for funding trips to the British Library, London, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the authorities of those institutions for permitting me to consult manuscripts and early printed books relevant to my research.

Unconnected to any single event, occasion, or political circumstance, and unaffiliated with any one university,1 this collection confidently presented and indeed showcased neo-Latin poetry for its own sake. As such it can be seen both to mirror and take its place alongside the Delitiae collections (for Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany) that had appeared at the beginning of the century.2 Bearing the rather elaborate title Poemata Varii Argumenti Partim e Georgio Herberto Latine (Utcunque) Reddita, Partim Conscripta a Wilh. Dillingham, S.T.D., the volume is in fact a bipartite anthology, which is much more comprehensive than even this verbose title would suggest. Compiled by a certain William Dillingham,3 Part One consists of Dillingham's Latin verse renderings of extracts from George Herbert's English poetry (The Temple),4 and from Erasmus's Latin prose treatise De Civilitate Morum Puerilium,5 as well as five original Latin poems by Dillingham on such 1 Contrast the official poetry anthologies issued by Oxford and Cambridge to commemorate occasions of national significance or to lament the deaths of individuals. Examples of the latter are the three Cambridge and Oxford anthologies published on the death of Sir Philip Sidney in 1586/87. 2 See, for example: Delitiae Carminum Italorum Poetarum Huius Superiorisque Aevi (Frankfurt, 1608); Delitiae Carminum Poetarum Gallorum Huius Superiorisque Aevi (Frankfurt, 1609); Delitiae Carminum Poetarum Belgicorum Huius Superiorisque Aevi (Frankfurt, 1612); Delitiae Carminum Poetarum Germanorum Huius Superiorisque Aevi (Frankfurt, 1612). 3 On Dillingham, see W.H. Kelliher, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, eds. H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (Oxford, 2004), sv William Dillingham, and 3-6 below. 4 Dillingham renders Herbert's "The Church-Porch," "The Sacrifice," "Providence," "Charms and Knots," and "Mans Medley" into Latin verse in the poems Perirrhanterium, Sacrificium, Providentia, Gryphi, and Gaudium, at Poemata Varii Argumenti Partim e Georgio Herberto Latine (Utcunque) Reddita, Partim Conscripta a Wilh. Dillingham, S.T.D. (London, 1678), 1-23, 24-35, 35-42, 43 and 44 respectively. All quotations from Dillingham's Latin poetry are from this edition. See De Civilitate Morum Puerilium Per D. Erasmum Roterodamum Libellus (London, 1578) rendered by Dillingham into Latin hexameters entitled De Moribus Puerorum at Poemata Varii Argumenti, 45-56.</page><page sequence="8">2 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry topics as the game of bowls,6 the tolling of church bells,7 the first flight of a fledgling bird,8 a garden topiary,9 and a hangman's stone with its associated folklore.10 Part Two, however, moves far beyond the confínes of England and its poets to embrace a broader spectrum of both classical and contemporary (or near contemporary) verse. Thus Virgil, Manilius, and Lucan sit quite happily alongside Theodore Beza, Marco Girolamo Vida, George Buchanan, Hugo Grotius, Desiderius Erasmus, Phineas Fletcher, and Thomas More. The collection is pioneering in a number of respects: chiefly perhaps in its placing of neo-Latin poetry on an equal footing with that of the classics of ancient Rome, its recognition of neo-Latin verse as a distinct category of writing,11 and its innovative situating of Anglo-Latin poetry within a wider continental context. Indeed the breadth of Part Two is quite stunning for its day and works on both a geographical and generic level. What is immediately apparent is that the language of classical Rome has become the poetic medium for a range of international "modern" neo-Latin writers (from Scotland, England, the Low Countries, and Italy) now for the first time collectively available in print. And the nationality of such authors is rather self-consciously highlighted. For example, Andrew Melvin and Thomas Rhaedus are both termed Scoti, whereas other writers are designated by their associated city: Phineas Fletcher Cantabrigiensis, Vida Cremonensis, Erasmus Roterodamus, and so on. The content is equally wide-ranging, embracing inter alia biblical material (reproduced in Latin metaphrase and paraphrase),12 surprisingly 6 Suleianum (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 56-59). 7 Campanae Undellenses {Poemata Varii Argumenti, 60-64). 8 Avicula {Poemata Varii Argumenti, 65-66). 9 Sepes Hortensis {Poemata Varii Argumenti, 67). 10 Nemesis a Tergo {Poemata Varii Argumenti, 68). 11 Dillingham would be succeeded in this respect by Walter Savage Landor whose essay Quaestio quamobrem Poetae Latini Recentiores Minus Legantur likewise identifies neo-Latin verse as a distinct literary category and affords it due recognition as an international enterprise. See Walter Savage Landor, Poemata et Inscriptiones (London, 1847), 264-348. 12 Cf. Carmen Mosis, Deut. 32 per A.

But what of that anthologist, whose name is all too unfamiliar even to neo-Latinists in the twenty-first century? What of the pioneering vision that seems to have inspired this collection? As noted below, this vision was perhaps both the product and culmination of a seventeenth-century humanist, a versatile scholar, who was at various times editor, translator, preacher, biographer, anthologist, and, especially significant for the purposes of the present study, neo-Latin poet in his own right. Born c. 1617 William Dillingham was the eldest son of Thomas Dillingham, rector of Barnwell All Saints, Northamptonshire. He received his preuniversity education at Barnwell Grammar School, from which he went up at the age of nineteen to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. There his roommate was William Sancroft (the future Archbishop of Canterbury), who would in fact succeed him as Master of Emmanuel and prove a lifelong friend, correspondent, and critic of his Latin poetry.16 Having gained his BA in 1639, Dillingham was elected (in 1642) Fellow of Emmanuel. Indeed his close affiliation with university life is frequently attested by his correspondence with Sancroft. Writing (in Latin) to Sancroft in June 1642, he describes with empathetic Paraphrasis P salmi CIIII (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 107-109); Historia Jonae, Carmine Paraphr. per Hug. Grotium (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 109-118); Eiusdem Paraphrasis in Tres Versus Postremos Cap X Proph. Jeremiae (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 118-120). 13 M. Hieron. Vidae Cremonensis Scacchia Ludus (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 134- 154). 14 Tho. Rhaedi De Arte Typographica Carmen (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 157-159). 15 Phineas Fletcher, Locustae (Poemata Varii Argumenti, 208-234). 16 It is interesting to note that Dillingham played a rather similar advisory role vis-à- vis Justinian Isham's verse-compositions. In a letter to Justinian he announces that he is returning "your excellent and elegant poem with some alterations; wherein if I have exceeded my commission, I must begg your pardon." He proceeds to state that he has only "mingled a little water with your inke, which if it make it thinner, it does also make it somewhat smoother." Cf. The Diary of Thomas Isham of Lamport (1658-81), Kept by Him in Latin from 1671-1673 at His Father's Command, trans. Norman Marlow, with notes and commentary by Sir Giles Isham (Farnborough, 1971), 82.</page><page sequence="10">4 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry fondness the feverish excitement of the students preparing to leave as the end of term approaches, comparing them to birds about to take to flight.17 He graduated MA in 1643, BD in 1650, and DD in 1655. In 1646 his English verses in praise of John Hall's Poems were included among the encomia prefixed to the Cambridge edition of Hall's poetry. Having been entrusted with the papers of Nathaniel Culverwell,18 he published (in 1651) his Spiritual Opticks and (in 1652) an edition of his The Light of Nature, dedicating the latter to the Masters and Fellows of Emmanuel College.19 He also edited from manuscript Theodore Bathurst's Latin verse-rendering of Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender (1653). But Dillingham frequently looked beyond the confines of England and her poets. For example, in 1647 we find him corresponding with the Dutch neo-Latin poet Daniel Heinsius, sending him gift-copies of his own works.20 In 1653 he obtained the Mastership of Emmanuel College,21 a position which he would hold until 1662. Despite evidence that the college did not fare particularly well during his mastership,22 and that the students may in fact have been rather out of hand,23 his Cambridge years 17 Bodl. Tanner MS 63, f. 42: Terminus Academiae usque ad diem praesentis Junii 13 prorogatur, processurus denuo protinus si res nostras in tuto positas intellexerimus; sed interim levant ales suas iuvenes ac si avolaturi . . . 18 Cf. Dillingham, ed., Nathaniel Culverwell, The Light of Nature (London, 1652), Epistle Dedicatory A2V: "Having therefore the disposal of his papers committed to me by his nearest and dearest friends, and finding them to be of such worth and excellence as ought not to be smothered in obscurity ..." 19 Kelliher, ODNB ad loc, notes that between 1656 and 1662 Dillingham's name "appeared as a syndic of the university press on licences for sixteen works." 20 In a Latin letter dated 20 May 1647 Daniel Heinsius thanks Dillingham for such a gift: Deauratum munus tuum, cum epistola illa quidem amicissima, sic ante tempus aliquod accept (BL Sloane 1710, f.181). 21 John Hacket sent Dillingham a congratulatory letter (6 April 1654). Cf. BL Sloane 1710, f. 197: maxime cumulasti beneficio (Vir praestantissime) adeoque laetificabili nuntio perfudisti, quod ab humanissimis tuismet literis hausi Collegii vestri praefecturam tibi obtigisse. 22 E.S. Shuckburgh, Emmanuel College (London, 1904), 101, remarks: "... under his charge the College showed no sign of recuperation. The number of entries averaged only about twenty-five, and a College order regarding the stipend of the Head Lecturer and the fees to be paid by residents mentions that the proportion of sizars to pensioners was increasing." 23 Shuckburgh, Emmanuel College, 102, states: "he was said to be more interested in his private studies and literary employments than in the government of the College.</page><page sequence="11">Introduction 5 are marked by a flurry of editorial activity. He published in 1657 the military Commentaries of Sir Francis Vere and an edition of the Lexicon Geographicum of Philip Ferrarius. In the late 1650s he married Elizabeth by whom he had three sons and a daughter. He was appointed Vice- Chancellor of the University in 1659, but his refusal to conform to the Act of Uniformity (1662) resulted in his automatic forfeiture (in August of that year) of all his Cambridge posts.24 Shuckburgh remarks that "it was much to the credit of his honesty that he quitted [Cambridge] on conscientious grounds."25 Nonetheless he continued to remain on good terms with his successor, William Sancroft, to whom he addressed a very generous letter.26 As Shuckburgh notes, "It would not be easy for a dispossessed man to write to his successor with more magnanimous kindness or with better temper."27 Likewise his interest in and Certainly the entrances were low during his mastership, and the number of 'admonitions' is rather above the average, as though the men were somewhat out of hand. They were mostly for 'drinking in alehouses' where the delinquents are sometimes 'taken by the vice-Chancellor, or for neglecting their studies or their Tutor's prayers.'" 24 Sancroft refers to Dillingham's resignation from the Mastership of Emmanuel College in a letter dated 4 October 1662: "I was not heer a week before that Mastership of Eman. College became void by Dr Dillingham's recusancy to subscribe, and conform to the late Act of Uniformity ..." (Bodl. Tanner MS 48, f. 52). 25 Shuckburgh, Emmanuel College, 103. On conscience, cf. Dillingham, A Sermon at the Funeral of the Lady Elisabeth Alston (London, 1678), 24-25: "But now a good Conscience, sprinkled with the Blood of Christ, that sincerely reports unto us, that we have by Faith in the Blood of Christ received him for the Pardon of Sin, and gives us an holy Life in evidence of the Truth of our Faith, doth thereby shew that the Promise of the Gospel, which was made conditionally is now become absolute unto us; and that therefore we are already passed from Death to Life... Thus we see that the Testimony of a good Conscience, (and nothing else without it) can give us true and solid Comfort, when we come to dy. ... An erroneous Conscience may make a man brave it out, and (with Curtius) leap desperately into the Gulf of the Bottomless Pit. An Hypocrite's Conscience may set a fair outside upon it, and dy (possibly) with seeming Joy; but in the midst of Laughter his Heart is sad." 26 See R.E.C. Waters, Genealogical Memoirs of the Extinct Family of Chester of Chicheley (London, 1878), 639: "... I have sent my servant to cleare the lower study for your present use, according as you desire, untili such time as I can wait on you myselfe ... I have sent herewith my cope, and scarlet gown, and scarlet hood, and my surplice, about which I shall confer with you when we meet, and which you may please freely to make use of for your present occasions." 27 Shuckburgh, Emmanuel College, 105.</page><page sequence="12">6 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry connections with Emmanuel College would remain lifelong.28 Dillingham spent the next ten years in retirement at Oundle. But it is a retirement characterized by literary and poetic activity.29 1672 saw the death of his wife, Elizabeth. In May of that year he was presented by his friend Sir Thomas Alston to the Rectory of Woodhill. The following year he married the thrice-widowed Mary Toller, who was fifty years of age according to the Isham correspondence,30 and mother of seven children. He published in 1674 and 1675 respectively Thomas Horton's Forty-six Sermons and his Choice and Practical Exposition on Four Select Psalms. He also prepared for press Latin lives of Archbishop Ussher and Laurence Chaderton.31 His last published poem (1680) was a brief neo-Latin epic entitled Aegyptus Triumphata on the plagues of Egypt. Two theological treatises were published just before his death in 1689. He was buried at Odell on 28 November 1689. Such was the versatility of a seventeenth-century Anglo-Latin humanist most accurately described perhaps in Kelliher's phrase as an "entrepreneur of letters."32 And it is to this entrepreneurship (especially as anthologist and neo-Latin poet) that we now turn. Dillingham' s literary entrepreneurship manifests itself most strikingly in his eagerness to make a wide and highly versatile range of neo-Latin poetry available to the wider world. In fact it was this that motivated several of his other literary projects even if these did not actually see the light of day. This was largely on account of his meticulous editorial care, evident in his practice of constant revision and the consistently scrupulous way in which he sought to obtain permission 28 As late as 1678 he would describe to Sancroft his plan for converting the college chapel into a library: "... And I may give your Lordship an account also of Emmanuel library. I have observed the windows &amp;c in the old chappel, and do not doubt but it may make a very convenient library, the walls are good and dry; the dampnes that appeares being only from the floore, which may be remedyed by raising the floore to the levell of the foot-pace of the Bachelors' Seates ..." (Odell 15 July 1678). (Bodl. MS Tanner 39, f. 65). Cited also at Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 645. 29 Two letters dated 14 February and 4 March 1671/2 respectively relate to the poetry of Justinian Isham, and allude to Dillingham' s own translation into Latin of Herbert's "The Church Porch." Cf. The Diary of Thomas Isham, 82. 30 The Diary of Thomas Isham, 82. 31 These together with his exercises for the degrees of BD and DD (see BL Harley 7052) were published posthumously at Cambridge (1700) by his son Thomas. 32 Kelliher, ODNB ad loc.</page><page sequence="13">Introduction 1 from the contributors.33 Extant among the manuscript holdings of the British Library are two unpublished neo-Latin anthologies compiled by Dillingham. The first of these is obviously incomplete. Entitled Wilhelmi Dillinghami Poemata ab eo vel Inventa vel Versa vel aliunde adoptata et edita; quaedam nunc Primum ex ipsius Authoris Autographia34 it runs to a mere seven folios, but even here is discernible once again that motivating breadth and diversity of subject matter. Thus biblical material (a Latin verse rendering [by David Pareus] of Apoc. 17),35 is followed by John Hall's encomium of an anonymous author of gunpowder plot verses.36 Royalist verses (to James I)37 are followed by an incomplete Latin pastoral on the Gunpowder Plot.38 The language, the genres, may be classical, but this is clearly a seventeenth-century world with its monarchs, and with plots against those monarchs as a Virgilian pastoral landscape is shattered and turned upside down by the sheer horror of a gunpowder conspiracy. Much more extensive is Dillingham' s unpublished Poemata Selecta ex Autoribus qua Veteribus, qua Neotericis amplius Quadraginta fere non tarn in vulgus nota; quaedam nunc primum edita39 in which such Anglo-Latin poets as William Barclay, Giles Fletcher, and Thomas Masters are set alongside such continental authors as Beza and Natale Conti. While the range of authors falls far short of those eventually included in the published Poemata Varii Argumenti, the variety of subject matter is nonetheless impressive, embracing mathematics,40 antiquarian 33 Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 640, correctly observes that Dillingham' s literary projects "are most inadequately represented by his published works." 34 BLSloane 1815, ff 54-61. 35 BL Sloane 1815, ff 55-56: Prophetia exAntiquiss. Cod. Mss in aedibus Praepositi Saleriani Reperto ad Missa David Pareus in cap. 17 Apocal (1628). BL Sloane 1815, f. 57: Versus Laudatomi J. Hall in auctorem cuiusdam carminis in coniurationem Sulphuream (1605). Dillingham had himself composed laudatory English verses in praise of Hall's own poetry. These were included among the prefatory material to Poems by John Hall (Cambridge, 1646). 37 BL Sloane 1815, ff 58-58v: Versus Heroici Ad Regem [Iacobum I] inscripti et carmine supradicto praefixi. 38 BL Sloane 1815, ff 59-61: Carmen in Coniurationem Sulphuream [Imperfect]. 39 BL Sloane 1766. 40 William Barclay, Arithmeticae Memorativae (BL Sloane 1766, ff 15-21).</page><page sequence="14">8 William Dillingham ys Latin Poetry matters,41 monastic life,42 hunting,43 and even the game of shovel-board.44 The multiple aims of this literary project were articulated by Dillingham in an insightful letter (to his lifelong friend and critic William Sancroft) dated 18 September 167 1,45 and can be seen to encapsulate a sense of vocation that inspired his literary ambitions in general: [My small Designe of a collection of poems] . . . therefore shall now more fully acquaint you with what I propounded to my selfe in undertaking it. Which was to make a collection of such poems as for variety of matter and elegancy of verse might be profitable and delightfull to scholars of all conditions; and in so doing to revive some pieces of worth yet not like otherwise to be reprinted; to communicate others which are non tarn in vulgus nota; to collect some which lay dispersed, and to publish others not yet printed. In the whole I have regard to the delicacy of the present age by making choice only of Such as have clearnese and facility of expression.4 The statement reveals a fourfold aim: of variety, pleasure, practical usefulness, and making accessible to a wide audience poetry hitherto unknown - all attuned to suit "the delicacy of the present age." In many respects Dillingham' s peculiarly modern vision combined with his lateral thinking helped to pave the way for a range of subsequent neo-Latin anthologies that would be published in England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Foremost among these are Francis Atterbury's 'AvOoXoyía (1684),47 which would be revised and expanded in 1740 by Alexander Pope as Selecta Poemata Italorum^ But the 41 Giles Fletcher, De Literis Antiquae Britanniae (BL Sloane 1766, ff 34-42). 42 Laelius Capilupus, De Vita Monachorum (BL Sloane 1766, ff 204-21 1). 43 Natale Conti, De Venatione (BL Sloane 1766, ff 270-277). 44 Thomas Masters, Mensa Lubrica (BL Sloane 1766, ff 289-290). 45 David Money, The English Horace: Anthony Alsop and the Tradition of British Latin Verse (Oxford, 1998), 40, incorrectly assumes that this letter describes the Poemata Varii Argumenti. It is clear from Dillingham' s stated intention to include in the anthology Conti' s De Venatione that the letter alludes in fact to the unpublished Poemata Selecta (BL Sloane 1766), in which that precise work occurs at ff 270-277. Conti' s poem is not anthologized in Dillingham' s published Poemata Varii Argumenti. 46 Bodl. MS Tanner 44, f. 274. 47 'AvOoXoyía seu Selecta Quaedam Poemata Italorum qui Latine Scripserunt (London, 1684).</page><page sequence="15">Introduction 9 Anglo-Latin dimension is perhaps best epitomized by the Musae Anglicanae compiled at the end of the seventeenth century by Joseph Addison49 and revised and augmented in the following century by Vincent Bourne.50 It is hardly a coincidence that Bourne's anthology would include Dillingham's original Latin compositions.51 Returning to the Poemata Varii Argumenti, evidence would suggest that Dillingham took no small pride in his own quite substantial contribution to that anthology. Writing to Sancroft in October 1677, he wonders about the title of the collection: should he simply call the volume Herberti Poemata Quaedam, Latine Reddita &amp;c. even though his versions of Herbert comprise only one quarter of the whole? Should the work perhaps fall "under the title of mine, which wilbe with them, about hälfe the Book"? Should he have "some more general title to comprehend all in one"?52 Sancroft seems to have suggested a compromise, which is quite likely reflected in the title eventually chosen,53 even if that title is in Selecta Poemata Italorum qui Latine Scripserunt, cura cuiusdam Anonymi Anno 1684 Congesta, herum in Lucem Data, Una Cum Aliorum Italorum Operibus, Accurante A. Pope (London, 1740), 2 vols. 49 Musarum Anglicanarum Analecta (Oxford, 1699). 50 Vincent Bourne, ed. Musarum Anglicanarum Analecta (London, 1741), 2 vols. Bourne moves beyond Addison by including Cambridge as well as Oxford neo-Latin poets. 51 Bourne includes Dillingham's Suleianum and Campanae Undellenses at Musarum Anglicanarum Analecta, I, 109-112 and 244-248 respectively. See Estelle Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 97.1 [Philadelphia, 2007]), 10. 52 Bodl. MS Tanner 40, f. 109 (22 October 1677) [Dillingham to Sancroft]: "... Also I begg your advice whether I should make the Title Herberti Poemata quaedam, Latine reddita &amp;c (which are but a 4th of the booke) which will be most known, and seemly due to his name; or whether Under the title of mine, which wilbe, with them, about hälfe of the Booke. Or else under some more general title to comprehend all in one. Among them there are versions of severall parts of Scripture by Grotius, Thuanus, and others; and some short papers of those which you formerly saw from Mr Hookes hand." 53 Sancroft replied thus in a letter included in BL Sloane 1710, f. 212: "For the Title, I would sett it, as in the inclosed." His enclosure does not survive. Given, however, the readiness with which Dillingham elsewhere heeded Sancroft' s advice in regard to his literary projects in general and his Latin poetry in particular, it is probably reasonable to assume that the present title is that suggested by Sancroft in that now lost enclosure.</page><page sequence="16">10 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry fact rather misleading in that it fails to take account of the sheer range of Part Two. Misleading though it may be, it is a title that confidently and quite self-consciously juxtaposes two Cambridge poets: George Herbert and William Dillingham. The juxtaposition is a felicitous one for in the first part of this volume vernacular poetry is now recast and amplified via Latin verse paraphrase, which in turn is complemented by original neo- Latin poetry. Indeed if the composition of Latin poetry enabled an author to take his place alongside neo-Latin writers in England and on the continent, so too was translation into Latin regarded as a means of explicating, augmenting, and enhancing a vernacular original. The preface to Dillingham' s edition (1653) of Theodore Bathurst's Latin version of Spenser's The Shepheardes Calendar is permeated by positive imagery of resurrection and revitalization: Spenser, now clad in a Roman toga (indutus idem Romana toga),54 seems not so much to have been "translated" as to have been "restored."55 But more than that: Bathurst's Latin version can illuminate, facilitate, and even embellish the original English.56 The same can be said to be true of Dillingham' s Latin renderings of Herbert's English poetry. These are the poems with which the Poemata Varii Argumenti open. In his introductory preface {Ad Lectorem) Dillingham takes pains to point out that his free version (versio libera) of Herbert is intended both to illuminate obscurities inherent in the original vernacular and to expand upon the sententia auctoris: Quocirca nonnulla ex iis seligenda duxi, quae versione libera ita demum Latine redderem, ut et obscuris lumen aliquod afferrem, et sententiam Auctoris alicubi dilatarem. 54 Calendarium Pastorale sive Aeglogae Duodecimi, Totidem Anni Mensibus Accommodatae.

Or in the words of the translation theorist Eugene Nida: 58 Bodl. MS Tanner 40, f. 7 (dated 19 June 1676). 59 "But the next Return brought me something fair more welcome, your excellently- well-labor' d Translation of Mr Herbert's Porch. It were unreasonable to expect you should measure Verse for Verse from an Author that writes so very close; I might add (in consequence) so obscure too" (BL Sloane 1710, f. 206). 60 "And therefore your paraphrase, where you have us' d your Liberty, will oblige your Readers, and be at once Translation and Comment too" (BL Sloane 1710, f. 206). 61 "And then for your Additions, they are so good, and so suited to your Text, they so enrich that who so considers them will say they are or ought to be there" (BL Sloane 1710, f. 206). 62 BL Sloane 1710, f. 206.</page><page sequence="18">1 2 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry [The translator] must understand not only the obvious content of the message, but also the subtleties of meaning, the significant emotive values of words and the stylistic features which determine the "flavor and feel" of the message. ... In other words, in addition to a knowledge of the two or more languages involved in the translational process, the translator must have a thorough acquaintance with the subject matter concerned.63 Nida proceeds to argue that the translator should admire the author, have the same cultural background, the same talent, and should present the same joy to the reader that is given by the original. The "joy" that can derive from such inventiveness is regarded by Dillingham as fundamental to both the translating and the reading processes. The ideal methodology is to read a vernacular and its Latin version side by side and pari pas su. This is apparent from one of Dillingham' s letters to Sancroft in 1676. Commenting on the latter' s Latin version of John Denham's vernacular poem "Cooper's Hill," he regrets that he did not have the English to hand when critiquing Sancroft' s Latin rendering and was thereby deprived of the delight that would accrue from observing "the harmony between the translation and the original" of a work that "may passe for a native of old Rome were not the subject modern."64 But while Dillingham played an important role in the transmission of Herbert's English poetry (and is thought to have owned the manuscript of the latter' s Musae Responsoriae),65 he was also a significantly accomplished neo-Latin poet in his own right, possessed of his own E.

But as it is, it may passe for a native of old Rome were not the subject modern" (Dated July 1676). 65 The Latin preface to James Duport's Ecclesiastes Solomonis (Cambridge, 1662), 6r, states that it was from Dillingham that Duport obtained the manuscript of Herbert's Musae Responsoriae.

And it is in this latter capacity that his work has been either entirely overlooked or at best dismissed in a rather cavalier fashion by critics and commentators. All too frequently his original Latin verse has been regarded as no more than a pastime, a pleasurable activity undertaken by a poet in rustic retirement at Oundle. Waters, for example, describes it in terms couched in a quasi-romantic subjectivity as "the favourite amusement of his leisure,"66 seeing his talent "in criticism rather than in original composition,"67 while offering the surely blinkered viewpoint that "his verses have a certain second-rate merit, but seldom rise above the level of University prize poems."68 It is a criticism that seems to have stuck. Thus more recently Kelliher's otherwise excellent account of the poet seems to follow suit in describing him as "amusing himself by writing verses in English and Latin which he shared with his friends."69 Perhaps it is the superficial simplicity of such verse that has led to this blighted view, a view that is very much at odds with the laudatory terms in which Sancroft refers to Dillingham's Latin poetry. And such praise cannot be neatly explained away by the fact that the two men were close friends.70 Likewise his debt to the poets of classical Rome has been underplayed. Bradner has remarked that the subjects of Dillingham's Latin verse "show his complete independence of the old school of classical imitation."71 While it is undeniable that such topics as sporting on a seventeenth-century bowling green, the tolling of church bells at night, the flight of a fledgling bird, or the beauties of a garden hedge seem to locate that verse in a world far removed from things classical, Bradner' s comment requires qualification and 66 "The favourite amusement of his leisure was in the composition of verses in Latin and English, for which he had a marvellous facility" (Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 641). 67 "His talent lay in criticism rather than in original composition, and he makes a better figure in other men's books than in his own" (Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 640). 68 Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 641. 69 Kelliher, ODNB ad loc. 70 Waters, Genealogical Memoirs, 643, presents the rather blinkered viewpoint that Sancroft' s letters to Dillingham "do more credit to the Archbishop's affection for his friend than to his critical taste." 71 Leicester Bradner, Musae Anglicanae: A History of Anglo-Latin Poetry 1500-1925 (London and New York, 1940), 204.</page><page sequence="20">14 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry modification in that it overlooks a key aspect of Dillingham' s methodology. Central to that methodology is the way in which the poems engage with a wide range of classical intertexts, for now in fact it is as though Dillingham' s own Latin verse "may passe for a native of old Rome were not the subject modern."72 For, as Hale has remarked, neo- Latin literature is perhaps the most intertextual of forms.73 Indeed in many respects the nature and style of Dillingham' s Latin poetry foreshadow (and to some degree inspired) that fusion of the classical and the romantic so central to Vincent Bourne's Latin verse.74 Bradner was also of the viewpoint that the pieces in Part Two of the Poemata Varii Argumenti were included "without any guiding principle of selection."75 Money, by contrast, while not illustrating the point, has stated that Dillingham' s methodological practice was "not quite haphazard."76 And this can be taken one stage further. In several respects the range of neo-Latin verse selected by Dillingham for inclusion in Part Two serves to complement several of his own original Latin poems appearing in Part One. Thus the genre of the sports-poem exemplified by Dillingham' s Suleianum (on a game of bowls) is represented on a more extensive level by Vida' s Scacchia Ludus (on the game of chess),77 a work that in many respects constitutes the father of this neo-Latin genre. Likewise Dillingham' s Avicula, depicting a fledgling bird receiving instruction from her mother in the art of flying, is complemented by three bird-poems in Part Two: Bartassius's De Aquila (which describes inter alia eaglets in their nest awaiting food from their mother and exposed to a variety of dangers),78 the same author's verses 72 See note 64 above. 73 J.K. Hale, Milton's Languages: The Impact of Multilingualism on Style (Cambridge, 1997), 12: "[Intertextuality] is precisely the aspect of neo-Latin poetry which deters and baffles us, because the degree of verbal allusiveness to the ancients either seems servile or vanishes in translation. It is time that literary theory rescued it, as being the most intertextual poetry known to Europe." 74 See Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, passim. 75 Bradner, Musae Anglicanae, 205. 76 Money, The English Horace, 40. 77 Poemata Varii Argumenti, 134-154. 78 Bartassius De Aquila, Gabr.

This brief study will focus on Dillingham's original Latin verse contributions to the Poemata Varii Argumenti. It will do so in an attempt to disprove two claims: 1) that Dillingham's talent lay in criticism rather than in original composition (Waters); 2) that his Latin poetry shows his complete independence of the old school of classical imitation (Bradner). It has the twofold aim of highlighting both the classical and the contemporary intertexts with which this hitherto neglected poetry engages. It will argue that far from constituting the leisurely product of a gentleman in rustic retirement, this is highly talented verse that "sports" with the classics in several ways: first in its self-consciously playful interaction with the Latin poets of Augustan Rome, chiefly Virgil and Ovid; second in its appropriation of a classical world and its linguistic medium to describe such seventeenth-century sports or pastimes as bowling, horticulture, and bell-ringing. It will also foreground the pseudoromanticism surprisingly inherent in the work of a late- seventeenth-century poet, who, it will be argued, discovered in his twilight years a neo-Latin inspirational Muse. 79 Idem de Luscinia, eodem Interprete {Poemata Varii Argumenti, 163-164).

That the sport was O a popular pastime in seventeenth-century England is attested by, for example, the Diary of John Evelyn1 or such works as Robert Howlett's The School of Recreation (1696).2 Dillingham's bowling-match, however, is recreated not in vernacular prose, but in Latin verse. The choice of linguistic medium can only serve to enhance the mock-epic qualities of a poem that reinvents and appropriates a classical world to a seventeenth- century setting. And it does so on a generic as well as a topographical level. For while, as noted below, the poem looks back to classical precedent, and especially to the games of Virgil, Aeneid 5,3 it also assumes a place within a miniature neo-Latin genre that had already begun to come to prominence in the Renaissance: the Latin verse- description of sports and pastimes. Furthermore, it may have helped to inaugurate in England a neo-Latin and vernacular tradition of bowling- green verse, in which the classical and the contemporary are juxtaposed and reconciled albeit in rather different ways. As Bradner has noted, the hallmark of the neo-Latin sports poem is its skillful presentation of a familiar object or pastime in a strange 1 Cf. John Evelyn: Diary, ed. E.S. De Beer (Oxford, 1955), m, 68: "11 June 1652 About 4 in the afternoone, beeing at bowles on the Greene;" Diary, HI, 219: "14 Aug 1658 We went to a challenged match to Durdens to Bowles for 10 pounds, which we wonn."

Thus at the close of that century Joseph Addison was able to include in his Musae Anglicanae5 neo-Latin poems on such activities as bullbaiting,6 cockfighting,7 and skating,8 while in the following century Latin poems on handball and football were anthologized by Edward Popham in his Selecta Poemata Anglorum Latina (1 774). 9 Although some are obviously more successful than others, all are united in their appropriation of the language of classical Rome to describe various sporting activities in a contemporary English setting. They are moreover characterized by the mock-epic heroism in which the seemingly trivial is enshrouded. Perhaps most strikingly Addison' s Latin poem Sphaeristerium takes bowls as its subject, not without a backward glance at Dillingham' s piece,10 which directly preceded it in the pirated Examen Poeticum Duplex (1698). n Both works may owe some debt to Thomas Masters's Mensa Lubrica (1658), a Latin poem on the Shovel Board12 (the ancestor of the modern American game of shuffle board), significantly anthologized by Dillingham in his projected though 4 Bradner, Musae Anglicanae, 221. 5 On Addison' s anthology and on his own neo-Latin verse contributions to the same, see Estelle Haan, Vergilius Redivivus: Studies in Joseph Addison' s Latin Poetry (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 95.2 [Philadelphia, 2005]), passim. 6 Francis Knapp, Taurus in Circo {Musae Anglicanae n, 80-84). 7 Joseph Friend, Pugna Gallorum Gallinaceorum (Musae Anglicanae H, 85-90). 8 Philip Frowde, Cursus Glacialis (Musae Anglicanae H, 145-147). 9 See Arthur Bedford, Lusus Pilae Palmariae and Anon., Pila Pedalis in Selecta Poemata Anglorum, Seu Sparsim Edita, Seu Hactenus Inedita, ed.

Bradner, Musae Anglicanae, 204, overstates the question of "influence" by asserting that Dillingham's poem "was probably inspired" by Masters's piece, and that "either he [Dillingham] or Masters was, in turn, the cause of Addison' s later Sphaeristerium" On possible points of contact, however, between Masters and Dillingham and between Masters and Addison, see Haan, Vergilius Redivivus: Studies in Joseph Addison' s Latin Poetry, 93-103.</page><page sequence="24">Sporting with the Classics 19 unpublished Poemata Selecta.13 But it was the game of bowling in particular that would function, and perhaps surprisingly so, as an inspirational muse for subsequent vernacular and neo-Latin poets. Francis Quarles, for example, extols the sport in English verses included by Robert Howlett in his description of bowling in The School of Recreation (1698).14 And the trend continued into the eighteenth century exemplified perhaps most notably by William Somervile's "The Bowling-Green" (1727),15 the neo-Latin Sphaeromachia: Anglice Bowling (1743) "by a gentleman, late of Balliol College, Oxford",16 John Marchands 'The Bowling-Green Or Trade Fortuitous" (1753),17 and Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green" (1774).18 In this later tradition the very sport of bowling can hold a mirror up to society and humankind in general. For Marchant it functions as an allegory of commercial enterprise: "thus Trade may be termed the Green,"19 while for Richard Seymour it is "the Emblem of the World."20 But if we are to trace the father of this miniature genre it is to sixteenth-century Italy that we must turn.

Vida' s poem was very well known in England from the late sixteenth century onwards, and was actually anthologized by Dillingham in the second part of the Poemata Varii Argumenti (1678) as if to complement his own bowling poem.22 There is evidence to suggest, moreover, that it had already made a not insignificant impact upon such neo-Latin poets as Thomas Watson, whose Amintae Gaudia (London, 1592), included as Eclogue 6 a battle between Jupiter and Pluto, and introduced the whole by the gift of a chess set, with the battle itself depicted in terms of the movements on a chessboard.23 Crucially, the neo- Latin sports poem provided such eighteenth-century vernacular writers as Alexander Pope with the germ and the paragon of the mock-epic battle most skillfully epitomized perhaps by the card game brilliantly described in the Rape of the Lock III.24 Something of this generic awareness can be seen to underlie Samuel Bentley' s rather self-conscious statement concerning his so-called disassociation from neo-Latin precedent. Speaking of his vernacular poem "The Bowling-Green," he proclaims: The Bowling-Green is one of the latest productions; and how the Public may be pleased with the versification, the conduct, and mechanical parts of it, I cannot pretend to say: but as I think very little has been written upon the subject, it will be found, at least, to be an original: very little of the machinery of antiquity made use of by Vida in his Schaccia [sic], could be introduced into it; nor could much be gathered from Mr. Addison, who only gives us the 25 outlines of the diversion of the Bowling-Green in his Sphaeristerium. 21 See The Game of Chess: Marco Girolamo Vida1 s Scacchia Ludus, ed. with introduction and notes by M.A. Di Cesare (Bibliotheca Humanística &amp; Reformatorica 13: Nieuwkoop, 1975). 22 Poemata Varii Argumenti, 134-154.

And we can read between the lines: the sports-poem, whether in Latin or English, was expected to implement the "machinery of antiquity,"26 a methodology epitomized in Italy and England by Vida and Addison respectively. In fact Bentley' s associated claim to originality falls rather flat as does his dismissal of Addison' s treatment of the subject of bowls. Whether he knew of Dillingham's Latin poem remains unknown. The Suleianum, like the majority of Dillingham's original Latin verse, can be dated to the 1680s when he was living in pseudoretirement at Oundle, a period during which he shared such poetry with his friends and acquaintances. And this is particularly pertinent in this instance. Included among his unpublished poetic anthology Poemata Selecta is an anonymous Latin poem entitled Sphaeristerium,21 which likewise takes bowling as its subject and was composed at Oundle. Signed "This for his reverend friend, Dr Dillingham at Oundale," this quasi-Ovidian Latin piece is cast in elegiacs as opposed to hexameters, the traditional meter of the neo-Latin sports poem. While the respective chronology of, and relationship between, this poem and Suleianum may be impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy (although it is tempting to regard it as a response to Dillingham's piece), it is interesting to note that it likewise eroticizes the role of the jack, albeit on a much more extensive level, depicting it as a second Penelope, about whom swarm a multitude of suitors, the bowls themselves. While transporting the whole to Ithaca, this rather skillful poem transforms the archery competition set by Penelope for her suitors28 into a bowling match not entirely dissimilar to that depicted in Suleianum. Indeed, as noted below, there are some further links between the two poems as, like the bowlers themselves, one poet seems to strive to outdo his opponent. As such Dillingham's piece takes its place within, and engages with, a complex intertextual network. Despite this disclaimer, as it were, Bentley in the poem proper invokes the Muse "Who taught the bards of old in lofty strains,/To sing heroical Olympic plains;/The noble champions bidding them rehearse/And praise the victors in immortal verse:/And in their songs made rapid chariots roll,/In swift contention for the distant goal" (Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 132, lines 1-6). 27 Poemata Selecta ex Autoribus qua Veteribus, qua Neotericis amplius Quadraginta fere non tarn in vulgus nota; quaedam nunc primum edita (BL Sloane 1766, ff 328- 329V). 28 See Homer, Odyssey 21. 75-77.</page><page sequence="27">22 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry Suleianum is addressed to Charles Fane (1635-1691), third Earl of Westmorland.29 The bowling green upon which this neo-Latin game is played is that of the Earl's residence at Sulehay Lodge30 to the west of Oundle and eight miles west of Peterborough. Bradner regards this "definite local setting" as rendering the piece more pleasing than the comparable poems by Masters and Addison,31 a viewpoint surely open to question. Addison' s poem in particular is a highly skillful piece especially in terms of its engagement with the Virgilian poetic corpus.32 Situated on a raised level with a prospect of valleys and fields below and beside a bridge and stream,33 the setting of Dillingham' s match (and hence of the poem) conforms to the ideal location for a bowling green as recommended by Samuel Bentley, who proclaims: Let distant prospects open to the sight Let it not low, or in a bottom lie, Nor yet its elevation be too high; Between the two extremes with nicest care, And with exactness form the oblong square.34 He advocates that the site be neither too low nor too high,35 but that it should constitute a rustic, rural setting of surrounding fields, trees and 29 Ad Illustrissimum Carolum Westmorliandiae Comitem. 30 Sulehay Lodge was presented to Catherine Howard by Henry VIE (as part of her wedding gift). Little of that dwelling survives. The present house was constructed on the site of the original stables. 31 Bradner, Musae Anglicanae, 204. 32 See Haan, Vergilius Redivivus: Studies in Joseph Addison' s Latin Poetry, 88-103. 33 Cf.

Significantly, however, it is a locus amoenus with a difference. In the punning phrase Aufonias ... ripas (1) the world of Ausonian pastoral has been transported to England, transformed as it now is into the banks of the river Avon, while the traditional shade afforded the shepherd by trees39 has become the clubhouse, the gratíssima fessis/umbra viris (27-28), from which the puer retrieves, and in which he stores the bowls as though he were penning his sheep in their fold.40 Likewise the shepherds of classical pastoral have been replaced, if not to some degree displaced, by the nobility, a generosa cohors (14).41 36 Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 133, lines 9-12: "Let lofty trees in proper places rise,/To screen the ground-plot from inclement skies:/Trees from the cold, and blighting winds defend;/And from too scorching heats a shelter lend." Cf.

The quasi-pastoral subtext is highlighted by an anonymous translator of the poem, who reworks this line as "This is the place, wherein the boy doth keep/By night, as in a field, his wooden sheep" (38- 39).

Cf. Masters, Mensa Lubrica 4: ubi sepositis placuerunt otia curis. Pope, Rape of the Lock 3.9-10: "Hither the Heroes and the Nymphs resort,/To taste awhile the Pleasures of a Court."

On bowling as a game reserved for the upper classes, cf. the highlighting in the Anon., Sphaeromachia that the competitors constitute Armigerique Equitesque (5) and the associated injunction that the common people betake themselves afar: vos, o vulgares animi, procul este profani;/accipiat nullas tali Plebecula sorores (7-8), itself a parodie echo of the injunction uttered by classical priests and priestesses, urging the uninitiated to steer clear of a religious</page><page sequence="29">24 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry In fact that "pleasing" quality highlighted by Bradner manifests itself in the poem in a variety of ways: in, for example, the stunned reaction of the natural world to a lawn roller or to the frantic fervor, antics and activities of impassioned competitors in the match itself; in the personification of the jack as a female whose magnetism, so to speak, attracts the bowls themselves, and who wins the admiration and veneration of the bowling and indeed bowing participants; in the mock- heroic grandeur of a sport that becomes an epic battle of sorts; in the homely realistic description of aspects of the sport itself: the comparative weight of the bowls, the rest afforded by the clubhouse, the physical contortions of the players as each urges his bowl along the green; in the evocation of a range of classical games via an explicit simile, and also intertextually in terms of the piece's interaction with Aeneid 5. Hand in hand with the poem's inherent pastoralism is Dillingham' s presentation of the pristine innocence of the landscape before it was leveled into a bowling green. This is conveyed in language {terra olim agricolae duros experta labores [6])42 evocative of the world of Virgil's Georgics, whose farmers operate under a cycle motivated by labor {redit agricolis labor actus in orbem [Georg. 2.40 1]).43 That implicit Romanitas is appropriated to describe the green itself which is, as it were, girt {cincta [7]) with armor in preparation for a battle of sorts. That armor constitutes in effect the protection of the turf itself, which functions as a "green toga"44 clothing a landscape {et viridi donata toga de cespite puro [8])45 that is now preparing itself for a sport {ludus [9]) or ceremony. Cf. Virgil, Aen. 6. 258-259; Horace, Odes 3.1. William Somervile's "The Bowling Green" satirically categorizes such upper-class competitors as attorneys (17); parsons (18); whigs, papists, and high-flyers (19); aldermen and squires (20); quacks and writers (21). 42 For the line-ending, cf. Virgil, Georg. 4.340: altera turn primos Lucinae experta labores. All quotations are from Virgil: Georgics, ed. R.F. Thomas (Cambridge, 1988), 2 vols. 43 Contrast Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 134, lines 2-4: "For there the softest mossy grass is found/Where browse the sheep, and the sweet-breathing cow,/Untouch'd, uninjur'd by the galling plow." 44 Cf. Dillingham' s appropriation of the toga metaphor on a linguistic level to describe Theodore Bathurst's Latin verse rendering of Spenser's The Shepheardes Calendar. See 10 above. 45 Cf. Antoine- Joseph Dezallier d' Argen ville, The Theory and Practice of Gardening (London, 1728), 77: "A Bowling-Green is one of the most agreeable Compartments of a Garden, and, when 'tis rightly placed, nothing is more pleasant to the Eye.

But is not this a rather incongruous marriage between the rural and the civic, between the world of nature and that of human industry? The flattening of the land is depicted in terms suggestive of the gradual civilization of humankind and the recourse to pseudoindustrial activities evocative of an iron as opposed to a golden age. The natural landscape has been reworked, refined, and remolded to accommodate man-made constructions. Thus the waters of Avon are "compelled to bear the yoke" that is Wansford's bridge (cogitar unda/ferre iugum [1-2]) as though the river itself constituted a beast of burden now shouldering an anti-pastoral, anti-georgic weight. And the site is somewhat artificially hedged off (postquam ciucia est vivae munimine sepis [7])46 and flattened by a stone roller (volubile saxum [12])47 to prevent any tufts of grass from impeding the course of the bowls themselves (12-13).48 The lines may have suggested Addison's equivalent though much more pejorative description of the relentless sickle (improba faix [5])49 and the lawn roller (saxum versatile [Sphaeristerium 7]) that ruthlessly level the surrounding quasi-pastoral 46 Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 135, lines 6-12: "Lo! Round the green, the flow'ry shrubs arise :/See flaunting wood-bines pendulous in air./Beneath the laurel see the lily fair,/The purple vi'let and the blushing rose,/And all the graces Flora can disclose ;/Far-stretch' d the walks extend amid' the flow'rs/Thro' clumps, thro' groves, and ever-verdant bow'rs." For Dillingham's elaborate description of a hedge (and its associated topiary), cf. Sepes Hortensis discussed in chapter 4 below. 47 Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 138, lines 15-20: "The buskin'd horse must with fit tackle bound,/Drag the huge roller turning slowly round;/This way and that way rolling shall the stone,/Make all the green its heavy pressure own,/Hard make the turf, and spread each mossy blade/ Effacing ev'ry stroke the scythe has made." 48 Cf.

Beneath each Stroke the peeping Flow'rs decay, And all th' unripen'd Crop is swept away. The heavy Roller next he tugs along, Whifs his short Pipe, or reals a rural Song.51 Later in Dillingham' s poem the contrast between pastoral innocence and civilization, as it were, is highlighted in the personified landscape (itself clad in a green toga [8]) marveling at its new occupants clad in yellow (10).52 For these novi ... coloni (10) now seem to displace the agrícola (6) of old. The theme resurfaces toward the end of the poem in the groaning of the mountains and the terror experienced by a Nymph upon hearing the noise of applause (94-96).53 Such applause is only one part of the essential realism that lies at the heart of Suleianum, and it is to this that we now turn. The poem emphasizes that bowling games generally occur on prescribed days 50 Addison, Sphaeristerium 5-8: improba faix noctis parva incrementa prioris/desecat, exiguam radens a caespite messem;/tum motu assiduo saxum versatile terram/deprimit exstantem et surgentes atterit herbas. On the anti-pastoral and Virgilian dimension of these lines, see Haan, Vergilius Redivivus: Studies in Joseph Addison' s Latin Poetry, 91-92. Cf. Anon., Sphaeromachia 2-3: planities quam .../laevigat aequali quacunque ex parte Cylindw, Anon., Sphaeristerium 21- 22: et subigit crassus tubercula quaeque cylindrus/nec salebra in torso surgat iniqua solo. Cf. Arthur Bedford's description of the flattening of the handball alley in Lusus Pilae Palmariae 3-4: et versatile saxum/surgentem in nodos, planum depressit in aequor. 51 William Somervile, "The Bowling Green," 5-10. 52 miraturque novos aurata veste colonos (10). This is in all likelihood a reference to the color of the sporting outfit worn by the bowling team. Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 139, lines 9-10: "Then groups of bowlers thronging shall be seen,/And glowing figures animate the Green." Dillingham strikes an ironic parallel between the bowlers clad in golden garb and the landscape endowed with a green "toga" of smooth turf {et viridi donata toga de cespite puro [8]). 53 totusque remugit/mons circum; trepidai mediis exterrita silvis/Nympha loquax, dubitans tanti quae causa triumphi (94-96).

Thus the competitors are divided into two teams (in partes itur [16])55 in a mock-heroic battle of sorts. For the opposing sides are described in allegorical terms as the rival Florentine aristocratic56 factions Guelphs and Ghibellines, but with their fury now appeased57 even if their political sparring is perhaps mirrored on a microcosmic level. Dillingham conveys the fact that bowling is a betting sport, warning: nimio si pignore certes Jcorrumpis ludum ne sit sincera voluptas (20-2 1).58 And other such elements of realism occur: in highlighting, for example, the respective weights of individual bowls:59 a 54 This is expanded by the anonymous translator of Dillingham' s poem in Bodl. MS Eng. Misc.d.L, ff 45-47, at f. 45, lines 19-21: "Hither the Gentry, when they would with play,/Unbend theire cares, on a sun-shiny day,/Twice in a week resort." Cf. Anon., Sphaeromachia 9-12: sacculus antiquam referens producitur Urnam,/ indice designans sumpto certamina Talo,/in binas acies; veros disiungit Amicos/partibus oppositis; John Marchant, "The Bowling Green," 9-12: "But trifle no Time in Debate;/We Six must be Three against Three;/So hussle the Lots in a Hat,/ And see who the Partners shall be;" William Somervile, "The Bowling Green," 24: "disposed in Pairs;" Anon., Pila Pedalis 7: in partes seceditur. 56 The inclusion of a simile pertaining to the aristocracy is appropriate in view of the fact that the competitors in the bowling match itself constitute a generosa cohors (14). 57 in partes itur; tu Guelfus esto,/hic Gibelinus erit, furiis tarnen ante remotis (Suleianum 16-17). Cf. Deborah Parker's allegorical reading of the tenth canto of Dante's Inferno as a dramatized reconstruction of the political debate between Guelphs and Ghibellines (Lectura Dantis: Inferno X, in Lectura Dantis 1. no. 1 [Fall, 1987], 37-47). Addison alludes to a division among the bowling teams that may occur either intentionally or accidentally (in partes turbam distinxerat aequas/consilium aut pars [Sphaeristerium 18-19]). Cf. William Somervile, "The Bowling Green" 35: "The Champions, or Consent, or Chance divide." The element of "chance" involved may allude to the practice of drawing lots to determine the composition of the teams. Cf. Anon., Sphaeromachia 9-12 cited in note 55 above. 58 Cf. Anon., Sphaeromachia 5-6: quos aemulus ardor/impulit ad pugnas, aurique insana cupido; Richard Seymour, The Compleat Gamester, 323-324: "The best Sport in it, is the Gamesters, and he enjoys it most who looks on and bets nothing. . . . Have a Care you are not in the first Place rooked out of your Money;" Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 141, lines 7-8: "Agree what premium shall reward the game,/Less for the prize ambitious than for fame;" 141, lines 13-16: "Ah! Let no great pecuniary prize,/Depress the bowler's breast, nor damp his joys;/Let not fell gaming with delusive face,/The noble bowling exercise disgrace." Bentley follows this with a diatribe against "Gaming, thou fiend!" 59 Cf. Robert Howlett, The School of Recreation (London, 1696), 95: "The first and greatest Cunning to be observed in Bowling, is the right chusing your Bowl, which must be suitable to the Grounds you design to run on."</page><page sequence="33">28 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry bowl with a heavier amount of metal can roll in a curve (25-26),60 whereas a lighter bowl can proceed in a straight line (46-47).61 We hear of the role of the clubhouse (domus [27]) as a source of shade and refreshment for the weary competitors and also as a store room for the bowls themselves (27-29).62 Emphasis is placed on the key role played by the jack (meta),63 which now metaphorically assumes the role of the 60 lateri immisum quas fusile plumbum/et docuit solidare gradas et ducere gyros (Suleianum 25-26). Cf. Addison, Sphaeristerium 14-15: quae infuso multum inclinata metallo/vertitur in gyros et iniquo tramite curriv, Masters, Mensa Lubrica 27: seu plumbi ignavi massa est seu divitis aurv, Anon., Sphaeristerium 39: adduntur lateri plumbi libramina fusi; William Somervile, "The Bowling Green," 28: "Here weighty Lead infus'd directs their Course;" Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 140, lines 11-12: "One side is light, and one is heavy found/Giving the bias as it circles round." 61 minimi quae conscia plumbi/radit iter laevum interior (Suleianum 46-47). Cf. Addison, Sphaeristerium 16-17: quam parcius urget/plumbea vis motuque sinit procedere recto. 62 stat iuxta domus exilis, gratíssima fessis/umbra viris; eadem ludentibus arma ministratf/hinc puer expromit sphaeras, hie nocte recondit (Suleianum 27-29). Addison describes perspiring bowlers in search of breeze and shade (lenia iam zephyri spirantes frigora et umbrae/captantur, vultuque fluens abstergitur umor [Sphaeristerium 65-66]). Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 136, lines 12-18: "Behold the graceful attic story rise!/With easy turnings flights of steps are seen,/And the neat structure decorates the green:/Thither the pleas'd spectators may repair,/Below sit warm, above enjoy the air;/Here, too, the bowlers may their spirits chear,/Whene'er fatigue, or languor shall appear." 63 protinus emittit nullo molimine sphaeram/exiguam (Suleianum 35-36). Cf. seu circumducto metam contingere gyro (32); stringere metam (44); metaeque amplexibus haeret (48); abducit metam (93). Cf. Masters, Mensa Lubrica, 42: summa gaudet consistere meta', Anon., Sphaeromachia 15-16: facili conamine metam/currentem primus per Sphaeristeria mittit. In Addison, the jack, an orbiculus (20), flies forth to assume this function (evolat orbiculus, quae cursum meta futurum/designat [20-21]). Cf. stipantque frequentia metam (Sphaeristerium, 27); metae inclinata recumbit (Sphaeristerium, 47). Addison' s juxtaposition of meta and futurum, which does not occur in Virgil, may have been suggested by Dillingham' s phrase cursus haec meta futuri (Suleianum 36). On the key role of the jack, cf. John Marchant, "The Bowling Green," 13-16: "The Jack I will throw,/ And trace it along with my Bowl:/Hah! Rub-rub a thousand! -Where now!/How wide from the Jack does it roll?"; Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 140, lines 18-20 - 141, line 1: "And there the jack, diminutive in size:/'Tis at the jack the bowlers all must play,/And 'tis the jack directs the ready way/For each succeeding bowl." Meta is used of the football goal-post at Anon., Pila Pedalis 34.</page><page sequence="34">Sporting with the Classics 29 turning post in a Virgilian chariot or ship race.64 At the same time it is strikingly eroticized, as in a cleverly gendered inversion of proper names the traditionally termed "Jack" becomes "Helen" (haec Helena est [36]) courted by the bowls.65 Then in a wistful makarismos: "happy is the one ... who rests at last in her arms" (37-38).66 The erotic terms in which the jack is presented find an interesting parallel in the anonymous Sphaeristerium, which goes one stage further by eroticizing the entire game of bowls, presenting it as the courting of Penelope by her multitude of suitors.67 In Dillingham, however, this jack, this "Helen" becomes in effect a Nymph venerated by a virtually prostrate bowler (prono veneratur corpore Nympham [40]).68 But to obtain the object of such veneration the bowler must show versatility. Indeed the poem depicts the sheer variety of shots cast: the bowl that approaches stealthily, insinuating its way alongside the jack In Aeneid 5, prior to the ship race, Aeneas had established an oak marker as the meta: his viridem Aeneas frondenti ex ilice metam/constituit signum nautis pater (Aen. 5. 129-130). All quotations are from The Aeneid of Virgil, ed. R.D. Williams (New York, 1982), 2 vols. Cf. Homer, Iliad 23.327-330, in which the turning post is none other than a tree stump: "There stands, about a fathom's height above the ground, a dry stump, of oak or pine, which rots not in the rain, and two white stones on either side of it are firmly set against it at the turning of the course." Translation is that of A.T. Murray, Homer: Iliad, rev. W.F. Wyatt (Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1999), H, 517. At 23. 334-336 Nestor tells Antilochus: "Pressing hard on it drive your chariot and horses close, and yourself lean in your well-plaited chariot a little to the left of your pair" {ibid., 517). Cf. 23.338-340: "But let the near horse draw close to the post so that the hub of the well-made wheel seems to graze the surface" (ibid., 519). 65 Cf. metaeque amplexibus haeret (48). felix qui limine primo/e gr essus tandem illius requiescit in ulnis (37-38). i(haec Ithaci Coniunx esto" (sphaeramque minorem/proiicit) "haec vestris meta petenda globis" (25-26). The poem as a whole, and in particular the role played by the jack (Penelope) and the competing bowls (her suitors) seems to invert and develop Penelope's proclamation at Odyssey 21. 75-77: "Whichever man among you proves the handiest at stringing the bow and shoots an arrow through every one of these twelve axes, with that man I will go" (Homer, The Odyssey, trans. E.V. Rieu [Penguin, 1966], 317-318). Cf. Anon., Sphaeristerium 63-64: hie Dominae ante pedes conatu lassus anhelo/procumbit, speciem sed venerantis habet.

Cf. Addison, Sphaeristerium 28-29: iam cautius exit/et leviter sese insinuât revolubile lignum. Addison' s insinuât finds a parallel in Masters, Mensa Lubrica 50: spatio summo sese insinuavit. Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," 158, lines 1-2: "Insinuates itself without one shock,/ Now slow it creeps - yet creeps - to reach the block." 70 nunc festinantem vocis moderatur habena {Suleianum 56). Cf. Anon., Sphaeromachia 25-26: insequitur currentem, atque anxius imminet orbi,/ obiurgatque fugas, et dot convitia Ugno. This is followed (at 28-32) by a simile of Apollo' s pursuit of Daphne. 71 ignavum et sine honore globum nunc increpat (Suleianum 57). Cf.

Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 149, lines 7-8: "Devious it wanders, and still goes astray ,/Wider and wider, from its destin'd way." 73 Cf. Addison, Sphaeristerium 40: distorto corpore', Francis Quarles, "See how their curved Bodies wreath, and skrue/Such Antick shapes as Proteus never knew," cited in Robert Howlett, The School of Recreation, 96; Charles Cotton, The Compleat Gamester, 223: "Never did Mimick scrue his Body into all the Forms these Men do theirs; and it is an Article of their Creed, that the bending back of the Body, or scruing in of their Shoulders, is sufficient to hinder the Over-speed of the Bowl, and that the running after it adds to its Speed;" Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling-Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 145, lines 1-4: "This twists, and wreaths, in attitude of pain,/While his bowl travels o'er the level plain;/And like the sun-flow'r turning tow'rds the sun,/Turns, as he wishes that his bowl may run." 74 Cf.

Cf. Dugald Stewart, Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind (London, 1792- 1827), HI, 172-173: "A person, for example, who plays at bowls, and who is deeply interested in the game, while he follows the bowl with the eye, naturally accompanies its deflections from the rectilinear course, with correspondent motions of his body; although it cannot well be imagined, that, in doing so, he conceives himself to be projected from his own hand, and rolling along the ground like the object about which his thoughts are so strongly engrossed. Such, however, is his anxious solicitude about the event, that he cannot restrain his body from following in its [the bowl's] movements, the direction of his wishes; nor can he help fancying, while the event is yet in suspense, that it is in his power to forward it by a verbal expression of his wish, or even by a mental expression of his will." Interestingly Stewart cites Addison, Sphaeristerium 26-43, in support of his argument. 75 The phrase echoes Virgil, Eel 8.108 (of deluded lovers) an, qui amant ; ipsi sibi somnia fìngunt? For satirical criticism of this attempt by the bowlers to influence the movement of the bowls, cf. Charles Cotton, The Compleat Gamester, 224: "How senseless these Men appear, when they are speaking Sense to their Bowls, putting Confidence in their Intreaties for a good Cast!" Cf. William Somervile, "The Bowling Green," 106-107: "Alas! How frail is ev'ry mortal Scheme!/We build on Sand, our Happiness a Dream." Cf. Dugald Stewart, Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, HI, 173: "Hence it is, that when the bowl takes a wrong bias, he is apt to address it, as if it could listen to, or obey his voice; - his body, in the mean time, not, as before, accompanying the motion of the bowl, but eagerly bending to the opposite side of the mark." 76 Cf. Addison, Sphaeristerium 36-37: nee risus tacuere globus cum volvitur actus/infami iactu; Masters, Mensa Lubrica 29-30: dextram comitatur inertem/et pudor, et risus, cassique infamia iactus. Cf.

Addison, Spectator 279 (19 January 1712: ed.

At times the behavior of several of Virgil's sports participants is mirrored or conflated in an individual bowler's action or reaction. Even before the game proper a Virgilian intertext is signaled. As the rival bowling teams are established, the terms and conditions of the match are expounded (16-26) and epitomized in the following proclamation: sed ñeque pro nuda iubeo te laude pacisci (19). The statement recalls and inverts the quasi-heroic gravity afforded the participants in Virgil's ship race, in which the leaders strive to retain the glory of their positional advantage (vitamque volunt pro laude pacisci (Aen. 5. 230). But in this bowling game neither greed (avaritia [18]) nor glory (laus [19]) are to act as the motivating force.78 Instead two types of prizes are recommended: one for the victor and a consolation prize for the loser, a custom which in itself is described as one pertaining to the ancients (veterum ritus [22]).79 Both this and more generally the role of herald in Dillingham' s poem recall the introductory announcements and subsequent actions of Aeneas.80 Before the foot race, for example, Aeneas promises gifts (muñera [5.247]) for all the runners (nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit [Aen. 5.305]),81 while after the race he not only announces the prizes to be awarded to first, second and third place, but also presents a consolation prize to Salius82 and a special prize to Nisus.83 Likewise in announcing the boxing competition (Aen. 78 Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 141, lines 7-8: "Agree what premium shall reward the game,/Less for the prize ambitious than for fame." 79 laudo tarnen veterum ritus qui muñera bina/praemia victori statuunt solatia victo (Suleianum 22-23). Cf. Samuel Bentley, "The Bowling Green," Poems on Various Occasions, 131, lines 7-8: "And while each artist for the prize contends/The victor, and the vanquished, still are friends." 80 In the anonymous Sphaeristerium this role is assumed by a female, Penelope herself: orbibus hie positis, "hoc" inquit f emina "ludo/seria sunt vobis iam peragenda, procL/haec Ithaci Coniunx esto" (sphaeramque minorem/proiicit) (23- 26). 81 Cf.

Thus as Sylvius takes the initiative (primus ibi ante omnes in arenam Sylvius heros/descendit [30-31]) he resembles both Gyas in the ship race (effugit ante alios primisque elabitur undis [Aen. 5.151]) and more strikingly Nisus, who takes the lead in the foot race and darts ahead in front of the others (primus abit longeque ante omnia corpora Nisus/emicat [Aen. 5.318-319]). But where Gyas and Nisus fail, Sylvius will eventually succeed. And Dillingham actually names another of the competitors Nisus, the bowler par excellence, than whom no one is more outstanding whether in casting a bowl, in reaching the jack, in dislodging an opponent's throw, or in outrunning an opponent's shot (43-45).87 His Nisus, however, recalls yet another Virgilian competitor. Nisus' s bowl, because of its lesser amount of lead, can follow an inner left-hand path (radit iter laevum meliorque priorem/detrudit spatio [47-48]).88 This personified bowl89 recalls the behavior (in Virgil's ship race) of Cloanthus, who had likewise traced an inside path to the left (radit iter laevum interior [5. 170]), steering in-between the ship of Gyas and the 84 Sic ait, et geminum pugnae proponit honorem/victori velatum auro vittisque iuvencum/ensem atque insignem galeam solada victo (Aen. 5.365-367). 85 On the personification of the bowls, cf. their equation with erotically resplendent dancers (sphaeras splendore coruscas [24]) taught how to dance in circles (ducere gyros [26]). 86 Addison uses the verb emicat (Sphaeristerium 25) to describe a series of bowls suddenly cast one after the other. excipit hunc Nisus, quo non praestantior alter/sive globum versare manu seu stringere metam/sive hostem turbare loco seu vincere cursu (Suleianum 43-45). Line 43 may contain a proleptic irony since it recalls Misenum Aeoliden, quo non praestantior alter (Aen. 6. 164), who died when he challenged Triton to a trumpet contest. Compare Arthur Bedford's description of one of the competitors in a handball match at Lusus Pilae Palmariae 29-30: hie forte astabat quo non praestantior alter/aut torquere pilam, propriae aut iactantior artis. 88 In Addison, a weakly cast bowl traces a path (radit iter [24]), tending toward a slight curve until, its original force gradually expended, it comes to rest: at ilia/ leniter effusa exiguum quod ducit in orbem/radit iter, donee sensim primo impete fesso/ subsistât (Sphaeristerium, 22-25). 89 Cf. Pope's personification of playing cards in Rape of the Lock 3.44: "Draw forth to Combat on the Velvet Plain."</page><page sequence="39">34 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry rocks themselves, and thereby overtaking him.90 Whereas in Virgil, Cloanthus passed Gyas (who until then was in first position [priorem [170]) and left the meta behind {metis ... relictis [171]), Dillingham' s bowl dislodges the leader {priorem [47]) from its space, and in pseudoerotic language clings to the meta. Likewise wayward shots cast by faltering bowlers {seu titubante pede et duplicato tramite vectus [73]) seem to recall tottering and stumbling participants in their Virgilian counterpart: the athletic Nisus slipping in blood {Aen. 5.328-329)91 or the stumbling boxer Entellus (Aen. 5.447-448).92 Such Virgilian intertexts, it might be argued, afford a level of grandeur to the game itself and as such contribute to the mock-heroic tone. This is also achieved by the Romanization of the whole. Dillingham' s very brief reference to the palaestra (81) equates the bowlers with Roman wrestlers, whose custom it was to oil themselves before engaging in the palaestra (9). The theme is developed by Addison,93 whose bowls run over a verdant palaestra {Sphaeristerium [9]) and are described as "anointed" and "glistening with oil" {uncta, nitens oleo [Sphaeristerium 10]). Indeed Sphaeristerium was a term employed in classical architecture to indicate a large space or room attached to the Roman baths {thermae). Here bathers would play ball games (usually prior to having a bath),94 wash, and perhaps anoint 90 Aen. 5. 169-171: Ule inter navemque Gyae scopulosque sonantis/radit iter laevum interior subitoque priorem/praeterit et metis tenet aequora tuta relictis. The phrase recurs later in the ship race as Mnestheus is compared to a dove skimming its way in clear light without any movement of its swift wings: mox aere lapsa quieto/r adit iter liquidum céleris ñeque commovet alas {Aen. 5. 216-217). 91 levi cum sanguine Nisusãabitur infelix {Aen. 5.328-329).

Pope, Dunciad 2.69- 74 where Curii slips and falls in a pool of excrement. 92 ipse gravis graviterque ad terram pondere vasto/concidit {Aen. 5.447-448). 93 See Haan, Vergilius Redivivus: Studies in Joseph Addison' s Latin Poetry, 92-94. 94 On ball games and Roman baths cf., for example, Pliny, Epist. 3.1.8: ubi hora bolinei nuntiata est (est autem hieme nona, aestate octava), in sole, si caret vento, ambulai nudus. deinde movetur pila vehementer et diu; nom hoc quoque exercitationis genere pugnai cum senectute. lotus accubat et paulisper cibum differì.

Roman thermae possessed a palaestra of their own, a general peristylar sports area to which might be annexed the sphaeristerium itself.95 Ultimately, however, it is in the description of bowling as an epic battle and of the bowls themselves as warring heroes96 that the mock- heroic comes to the fore. This is achieved by the implementation of a military metaphor throughout. Thus the bowls constitute "arms" {arma [28])97 to be used against the "enemy."98 The bowler must burst through QQ (perrumpere [34]) the hostiles ... turmas (34), and dislodge the enemy (hostem turbare loco [45]). Such an attempt is presented as the wish to remove an opponent from his position on a wall that is now captured {Ule volens capto Nisum detrudere muro [6 1]),100 but when unsuccessful the bowler can only waste his strength upon the empty breezes {inque auras vires effundit inanes [62]). The successful bowler is a hero {Sylvius heros [30]) possessed of ideal Roman qualities {multa virtute insignis et arte [3 1]),101 and the winning shot is one which dissipates the enemy 95 On the association of sports with Roman baths, see John Ward, Roman Era in Britain (London, 191 1), 96: "Physical exercise was a concomitant of the bath. Even domestic baths sometimes had their tennis-court {sphaeristerium), as had Pliny's. In most of the public baths there was a spacious court (palaestra) with porticoes, exedrae, swimming-bath, etc., and other conveniences for outdoor recreation, ball- playing being a favourite pastime."

In language reminiscent of the behavior of Virgil's bees, bowls encircling the jack are likened to Roman youths in camp protecting their leader.104 Here, as elsewhere in Dillingham, they do so in a clever fusion of the inanimate and the animate. And as Sylvius casts his winning shot, he becomes a second Jupiter of sorts, brandishing a weapon from a hand of thunder (fulminea vibrata manu [[90]). 105 Nonetheless he is proclaimed by the 102 Cf. William Somervile, "The Bowling Green," 183: "Bowls dash'd on Bowls confounded all the Plain;" 192: "And heaps on heaps are thrown;" Anon., Pila Pedalis 21-22: corpora turn passim, nequicquam fortia, campo/sternuntur; Pope, Rape of the Lock 3.80: "With Throngs promiscuous strew the level green." 103 Both Virgil and Addison employ an epic simile (that of a chariot race). In Aeneid 5, as the signal is given for the commencement of the ship race, the rowers advance. Their movement is compared to that of chariots (non tarn praecipites biiugo certamine campum/corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus [Aen. 5. 144-145]). Virgil continues: nee sic immissis aurigae undantia lora/concussere iugis pronique in verbera pendent (Aen. 5. 146-147). Cf. Iliad 23. 362-372, in which the charging horses quickly leave the ships behind. In Addison, as a rival tries to get the upper hand against his opponent, whose hit is resting alongside the jack, he stoutly casts his bowl: its power and speed are compared to a charioteer leaving the starting gate at Elis, and seeing buildings whizzing past: haud ita prosiliens Eleo carcere pernix/auriga invehitur cum raptus ab axe citato/currentesque domos videi et fugientia teda (Sphaeristerium 52-54).

Masters, Mensa Lubrica 8-10: Romani credas spatium te cerneré Circi/aut stadium Elei, lustro redeunte, TonantisJutque Coloratas mirata est Roma Quadrigas; Mensa Lubrica 38-42: vere Ule Argenteus orbisjet dignus splendore suo qui Carcere pernix/evolat et (cursum accedens tenui stridore )/lineolam post se linquit, neque limine Campi/contentus, summa gaudet consistere Meta. 104 Cf. Georgics 4.75-76: et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae/miscentur magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem. While Dillingham' s simile is very different from those employed by Virgil and Addison, it is interesting to note that lines 67-68 (tutaturque ducem, multoque satellite cingit./haud aliter Nisum sodi fido agmine cingunt ...) find a parallel in Addison, Sphaeristerium 55-56: si tarnen in duros, obstructa satellite multo, ñmpingat socios.

Their salutation evokes the concluding lines of Virgil's seventh Eclogue as Meliboeus announces: ex ilio Cory don Cory don est tempore nobis (Eel 7. 70). In his aims and aspirations, his manifold emotions, and his spirit of emulation perhaps a seventeenth-century bowler is not after all so very far removed from a Virgilian shepherd competitively producing his pastoral music.</page><page sequence="43">Chapter 2 Ringing Classical Bells: Campanae Undellenses Pastoral music lies at the very heart of Dillingham's Campanae Undellenses, which takes as its subject the peal and indeed the appeal of tolling bells. As such it is comparable perhaps with some vernacular verses prefixed to Thomas White's Tintinnalogia or The Art of Ringing (1671): What Musick is there that compar'd may be To well-tun' d Bells enchanting melody! Breaking with their sweet sound the willing Air, And in the list'ning ear the Soul ensnare; The ravisht Air such pleasure loth to lose, With thousand Echoes still prolongs each close; And gliding streams which in the Values trills, Assists its speed unto the neighbouring Hills.1 But the focus of Dillingham's poem is not so much on the actual bells themselves, but on the memories awakened in the listener, combined with an analysis of the accompanying emotional sensibilities. In this respect it seems somewhat ahead of its time, pre-empting as it does the treatment of the theme by eighteenth-century and Romantic poets. Such poets tend to emphasize both aural and emotional sensibilities, interrogating the effect of the tolling as it gradually wafts upon the breeze. And this operates on both a neo-Latin and a vernacular level. It is hardly a coincidence that in the mid-eighteenth century Dillingham's poem was anthologized by Vincent Bourne in his edition of the Musae Anglicanas? for Bourne himself would compose two Latin poems on the subject, not without a backward glance at Dillingham's treatment.3 1 "On the Ingenious Art of Ringing," prefixed to Thomas White, Tintinnalogia or The Art of Ringing (London, 1671), A3r. 2 Musae Anglicanae Editio Quinta (London, 1741), I, 244-248. 3 See in general Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, 100-103.</page><page sequence="44">40 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry Bourne's Certamen Musicum, first published in 1734,4 takes as its theme two different types of tolling produced by the bells of two Thames- side churches: St Mary-le-Bow and St Bride's (i.e., Wren's church on Fleet Street), which possess eight and twelve bells respectively. The tolling produced by the latter is light and swifter; that produced by the former is weighty and slower. Such a disparity is replicated both syntactically and rhythmically in a poem whose language mirrors the sounds themselves.5 Likewise Bourne's short Latin epigram on the theme, entitled Si Propius Stes, Te Capiet Minus? first published in 1743, shows how the harmony produced by the bells of St Mary Overie, London, is enhanced by the perspective of distance, thereby awakening enraptured awe in the listener. Or as George Orwell would later put it: All the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's; You owe me three farthings say the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing. But if the tolling bell awakens memories, so too does it epitomize timelessness itself. Or as T.S. Eliot states: 4 Poematia, Latine Partim Reddita, Partim Scripta: a V. Bourne, Collegii Trinitatis Apud Cantabrigienses Aliquando Socio (London, 1734), 140. 5 See Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, 100- 101. 6 Bourne's poem was first published in Poematia, Latine Partim Reddita, Partim Scripta: a V. Bourne, Collegii Trinitatis Apud Cantabrigienses Aliquando Socio Tertio Edita Adiectis ad Calcem Quibusdam Novis (London, 1743), 231. Its title inverts Horace's famous dictum (Ars Poetica 361-365) comparing reader response to poetry with the respective advantages afforded by closer and more distant perspectives of a painting. See Haan, Classical Romantic: Identity in the Latin Poetry of Vincent Bourne, 101-102. 7 George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four, ed. Bernard Crick (Oxford, 1984), 242. The St Clement's alluded to is either St Clement Danes or St Clement's Eastcheap, London. St Martin's is in all likelihood identifiable as St Martin-in-the Fields, London since 'five farthings' presumably refers to the moneylenders on St Martin's Lane.</page><page sequence="45">Ringing Classical Bells 41 The tolling bell Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried Ground swell, a time Older than the time of chronometers, older Than time counted by anxious worried women Lying awake, calculating the future, Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel And piece together the past and the future, Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception, The future futureless, before the morning watch When time stops and time is never ending; And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning, Clangs The bell.8 Indeed the timelessness of Dillingham's poem becomes apparent upon closer inspection. For while the piece is strangely forward-looking, so too does it cast a backward glance to things classical, more specifically to the Latin poetic corpus of Virgil, with which it interacts on a variety of levels. At times such interaction locates the piece in a pastoral world, at others in settings more accurately describable as georgic or heroic, now wistfully recollected and recreated. From the outset it is the quasi-pastoral that comes to the fore. The poem's opening lines are marked by their stillness and silence as outdoor activities and the accompanying din of the human voice have ceased. Such silence is mirrored in the natural world, conveyed by a series of negative statements: winds do not disturb the tranquil air {nulli tranquillum turbabant aera venti [3]) while the clouds do not dare to defile the clear sky {nee coelum audebant nubes temerare serenum [4]), the long vowel sounds recreating the stillness of the sound of silence that they celebrate. And the poem's dramatis personae are exiles who have lost a "pastoral" world in more than one sense. Having refused to subscribe to the Act of Uniformity, Dillingham had forfeited his posts as Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and as Vice-Chancellor of the University with the result that he was thereby stripped of the religious and pastoral duties associated with those positions. Now he is procul a Camo (9), a "new inhabitant" of an "old countryside" (veteris novus incola runs [9]), a lonely exile {solus ego [10]) even if he is in the company of a fellow exile Ferus (whose punning name is in fact a pseudonym for the ejected Presbyterian poet Robert Wild). In a sense they have in actuality 8 T.S. Eliot, "The Dry Salvages," I, 35-48. Text is that of T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets (London, 1979).</page><page sequence="46">42 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry realized a fate feared and experienced by such Virgilian shepherds9 as Meliboeus in Eclogue I10 and Moeris in Eclogue 9.11 In this instance, however, a lost pastoral paradise can perhaps be regained through the power of music and memory. United in exile, they sit in front of a hearth, reciting their rustic muses (solus ego en Férus atque meus consedimus una/ante focum, agrestes recitantes ordine musas [10-11]). And they do so in Virgilian terms: that consedimus reminiscent perhaps of such comments as those of Palaemon (in molli consedimus herba [Eel. 3.55]) or Menalcas (hie corylis mixtas inter consedimus ulmos? [Eel. 5.3]) or Meliboeus (forte sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis [Eel. 7.1]). In this instance, however, the pastoral landscape of grass, elms, or oaks has been replaced by the hearth itself (ante focum), a feature that is also nonetheless another part of the homely shepherd's world. Thus in Eel. 5.70 Menalcas can imagine festivities ante focum, si frigus erit. Surprisingly, the traditional shepherd's flock is transmuted into a grex stellarum (5), thereby functioning on a cosmic level and feeding upon the whole of Olympus (toto pascebat Olympo [5]), a celestial pasture, so to speak. And the rustic muses (agrestes ... musas [11]) that constitute the subject of this particular song parallel the Virgilian speaker's contemplated song in Eel. 6.8: agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam. Into this pastoral setting that is both familiar and strange there intrudes a muse or music very different from that experienced by Virgilian shepherds. For this is produced not by the traditional shepherd's pipe or by the singing voice, but by the tolling of church bells. And far from being alien to this seventeenth-century pastoral locale, that musica (17) is depicted as though it were the lost or unattainable beloved about whom the shepherds of classical pastoral would frequently sing in 9 On the theme of exile in Virgilian pastoral, see, among others, C.P. Segal, "Tarnen cantabitis, Arcades: Exile and Arcadia in Eclogues 1 and 9" Arion 4 (1965), 237-266; B.F. Dick, "Vergil's Pastoral Poetic: A Reading of the First Eclogue" American Journal of Philology 91 (1970), 277-293; Christine Perkell, "On Eclogue 1. 79-83," Transactions of the American Philological Association 120 (1990), 171-181; Charles Martindale, "Green Politics: The Eclogues," in The Cambridge Companion to Virgil, ed. Charles Martindale (Cambridge, 1997), 107-124. 10 nos patriae finis et dulcía linquimus arva./nos patriam fugimus (Virgil, Eel. 1.3-4). Cf.

This is conveyed by Ferus through such terms of endearment as dulcíssima (17), through the emotional verb depereo (18) used to describe his impassioned reaction to that music and, in an intensification of the quasi-amatory subtext, through close echoes of Virgil's love-sick Dido. Thus as the church-bells reawaken in Ferus memories of a distant past and of the religious duties that he once performed, he proclaims: protinus agnovi veteris vestigia flammae (19) in terms closely reminiscent of the widowed Dido's famous confession to her sister Anna of the fact that Aeneas has begun to resuscitate in her the traces of former passion (agnosco veteris vestigia flammae [Aen. 4. 23]). If the poem's opening lines transport the reader to a Virgilian pastoral world, a world that is nonetheless subtly transformed and at times reinvented, the speaker's intervention seems to turn to a quasi- heroic and georgic setting. He too is inflamed by a similar love (simili nonnullus tangor amore [24]) of the music produced by the bells and of the memories that they enkindle in the human heart. He reflects on his childhood when he used to listen to the village bells of a rustic vicinity,12 whose inhabitants would, when not engaged in ploughing, indulge in the pleasure of bell-ringing: his, si quando labor curvi cessabat aratri,/ campanas pulsare sacras erat una voluptas (29-30). At first sight the language is seemingly and perhaps surprisingly evocative of the disrespect for the plough that came to symbolize the loss of pastoral innocence in Latium as described in Aeneid 7.635-636: hue omnis aratri/cessit amor. In Dillingham, however, bell-ringing functions to enhance rather than to usurp a pastoral or georgic landscape while also constituting an alternative form of pleasure. But pleasure and pain frequently proceed hand in hand. For this music is hauntingly suggestive of loss. Thus as the speaker recalls how the bells rang out come day, come night (sic veniente die, sic decedente canebant [37]) he does so in language evocative of Orpheus' s endless lamentation over the loss of Eurydice: te veniente die, te decedente canebat (Georg. 4. 466). 13 He 12 Most likely a reference to the rustic surroundings of Northamptonshire where Dillingham spent his childhood. His father, Thomas Dillingham (d. 1647), was rector of Barnwell, All Saints, Northamptonshire. On the association of bells with memories of childhood, cf. F.S. Mahony, "The Shandon Bells," 1-8: "With deep affection,/And recollection,/I often think of/Those Shandon bells,/Whose sounds so wild would/In the days of childhood,/Fling around my cradle/Their magic spells." Text is that of Leonard, ed. A Book of Light Verse, 355. On the parodie nature of the poem, see E.C. McAleer, "Understanding The Shandon Bells,'" Modern Language Notes 66.1 (1951), 474-475. 13 For further evocations of Orpheus' s lament cf. Dillingham' s Avicula 35-36. See in general chapter 3.</page><page sequence="48">44 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry longs to relive those childhood days when the tolling of bells lulled him to sleep or kept him awake (41-42).14 In different ways then tolling bells and a lost Eurydice can epitomize a past that can never be recovered. For this speaker, however, in quasi-Romantic terms it is through the preserving power of memory that aspects of that lost past can at least begin to come to life again. If the past can be regained through memory so too perhaps can a lost pastoral world. Just as Eclogue 1 afforded some sort of consolatio in Tityrus's description (to Meliboeus) of the rising Rome and a quasi- divine promise to ensure and safeguard the shepherd's domain, so in Oundle Dillingham has found some form of salvation. For he introduces the village and the grandior ... cantus (45) produced by its bells as surpassing all others15 just as oak trees tower over hazel trees (quae tantum villas inter caput extulit omnes/quantum inter corylos umbrosa cacumina quercus [46-47]). The lines echo almost verbatim the description of the rising city of Rome as witnessed by Tityrus in Eel. 1: verum haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes/quantum lenta soient inter viburna cupressi {Eel. 1.24-25), a city in sharp contrast to the lowly and poverty-stricken world of pastoral simplicity: pauperis et tuguri congestum caespite culmen {Eel. 1.68). This description of Oundle is undoubtedly mock-heroic, but epic and pastoral can coexist in this seventeenth-century world. For now Virgilian poverty is proudly transformed into the thatched dwellings {congesto cespite culmen [49]) of a rustic vicinity that is impoverished yet simultaneously proud of its simplicity.16 The village itself is strikingly 14 O illas dulces nodes cum ducere somnum/ad numéros licuit, vigilemque revisere vitam (41-42). For a contrary viewpoint, cf. Giovanni Casa, In Campanas, 1-6: o quae terríficos vicina e turre cietis/tot nocte aere sonos tinnulla, totque diejsi mihi venturae noctis dormire licebit/per tot tinnitus particulam misero:/nec cum defessos iam iam continget ocellos/vos metuet subito diffugietque sopor.

MS Tanner 147, f. 44): "There is a poor vicarage at Oundle in Northampton Shire of fifteen hundred communicants . . . which is now vacant by the death of my Brother, who after greate paines taking in that curia dyed eight dayes since leaving a widdow and 6 small children but very meanly provided for.

In a stunning personification the bells of the church are depicted as five Muses {quinqué sorores [57]) possessed of varying sounds {et queis vox pariter dispar [58]), including both high and low,20 with a combined and cumulative effect that causes Echo to tremble, and perhaps dislodges even the spirits of the dead from their abode (61-62). The salutary consequences of such music are highlighted: it can dispel care, purify the breezes, and even ward off evil spirits (63-64), who take flight in fear of the imminent prayerfulness signaled by the sound (66). Such Muses are multifaceted and toll on a variety of occasions (70-74). The poem then zooms in on one festive occasion in particular, that of Restoration Day (29 May): Caroli ... lux festa (78),21 while the associated imagery transports the whole to a quasi-divine plane. As soon as this festive day comes round the sisters hasten as Nymphs dance and sing songs {pars pedibus plaudunt choreas, pars carmina dicunt [105]) in 17 promissique sedens equitansque in ter gore montis (51). 18 Aufoniasque atrinque pedem demittit ad undas (52). Cf. John Dyer, "Grongar Hill," 65-72: "Gaudy as the op'ning dawn/Lies a long and level lawn/On which a dark hill, steep and high,/Holds and charms the wandering eye!/Deep are his feet in Towy's flood,/His sides are clothed with waving wood,/ And ancient towers crown his brow,/ That cast an aweful look below." Text is that of John Dyer, Poems 1761 (Scolar Press, 1971). 19 Cf. Aeneid 10. 767 (of Orion). Bourne's Certamen Musicum likewise differentiates between the various types of sound produced by bells of different weight: Octo trans Tamisin campanis diva Maria,/cis Tamisin bis sex diva Brigetta sonat./haec tenues urget módulos properantius aedes, /alternat grandes lentius illa modos./nec quis in alterutro distinguât litore iudex/an magis haec aurem captet an illa magisJtantae est harmoniae contentio musica, turris/altera cum numéros, altera pondus habet.

Among these Nymphs the most beautiful is Calliope (quarum, quae forma pulcherrima, Caliopeia [106]), who seems to parallel two female characters in Aeneid 1 : the Nymph offered as a bribe by Juno to Aeolus (quarum quae forma pulcherrima Deiopea [Aen. 1.72]), and also perhaps Dido herself (forma pulcherrima Dido [Aen. 1.496]). And as they ring out they mirror a people's joy at the Restoration (gaudentemque canit populum, Regemque reductum [108]).22 But this idyll is not without its own glimpses of realism, for combined with such festivities are the potent memories of the political dangers encountered by Charles (pretiosa pericyla/tam cari capitis [109-110]). The whole reaches a climax in an encomium of the restored king, and unqualified praise of his gentleness and righteousness. The lines are undoubtedly characterized by the hyperbole that typically underlies such royal flattery (after all, Dillingham had written in 1660 encomiastic Latin verses that were prefixed to a volume of Cambridge poems celebrating the Restoration),23 but as the poem concludes, the focus shifts from the restoration of a king to that of a poet, whose exile in a pastoral retreat has at last given way to and even enhanced the power of song (haec ego campanis super et super aere canoro [129] . . . et cecini, et cecinisse iuvat [134]). The lines mirror Virgil's poetic sphragis24 to the Georgics (Haec super arvorum cultu pecorumque canebam/et super arboribus, Caesar dum magnus ad altum/fulminat Euphraten, te ... cecini [Georg. 4.559-566]). But if in Charles II Dillingham has found a second Augustus,25 so too perhaps, like the ringing bells celebrated in the poem, has he found a music of his own. It is a music that seems to achieve a harmony between past and present, between classical and contemporary, between the public and the private worlds of the poem, evoking sensibilities that are perhaps most accurately described as quasi- 22 Cf. The Elegant Entertainer, and Merry Story-teller: Being a Valuable Collection of Diverting and Instructive Tales, Fables, and Other Curious Articles, Both in Prose and Verse (London, 1676), 107: "Besides the common way of tolling bells there is also ringing, which is a kind of chimes used on various occasions in token of joy. This ringing prevails in no country so much as in England." 23 See Appendix 3. 24 On the sphragis ("seal," "signature"), see Thomas, ed.

From Avicula to Nemesis Suleianum and Campanae Undellenses depict the variety of pleasures deriving from bowling and bell-ringing respectively, Avicula and Nemesis a Tergo turn to the world of nature and contemporary folklore to present in quasi-moralistic tones the danger and retribution attendant upon reckless ambition and theft. On the one hand they are typical of Dillingham's methodology in that here once again they seem to reinvent a classical world; on the other, they move beyond his practice to date. For these pieces can perhaps best be categorized as moralistic fables characterized by an implicit didacticism. Avicula takes as its subject a young fledgling's attempt at flight after receiving instruction from her mother. It is a carefully wrought piece, of which Sancroft enthusiastically proclaimed: "if there be any fault in it, 'tis that it hath none at all, being, as some perhaps would say, over-labored already."1 The poem, cast in Latin hexameters, describes the gradual stages of the fledgling's experience: her enticement by her mother from the nest, her associated trepidation, and her initial endeavor to fly. But when, following her mother's example, she gradually takes to the air, fear is displaced by reckless ambition and an over zealous soaring, which in turn leads to her misfortune in a headlong fall. Worthy of comparison and contrast perhaps is the treatment of the subject in James Thomson's vernacular poem "Spring" (1728): O'er the Boughs Dancing about, still at the giddy Verge Their Resolution fails; their Pinnions still, In loose Liberation stretch' d, to trust the Void Trembling refuse: till down before them fly The Parent-Guides, and chide, exhort, command, Or push them off. The surging Air receives 1 Sancroft to Dillingham: 16 November 1677 (BL Sloane 1710, f. 214). Sancroft, however, proceeds to offer no fewer than nine suggestions for minor improvements to the piece.

On Ground Alighted, bolder up again they lead, Farther and farther on, the lengthening Right; Till vanish' d every Fear, and every Power Rouz'd into Life and Action, light in Air Th' acquitted Parents see their soaring Race, And once rejoicing never know them more. ("Spring," 740-754)2 Like Dillingham, Thomson conveys the initial faltering of the fledging, its trepidation and reluctance to make trial of the air, its eventual audacity, emphasizing the central role played by the parental guide via a series of staccato verbs ("chide, exhort, command" [745]).3 But there is an important difference. The fatally doomed precipitating Avicula has been displaced by a "soaring Race" (753), and a grieving mother has given way to parents who rejoice as they witness a successful flight. Dillingham' s poem, however, does not confine itself to a depiction of the fledgling's emotions and fate. Equally important is the representation of a mother bird's conflicting sensibilities and actions: her admixture of gentle advice, instruction, and rebuke; her teaching by example; her anxious expectation and anticipation as she sits perched upon a neighboring tree waiting for the fledgling to join her; then her tragic grief as she witnesses the fate of her chick, a grief conveyed in human terms as a mother beating her breast and proclaiming a funeral dirge for a lost daughter. Such anthropomorphism is in fact central to the poem's success. And it is both mirrored and achieved in terms of the Virgilian and Ovidian intertexts with which the piece engages. On the one hand the poem is quasi-georgic in its conception. This seems to operate on two levels. Initially the birds mirror the behavior of Virgil's bees, but in the poem's closing moments they re-enact aspects of the Orpheus/Eurydice episode of Georgics 4. That the avicula and its mother should be cast in language reminiscent of Virgilian apes is perhaps hardly surprising, for in Virgil's didactic poem Dillingham would have found the locus classicus for the personification of the natural world and its creatures. Thus, just as the ideal site of the Virgilian hive is a location close to a tree which will afford "hospitable leaves" (obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus [Georg. 4.24]), so the birds' nest is positioned upon the branches of an hospitable elm (hospitis ulmi [3]). In Text is that of Eighteenth-Century Poetry, eds. David hairer and Christine Oerrard (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004), 229. 3 Cf. Dillingham, Avicula 8: suadet, iubet, increpat, urget.</page><page sequence="54">Two Classical Fables? 51 both instances the dwelling or "nest"4 is described in language reminiscent of the Roman household with its lares and penates. Thus Virgil's bees fovere larem {Georg. 4.43); et patriam solae et certos novere penates {Georg. 4.155) whilst in Dillingham the mother bird has hung5 upon the tree a nest, which constitutes patriam parvosque lares [4]). In both the possible dangers of flight are signaled via the notion of entrusting oneself to the sky {aut credunt coelo adventantibus Euris [Georg. 4. 192]/ f credere coelo [6]). But the miraculous vision of a swarm issuing from a hive and streaming through the sky {Georg. 4.58-61)6 has now become the painful and pitiful sight of a failed flight that is strikingly individualized, beheld as it is by a lamenting mother who is also to some degree a second Orpheus. In Georgics 4, Orpheus, upon losing his wife, Eurydice (after his fateful contravention of the divine decree by looking back at her as they were emerging from the underworld), articulates his sorrow in lugubrious tones. This is compared by Virgil in a famous simile {Georg. 4. 512-515) to the grief of a nightingale lamenting the death of her chicks, whom a ruthless ploughman has snatched while still fledglings from their nest.7 The nightingale's miserabile carmen {Georg. 4.514) has become in Dillingham' s version the mother bird's lacrimabile carmen (29), while the lamentation itself and its effect upon the surrounding landscape {et maesas late loca questibus implet [Georg. 4.515]) are now echoed in the depiction of the mother as late loca questibus implens (3 1).8 For this is a poem in which creatures of the natural world both mirror and indeed transcend their human counterparts. 4 Virgil uses nidus to describe the hive at Georgics 4.56: progeniem nidosque fovent. 5 On a bird "hanging" her nest, cf. Georgics 4. 306-307: ante/garrula quam tignis nidum suspende rat hirundo. hinc ubi iam emissum caveis ad sidera coeli/nare per aestatem liquidam suspexeris agmen/obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem,/contemplator (Georgics 4.58-61). 7 qualis populea maerens philomela sub umbra/amissos queritur fetus, quos durus arator/observans nido implumis detraxit; at illa/flet noctem, ramoque sedens miserabile carmen/inte g rat, et maestis late loca questibus implet {Georgics 4.511- 515). 8 This Virgilian phrase was suggested to Dillingham by Sancroft, who comments as follows upon an earlier version of the line: "The only thing I would add is that in the Lamentation of the old Lady-Bird for losse of her Daughter, at mane, mane, improba, dixit I would add a little mollifying dixit with the parenthesis (Dicere vel visa est, late loca questibus implens)" (Sancroft: Letter to Dillingham dated 16 November 1677. BL Sloane 1710, f. 214).</page><page sequence="55">52 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry And this operates on the level of epic heroism. At times the language in which the birds are depicted is quasi-heroic. This occurs at key moments in the poem and not without proleptic irony. For example, as the mother teaches her chick how to fly, she assumes a quasi- pedagogical role in, as Sancroft terms it, "Nature's great Académie,"9 soaring ahead, then returning to lead forth her fledgling. The erratic motion of coming and going (itque reditque viam toties [10]) is conveyed via a verbatim echo of Virgil's description in Aeneid 6.122 of the immortal Pollux's infernal journey (in place of his twin, Castor) for six months each year. Here, as elsewhere, the poem's intertextuality seems to signal that the flight itself is doomed, for the important difference in Dillingham' s poem is that death cannot be ransomed. Though doomed, however, that flight is couched in epic language. When the overweening chick realizes that she is entrapped and that nothing but unknown paths of sky remain (coelique profundi/ignotas restare vias [41-42]) the quasi- heroic nature of her audacity is signaled via a verbal reminiscence of Evander's question to Aeneas about the purpose of his epic journey: quae causa subegit/ignotas temptare vias (Aen. 8.112-113). Similarly, when she perceives the danger in which she has placed herself by flying too high, the horror of that realization (gravis ingruit horror [42]) is conveyed in language evocative of Aeneas' s professed acknowledgment of the grim reality of the Trojan war (clarescunt sonitus armorumque ingruit horror [Aen. 2.301]). And the military subtext is evoked in the mother's pseudo-Horatian question: quo ruis? (32),10 a question likewise posed by Aeneas to his comrades overcome by martial frenzy and lust for blood (quo ruitis? quaeve ista repens discordia surgit? [Aen. 12.313]). Ultimately, however, the chick's flight is censured for its rash daring, a daring, which is in fact Icarian in essence. The Icarian subtext of Dillingham' s poem is facilitated by the fact that Ovid's accounts (in Metamorphoses 8 and Ars Amatoria 2) of the Daedalus/Icarus episode explicitly compare the mythological characters to birds. Thus in Ars Amatoria 2 the instruction provided by Daedalus to his son is compared to that of a mother bird to her chick (erudit infirmas 9 Sancroft highlights the pedagogical dimension of the piece: "And now I am come to your Little Bird at Schole, learning to fly in Nature's great Academic" (Sancroft: Letter to Dillingham dated 16 November 1677. BL Sloane 1710, f. 214). Contrast Mrs. Lovechild, A Miscellany in Prose and Verse for Young Persons (London, 1795), 69: "The bird fluttering from its parent's nest needs no instruction to fulfil her task." 10 Cf. Horace's grim querying of the horrors of civil war at Epode 7.1: quo quo scelesti ruitis? Text is that of Horace: Epodes, ed. David Mankin (Cambridge, 1995).</page><page sequence="56">Two Classical Fables ? 53 ut sua mater aves [A.A. 2. 66]). n Likewise in Metamorphoses 8 as Daedalus flies ahead of Icarus, his fear for his son's welfare is compared to that of a bird leading her young chick from the nest (velut ales, ab alto/quae teneram prolem produxit in aera nido [Met, 8. 213-214]).12 Throughout the Avicula mother bird and chick are represented in terms strikingly reminiscent of Daedalus and Icarus respectively. But the Ovidian bird similes and the contexts in which those similes occur function only as a point of departure for Dillingham's treatment. In Ovid's versions Daedalus is depicted as instructing (instruit [Met. 8. 203])13 and encouraging his son (hortaturque sequi [Met. 8. 215]), and as leading the way by his example (me duce carpe viam [Met. 8. 20S]/me pinnis sectare datis; ego praevius ibo.Vsit tua cura sequi, me duce tutus eris [A.A. 2.57-58]). The principles of the imminent flight are clearly articulated and enumerated: Daedalus warns his son to be careful not to fly too low in case he falls into the sea; likewise he must not fly too high in case the sun's heat melts the wax fastenings on his wings; instead he is to seek a middle path.14 Like Daedalus, Dillingham's mother bird gently encourages her offspring (hortatu hanc mulcet mater [7])15 while the Ovidian combination of instruction, admonition, and rebuke is now encapsulated not by recourse to direct speech but by an emphatic series of four staccato verbs as the mother persuades, commands, rebukes, and urges her chick (suadet, iubet, increpat, urget [8]). Like Daedalus (ante volat [Met. 8. 213]), she flies ahead (ante volons [19]), equally fearful for her offspring's fate (comitique timet [Met. 8. 213]; multa timens [22]), but 11 Text is that of Ovid: Amores, Medicamina, Faciei Femineae, Ars Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, ed.

Thus as his father is constructing the wings and carefully arranging the feathers in order, Icarus takes great pleasure in playfully snatching at those feathers that float along the breeze.17 By contrast, the baby chick is consumed by fear from the outset, palpitating (pectore toto/palpitat [5-6]), fearing {metuens [6]), and possessing timorés (7). It is a fear that will be rendered all too real. Just as Ovid's Icarus begins to rejoice in his daring flight {cum puer audaci coepit gaudere volatu [Met. 8. 223]/cum puer incautis nimium temerarius annis [A.A. 2.83]), a flight that is too lofty (altius egit her [Met. 8. 225; A.A. 84]), so the chick is borne upon a flight that is excessively high {ferri nimio in sublime volatu [2 1])18 while rejoicing in an ascent that is both celestial and, as Sancroft noted,19 surprisingly cosmic {iam caelum meditetur ovans, et cogitet astra [25]).20 In both instances such behavior is presented as the very antithesis 16 redux cessantem corripit (9). Cf. et nati respicit alas {Met. 8. 216; A.A. 2.73). 17 quas vaga moverai aura,/captabat plumas {Met. 8.197). 18 Writing to Sancroft from Cambridge in June 1642, Dillingham uses the metaphor of birds perparing to fly to describe the restlessness of the university students at the end of term: sed interim levant ales suas iuvenes ac si avolaturi ... (Bodl. Tanner MS 63, f. 42). See 3-4 above. 19 The phrase et cogitet astra was suggested by Sancroft, who remarked on an earlier version of this passage: "Designare Astra is a phrase that takes me not at all; I would say et cogitet Astra, to unite with meditetur just before. But what doth your day-bird (such I suppose her) to do with the starres? She goes to bed too soon to be acquainted with them. I would therefore say atque aethera tränet" (Sancroft: Letter to Dillingham dated 16 November 1677. BL Sloane 1710, f. 214). Cf.

Thus Icarus deseruitque patrem {A.A. 2. 84)21 only to be lamented by a pater infelix {Met. 8.231; A.A. 2.93), now no longer a father {nee iam pater [Met. 8.231; A.A. 2.93]). In Dillingham not even the chick's sense of pietas or regard for her mother {cura parentis) can change her fatally transgressive behavior.22 All that remains is for the parent to call upon the offspring in vain. Thus the Daedalean twofold exclamation "Icare ... /Icare, ... ubi es?" {Met. 8. 231-232/A.A. 2.93-94) becomes the mother bird's plea that her offspring check her flight {"dilecta, mane, mane, improba," dixit [30]), a plea that is likewise twofold {lugubri notam, natam bis voce vocabat [35]). But all too late. For in Ars Amatoria 2 the father's words mirror a twofold exclamation proclaimed by the falling Icarus: "pater, o pater, auferor!" (91).23 In the Avicula a mother's lament is reciprocated by a daughter's futile cry for help from a parent, a cry that can only go unheard {saepe suam matrem non exaudita vocabat [45]) as Dillingham' s avian Icarus proclaims a lamentation of her own {sed dum triste gemens luctus singultibus urget [47])24 and plunges to the ground. Where Avicula conveys the moral of the danger of flying too high, Dillingham' s Nemesis A Tergo emphasizes the inevitability of retribution for wrongdoing, citing a "proof of the moral in question. Like the Avicula, this poem was sent by Dillingham to Sancroft. This is attested by the latter' s reply in a letter dated 16 November 1677 in which he states: "I am much pleas' d with your Thief taken in the Marmor," and suggests the Classical Neo-Latin and Vernacular Contexts (Brussels: Collection Latomus 257, 2000), Appendix 1. 21 Cf. deseruitque ducem {Met. 8.224). 22 non illam pietas, non Ulani cura parentis/abstrahere inde potest {Avicula 26-27). 23 Cf.

" Text is that of Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italorum, III, 78. 24 Dillingham has followed in part the advice of Sancroft: "As to lacrymas singultibus urget - in the penultimate - though the Nightingale hath her sobbe, I know not that any of the chorus have Tears too: Say therefore Sed dum triste gemens, gemitu singultibus urget (Singultus being more than gemitus: and sic Oratio crescif)" (BL Sloane 1710, f. 214). Cf. Fables for Youth (London, 1777), 14: "Think of your parents so distress 'd,/If such the pangs within her breast,/Such pangs yon mourning bird must share,/Such woe, such anguish, and such care" (Fable I: "The Philosopher, Boy and Bird's-Nest," 56-59).</page><page sequence="59">56 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry actual title of the whole (Nemesis a Tergo), picks up on individual details from the poem itself, and offers some minor changes.25 Dillingham' s poem tells the legend of the "hangman's stone," a purported tale associated with a milestone in Elton. The legend concerns the stone itself and the strangling of a thief. This has come about by a rather strange set of circumstances: once upon a time a thief stole a sheep, bound its legs together with rope, and then slung the animal upon his shoulders. After carrying the sheep for some time, rather breathless and exhausted, he sat down alongside a milestone and lay back against it. The sheep started to wriggle, and in so doing, managed to droop its feet over the back of the stone, thereby tightening the rope about the thief s neck and eventually strangling him. The piece achieves a fusion between realism and myth. This is evident in its juxtaposition of precise detail (the location: finibus Eltonae [1]; the height of the stone: pedibus tribus [3]) with aetiological legend (perhaps the stone was positioned by Mercury, Terminus, or Astraea [6- 7]) and folklore (ut perhibent [9]). The moral of the whole is aptly conveyed via a series of ironic contrasts. Thus a thief's exultation (ovans [12]) is gradually muted by breathlessness (anhelus [11]) and exhaustion (lassus [16]), and is ultimately silenced by strangulation itself. And that strangulation (adstrinxit [20]) is in effect a grimly distorted re-enactment of the thief's treatment of the sheep (strinxit [11]), which he bound together and slung upon his shoulders. Hence the moral of the story. At first glance it would seem that Dillingham' s poem, rather like the Avicula, draws on the classical tradition to emphasize the moral that retribution is inevitable. To some degree this is indeed true. After all, the theft of an animal and the subsequent punishment incurred by the thief is a theme that seems to trace its origins back to Homer's Odyssey, in which Odysseus' s crew steals and subsequently devours the oxen of the sun, a crime for which they are punished by a severe storm.26 Likewise in Homeric Hymn 4, Hermes steals the cattle of the gods. His theft is witnessed by an unnamed old man, in return for whose silence Hermes promises him a good crop of grapes. The old man, however, reports the theft to Apollo.27 The theft of Apollo's cattle by Hermes also occurs in Hesiod's The Great Eoiae. Interestingly, the theft is now associated with 25 Sancroft to Dillingham, 16 Nov 1677 (BL Sloane 1710, f. 214): "Dear Friend, I am much pleas' d with your Thief taken in the Marmor. But what if you should add ... sive Nemesis a Tergol" 26 Homer, Odyssey 1. 7-8; 12. 260-388. 21 Homeric Hymn 4.4.68-212.</page><page sequence="60">Two Classical Fables ? 57 a rock or a stone, and the theme of retribution is prominent. Again there is a witness, in this instance Battus; again his silence is purchased by the promise of a reward. But Hermes returns in disguise to test Battus, offering him a robe if he will tell of any stolen cattle he has seen. Battus succumbs and is punished by being turned into stone.28 Hesiod's version is closely followed by Ovid in Metamorphoses 2. 676-707. Here Apollo's cattle are spied by Mercury, who drives them off and hides them in the woods (arte sua silvis occultât abaetas [boves] [686]). Battus notices the theft and is bribed by Mercury to keep silent. Battus replies that sooner will a stone tell of the theft than he ("lapis iste prius tua furta loquetur'Vet lapidem ostendit [696-697]). Mercury returns in disguise and promises Battus a bull and its mate. Battus gives in. Mercury catches him out and turns his faithless heart into flint (periuraque pectora vertit/in durum silicem [705-706]). The rock bears the shameful mark of the deed (qui nunc quoque dicitur index/inque nihil merito vetus est infamia saxo [706-707]). And the theme likewise occurs in the story of Hercules and Cacus in Virgil, Aeneid 8. Once again the role of the rock is highlighted but now this is interestingly coupled with the theme of strangulation and an emphasis on retribution. The monstrous Cacus steals Hercules' s cattle, hiding them in a cave and shutting them (and himself) in by a huge boulder (raptos saxo occultabat opaco [8. 211]). This self-imposed enclosure is effected as Cacus breaks a chain and lets a huge rock fall (deiecit saxum, ferro quod et arte paterna/pendebat [8.226-227]) thereby making the doorposts impassable. But the secret is disclosed when one of the cattle lows. Hercules grabs a pinnacle of rock and wrenches it from its roots. Cacus becomes trapped in a hollow rock (inclusumque cavo saxo [8. 248]) and is eventually twisted by Hercules into a knot, choked and strangled (hie Cacum .../corripit in nodum complexus, et angit inhaerens/elisos óculos et siccum sanguine guttur (8. 259-261). Hercules emerges as the maximus ultor (8. 201). But if the subject matter and to some degree the methodology of Nemesis a Tergo have some basis in classical poetry, the piece is much more strikingly rooted in a contemporary English world and that world's associated folklore. For the legend at the heart of the poem reflects folklore that attended (and continues to attend) several similar "hangman's stones" in a variety of districts in England. In the late eighteenth century, for example, Samuel Rudder describes a stone and its associated tale as it existed in the parish of Preston: See The Great Eoiae 16 in Hesiod: The Homeric Hymns and Homérica, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White (Cambridge, Mass., 1977).</page><page sequence="61">58 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry This parish [Preston] is bounded to the westward by the Irminstreet, one of the Roman ways passing thro' Cirencester; and at the distance of two miles from the town, but in this parish, there stands an antient, rude stone, about four feet high, lately painted and mark' d as a mile stone. This is vulgarly called Hangmans stone because, it is said, a fellow resting a sheep thereon, (which he had stolen, and tied its legs together for the convenience of carrying it) was there strangled, by the animal's getting its legs round his neck in struggling. Other such stones are attested by several nineteenth-century contributors to Notes and Queries: one in the parish of Foremark, Derbyshire;30 another "at the end of Lamber Moor, on the roadside between Haverfordwest and Little Haven, in the county of Pembroke,"31 another "five miles from Sidmouth, on the road to Colyton," another near the 29 Samuel Rudder, A New History of Gloucestershire. Comprising the Topography, Antiquities, Curiosities (Cirencester, 1779), 606. He continues with the following skeptical remark: "But this does not account for the stone's being placed there, and considering the common propensity of inventing stories to obviate names and things not generally understood, I have sometimes been of opinion that all this is fiction, and that the right name of the stone is Hereman-stone, so called, like the Roman way upon which it stands, from Hereman, a soldier; and that the stone is an antient monument for some military person." 30 See C.S. Greaves, "Churchdown: Similar Legends at Different Places," Notes and Queries, 1 (January 5, 1856), 15-16, at 15: "When I was a youth, there were two fields in the parish of Foremark, Derbyshire, called the Great and the Little Hangman's Stone. In the former there was a stone, five or six feet high, with an indentation running across the top of it, and there was a legend that a sheepstealer, once upon a time having stolen a sheep, had placed it on the top of the stone, and that it had slipped off and strangled him with the rope with which it was tied, and that the indentation was made by the friction of the rope caused by the struggles of the dying man." 31 See J.W. Phillips, "Similar Legends at Different Places," Notes and Queries 14, (April 5, 1856), 282: "At the end of Lamber Moor, on the roadside between Haverfordwest and Little Haven, in the county of Pembroke, there is a stone about four feet high called 'Hang Davy Stone,' connected with which is a tradition of the accidental strangling of a sheepstealer, similar to the legend mentioned by Mr. Greaves with reference to the stone at Foremark." 32 N.S. Heineken, "The Hangman-stone," Notes and Queries 1 (May 17, 1856), 402: "It may be interesting to your correspondent Mr. J. W. Phillips, to be informed that at about five miles from Sidmouth, on the road to Colyton, on the right hand side of the road, and near Bovey House, is a large stone known by the name of 'Hangman's Stone.' The legend is precisely similar to that noticed by Mr. Phillips ... and by Mr. Greaves."</page><page sequence="62">Two Classical Fables ? 59 north-western boundary of the parish of Littlebury, in Essex,33 another between Brighton and Newhaven,34 another between Sheffield and Barnsley.35 A variation on the legend is provided by a certain Potter in vernacular verse. Now the sheep is replaced by a hart and the thief named as one John of Oxley: One shaft he drew on his well-tried yew, And a gallant hart lay dead; He tied its legs, and he hoisted his prize, And he toil'd over Lubcloud brow. He reach' d the tall stone, standing out and alone, Standing then as it standeth now; With his back to the stone he rested his load, And he chuckled with glee to think That the rest of his way on the down hill lay And his wife would have spiced the strong drink. 33 See Braybrooke, "Hangman Stones," Notes and Queries 1 (May 31, 1856), 435: "Some years ago there was still to be seen in a meadow belonging to me, situate near the north-western boundary of the parish of Littlebury, in Essex, a large stone; the name of which, and the traditions attached to it, were identical with those recorded by your correspondents treating of 'Hangman Stones.' This stone was subsequently removed by the late Mr. Jabez Gibson to Saffron Waiden, and still remains in his garden at that place. I have a strong impression that other 'hangman Stones' are to be met with elsewhere, but I am unable to point out the exact localities." 34 H.E.C., Notes and Queries 1 (May 31, 1856), 435-436: "On the right side of the road, between Brighton and Newhaven (about five miles, I think, from the former place) is a stone designated as above, and respecting which is told the same legend as that which is quoted by Henry Keasington." 35 See Alfred Gatty, "Hangman Stones," Notes and Queries 1 (June 21, 1856), 502- 503: "At a picturesque angle in the road betwixt Sheffield and Barnsley, and about three miles south of the latter place, there is a toll-bar called 'Hangman-Stone Bar.' Attached to this title is the usual legend of a sheep-stealer being strangled by the kicking animal, which he had slung across his shoulders, and which pulled him backwards as he tried to climb over the stone wall enclosure with his spoil. I do not know that any particular stone is marked as the one on which the sheep was rested for the convenience of the thief in trying to make his escape, but the Jehu of the now extinct Barnsley mail always told this story to any inquiring passenger who happened to be one of five at top - as quaint a four-in-hand as you shall see. I have little doubt that the story told by the 'Jehu,' which my memory may have embellished a little, as is not unusual with travellers' recollections, was the one to which I listened as one of the five outsiders, and in answer to my question the country boys used to insist upon it in my young days that stones grew. It seems to me probable that a very moderate monolith may have grown in my recollection to 'a handsome marble column,' and that 'the lord of the manor' was my own phrase rather than our coachman's."</page><page sequence="63">60 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry A swineherd was passing o'er great Ives' Head, When he noticed a motionless man; He shouted in vain - no reply could he gain - So down to the grey stone he ran. All was clear. There was Oxley on one side the stone, On the other the down hanging deer: The burden had slipp'd, and his neck it had nipp'd; He was hanged by his prize - all was clear. In short Nemesis a Tergo, like several of Dillingham' s other Latin poems, achieves a subtle fusion of the classical and the contemporary. While the theme, the linguistic medium of neo-Latin coupled with the moralizing personification of Nemesis37 would seem at first glance to look back to a tradition rooted in the world of ancient Greece and Rome, the legend and the moral of that legend are located in the prevailing and enduring folklore pertaining to the English countryside and its associated landscape. 36 Potter, Churnwood, 179, as quoted in C.S. Greaves, "Churchdown: Similar Legends at Different Places," 15. 37 For other moralizing treatments of Nemesis by neo-Latin poets, see Andreas Alciato, Illicitum non sperandum: Spes simul, et Nemesis nostris altaribus adsunt: /Scilicet ut speres non nisi quod liceat (Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italorum I, 71); Caelius Calcagninus: Nemesis: Sum Nemesis, hominum cubitores metior omnes,/Neve quis abscedet limite, frena gero (Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italorum III, 78); Andreas Dactius, Nemesis: Qui mare, qui terram, quique aera miscuit igni,/Terrificans ánimos peste, cruore, fame./Pendulus, exustus, vento iactatus et undis;/Praeda iacet terrae, et aeri et igni et aquae (Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italorum IV, 8).</page><page sequence="64">Chapter 4 A Horticultural Metamorphosis: Sepes Hortensis Dillingham's recreation of natural landscape and of its inhabitants manifests itself on a rather different level in his Sepes Hortensis. For this is a poem that celebrates the reinvention of a whole series of creatures from the natural world, and it does so by means of a garden topiary. A draft of the piece was sent by Dillingham to his longtime friend and critic, William Sancroft, who, despite offering a couple of suggestions for improvement,1 conveyed more than his customary enthusiasm: The Truth is, I ought injustice to step yet further back; and to thank you also for your former Letter, and what came with it, your elegant Description of a Garden-hedge, and gravell walk. I will not tell you, how often, and with how much Delight I have pac' d it over from End to End, and entertain' d myself in it.2 For Sancroft the poem comes to life, providing an entertaining space that is both literary and pseudohorticultural, a space within whose confines the reader may pace with pleasure. As Ross remarks "gardens are at once parts of the real world-actual pieces of land-and also virtual worlds- coherent sets of possible stimuli."3 These real and virtual worlds coalesce in Dillingham's poem as a seventeenth-century garden becomes the site 1 "I shall rather take the manly Freedom which you have so often allow' d me, that I am now well-nigh in case to prescribe it. And though you have not made me your Gardiner, nor expressly put the sheers into my Hand; yet I shall take it for granted, that I have your leave to tell you (whether I mistake, or not, of which you are sole judge) that there is a sprig or two in your Hedge which have not the Smoothness, and eveness which so visibly beautifies all the Rest" (BL Sloane 1710, f. 212). 2BLSloanel710,f.212. 3 See Stephanie Ross, What Gardens Mean (Chicago, 1998), 176.

And more than that, for, as noted below, this "garden hedge" also comes to function as a symbol of transformation and transgression, a locus in which boundaries may be crossed. Or in the words of Foucault: The limit and the transgression depend on each other for whatever density of being they possess: a limit could not exist if it were absolutely uncrossable and, reciprocally, transgression would be pointless if it merely crossed a limit composed of illusions and shadows.4 The Sepes Hortensis was also deemed by Dillingham to be appropriate for much younger eyes than those of an Archbishop. On 14 February 1672, he sent the poem to Justinian Isham for his son Thomas, writing: "I send your sonne a verse made upon a garden dipt hedge which I have sometimes seen."5 And the event was recorded by the young Thomas in his famous Latin diary: "John Fisher returned from Oundle bringing a letter to my father from Dr Dillingham with some verses on the topiary art."6 It is possible that Dillingham was aware of Thomas's apparent predilection for hedges and gardens, a predilection that seems to be attested by several of the diary entries.7 Or his sending the poem may reflect a more general interest in the younger Isham' s education. In the same letter Dillingham had recommended a range of texts that might prove useful to the boy's classical studies. Even so his own piece is rather self-consciously juxtaposed with such texts as though assuming a proud place alongside the classics. After all, the very craft of topiary8 traces its origins back to the classical world. It was a skill that had developed as a by-product of the Romans' mastery of the technique of pruning.

Thus "the Gardeners, from clipping and laying out every thing by the Line, and turning Trees and Hedges into various Forms, were called Topiarii"10 Gradually the term opus topiarium was used to describe the crafted art of the landscape gardener.11 The skill of the topiary worker was held in high esteem by the ancients,12 characterized as it was by precision and versatility. As Lawson remarks, the classical topiarist "was not content to depict individual figures but achieved elaborate compositions, such as hunting scenes and naval battles."13 Pliny the Younger could boast that his Tuscan estate possessed a terraced formal garden with box hedge topiary, from which there sloped a bank with more box hedges clipped into the figures of animals {bestiarum effigies).14 John Ray defined the art as follows: Topiarium opus vocant arbores et herbas egregio artificio in formas animalium aut aliarum rerum ductas, and proceeded to emphasize the importance of the vegetation's "flexibility" as it is molded into a variety of shapes (frútices aut arbusculae tonsiles religatae . . . torquentur, flectunturque adfingenda quae ludunt rerum et animalium argumenta)15 quite literally at the hands of an artist of sorts. 9 See Linda Farrar, Ancient Roman Gardens (Sutton Publishing, 1998), 161. 10 Robert Castell, The Villas of the Ancients (London, 1728), 118. 11 See Farrar, Ancient Roman Gardens, 161. 12 Farrar, Ancient Roman Gardens, 161: "Topiarii seem to have been held in some regard and comments found in the letters of Cicero reveal aspects of their work that produced admiration." 13 James Lawson, "The Roman Garden," Greece and Rome 19.57 (1950), 97-105, at 104. 14 demissus inde pronusque pulvinus, cui bestiarum effigies invicem adversas buxus inscripsit (Epist. 5.6.16).

And this works on both a literary and topographical level. An elaborate topiary garden features prominently in "The Pastime of Pleasure" by Stephen Hawes (c. 1475-1511): Then in we went / to the gardyn gloryous Lyke to a place / of pleasure moost solacyous With flora paynted / and wrought curyously In dyvers knottes / of mervaylous gretenes Rampande Lyons / stode up wonderfly Made all of herbes / with dulcet swetenes With many dragons / of mervaylous lykenes Of dyvers floures / made full craftely By flora couloured / with colours sundry (2008-2016)17 A detailed and quasi-ekphrastic description of an "opera topiaria" is included in Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499),18 a hugely influential work adapted in England by Robert Dallington in his Hypnerotomachia: The Strife of Love in a Dreame (1592). Here shrubbery is trimmed into the shapes of birds, oxen, and dolphins "with their gilíes lyke leaves, and their Finnes and their extreame partes of a follature" to constitute "a Topiarie worke."19 But far from being confined to the world of literary fiction, the topiary garden in its most intricate form was very much a part of the real fifteenth-century Italian world. One such garden possessed topiary in the form of ships, galleys, temples, vases, urns, giants, men, women, heraldic 16 Lawson, "The Roman garden," 104. 17 Text is that of Stephen Hawes, The Pastime of Pleasure, ed.

Tonsilis herba refert, Eoum inventa, tapetes, Et myrtus varias ingeniosa feras.21 And Renaissance England could boast of her equivalents. Thus Henry VIIFs royal retreat Nonsuch was extolled in 1598 by Paul Hentzner for its parks abounding in deer, and its gardens and groves adorned with topiary (horti delicati, luci topiario opere exornati).22 Hampton Court was described in 1599 in the following laudatory terms: There were all manner of shapes, men and women, half man and half horse, sirens, serving-maids with baskets, French lilies and delicate crenellations all round made from dry twigs bound together and the aforesaid ever green quick-set shrubs, or entirely of rosemary, all true to life, and so cleverly and amusingly interwoven, mingled and grown together, trimmed and arranged picture- wise that their equal would be difficult to find.23 The gardens at Wresehill Castle in Yorkshire were praised by John Leland: 20 See, in general, Alessandro Perosa, Giovanni Rucellai ed il suo Zibaldone (London, 1960), 22; Claudia Lazzaro, The Italian Renaissance Garden (New Haven and London, 1990); Jennifer Nevile, "Dance and the Garden: Moving and Static Choreography in Renaissance Europe," Renaissance Quarterly 52.3 (Autumn 1999), 805-836, at 809. 1 Felicitatis Humanae Fuga Coelestis Adeptio, 25-28.

To some degree it anticipates the scorn poured upon the art almost a century later by Alexander Pope: How contrary to this Simplicity is the modern Practice of Gardening; we seem to make it our Study to recede from Nature, not only in the various Tonsure of Greens into the most regular and formal Shapes, but even in monstrous Attempts beyond the reach of the Art itself: We run into Sculpture, and are yet better pleas' d to have our Trees in the most awkward Figures of Men and Animals, than in the most regular of their own.29 Pope's "Catalogue of Greens" would purport to be the product of "a Virtuoso Gardener who has a Turn to sculpture,"30 a mock-topiary, as it were, including a representation of "Adam and Eve in Yew, Adam a little shattered by the fall of the tree of Knowledge in the great Storm; Eve and the Serpent, very flourishing."31 Likewise William Mason in "The English Garden" criticizes topiarists, rebuking the associated Folly and Wealth of those who vainly strove By line, by plummer, and unfeeling sheers, To form with verdure what the builder form' d With stone. Egregious madness; yet pursu'd With pains unwearied, with expence unsumm'd, And science doating. Hence the sidelong walls Of shaven yew; the holly's prickly arms Trimm' d into high arcades; the tonsile box Wove, in mosaic mode of many a curl, Around the fugur'd carpet of the lawn.32 Worthy of comparison perhaps is a Latin poem on the gardens of Merton College, Oxford. Here the absence of topiary is extolled. These are gardens that do not possess trees pruned in the shape of wild beasts or foliage cut into the shape of letters: 29 Alexander Pope, "On Gardens," The Guardian 173 (29 September 1713).

Thus James Dallaway could proclaim of Blenheim: "When Vanbrugh imagined and completed Blenheim, it had little advantage of corresponding scenery, but was deeply inveloped in formal plantations, labyrinths, and topiary works of box and yew."34 Although the topiary garden in Dillingham' s poem remains unidentified, the skill of its achievement is certainly undeniable. The piece is pervaded by the theme of wonder: by the miraculous art of topiary itself {cultae ... miracula sepis [7]; mira ... arte [10]), the ecphrastic nature of which is exemplified by the poem as a whole, and explicitly highlighted in the closing lines. For both the topiarist and the poet can give life to the inanimate. As Myers has convincingly argued, "gardens can parallel the skill of the literary author in the design and disposition of his or her material in the composition of a work of literature."35 Thus perhaps landscape gardening can function as an iconographical mirror of the poetic imagination. Worthy of comparison is Joseph Addison's frequent use of the trope in his "Pleasures of the Imagination" to describe the poet whose Rose-trees, Wood-bines, and Jassamines, may flower together, and his Beds be covered at the same time with Lillies, Violets and Amaranthus.

Such myths moreover readily take their place within a poem whose opening lines turn to the classical world as a means of highlighting the beauty of the garden and hedge in question. This particular Hortus is depicted as taking its place alongside the gardens of Alcinous (2)39 or 36 Joseph Addison, Spectator 418 (30 June 1712), ed. Bond, III, 569. Cf.

During the Renaissance these two literary gardens were frequently juxtaposed as examples of a horticultural ideal. Thus, "the garden of Alcinous in the Odyssey provides a fine example of a classical Greek garden, which resembles the Renaissance garden in certain respects."41 In particular the abundance of fruit (symbolized by Dillingham in the phrase cum poma Alcinous ... numerarei [2]) mirrors perhaps the fact that in Alcinous' s garden the fruit grows spontaneously, is gathered without toil, and surpasses in its sweetness that of any human garden.42 This abundance is replicated on a linguistic level for in the Homeric passage in question, as Beretta points out, "the word 'fruit' is mentioned six times," while "fourteen lines out of twenty-three deal with fruit and six different kinds of fruit are mentioned."43 Likewise the garden of Adonis (here represented by the phrase cum ... flores numerarei Adonis [2]) functioned as a virtual symbol "which later developed into a mythical garden with the same status as the gardens of the Hesperides and Alcinous."44 Dillingham' s topiarist (perhaps like the poet himself) uses his ingeniosa manus (10) in such a way that the whole scene serves to recreate the characters of Ovid's Metamorphoses (Nasonis reduces pulchre mentita figuras [12]). The relevance of the classical poet and the text itself will become apparent in due course and should be viewed alongside the comments of Beretta in regard to the centrality of the Ovidian text in the Renaissance garden: Most of Ovid's characters are turned into stones, plants, or trees, all natural forms that are found in the garden. . . . The Metamorphoses is full of features of Nature that are not what they seem to be. Not only are people turned into garden of Homer's Alcinous as the prototype of the ideal hortus, cf. Fabio Segnio, De Rure Suo Septimiano: alta domus geminis hinc atque hinc cingitur hortis;/Alcinoum tales non habuisse ferunt. Text is that of Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italorum, IX, 8. 40 cum . . . flores numerarei Adonis (2). 41 Dva Beretta, "The World's a Garden": Garden Poetry of the English Renaissance (Uppsala, 1993), 18. 42 See Beretta, "The World's a Garden," 18. 43 Beretta, "The World's a Garden," 18. 44 Beretta, 'The World's a Garden," 20.</page><page sequence="74">A Horticultural Metamorphosis 1 1 stones, plants and trees, but also into animals and springs. By alluding to Ovid a feeling of Nature being modified by Art is conveyed.45 The transformation of one matter into another reflects the transformation of Nature by Art; Nature is transformed into natural-looking artificial features through Art.46 And the poetry itself performs a rather similar function. Dillingham's verses seem to recall Ovid's account of Thetis' s ability to transform herself into 100 shapes {centum mentita figuras [Met 11. 253])47 as a means of escaping her would-be lover Theseus (who does eventually get his way with her, thereby fathering Achilles). In Ovid, such shapes included a bird, a tree, and a tigress.48 In Dillingham, this transformation of an individual nymph is itself transformed and expanded into an ensuing tableau of various animals, a tableau that nonetheless takes its place in a classical landscape now suddenly resurrected. After all, the Renaissance garden, as Battisti has observed "is a measured and well- ordered model of the universe. ... It assumes the function of a sculpture gallery, a pinacotheka, a horticultural encyclopedia in vivo ... and a theatre for fantastic imagination."49 In terms of the topiary figures in Dillingham's poem there are five categories: a dog, a lion, a serpent, stags/does, and a hunter. But each of these is depicted as a revivified classical myth or scene that is vibrantly alive in its leafy metamorphosis. Like the topiarist, the poet casts the animal world in its verdant form by juxtaposing such adjectives and nouns as viridantum ... ferarum (9), frondosus Hylax (12) andfrondeus ... venator (20). And the leafy bodies in which these figures are cast are represented as living, breathing beings. Thus the dog is barking or, as the speaker asks: audisne ut frondosus Hylax in limine latrai?

The description recalls a simile used by Ovid to convey Apollo's relentless pursuit of Daphne (ut canis in vacuo leporem cum Gallicus arvo/vidit, et hic praedam pedibus petit, Hie salutem [Met. 1.533-534]) and the echo is highly appropriate. For Daphne herself would ultimately be transformed into a laurel tree, its bark encasing her heart, its foliage replacing her hair, its branches now functioning as her arms (Met. 1. 548- 552) as the swift-footed runner is literally rooted to the spot.54 It is a stunning metamorphosis whereby in typically Ovidian fashion the human body is usurped by and eventually becomes greenery.55 Perhaps then 50 néscio quid certe est, et Hylax in limine latrai (Eel. 8. 107). 51 hic Nemeae videas herum saevire leonem;/hic iterum ad partes Alcidae clava recurrit (14-15).

Cf. saucius at serpens sinuosa volumina versat/arrectisque horret squamis et sibilai ore/arduus insurgens (Aen. 11.753-755). With Dillingham' s account of the serpent hissing non unisfaucibus (16), cf. Virgil's description of Cerberus at Aen. 6. 421: Hie fame rabida tria guttura pandens. 53 damasque arborei tondentes iugera campi (19). Cf. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 2.660: tondentes gramina campo.

Prefaced to his poem "The Loves of the Plants" is an interesting statement by Erasmus Darwin: Whereas P. Ovidius Naso, a great Necromancer in the famous Court of Augustus Caesar, did by art poetic transmute Men, Women, and even Gods and Goddesses, into Trees and Flowers: I have undertaken by similar art to restore some of them to their original animality, after having remained prisoners so long in their respective vegetable mansions.56 Something of this methodology lies at the heart of Dillingham's poem as the leafy dwellers in those "vegetable mansions" transgress the boundaries in which they are confined, thereby achieving some form of poetic liberation. This topiary comes to life as an ecphrasis eventually epitomized by the same phrase {cerneré er at [26]) used by Virgil to summarize the scenes in the center of Aeneas' s shield.57 And it does so despite or perhaps because of careful signposting (hie ... videas [14] ... hie videas [18]),58 balanced syntax (hie ... iterum/hic herum [14-15]), and the rhetorical language (en! [13] ... en! [20]) in which it is cast. As the ecphrasis proper comes to a rather breathless conclusion, the riveted speaker asks singula sed quid ego versu comprendere coner? (23)59 and does so after a sudden break in the line (22). The line-break was in fact suggested to Dillingham by Sancroft: Or rather, were it to me, I would leave it upon the Cesura at Lepori, without any supply at all; which would look (me thinks) as done, not because you knew not how to compleat the Verse, but out of a great judgement as abruptly breaking off that particular Enumeration, with Singula sed quid ego versu comprendere coner? I am sure Virgil leaves many such half verses, where a seeming defect is not so significative, or at least not visibly to me.60 The indeterminacy of the poem's conclusion serves perhaps to encapsulate the inability of language, of art, to confine its subject - a 56 Text is that of D.N. Smith, The Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse (Oxford, 1936), 681. 57 Cf. Aeneid 8. 675-676: in medio classis aeratas, Actia bella/cernere erat. 58 Precedent for such signposting is provided on a more extensive level in the description of Aeneas' shield at Aeneid 8. 626, 635, 639, 642, 663, 666. 59 For the designation singula to describe the individual scenes on an ecphrasis, cf. Aen. 8. 618: atque óculos per singula volvit. 60BLSloanel710,f. 212.</page><page sequence="77">74 William Dillingham 's Latin Poetry subject that transgresses boundaries that are literary, topographical, and chronological. For now the speaker's attempt to describe in verse the hedge and its amazing animal shapes is explicitly equated with Homer's ecphrastic representation of the arms of Achilles (quicquid Maeonides armis inscripsit Achillis [24]) and the account by Hesiod of the shield of Hercules (Herculis out clipeo vates Ascraeus [25]).61 It is an equation that finds a parallel of sorts in Pliny's description of the topiary garden on his Tuscan estate, which likewise concludes with a rather self-conscious observation on the way in which his account of this and other aspects of his villa is akin to ecphrastic descriptions by Homer and Virgil of the arms of Aeneas and Achilles: Vides quot versibus Homerus, quot Vergilius arma hic Aeneae Achillis ille describat; brevis tarnen uterque est quia facit quod instituit. vides ut Aratus minutíssima etiam sidera consectetur et colligat; modum tarnen servat. non enim excursus hic eius, sed opus ipsum est. (Epist. 5.6.43) Perhaps then Myers's argument that Pliny used his descriptions of an estate as "ecphrastic models of self-representation"62 is equally applicable to Dillingham himself. As leafy figures undergo a metamorphosis into the personae of classical myth, a seventeenth-century topiary becomes a poetic ecphrasis which reinvents a world that is both classical and contemporary. Such reinvention lies at the heart of Dillingham' s original Latin poetry included in the Poemata Varii Argumenti. This is neo-Latin verse that "sports" with the classics in such a way that "recreation" is ultimately wedded to timeless recreation. 61 Cf. Ovid, Am. 1.15.11: vivet et Ascraeus; Virgil, Georg. 2.176: Ascraeumque ... carmen. 62 Myers, "Docta Otia" 103. Cf. 122: "Pliny's evocation of the tradition of poetic ecphrasis suggests that his villa descriptions may also be read as self-reflective models of the text itself as a work of art."</page><page sequence="78">Appendix 1 William Dillingham's Latin Poetry Latin Text and Facing English Translation1 By Estelle Haan 1 Text is that of Poemata Varii Argumenti Partim e Georgio Herberto Latine (Utcunque) Reddita, Partim Conscripta a Wilh.

Close to the banks of Avon where the stream is forced to bear the yoke, and Wansford owes its fame to a bridge, near a wood and on the top of a hillock there is a place which, facing in the direction of the south and the east, commands a prospect of valleys, villages, and distant fields. In times past this land experienced the severe toils of the farmer, but after being encircled by the protection of a quick-set hedge and endowed with a green toga of smooth turf, it is completely free for sport, worthy to be celebrated in mighty triumphs as it marvels at its new cultivators in gear of gold. When this has been properly sheared, with its turf naturally trimmed, a stone roller levels, smoothens, and polishes it in case at any point a clump of grass might check the progress of the gliding bowl. To this spot there flocks a band of gentry when it is their wish to dispel anxieties from their mind, when the weather is clear, and mostly on prescribed days. They divide into sides: "You be Guelfo; this one will be Gibelinus, but banish beforehand madness and greed as well: this stirs up shameful anger. Still, neither do I enjoin you to strike a bargain for nothing but renown: 'that which is small acts as an incentive; but if you compete for a stake that is excessive, you spoil the sport with the result that the pleasure is not genuine.' Nonetheless I commend the customs of the ancients, which establish two rewards: prizes for the victor, consolation prizes for the vanquished. Come on, boy! Fetch here quickly the resplendently gleaming bowls taught by the molten lead poured into their side both how to steady their pace and how to move in circles." Close by is a little house, a most welcome shade for the weary men. This same place supplies arms for the sportsmen. It is from here that the boy brings out the bowls; it is here that he stores them at night. Then first of all there comes down into the arena Sylvius the hero, renowned for his great bravery and skill, whether the need be to make contact with the jack in circular formation or to burst through the enemy squadrons. Once the iron marker had indicated the starting-point, immediately and effortlessly he casts forth a tiny ball. This is Helen: this is the goal for the path of subsequent bowling: it is she who is encircled by all; happy is he who leaves the starting-point and rests at last in her arms. Next grasping a bowl in his right hand, with unwavering gaze he marks out its course, worships the Nymph with his body prostrate, and shoots forth a bowl. This gliding along like a silent stream,</page><page sequence="81">78 Appendix 1 metae contiguus media requiescit arena.

This is followed by Nisus, than whom no other is more outstanding whether in spinning a bowl in his hand or in skimming the jack or in dislodging the enemy from his position or in conquering by running. He balances a bowl, which privy to its lesser quantity of lead, skirts a left- hand path on the inside, and overtaking the previous bowl, it pushes it aside from its place and clings to the embraces of the jack. Then in the others there arises a variety of emotions: hope, anger, fear, shame, enthusiasm, and a huge passion for glory. Each one is mentally prepared to protect his own side, but not everyone can match with bravery their leader's glory. This man, longing greatly to increase his claim to triumph, and hoping to hold on to second place at least, doggedly pursues with his hands and feet a bowl as it runs along: now by the reining power of his voice he restrains the bowl as it hurries along; now he rebukes the bowl as lazy and lacking in honor, and next he advises, encourages, praises it; then with bodily contortions he instructs it on how to avoid the rocks, under the impression that he has corrected it by his own advice. What fancies do not dreams produce? That man, wishing to thrust Nisus down from the wall he has captured, makes a mistake, and pours his strength into thin air: Unlucky bravery! But it is only from mighty exploits that a fall ensues. But just like young Roman soldiers in their camp in times gone by: if ever danger happens to threaten their general, they immediately station themselves beside his tent and protect their leader, surrounding him with many bodyguards; no differently do his teammates surround Nisus in a loyal band, strengthening the approaches with a barrier, and delaying the enemy. Why should I tell of the rest who were led astray by mistakes of various kinds? This one, cast too far ahead, leaves the jack behind: another grows torpid in midpath, whether from leaving the starting-post at too sluggish a pace, or whether cast by a bowler with tottering step and borne on a path twice the length. This one is too hesitant amid excessive uncertainty; that one marks a path with an inner circle, or else wanders off course, disadvantaged by the weight of the lead, an object of ridicule in the whole arena. When Sylvius saw that there were none of his men remaining who could help his lost cause, he did not lose courage or become angry with destiny; instead he was glad that there was presented to him the type of opportunity which he would voluntarily call for - a wrestling-ground worthy of his own bravery: "It is in times of difficulty that the presence of a soaring bravery is proven; just as a river rises higher when a dam is placed in its way." Then, scanning with his gaze the entire space, with the eye of scrutiny he investigates now these approaches, now those. "No path is inaccessible to bravery," he instantly says. Having spoken, he made for the starting-point once again and demanded a bowl which he had wisely kept in reserve for that very purpose. He hurls this with all his strength: now this, brandished by a hand of thunder, flies out, breaks through and shatters the enemy phalanxes, scattering death on this side and on that,</page><page sequence="83">80 Appendix 1 obiectasque moras cursus molita per omnes, abducit metam et summa consistit arena.

Immediately shouting issues toward the heavens and the mountain reverberates all about; amid the woods the babbling Nymph trembles in terror, wondering what can be the reason for a triumph the extent of which she does not recall being celebrated even at the death of a stag. The woods are beset with thunder and the lesser Nymphs redouble: "Silvius: from this time Sylvius will be for us and in these woods the most famous name!"

There shone forth a candle which, rivaling the sun's ray, took up her regal residence, and dispersing the fleeing darkness, she atoned for the hours of a long night. It was then that I in solitude and far from Cam, a new inhabitant of an ancient countryside, I and (behold) my Wild sat down together before the hearth, reciting in succession our rustic muses. But suddenly there reached our ears music produced by the tolling bells of a village close by, soothing the valleys in clearly resonating waves to such a degree that they filled the entire ether with their song. Then Wild proclaimed: "Ah! That church possesses my love. O music most sweet to me above all else; how I am dying about you! You deserve to be proclaimed in my song too. I have instantly recognized the traces of the old flame that (when it was permissible) burned with love for worship, for the people of God, and his sacred works; but burning it is still, and only by death alone can it be wrenched from there - in fact, not even by death can it be wrenched from there." Then I said: "I too can disclose my passion inasmuch as I am touched in no slight degree by a similar love. Once upon a time (for remember it I can) when as a nursling of my native countryside, grammar school was molding my tender years, there was a small village contented in its few inhabitants, who possessed nonetheless minds in harmony and with an apprehension of heaven. Whenever the labor of the curved plough had ceased, their single pleasure was to ring the sacred bells. This music bestowed solace upon night's exceeding length. It summoned new toils when morning was already underway; it sung out the cradle of the reborn sun; and eyes did not incline toward gentle sleep until the funeral of the day's closure had been celebrated. No day passed unsung by these Camoenae:</page><page sequence="85">82 Appendix 1 sic veniente die, sic decedente canebant, et penitus toto delebant pectore curas. interea vario mulcebant aethera cantu, pergratisque sonis vicinia tota sonabat. 40 o illas dulces noctes cum ducere somnum ad numéros licuit vigilemque revisere vitam!

In the meantime they soothed the air with different types of music and the entire neighborhood used to resound with their very pleasing tones. O those sweet nights when I could fall asleep to their rhythms and when I could awaken to behold life again! These were the delights of my childhood years. But after my chin bloomed with tender down, my heart was captivated by the more serious music of Oundle, which has reared her head as high among all villages as oaks rear their shady summits amid hazel-trees. This, rising out of living stone and of charming aspect, claims as its own an exceptional roof of piled turf (since anyone can make a roof of tiled stone), and sitting and riding upon the back of a projecting mountain, it dips its feet on both sides in the waters of the Avon: but it strengthens its footsteps by two stone bridges and buries its turret-bearing head amid the lofty clouds. This is the dwelling-place of those Muses, the sweet Camoenae, who with their music soothe the surrounding valley. There are five sisters of very different physical appearance, whose voices are equally different: this one rings on high; that one is ponderous and sings ponderously and with the resonance of thunder as she bursts forth her prolonged booming to the sky. Echo has heard her and has trembled in the depths of her abode. It is to be believed that the very spirits of the underworld have been moved by the music. These drive off anxieties; these purify the breezes of defilements and ward off evil spirits (if there is any credence to the tale) who, as soon as the bells resound from the lofty towers, hasten their flight in fear of the orisons of those at prayer. Thus in times past slaves took to flight upon seeing the whip, and mindful of their lot, they showed their masters their backs. How pleasing, how sweet is the melody, whether the sacred trumpets sound at a feast day or whether on an ordinary day they seem to concentrate their tones into a circle or with skillful rhythms to alternate thrice forty verses in succession! O who will add a sixth one to these? Then indeed they could alternate six hundred notes. But who is that excellent one who will grant them the ability to add measures to the hallowed herald as it ritualistically strikes one hundred times every year? Whoever it is, we will determine deserved glory for him. Behold! As often as the festive day of Charles recurs for us, the sisters arise in haste late at night, and they contemplate the mighty destiny of the forthcoming day. Then suddenly experienced men and skillful youths pull the ropes and rhythmically strike the bronze, and instantly they all proclaim their joys to the countryside. Close to Oundle and within the second milestone from there are situated all about fourteen hamlets in succession, hamlets that act as her pupils, standing by with their steep towers.</page><page sequence="87">84 Appendix 1 hae postquam accepere sonos paulumque moratae, attonitis similes, taciturno murmure secum hos recitant intusque canunt et carmina fingunt. ut sibi prima fides clangunt. turn protinus omne 90 campanile sonat dum tintinnabula cantant, et totas variis implent tinnitibus auras. astra micant blandum, reparabilis adsonat Echo.

As soon as they have the confidence, they ring out. Then every field immediately resounds as the bells toll, filling every breeze with their varied ringing. The stars gently gleam and Echo, recovering the sound, responds in accompaniment. But slightly more distant from them there is a hamlet (a hamlet once inhabited by many farmers until - something to make you marvel - sheep devoured both their owners and their homes). This, rearing its tower aloft upon a mountain top begins the song, but its fourth inhabitant falters - the only music familiar to the dog has been that of the shepherd's pipe. Meanwhile the Naiads are aroused amid their kingdom of blue, and stand halfway up in the water; then they command the rivers all about to stand still. Their wish is to indulge in joyful dancing. The waves stand still, with no concern at all to be mingled with the sea. The Nymphs apportion their tasks and reveal their joys: some beat out the dances with their feet; others sing songs. Calliope, the most beautiful of them in appearance, the leading songstress of the troop, ready to proclaim the song first, sings of a rejoicing people and the restoration of the King. She even takes pleasure in recalling the costly dangers to an individual so beloved, than whom no other monarch on Earth is more gentle or more observant of righteousness. Then she tells of Charles saved so many times, and of miraculous events: after his divine escape from war she sends him across the sea, then summons him back, and fetches him home again, and encircles him with a crown as he celebrates august triumphs in joyful peace. Then she tells of a people's joy and ecstatic happiness. But soon the bells realized that they had become heated by the joyous tones; for their bronze cannot adequately encapsulate joy so great. Their fear is that they may fade into nothingness. Waters, hastily speed at once to the deep: those who dwell amid the rocks have already begun to ask for you with ardent prayers, as have the fish exposed upon the shore. But as the years slip by the Nymphs, mindful of a service so great, and sporting in a frolicking stream about this, their beloved valley, wander three thousand paces and name the village after their own name. May the sweet bells be strong and flourish, and may they never mourn the grim heat associated with the movement of Cancer." These few things about bells and about the tuneful bronze I, an exile far from the Muses and far from the waters of the Cam, have sung and am delighted to have sung to my Wild here where the uxorious stream encircles Oundle's river banks, under the ever flickering stars, until a very sweet sleep closed my eyes. The rest the Muse knows.</page><page sequence="89">86 Appendix 1 Avicula En! viden ut volucris pictis iam florida pennis (aetheris ignaram cum primum sedula mater elicit in ramos extremos hospitis ulmi, qua patriam parvosque lares suspenderat atque inde audere iubet per inania) pectore toto 5 palpitât, ignoto metuens se credere coelo!

Do you see how the bird, already adorned with colored plumage (as soon as her painstaking mother has enticed her [though unacquainted with the heavens] onto the furthermost branches of a welcoming elm, where she had hung her homeland and little dwelling, enjoining her to make a daring flight from there through the void) utterly quivers in her heart, fearing to entrust herself to a sky she does not know! Her mother soothes her with exhortation, and by her own example proves that her fears are in vain: she persuades, commands, rebukes, exhorts; then she flies and returning, she grabs hold of her hesitant offspring; next she proceeds and comes back again upon a path so many times until a well-worn track indicates a clear route marked by the oarage of her wing. The daughter, stimulated by a mother's advice, often raises her delicate little wings and bending her neck, nods to her as she calls, pledging obedience with charming chirping. But as many times as she makes trial of the air with outstretched wings, so many times does she remain fixed amid the branches, stifling those efforts. Soon placing initial trust in her shoulders and overcome by shame, she flies off and beats at the empty air with inexperienced wings. Her mother, flying ahead, rests upon a neighboring ash with the intention that it receive her daughter hospitably in a foreign abode. As soon as she sees her borne by a flight that is exceedingly high, she is very afraid and rebukes her with a quavering shriek. In vain, alas! For she is driven on by such confidence in her wing that she forgets her nest and her previous fear, exultantly contemplates the sky and ponders the stars. No sense of duty, no regard for her parent can drag her away from there. She is borne along, and now gradually she ceases to be visible and, immersed in the sky, she lies hidden in the entire heavens. Alas a mother's groaning and her very mournful song! Ah how many times did she say: "My dear, stay; stay, you mischief-maker" (or so she seemed to say, filling the regions far and wide with her plaintive laments). "Where are you rushing to? Ah do not through your over obedience make a parent wretched; carrying out my orders was not worth such a price." Eventually revoking though in vain her injurious instructions, she called for her daughter; for her daughter she called twice with a mournful voice, and tore at her own breast with cruel pecking. She, flying and fluttering, fluttering and flying through the breezes, climbs in a high spiral; next she penetrates the spheres and in her erratic playfulness hangs suspended amid the stars. But when her wings grow weak and her strength grows weary, she sees that the earth is in the distance while all that remains are the unknown tracts of heaven's heights. A serious dread assails her that in her intoxication for the heavens she might be hurled headlong by the arrows of Phoebus and eventually fall and be thrust down to the gloomy underworld. Often, though unheard, she called for her mother, and all too late regretted that she had disregarded a parent's instructions. But amid her sorrowful moaning and as she plied her lamentations with sobbing, she looks back at the earth, and with wings pointing downwards, down she sinks.</page><page sequence="91">88 Appendix 1 Sepes Hortensis Hortus erat qualem veteres cecinere poetae cum poma Alcinous, flores numeraret Adonis; hie spatia ingenti multum solidata cylindro praebebat Musae meditanti laevis arena; margine quam longo pariter utrinque coercent, 5 et pingunt variis habitatae floribus herbae. at quis tarn cultae referat miracula sepis? quae densas aequata comas in vertice summo viminea ostentat viridantum armenta ferarum, ingeniosa manus mira quas luserat arte 10 Nasonis reduces pulchre mentita figuras.

It was here that a smooth surface afforded my practising Muse a space greatly strengthened by a vast roller. The surface is confined and adorned in a long border and equidistantly on both sides by plants inhabited by a variety of flowers. But who could relate the marvels of the hedge so well groomed? With its dense foliage evenly cut it reveals on its very summit a herd of green wild beasts made from shrubs, the playful work of a hand talented and amazingly skillful in its beautiful pretense that the shapes of Naso have returned. Do you hear how leafy Hylax barks upon the threshold? Look! He is preventing the animals from entering and is threatening the boys. Here you may see the Nemean lion roaring once again; here on the other side recurs the club of Hercules: moreover opposite, the Hydra hisses but not from a single throat, rising up in her rage, a monster that can be restored. Here you may see stags tossing their antlers on high, and does cropping the acres of a field made out of a tree. Look! A leafy hunter stands by, his reins held loose, poised in expectation and gazing intently as a Gallic hound threatens a hare from behind. But why should I attempt to express each individual scene in verse? Whatever Maeonides engraved upon the armor of Achilles or the Ascraean bard engraved upon the shield of Hercules - all that could be seen there inwoven in the trimmed shrubbery. The invigorating sequence of scenes cites the authors as authority. Nemesis at One's Back In the territory of Elto at the top of a lofty mountain where a path leads toward the citadels of those who dwell amid the rocks, there is a rock of three feet implanted in the ground, not unwelcome to the horseman when he wants to descend a mountain slope on foot and with his neck still intact. Perhaps Mercury positioned this or Terminus in days of old; or by chance it was in this spot that Astraea abandoned the Earth, marking her final footsteps by a rock of no great size. Once upon a time (so they say) a villain, an evil inhabitant of this countryside, stole a sheep from the neighboring sheepfold. He tied the four-footed beast together and raised it up upon his neck and shoulders. He was going along happily having acquired his booty and availing of the darkness (thus far did the beautiful Laverna smile upon his prayers), but he did not escape, nor did he get away with his theft without being punished. For once when he had climbed a slope, panting and exhausted, he sat down here upon the ground and lying back against the rock, he propped the sheep up against it. As soon as the sheep had found rest, longing to</page><page sequence="93">90 Appendix 1 libértate frui cupiens, conamine toto movit se, aversa saxique in parte pependit, raptoremque sui pedibus complexa ligatis adstrinxit saxo, lictoris muñere fungens. 20 nec sivere illum iugulo depellere nodum exhaustae vires et anhelitus interclusus. deprensus sedet ergo miser, dum vita per auras concedit moesta ad manes corpusque reliquit.

Entangling its own abductor in its tied feet, it bound him to the rock, performing a Lictor's duty. His exhausted strength would not allow him to release the noose from around his throat and he became breathless and stifled. And so the wretch sits there entrapped until his miserable life departed through the breezes to the spirits of the dead, and abandoned his body. Nemesis looms behind. Each man's crime is his own Lictor. It is the frequent custom of the Divinity to punish the savagely guilty, and she delights in sowing punishment in the midst of triumphs.</page><page sequence="95">Appendix 2 SuLEY Bowling Greene (Bodl.

Among his prolific output are twenty-four tracts and sermons published between 1619 and 1627, a series of funeral orations, collected sermons (published 1637),2 Latin treatises on the tetragram (1645)3 and on diphthongs (1646),4 sermons against antinomianism (1645)5 and most notably his full-scale edition of Marcus Aurelius, the product of forty years' research.6 His death occurred on 27 July 1654, just a few weeks before his eightieth birthday. Dillingham's poem appears as the first of eleven such tributes (seven in Latin; four in English composed for the most part by Cambridge academics and acquaintances), which were appended to Simeon Ashe's Gray Hay res Crowned with Grace: A Sermon Preached ...at the Funerali of ... Mr Thomas Gataker (1655).7 As such they take their place within a seventeenth-century Cambridge context and indeed seem to mirror sentiments expressed not only in Ashe's funerary oration, but also in Gataker' s own published sermons. Entitled In Funere Thomae Gatakeri S.T.B. Viri Doctissimi Octogenarii Vegeti et Venerandi Senis, Dillingham's piece turns to the world of Latin elegy (reflected in his atypical recourse to elegiacs) to depict its subject as a second phoenix now weary of old age and longing to acquire new life in death, piling up incense for its funeral and then burning upon its pyre. For Gataker such incense constitutes the sacred fragrances of fame and virtue, which he accumulated in life, a life that, like the phoenix, is now reborn on a celestial plain as his spirit has eluded the tomb and has made its way to the stars above. Yet his fame will live on, so the speaker states, through his writings, especially his edition of Marcus Aurelius, and his volumes, which will be read by scholars. The poem concludes in a conventional expression of grief: no verses could adequately convey this mourner's sorrow (even if the river Cam were to supply him with all its waters). Nonetheless this lament is presented as a pledge of genuine affection. The very title of the poem, with its emphasis on the vigorous and reverend nature of an old man {vegeti et venerandi senis) and by implication of old age in general, may reflect Gataker' s own comments on the subject. For example his sermon Abrahams Decease (on the death of Richard Stock) had proclaimed: "Old age is honorable. Yea, as the Apostle saith of Marriage, 'It is honourable among all men.' It is a 'resemblance' of 'Gods antiquitie,' who is called 'the Ancient of daies.' The glory Certain Sermons, First Preached and After Published at Severall Times by M.

And, old age or the gray-head is a crowne of glory, that is a glorious crowne, where it is found in the way of righteousness."8 The theme lies at the very heart of Ashe's funeral speech, which takes as its biblical point of departure Proverbs 16.31: "The hoary head is a Crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness,"9 proclaiming: "The beauty of old men is the gray-head. And the Apostle Paul speaketh of his old age as his credit, and that which should render him the more respectfull."10 It is a speech that appropriates the whole to Gataker himself: "his hoary-head was a Crown of glory, for it was found in the way of righteousnesse. Through God's good providence, he had a long time worn this his Crown, for he was well nigh Fourscore years old."11 Likewise James Duport's verse tribute appended to Ashe's sermon describes Gataker as a reverendus ... senex possessing vigor and a vegetam viridemque senectam}2 The poem's opening lines are characterized by their oxymoronic tone: the desire to prepare for new life through death (cupiens vitam morte parare novam [2]), the presentation of a willing victim of death who finds a funeral pyre for which he longs {optato victima grata rogo [4]). Such a tone likewise underlines Gataker's "Pious Epigram," which prefaces the collected laments. Thus: "I thirst for thirstiness; I weep for tears" (1); "I cannot choos but live, because I die" (5).13 More specifically, Gataker had conveyed something of that paradoxical quest for life through death in such homiletic writings as Abraham's Deceased: "For this life here, is in a manner no life; it is life in name, but in deed and truth, death. It is no true life that cannot overcome death, that yeeldeth to, that tendeth to, that endeth in death,"14 and The Decease of Lazarus: "They dye not, though they dye: death is no death to them: as they hope even in death; so they live even in death. As others are dead while they live; so they live when they dye. As to the worldly their life is but a passage unto death; so to the godly their death is but an entrance into life: their deaths-day is better to them 8 Abrahams Decease: A Meditation on Genesis 25.8 Delivered at the Funerali ofthat Worthy Servant of Christ Mr Richard Stock (London, 1627), 48. 9 Ashe, Gray Hay res Crowned with Grace, 1 . 10 Ashe, Gray Hay res Crowned with Grace, 11. 11 Ashe, Gray Hay re s Crowned with Grace, 38. 12 James Duport, In Obitum Reverendi Admodum Senis, 70-71: atque vigorem aequans vegetaque viridique senecta/ingenio florens etiam vergentibus annis (Ashe, Gray Hayres Crowned with Grace, 68).

Simeon Ashe repeatedly conveys Gataker's own rather impatient eagerness to leave this mortal life and find rest in heaven. Thus: "'I expect daily, yea hourly to be translated into that everlasting rest, which God hath prepared for them who are interested in his Christ.' These were his last words unto me ,.."16 Then just prior to his death: "July 26: Early in the morning, full of pain, gasping and panting, he cried out 'How long Lord, how long? Come speedily,'"17 and finally "July 27: Within an hour after, nature being quite spent, he gave up the Ghost, and was translated into that Rest which he so often and earnestly had desired to finde in another world, because he could obtain none in this."18 While the equation of Gataker with the phoenix likewise occurs in Thomas Ducard's lament ("A perfect Body of Divinity,/And such a Phoenix" [44-45]),19 its role as a Christian symbol of resurrection and afterlife finds an interesting neo-Latin parallel in John Milton's Epitaphium Damonis, a lament on the poet's close friend Charles Diodati. Here an ekphrasis depicting the phoenix looking back at a rising dawn serves to convey the envisaged resurrection of Diodati in a Christian heaven.2 But Gataker has also achieved a form of earthly immortality, guaranteed through his scholarly writings. Just as the phoenix accumulates incense for its pretiosa ... fuñera (3), so has Gataker laid his exuvuiae (6) among his learned works. This is his earthly treasure so to speak. Or in the words of Simeon Ashe: "He was not so great a Treasurer, as a free dispenser of those riches of the minde, which he did communicate readily, expeditely, cleerly."21 Chief among these is Magnus ...

In this way there will survive one to sing your exploits hereafter.] Three years later there appeared in the Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano (Cambridge, 1658), Dillingham's Latin elegy on the death of Oliver Cromwell. The piece assumes a rather conventional place in a multilingual university collection of predominantly Latin, but also Greek,26 Hebrew,27 and English28 epicedia on the deceased Protector. Indeed the bipartite nature of Dillingham's poem (lines 1- 17 on the death of Oliver; 18-25 on his successor Richard) would seem to mirror aspects of the volume itself - a volume whose title-page with its contrasting nouns luctus and gratulano reflects a twofold purpose: 1) to lament the death of Cromwell 26 Greek poems are provided by R. Widdrington (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, A2V), J. Cremer (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, D2r), R. Critton (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, D4r), and Charles Darby (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulado, Flv-F2r). Two of the poems (by R. Widdrington [Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, A3r] and R. Bowen [Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, F3V]) combine both Latin and Greek. 27 See R. Cudworth (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, *3V). 28 See Thomas Fuller (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, G3r-G3v), G.G. (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, G3v-G4r), Charles Darby (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, G4v-Hlr), R.H.C.J. (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, Hlr), B. Turner (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, Hlv-H2r), Dawson (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, H2r-H2v), and Samuel Fuller (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, H2V-H4V).</page><page sequence="106">104 Appendix 3 (Illa in Funere Oliven)29 and 2) to acclaim his successor (Haec De Ricardi Sucessione Felicissima Ad Eundem). In many respects the piece sits quite happily alongside others in a somewhat conventional collection,30 which typically convey in rhetorical hyperbole the grief felt by England upon the death of this heroic or quasi-heroic figure. Thus, like the majority of epicedia it reverts to traditional elegiacs,31 and compares the deceased to figures from a classical, and more specifically Roman, world. This Romanization of the whole is perhaps best conveyed in the words of an anonymous contributor, who states that in comparison to Oliver's achievements all the marvels of the Roman race should fall silent.32 Dillingham states that whatever constituted Roman virtue33 is buried in Oliver's tomb.34 One of the leitmotifs of the volume is the depiction of Oliver as a second Caesar. Thus Charles Darby asks: "For where is Rome if Caesar be not there."35 The theme is perhaps most fully developed by Samuel Fuller: "When Caesar dy'd then 29 The title page misprints Ule for Ilia. 30 Some less conventional elements in the collection include the pastoral setting of the whole provided by Anon, at F3v-F4r, as Tityrus is urged to proclaim the death of Daphnis amid a pastoral landscape characterized by pathetic fallacy. Striking too is a certain Dawson's depiction of Oliver waging wars on a cosmic and quasi-celestial level (H2r-H2v). 31 Contrast, however, the neo-Horatian poems by R. Huckle (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Lucius et Gratulano, B2r-B3r); Anon. (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulado, B3v-B4r); Bernard Skelton (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, Clr-Clv); Robert Quarles (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, Flr); J. Cutio ve (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, F4V- G2r). 32 Omnia Romanae sileant miracula gentis/queis animis par est Herculeusque labor (C3V). 33 On a syntactical level the rhetorical opening of Dillingham' s poem with its inverted syntax and quicquid (1; 2) quotquot (3) and si quod (7) clauses, which are resolved only in line 8, is paralleled by John Pratt' s Latin piece, which opens with a series of quas ... qui ... quod clauses (A2r). 34 On the tomb motif, cf. Charles Darby: "See, how whole Brittain strives to be his Urn;/And, while his dolefull Funerals do burn,/Is strew'd with ashes, like the neighb'ring plains,/' Mongst which the fiery mouth'd Vesuvius reigns./At Westminster, me thinks, I see each Tomb,/And statue brustle, for to make him room;/Wiping their dustie faces, that they might/Behold so rare a Monarch; at whose sight/All bow themselves, and that subjection own,/Which, had they liv'd with him/they must have done" (G4v-Hlr).

Turner "Nature's distrest, thy Grave seemeth to be/Th' last gasp her honour hath, inter' d in thee" (Hlv). 35 Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulado, G4V.</page><page sequence="107">Appendix 3 105 Tybers tide did rise"36 now replaced by "the Caesar of our time."37 As Caesar he passes on his dominion to his "son," a second Augustus.38 Other contributors compare him to such mythological Roman heroes and deities as Atlas,39 Hercules,40 and Mars.41 But quite striking in Dillingham's poem is the rather condensed Romanitas and pseudohistoricism of the whole as Cromwell is compared to such classical "heroes" as Alexander, Pompey, Scipio, Marcellus, and the Fabii. In none of the other poems is there such variano in terms of classical personae. But like the other contributors Dillingham echoes commonplace sentiments, lauding "Mighty Oliver" (magne Olivere [8])42 as a thunderbolt of war (belli fulmen [II]),43 the custodian of laws (legumque satelles [1 1]),44 and the envisaged recipient of a heavenly crown (13- 14).45 Several contributors depict Richard Cromwell as a phoenix rising from his 36 Musarum Cantabrigiensium Lucius et Gratulano, H2V. 37 Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus et Gratulano, H3r.

This short poem introduces the Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra (Cambridge, 1660), a multilingual volume (Latin, Greek, Hebrew) of university verse celebrating the Restoration. Read alongside such contributions, Dillingham' s piece is characterized by a typical air of graceful formality appropriate to a poem intended no doubt to encapsulate the spirit of the volume as a whole. Indeed where such contributors as William Fairebrother and James Duport had founded their pieces upon such witty anagrammatic punning as Charles Stuart/stei lar charus or Carolus Stuart/Ai Tu Ros Clams,54 Dillingham seems content to assume a rather conventional and dutiful place in a seventeenth-century royalist world. The poem's opening lines present the collection as an offering to the king from the river Cam at Granta: Musas/quas tibi Grantigenae porrigit unda Carni (1-2)55 for this is a patron who has ennobled Cambridge University, here described metonymically as "our . . . toga" - a reference to the academic gown: quum placuit nostram nobilitare togam (4). 6 This is reflected in several of the other contributions that depict him as, for example, the desiderium populi, gentisque togatae51 or as a second Apollo acknowledged as such by the university as a whole: teque suum agnoscit Grantana Academia Phoebum.5* The choice of deity has a twofold purpose. On the one hand, it equates the king with the god of poetry; on the other it evokes the light-bring, life-giving force of a sun-god, dispersing the darkness and creating a new dawn. The latter theme, which functions as a virtual leitmotif of the volume, seems to underlie Dillingham' s statement that Charles blesses the English people and calms the sky, and that he brings forth propitious days: qua tu fronte beas Anglos coelumque serenasjet populo laetos promis ab axe dies (5-6). The whole is developed later as the Parcae are envisaged as creeping their way out of the darkness of the underworld in order to enjoy the radiance of Charles, their new Apollo {en proreptantes tristi de nocte sorores/ut possint Phoebo te propiore fruii [7-8] ).59 The equation of the king 54 See Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, (Cambridge, 1660) D3V and O4V respectively. 55 On references to Cam and Granta, cf.

Dillingham,61 J. Worthington,62 N. Wragge,63 Thomas Hoiton,6* Richard Kitson,65 Robert Alfounder,66 and Owen Hughes67 inter alios.68 But this is a king who has a very close relationship with the Muses. Dillingham asks that he show favor to the Muses since it is by his countenance that they either stand or fall: tu placido aspectu faveas (nil amplius optant ),/illae etenim vultu stantque caduntque tuo Carolus, premat usque precamur/Parcarum et fusos regia sceptra regant (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, C3V). 60 Cf. ut lux post longas oritur mage grata tenebrasi sic tu, Car' le, tuis gratissimus advena terris/... cum tu Sol oreris, sunt omnia protinus alba/Sol oriens (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, *3V). 61 qualiter apparens post tristia nubila Phoebus/ splendidius laeto fundit ab ore iubar (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Blr). 62 tu simul ac nostro praesentior orbe refulgesjdiffugiunt tenebrae, Carole, luce novajecce horas, nulla temeratas nube, serenasì/en placidos soles, candidiusque iubar! (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Blv). Cf. Anon.: redde diem: radios petit alma Academia vestros/nam nova lux oculis est inimica suis (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, C2r). 63 tuis affulgeat Anglis/clarior e tenebris, fato sublimior omni/maiestas (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, C3V). 64 aspicis ut nigram radiis claríssima noctem/subsequitur tenebras sole fugante dies (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, A2V). 65 vidimus lucem tenebris fugari;/vidimus solem rediisse, claro/cuius adventu fugiunt ab altis/montibus umbrae (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Dlv). 66 sed tandem nostris illucet Phosphorus orisJAuroram ostendens extremo a margine coeli,/et portas soli paulatim pandit, at ille/purpureus pede primo attingens limen Olympi/omnia perfundit laeto splendore (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, I4r). 67 salve festa dies, rosea quae lampade primum,/ sidereo, et nostri Caesaris ore nites (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, K3r). 68 Cf. M. Thruston: salve, oformosum iubar! O laetabile lumen! /exoreris tandem, ac manifesto numine fulgens/ discutis horrendas tenebras (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Elv); Fr. Bridge: parce tuis (Princeps) radiis, Phoeboque minori/assuetas placidus da posse accedere Musas (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, I4V); R. Boys: Musa negai: sed Apollo iubet, mihi magnus Apollo/Carolus exoriens, omnia luce beans (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Llr); R. Chrichton: qualis purpuream sparsurus ab aequore lucem/Phoebus anhelantes aureus urget equosjtalia purpurea tu maiestate decorus/rex auguste, diem reddis ab oceano (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, L2r); John Boult: et Ule melior dum refulget Cynthius (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, M4r).</page><page sequence="112">110 Appendix 3 (9- IO).69 Likewise Robert Grove hails him as o sacra Maiestas, tu Musis divus Apollojtu stator populis Iupiter esto tuis.10 In Dillingham, this special relationship between king and Muses (symbolic here of seventeenth-century poets in particular and perhaps of the poetic art in general) will constitute a key element of the poem's climactic triumph: Carole, tu redimis Musas ornasque redemptasjsic pulchre munus protegis ipse tuum (17-18). But even before this Charles's anticipated acts of favor and patronage are reciprocated by the Muse herself, who is already weaving him a crown of triumph and placing it upon his hair: ecce triumphalem nectit tibi Musa coronam/imponitque tuis officiosa comis (11-12). This poetic coronation mirrors the very act of the Cambridge Sostra and its verse encomia of the restored king, but it also recalls such classical celebrations of military triumphs as those enjoyed by Caesar.71 For this is a national hero who has rescued England now envisaged as a nightingale snatched from the claws of an eagle and pouring forth a song of thanksgiving to her savior: erepta accipitri dulcis philomela triumphat/gratum soteri et fundit ab ore melos (13-14). Then in a fusion of the historical and mythological Charles is described as an heroically vindictive Caesar72 delivering the nation from the claws of the Harpies (Harpyiarum ungues cum nos iam iamque tenerent/Caesar ade s vindex [15-16]). While the Harpy theme likewise occurs in two contributions by M. Barlow,73 and William Leigh respectively,74 the equation with Augustus Caesar is to be found in poems by Richard Kitson,75 Thomas Gale,76 Robert Grove,77 R. 69 Cf. Radulphus Widdrington: Carolus est, semperque fuit, cui serviet uni/Doctrinae Musis quicquid et artis inest (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, A41). Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, E3r. 71 Cf. Richard Love: da modo, da facilis tua cingant témpora, princeps, /turn vel Caesar eas vincent fulgore coronas (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Alr). 72 This classicizing of the whole is evident in other contributions that equate Charles with such heroic figures as Hercules (Anglicus Alcides [by a certain J.B., Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, N3r]) or Aeneas (et velut Aeneas terris iactatus et undis/moenia conspexit tandem promissa Lavinijoptatas Britonum Carolus sic conspicit orasi/quo Phoebo in nostro coelo splendente vocemur/nunc iterum minima contenti nocte Britanni [R. Nevile, Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Mlv]). 73 Harpyiasque truces delusit niantes, /faucibus eripuitque bolum, certumque triumphum (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, B4V). 74 William Leigh: quae non mala sensimus Angli? ... Harpy arumque rapaces/ungues (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Glv). 75 sic tuos inter vigeas Britannos, /Caesar et terris dominare felix;/divus ut sero redeas in altos, /Carole, coelos (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, D2r). 76 Caesarem vehis; modo/sistas, quo placuit, litore debitum/terris, debita caelo/iuxta Phasiacam (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, D4V). 77 Thus England is stablized by Caesaris adventu (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, E3r).</page><page sequence="113">Appendix 3 111 Chrichton,78 inter alios. It is an equation that is hardly surprising, given the fact that Augustus had delivered the Roman nation from the horrors of civil war. Charles is thus punningly hailed as rex augustissime,19 endowed with the Augustan appellation pater patriae, and even envisaged by several contributors as surpassing his classical counterpart.81 Dillingham's poem concludes with the conventional "Long Live the King": "Carole vive diu," coelorum cura, tuique/deliciae populi, "Carole vive diu" (19-20),82 repeated twice in hymnic salutation. 78 Caesare venturo, visuri ad littora passim/hinc atque hinc vulgi confluii unda frequens ... Caesar ter maxime (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, L2r). 79 E. Foxcroft.: rex augustissime (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, K3r). 80 Rudulphus Widdrington: Ule Pater Patriae, legum veneranda potestas ...ut levis Augustam ventilei aura ratem (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, A4V). 81 Thus Andrew Yardley: Carolus Augusto sit uti felicior, et tu,/qui dictus olim es optimus (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, 13 v); John Boult: Augustiorem ... Caesarem (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, M3V). 82 Cf. B. Whichcot: Carole vive diu (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, A3r); H. Masterson: vive Deo gratus Carole, vive plus (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, B2r); M. Thruston: vive diu Magni proles genuina Parentis (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, E2r); T. Gearing: hactenus Anglorum suspiria, verba precesque,/nunc demum excipias, Carole vive diu (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, K2V). 83 On hymnic repetition, cf. Richard Love: Carolus ecce redit, regni tutela salusque ... Carolus ecce redit, pietatis cultor avitae (Musarum Cantabrigiensium Sostra, Alr), and, on a elaborate level the refrain rerum praeside Carolo in Theoph.
