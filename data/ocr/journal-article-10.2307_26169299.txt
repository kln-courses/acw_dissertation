Winkel, Daniel E. Toomey, and Robert Taylor Design Research Engineering ABSTRACT Thoracolumbar vertebral fractures are most commonly due to compressive loading modes and associated with falls from height. Two  injury metrics are generally referenced for assessing the potential for compressive thoracolumbar injury; the Dynamic Response Index  (DRI) and the compressive load measured between the pelvis and lumbar spine using the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) title 49  part 572 subpart B anthropomorphic test device (ATD). This study utilizes an ATD to investigate the injury mitigation potential of a variety of seat cushions during vertical impact in an  unrestrained seated posture. ATD responses and DRI are reported for 65 vertical impacts with and without cushions from heights  between 4 and 80 inches. The cushions investigated reduced ATD peak pelvic acceleration 63 +/− 11% and compressive lumbar load  42 +/− 9% on average. Results indicate a drop height of approximately 19 inches onto a rigid surface will generate ATD lumbar loads  of 1500 lbs, whereas drop heights of 42 +/− 10 inches were required to produce equivalent lumbar loads with a cushion present.  Conversely, the presence of a cushion had little or no influence on the resulting DRI. A 40 inch drop onto a rigid surface resulted in a  DRI of 20.3 and drops of 40 inches onto a cushion resulted in DRI of 20.5 +/− 1.3. ATD lumbar load is a superior tool for qualitative  comparative purposes. Neither metric has been correlated to human tolerance during unrestrained vertical impacts. Further research is  required to better define their relationships to injury potential.

Safety / Volume 3, Issue 1 (April 2015) 87 DISCUSSION The experimental study presented herein was designed to investigate  the potential injury mitigating effects of a variety of seat cushions and  aviation foams during a vertical impact. When the two available  injury metrics, lumbar load and DRI, are used to analyze the data, the  results differ drastically. Assessing the impulse experienced by the  ATD with the DRI model suggests that the presence of a cushion  affords little or no benefit in terms of injury mitigation. In some  scenarios, greater DRI values were found with a cushion present  compared to an impact on a rigid surface, a counter-intuitive finding.  Generally, application of the DRI model to the ATD pelvis response  suggests that a vertical drop of approximately 40 inches (impact  velocity of 10 mph), would be expected to be potentially injurious in  a young healthy male based on existing DRI / injury probability  relationships [22]. A 40 inch drop onto the rigid frame resulted in a  DRI of 20.3 and 19.2 to 21.8 with boat seat cushions or aviation foam  present. In contrast, the lumbar load experienced by the ATD upon  impact, was consistently reduced with the presence of a cushion  Figure 8.

Pelvis acceleration pulses and the corresponding  response of the DRI model during drops from 30 inch without a  cushion and with Aviation Foam 1 are compared in Figure 10. While  the peak pelvis acceleration, chest acceleration, and lumbar load were  reduced by 61, 53, and 35% respectively, the peak DRI were 17.3 and  17.4 with Aviation Foam 1 and no cushion, respectively. The DRI analog model for the human torso, with a natural frequency  of approximately 8.4 Hz, effectively acts as a low-pass filter with a  lagging response to short duration impulses. For vertical impacts,  such as those conducted in the present experiments, the DRI model  suggests that the only parameter of any significance is drop height, or  analogously, impact velocity. Impact velocity is unquestionably an  important parameter in determining whether an injury can be  expected but is not the only important parameter.

Safety / Volume 3, Issue 1 (April 2015) DRI value of 19 for very short duration impulses. The five impulses  and the corresponding response of the DRI model are presented in  Figure 11. This simple analysis demonstrates that DRI is insensitive  to acceleration amplitude for pulses less than approximately 50  msec. in duration. To achieve 10% and 25% reductions in DRI  relative to a pure impulse of infinite magnitude and zero duration,  pulse durations of 48 and 80 msec. are required. The associated  stopping distances for sine-squared pulses 48 and 80 msec. in  duration are 4.6 and 7.6 inches, respectively. The origins and development of the DRI model are intimately tied  to aviation ejector seat research where pulses were considerably  longer than those associated with a vertical impact in a seated  posture with or without cushions present. Based on the results of the  present study, the DRI model has limited utility in assessing the  injury mitigation potential of a cushion for thoracolumbar  compressive fracture. DRI suggests, counterintuitively, that  cushions have negligible benefits and may even promote injury  potential during a vertical seated impact. Figure 11. Idealized sine-squared pulses (upper) for an equal change in  velocity of 10.8 mph and corresponding response of the DRI model (lower). Hybrid II ATD Lumbar Compressive Load Unlike the DRI model, the compressive lumbar load experienced by  the ATD was reduced considerably with the presence of a cushion. In  addition, ATD peak lumbar load can be used to qualitatively  differentiate one cushion from another. Using an ATD compressive  load of 1500 lbs. as a threshold, the threshold would correspond to a  drop height of approximately 19 inches without a cushion present and  a drop height of 42 +/− 10 inches for the cushion / foam specimens  investigated. The compressive loads experienced by the ATD indicate  that a cushion has some finite potential to reduce the potential or  severity of compressive spinal injury during a vertical impact. ATD  lumbar load appears to be a more reliable tool for the design and  evaluation of cushions and other injury mitigation devices.
