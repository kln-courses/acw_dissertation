Travaux de la Maison de l'Orient et de la M?diterran?e, No. 46. Lyon: Maison de l'Orient et de la M?diterran?e?Jean Pouillux, 2007.196 pp., 9 figures, 24 plates. Paper. 25.00. The island of Cyprus is well known for its abundant and lively terracotta figurines. Beyond site publications, there have been some important regional figurine studies, but theoretical analysis has largely been restricted to pre historic figurines. Despite an international conference on Cypriot terracottas (Vandenabeele and Laffineur 1991) and Vassos Karageorghis's useful six-volume collection of figurines (Karageorghis 1991-1996), few studies have taken advantage of past work to approach the material from a new perspective. Fourrier begins where past figurine studies have left off, situating the coroplastie industry within the sociopolitical culture of the island in a specific period. Her focus on the social significance of style and craft produc tion in the Cypro-Archaic period along with the island wide scope of her study is refreshing and represents one of many new approaches in Mediterranean figurine studies. Fourrier lays out the scope of her study and metho dology in a brief but important introduction (pp. 13-20). Reconstructing Archaic Cyprus is notoriously problematic due to the rarity of textual evidence, which hinders our understanding of the political organization of the island during one of the most affluent and creative periods of Cyp riot history. Scholarly debate has centered on the origin and number of the royal kingdoms (see most recently Iaco vou 2008; Voskos and Knapp 2008). In the absence of texts, scholars have turned to the rich archaeological evidence to reconstruct the history and borders of the kingdoms. Four rier makes use of a previously untapped (and seemingly</page><page sequence="2">2010 BOOK REVIEWS 97 unlikely) source for understanding the island's political organization: the abundance of figurines produced through out the island during the Cypro-Archaic period. Her study focuses on this period for two reasons: it is an especially creative and prolific period of figurine production, and it is a critical phase in the development of the kingdoms. Fourrier's objective is targeted. She does not attempt to provide detailed analyses of coroplastic manufacturing tech niques, types, or figurine iconography. Rather, by organiz ing a wide sample of figurines into stylistic groups, she reconstructs discrete cultural groups that likely reflect the political boundaries of the kingdoms. Fourrier uses a carefully assembled and representative corpus of mostly published anthropomorphic figurines. She succinctly lays out her definition of style ("La demarche stylistique"), rightly challenging past linear views of style, asserting that "le style, est au contraire, ce qui est partag? par toutes les productions issues d'une m?me commu naut?, quelles que soient leur qualit? ou leur chronologie relative" (p. 15). Fourrier outlines her stylistic groups ("Les groupes de production"), publishing her corpus in an annex (pp. 125-73). This annex, organized by site according to manufacturing technique, is streamlined, including only the museum inventory number and brief bibliographic ref erences. This is justifiable because almost all the figurines have been previously published and including a catalog would have made the annex unwieldy. Nevertheless, sim ple descriptive phrases (e.g., horse and rider) are missed. The corpus consists of figurines primarily from sanctuar ies, including selections from urban, peripheral, and extra urban shrines. Since archaeological context is crucial for this approach, only figurines from known contexts are in cluded. The corpus is additionally limited to anthropo morphic figurines, again to keep the size of the corpus manageable (although Fourrier notes that that same method could be applied to other types), but also because stylistic differences are easily discernible in the facial fea tures of anthropomorphic figurines. Having identified the stylistic groups, Fourrier next attributes them to a centre cr?ateur (designated in the annex with a capital letter; the groups are further divided by Arabic numerals). Distin guishing workshops and stylistic groups is based on several factors, including choice of models, use of manufacturing techniques, and stylistic facial details (pp. 18-19). Fourrier contends that there was a distinct artistic style adopted for objects produced throughout each kingdom's territory, and that workshops created material stylistically similar to that made in the cultural and political center of the kingdom. Style served as an agent in creating cultural identities. She asserts that "un sanctuaire rural ne peut pas ?tre un centre cr?ateur, m?me d'un style consid?r? comme 'provincial'" (p. 19), a claim that challenges the undue importance given to Ayia Irini and other rural sanctuaries as the birthplace of some styles. The products of such sanctuaries must be evaluated with the uneven archaeo logical record in mind (for example, the lack of evidence from the capital Soloi affects our understanding of the Ayia Irini material). After establishing a framework, the book is then di vided into two main sections. Part I ("Les centres pro ducteurs," pp. 21-100) presents the regional production groups organized in nine chapters. The production groups include Salamis, Idalion, Kition, Amathus, Kourion, Pa phos, Marion, Soloi, and the northern island (Lapithos and Kazaphani). Within each chapter, Fourrier explores the production center that created a regional style before discussing the diffusion of the style throughout the territory, beginning with sites nearest the capital (cercle proche), sanctuaries in the territory (les sanctuaires de territoire), and ending with border sanctuaries (les sanctuaires de fronti?re), when evidence allows. This section provides an excellent list and summary of the sanctuaries throughout the island arranged by likely political boundaries, a valu able reference. Not all scholars, however, will agree with Fourrier's conclusions in this section. Part II ("Ateliers, sanctuaires et royaumes," pp. 101? 24) presents broader conclusions about the relationships among coroplastie workshops, sanctuaries, and the king doms. The first chapter of this section ("La naissance des styles") tackles the tricky issue of Cypriot chronology. Founder's critical assessment of past stylistic divisions leads to some important chronological revisions. The prob lems with Gjerstad's proposed chronology for Ayia Irini have long been noted, with debates over high and low chronologies based on comparison between material from Cyprus and Cypriot material from Aegean contexts. Four rier takes issue, however, not only with Gjerstad's abso lute dates, but with his relative chronology as well. She challenges his proposed linear succession of styles and systematically deconstructs the overly nuanced stratigra phy used to corroborate it before offering a new and con vincing solution to a long-standing chronological problem. Chronological issues disappear if one interprets the Ayia Irini styles as representing not change over time, but rather regional stylistic groups. The beginning of regional styles has a direct relation ship with the formation of the kingdoms on Cyprus (pp. 107-9). Although Fourrier ultimately agrees with an ear lier foundation date for the kingdoms, she emphasizes the dynamic nature of the kingdoms throughout the Early Iron Age. In the end, their foundation date becomes less impor tant when one recognizes the importance of the Cypro Archaic period in their development, whether they began in this phase or were reorganized into centralized states around an urban center with a defined territory. This reor ganization coincided with the development of secondary urban centers, extra-urban sanctuaries, and, Fourrier con tends, the birth of coroplastie styles. Fourrier argues that these are all effects of the consolidation and organization of the territory by a centralized state ("la naissance des styles participe de cette nouvelle constitution politique et culturelle," p. 109).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 357 In the second chapter of part II ("Identit?s culturelles et territoires politiques"), Fourrier uses the information on cultural/political identities drawn from the figurines and proposes a theoretical map of the Archaic kingdoms (fig. 9). Like the well-known maps proposed by D. W. Rupp (1987: maps 4, 6), Fourrier's map offers a snapshot of the kingdoms and their borders between the second half of the seventh century to the beginning of the fifth century b.c.e. The number of kingdoms changed throughout time, but the figurine evidence suggests that nine kingdoms existed in the Cypro-Archaic period. Fourrier compares her con clusions against the epigraphic and numismatic evidence and posits hypothetical borders. For each kingdom, Four rier provides a useful overview of the evidence for that kingdom, the coroplastic style found throughout its terri tory, and a discussion of its borders. Fourrier's summary highlights the variety of the kingdoms, stating, "il n'existe pas de mod?le g?ographique des royaumes chypriotes ar cha?que" (p. 120). The final chapter ("Les sanctuaires") highlights the ac tive role of sanctuaries and religion in community build ing, which explains why sanctuaries proliferated at the same time the kingdoms were organizing and defining their territory. In addition to religion, Fourrier asserts that there is a direct correlation between style, cultural iden tity, and political boundaries and that coroplastic produc tion centers functioned as active agents in creating and maintaining cultural identities related to the royal king doms. Fourrier's approach of placing the development of artistic style within a political framework draws heavily on the work of Croissant (1983), while also drawing upon studies on the political aspect of religion, most notably de Polignac (1996). Following de Polignac, Fourrier divides Cypro-Archaic sanctuaries into three broad categories: sanctuaries urbains, p?ri-urbains, and les sanctuaries de territoire. This is perhaps the least developed section of this book, but Fourrier has laid the groundwork for future studies on the complexities of Cypriot religion and cult. This work is a valuable contribution to Cypriot archae ology. Fourrier's focused scope has its advantages: it al lows for a concise presentation of the evidence geared toward scholars familiar with Cyprus. The conclusions put forth, however, will likely be of interest to a broader audi ence, and an extended introduction and conclusion would have made this material more accessible to Mediterranean scholars in general. The selected black-and-white illustra tions are of good quality, but more coordination among the images, the annex, and the text would help guide the reader through the visual evidence. None of these minor points, however, detract from the overall high quality of this astute study, which enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between craft production and the kingdoms.
