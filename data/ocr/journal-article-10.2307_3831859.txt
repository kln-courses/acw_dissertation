Being a white man among the blacks is like being an analyst among the whites. - Octave Mannoni2 A xjLlthough psychoanalysis and colonialism share a long and fraught history, the 1986 reprinting of Frantz Fanon's treatise Black Skin , White Masks doubtless altered the course of their relation- ship, promoting in some academic circles even the possibility of a lasting truce. While for years critics had disparaged Freud's notorious description of femininity as a "dark continent," using this analogy to tarnish psychoanalysis with fin-de-siècle imperial fantasies, a sea change occurred in the 1980s. Scholars began representing psychoanalysis not as complicit with colonialism, but as indispensable to its critique. Emily Apter credits some of this transformation to the "return of Fanon" that began in 1986 when Pluto Press reissued Fanon's best-known work.3 Homi K. Bhabha's introduction renewed interest in Fanon's clinical role as a psychiatrist and his shared 1 .

And although ambiva- lence about Freud has not disappeared from academic and mainstream culture, psychoanalysis increasingly is prized today for stressing "the impérium of affect," because such emphasis enables rigorous, historically exact accounts of colonial fantasy, identification, and transference.7 In light of such goodwill to psychoanalytic theory, especially after many mainstream intellec- tuals have sharpened their attacks on Freudianism, it may seem churlish to question the terms of this rapprochement. The following essay does so, however, because the principle of "dislocation," to which the French intellectual and civil servant Octave Mannoni alludes, can do much more for postcolonial critique than most scholars seem to realize.8 Although Jonathan Crewe argued recently that psychoanalysis strives to "assimilatfe] the native subject" to universal Western notions, but finds itself "exposed in a setting conceived as alien," Mannoni, in revealing forms of self- strangeness that all races experience, makes the principle of assimilation illusory, because psychically untenable.9 The resulting difference in perspective, crucial but underexamined, is the key point. Additionally, critics using psychoanalytic concepts often distort central moments in the history of psychoanalysis, thereby limiting, and even jeopardizing, its interpretive potential. Part of the rapprochement rests on an oft-cited but largely misunderstood debate - ■ Apter calls it a "feud"10 - between Fanon and Mannoni. It was Mannoni who sparked Fanon's interest in the colo- 4.

I would argue that the reverse is true, that Mannoni's mature work is ultimately the more useful. Despite claims to the contrary, Mannoni pushes for an understanding of racial conflict that is free of essentialism - indeed, for a perspective on otherness finally devoid of racism. My rationale, then, is neither willfully tendentious nor naive. I acknowledge profound weaknesses in Mannoni's early work, including his incipient universalist psychology (which eclipses ethnic dif- ferences altogether) and his reductive assumption, dating also from the 1950s, that economics and politics follow psychological principles. But as Fanon's debate with Mannoni has strongly influ- enced the ways in which postcolonial critics view individual and collective suffering, one must ask whether Fanon's political account of psychic factors advances or impedes the understanding of such torment. As David Macey explains in a recent biography of Fanon, "Whereas psychoanalysis speaks of fantasy, Fanon consistently speaks of trauma and explains mental illness as a form of social alienation."12 At the very least, then, Fanon's debate with Mannoni crystallizes what is still a fraught debate about the origins of colonial trauma. Viewing psychic conflicts as politically determined, Fanon sought explanations for suffering in the patient's cultural world. His 1952 account of the "North African syndrome" and late essay "Colonial War and Mental Disorders" are but two examples of his emphasis on cultural symp- tomatology.13 In a similar vein (and despite his temporary rejection of Jean-Paul Sartre's critical analysis of négritude ), Fanon adopted Sartre's ontological account of racial tension. But despite its emphasis on dialectical conflict, this perspective is more rigid than Mannoni's, for it locks Euro- peans in a category of sameness and fixes the colonized as Europe's "Other." As Fanon declared, in these now-famous words, "the real Other for the white man is and will continue to be the black man. And conversely [le véritable Autrui du Blanc est et demeure le Noir. Et inversement]"14 By the mid 1950s, by contrast, Mannoni tended to de-ontologize racial conflict, thereby dis- tinguishing between prejudice and persons. He began offering a more nuanced psychoanalytic critique of colonialism, in which otherness in the broadest sense is a determinant of conflict, rather than a guise that the colonized seem to represent to those who would subject them. For Mannoni, the origins of violence need not be external, but can obtain from the power of a person's racial 11. Apter p. 77. 12. David Macey, Frantz Fanon: A Life (London: Granta, 2000), p. 194.

Fanon declares, at the start of the first essay: "It must be possible ... to describe an initial, basic dimension of all human problems" (p. 3). Near the start of the second essay, he insists: "That imperialism which today is fighting against a true liberation of mankind leaves in its wake here and there tinctures of decay which we must search out and mercilessly expel from our land and our spirits. . . . The defensive attitudes created by this violent bringing together of the colonized man and the colonial system form themselves into a structure which then reveals then colonized personality" (pp. 249, 250). 14.

By stressing the influence of fantasies bearing no logical or even practical influence on external reality, Mannoni alters our conception of colonial reciprocity and relationality. This is something Apter almost concedes when summarizing this debate and explaining why Fanon's wrangle with Mannoni still haunts us: Fanon's famous attack on Mannoni . . . exemplifies many of the pitfalls and virtues of conjugating race and psychoanalysis. It shows, on the one hand, how suppressed colonial histories have been embedded within the conceptual apparatus of psychoanalysis, and on the other, how vital psychoanalysis remains to a nuanced understanding of depen- dency; whether at the micro level {colon facing off against colonisé), or the global level (the politics of "dependent" nations within transnational capital flows of debt, technical know-how, and actuarial projection).15 In Apter 's study, however, Mannoni is too embarrassing a figure to "rehabilitate]" entirely.16 Although she is "tempted to retrieve shards of [his] theory," this is, she explains, "not because I am committed to exculpating him from charges that he reversed the terms of colonial dependency (taking the result of colonial brutality and economic imperialism for the cause), but rather, because I think that in trying to map psychic dependency, he was onto something that he never properly worked out, or, alternatively, that he worked out in a displaced fashion in the context of his psycho- analytic theorization of fetishistic disavowal."17 Apter's reading gives us a strong sense of the breadth and speculative quality of Mannoni's work, as well as evidence that he was "strategically impugned by an underautoanalyzed Fanon."18 And critics have indeed followed Fanon here by tending to debunk rather than to explore the most inchoate aspects of Mannoni's theory. For these reasons, Apter's account of Mannoni, Lacan, and Fanon deserves careful reconsideration. According to her, we are nonetheless stuck with "the transparent ethnocentricity of Mannoni's reading of native character,"19 and should attribute devel- opments in his thought largely to luck and the benefit of hindsight. Drawing on essays by Mannoni that Apter does not consider, I contend that his late work retains some compatibility with his early essays and that both sharpen our understanding of colonial violence in ways surpassing nonpsy- choanalytic work on post- and neocolonialism. This, in short, is my assessment of the stakes of this debate: Mannoni's account of "native character" is not "transparently ethnocentric" but contingent on cultural traits, psychic drives, and the moment both become politically meaningless - because symbolically empty - categories. Although colonialism depends structurally and politically on the assertion of clear differences between whites and blacks, Mannoni uses psychoanalysis for anti-colonial and anti-essentialist ends, effectively to confound such fallacious thinking. Revisiting this apparently well-known material helps us assess what postcolonial theory might have gained had it substituted Mannoni's insights for Fanon's. It was, after all, Fanon who took from Mannoni and Lacan the suggestion that violence can ensue when racial identifications fail. This is one reason Fanon sometimes admitted that he was "willing to work on the psychoanalytic level ... the level of the 'failures,' in the sense in which one speaks of engine failures."20 Yet unlike 15.

In his formulation, aspects of racism defy logic and sense and thus should not be construed as simple extensions of political conflict. In sum, I would revive Mannoni's arguments and their impact on Fanon by reinterpreting a large body of material dating from the late 1940s and early 1950s to the early 1970s, focusing on Mannoni's and Fanon's respective debts to Freud and Alfred Adler, as well as their intellectual (and in Mannoni's case also clinical) relationship to Lacan. In this regard, I want to move beyond the obvious fact that Mannoni revised his earliest publications and that he and Fanon confronted colonial psychiatry as a conceptual horizon which we are now understandably anxious to forget. To my mind, Mannoni's work helps us rethink a set of categories - principally, sameness and oth- erness - that we have inherited from colonial theory. Although we repeat these categories today, often without considering their vexed history, they are tied to assumptions about personhood and racial difference that, traditionally conceived, offer little, if any, emancipatory potential or appeal. * * * * In the spring of 1947, Mannoni was busy recording his dreams. He had begun analysis with Lacan two years earlier but broke off treatment after three months to return to his administrative post in Madagascar. Mannoni had lived in that country since 1925, working as an ethnologist and director general of the colony's information service.22 Unremarkable in themselves, these details form a startling backdrop to subsequent political events. In March 1947, the Mouvement Démocratique de la Rénovation Malgache (MDRM) - a nationalist party founded in February 1946 - organized a widespread anti-colonial revolt in Madagascar (a "holy war against colonialism," in Macey's words), sparking riots and a brutal reac- tion from the French authorities that resulted in up to one hundred thousand deaths, roughly half the MDRM membership.23 Several months later, demoted from his administrative position - but before returning to Paris in January 1948, partly to recommence analysis with Lacan - Mannoni began writing Psychologie de la colonisation (trans. Prospero and Caliban : The Psychology of Colonization ), which Seuil published in 1950.24 Although he had lived through and even dreamed about the rebellion, his study - a psychological account of the causes and effects of colonialism in Madagascar - gave only a terse, impressionistic account of the massacre.25 21.

C'est là ma route : Carnets - that is, We're Parting.26 Clearly allusive, the title invokes his literal departure from France and, later, from Madagascar.27 But the course he would take was both geographical and psychic - a return to Lacan in Paris and an attempt to replicate Freud's dictum Wo es war , soll Ich werden , which Lacan later rendered as " Whatever it is , I must go there " in this way supporting his own metaphor of the drives as executing an elaborate "adventure" or "mission."28 According to Denoël, the pub- lisher, Mannoni's journals address "un 'lecteur fantôme,'" an imaginary, perhaps ghostly reader, devoid of character, race, and nationality - a Malagasy, in other words, and a French citizen, or neither.29 Partly owing to this national and ontological indeterminacy - the ambiguous, shifting refer- ent for "Nous" in Mannoni's title - the experience of reading his memoirs is unsettling, creating a type of dislocation or dépaysement , to adopt the Surrealists' word, that troubles narrative bear- ings and political expectations. Behind the "sharp, clairvoyant eye of the I," he writes, lies "a cone of shadow more and more dense [cône d'ombre de plus en plus dense ]" (p. 314), a statement complicating the idea that we respond predictably to colonial events. According to Apter, this sen- tence signals Mannoni's discovery of "the colonial unconscious" (p. 82), a point with hermeneutic repercussions that are worth parsing, because they determine how we represent colonial events and related psychic distress. The book's narrative perspective shifts erratically from haunting dreams about jealousy, regrets, and Mannoni's administrative burdens to assessments of extreme politi- cal violence. But the order of events described in the book - registered somewhat chaotically in dreams and diary form - is contingent more on insights provoked by analysis with Lacan than by external events. Nous nous quittons combines elaborate discussion of Mannoni's emerging thesis on psychoanalysis and colonization with scattered commentary on what Maurice Bloch calls "one of the bloodiest episodes of colonial repression on the African continent."30 Mannoni's journal is thus a testament to connected, but nonidentical realms - what Lacan in 1936 called "a relation between the organism and its reality . . . between the Innenwelt and the UmweWm Mannoni's similar stress on gaps between our "inner reality" and "the outer world" is arguably one of his work's heuristic - and, for some, exasperating - values.

Obscurely, the content of his dreams informs a theory of colonialism, Psychologie de la colonisation , itself staging a confrontation between two different registers of personality: the dependent and the inferior. Critics often forget this doubled (even multiple) stress on deracination when disparaging Mannoni's colonial theory. But his emphasis on psychosocial distortion indicates where psychic and external reality part company. Indeed, since Mannoni's dreams partly signify the legacy of his analysis with Lacan preceding the MDRM revolt, their content is often irreduc- ible to social commentary and conventional meaning, thereby frustrating expectations of political transparency. Certainly, the memoir gives us no clear answers about colonialism or national self- determination - one reason that we should read it carefully rather than throwing it aside. Nous nous quittons complicates political causality by failing to attribute violence conclusively to either the French or the Malagasy. Additionally, the book's language is highly allusive, partly capturing through puns the surreal landscape of dreams and the unconscious. For instance, Man- noni records a dream - dated 6 August 1947, five months after the French authorities brutally suppressed the anti-colonial revolt - during which his feet sink slowly into the muddy streets of Tananarive in Madagascar. Torn between a sense of paralysis and fear that he is "perhaps making too much fuss," he "ask[s] for aid and stretch [es] out [his] hand," only to discover that "Malagasy women, small and young, pass by in the rain, blurred. I stretch out my hand to them, they look at me and pass." When in the dream Mannoni comes across an excavation and barrier, he "reads" the latter quite literally as a color bar. Indeed, since the sign on this barrier apparently is the word "propaganda" written in English (as is this section of Nous nous quittons ), Mannoni believes that the sign is meant to inform the Malagasy and to dupe the French, an idea that in the dream makes him feel "almost indignation" (p. 373). 32 Although the dream's symbolism seems overdetermined, one might best approach it by invok- ing the famous opening words of L.P. Hartley's The Go-Between, published six years afterwards: "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there."33 Often taken as a sign of evasion because it seems to eclipse reality, this oneiric emphasis in fact betrays the idea that all aspects of colonialism are epistemologically certain. Such emphasis also complicates any simple depiction of European sameness, including the idea that European fantasies, dreams, and policies cohere in a single aim. In passages from the book that are not marked as dream sequences, Mannoni insists on "treating philosophy like delirium," the better to uncover "its profound roots in consciousness, the unconscious, and the social." Treating philosophy as a kind of "madness" helps expose what, of colonialism, doesn't add up or make sense. "The right to psychoanalyze metaphysics," he adds, "stems from a certain dissatisfaction in the physical realm. It's an evasion. A successful psychoanalysis ought to help us return to this [doit nous permettre ďen revenir ]" (p. 290). But to ask, to what are we returned, and is this equivalent to what we feel compelled to revisit seems in this context especially vexing and difficult to answer. As Mannoni later realized, psychoanalysis defeats - rather than enables - reparative approaches to colonialism. A successful psychoanaly- sis could neither return the French and the Malagasy to life as it had been, nor reconcile them to 32. Apter engages with this dream in Continental Drift, pp. 91 and 255 n.32.

During analysis, a type of "dislocation" occurs that permanently alters the "relation between the organism and its reality," Mannoni provocatively likening the result to decolonization.34 Although some crit- ics might balk at this metaphor, deeming it opportunistic, arguably it shows that psychoanalysis, strictly conceived, is integral to postcolonial critique. As Mannoni explains, the enigmas fueling the interpretive path of psychoanalysis transform - even "decolonize" - external reality, because "it's undoubtedly the unconscious that pushes [us] on toward rupture [originally: V inconscient qui me pousse vers la rupture ]" (p. 145). Shattering many of colonialism's psychic and political structures, such crises of meaning are essential to any lasting transformation of society since they break up colonial patterns, including the fantasies that invest them with meaning. One might fault Mannoni's purportedly "objective" studies, including Prospero and Caliban, for representing politics as if it were an extension of psychic turmoil - for "relying," as Bloch puts it, "on psychoanalytic theories that supply facile motivational explanations for actions that at first sight are meaningless to the foreign observer" (p. vi) - but doing so would misrepresent Mannoni's claims and ignore almost all of his other work. Moreover, Bloch's assessment is itself ambiguous: If such "motivational explanations" are meaningless "at first sight," are they any clearer belatedly, retrospectively? Although Mannoni certainly thought so, he insisted that psychoanalysis could not resolve political crises - not because it is apolitical, but because it engages with conflicts that frustrate strategy. Such an approach, in his words, "cannot help us formulate a colonial policy [ne permet pas de mieux dessiner un plan de politique coloniale ]" (pp. 167; 161); if anything, psycho- analysis pushes us in the opposite direction, where policies fail and become unworkable, because they are shown to lack meaning. This itself is surely a valuable political point, signaling what psychic elements must fall out of representation in order to give colonialism the appearance of consistency, but Bloch misses this idea. He ignores the fact that it is impossible, in Mannoni's terms, to define racial conflict simply as a nonpsychic phenomenon. This point becomes evident when we revisit not only Prospero and its now famous critiques by Aimé Césaire, Fanon, and Albert Memmi, but also Mannoni's journals; his subsequent commentary on Lacan's early seminars; his radical departure from colonial psychiatry; and his retraction of much of Prospero in 1956 and 1964, especially in "The Decolonisation of Myself" (1966) and "Terrains' de mission?" (1971). 35 We should also consider his arguments in several articles preceding, anticipating, and modifying Prospero : "Le complexe de dépendance et la structure de la personnalité" (1947), published in several installments; "La personnalité malgache" (1948); "Colonisation et psychanalyse" (1948); "Psychologie de la révolte malgache" (1950); and "La plainte du noir" (1951).36 * * * * 34.

But while Fanon's and Bloch's arguments point up many weaknesses in Mannoni's thesis, they cannot explain the ferocity of the French authorities' retaliation for the Madagascan revolt, or account for a genocide incomprehensible within even the twisted, paternal- istic frame of French colonialism. An impasse arises here concerning the motivation for ethnic violence, which corresponds roughly to Mannoni's and Fanon's competing emphases. But whereas Mannoni initially tried to interpret the ontology of colonial structures, suggesting radically that "the negro ... is the white man's fear of himself [le Nègre, alors , c'est la peur que le Blanc a de lui-même ]" ( Prospero , pp. 200; 191), Fanon offered a more blanket assessment of racial violence, insisting "It is the racist who creates his inferior [c'est le raciste qui crée V infériorisé]" {Black Skin, pp. 93; 77). Fanon's and Bloch's perspectives represent psychic conflict as largely an effect of colonialism; Mannoni's is close to inverting this claim, viewing psychic and "extrasocial" concerns as not only paramount, but also a possible explanation for colonial aspirations. More important, Mannoni underscores that there's "no watertight barrier [aucune barrière étanche] between the psychology of the colonized and that of the European," because both constituencies are " only too similar " in their apprehension of hostile thoughts and drives.38 In April 1950, Mannoni published a brief article in Esprit - "Psychologie de la révolte malgache" - that ostensibly is just a précis of his forthcoming book, Prospero and Caliban. But the Esprit essay - one of four in a special issue on "Humanisme contre guerres coloniales" - is more subtle, acute, and politicized than Prospero. For a start, Mannoni engages at length with the MDRM revolt - a phenomenon that his book condensed into six pages - and in his essay's open- ing paragraph, he refutes conclusively the ethnographic and sociological "pretension" that objec- tivity is possible, a point that neither Fanon nor Bloch properly heeded. "In every inter subjective situation," he explains, "what is human in the relation manifests itself [s'établissent des rapports humains ], and the actions of the 'indigenous' attach themselves as well to this relation. Man is never a pure object . . (p. 581). The unconscious not only thwarts reciprocity, in other words, but betrays the particularity of individuals' fantasies. Unlike Fanon, Mannoni stresses the collapse of objectivity and meaning, as well as the aggressive transference that replaces both.

Our perception is contingent on an imago, he insists, and this helps to explain the existence of prejudice among those who have neither left their own countries nor had any contact with other races. "The observer," he points out, can be "repelled by the thoughts he encounters in his own mind, and it seems to him that they are the thoughts of the people he is observing" ( Prospero , p. 20; also pp. 120-21). A specious innocence is in this way recovered "by accusing someone else of what he considers to be a fault in himself" (p. 20). According to Mannoni, these projections have material effects - they may at times be indis- tinguishable from acts (see "Decolonisation," p. 329; "Colonisation et psychanalyse," p. 94). But while projection seems, to the colonizer, to rationalize hatred, it also shatters any notion of perfect symmetry between him and the colonized, making clear that each refers first to a mental image, a precursor to Lacan's interest in part objects (objets petit a ); these, we stress, are neither identical nor reducible to people or objects, and thus have no intrinsic racial meaning or content. Accord- ing to Mannoni, we should probe - and try to dismantle - the "imaginary" character of these reactions [caractère ' imaginaire * de ces réactions ]" ("Psychologie," p. 591; also "Colonisation et psychanalyse," p. 94), while recognizing that the subject also experiences racism in its symbolic and real dimensions. Mannoni's article provides a significant account of the anti-colonial revolt. He argues that the whites in Tananarive organized a conspiracy ("petit comploť ), hoping to paralyze military conflict by exploiting the Malagasy's divided loyalty between the French and the new authorities. These were now the "beneficiaries of a transference from which the French had for a long time profited [ bénéficiaient seules de ce transfert affectif dont ils avaient longtemps profité ]" (p. 589). This argument is much subtler than Mannoni's discredited account of dependency in Prospero. "Not all peoples can be colonized," he had explained in a notorious phrase later recanted; "only those who experience this need [ceux qui possèdent ce besoin ]" (pp. 85; 88). Citing this and other passages, Fanon shows where Mannoni's study appeared complicit with colonization. "Wherever Europeans have founded colonies of the type we are considering," Mannoni had written, "it can safely be said that their coming was unconsciously expected - even desired - by the future sub- ject peoples [attendus, et même désirés dans l'inconscient de leurs sujets ]" (pp. 86; 88, also qtd. in Fanon, Black Skin , pp. 98-99). But Mannoni revised these claims in 1956 and 1964, before rejecting them in 1966 and 1971. When reading Prospero alongside Mannoni's later articles, one witnesses the evolution of a thesis that is not identical to its origins, a conceptual lag that reveals important, often misunderstood elements of French intellectual and psychoanalytic history. * * * * Mannoni's thesis about inferiority and dependence in Prospero stems directly from what he calls "a failure in adaptation" (p. 102), an Adlerian idea implying pathology, although also one with powerful Lacanian implications, suggesting that our only reprieve from the ensuing malaise is through psychosis. At his most Adlerian, as Fanon later observed, Mannoni views colonial structures as fixed, even predetermined. At his most Lacanian, by contrast, his thesis addresses psychosocial patterns that flounder and misfire. As Mannoni's two complexes apparently predate colonialism, he suggests that the colonizer's inferiority complex is "already in existence in a latent and repressed form in the European's psyche" (p. 97). He is discussing primarily European men here and (like Fanon) has little to say about women. But as Hussein Abdilahi Bulhan points out,</page><page sequence="11">Lane: Psychoanalysis and Colonialism Redux 137 Mannoni is chiefly concerned with the means by which "the Europeans and the colonized were psychologically conditioned for colonial relations long before colonization occurred."39 While arguing that the social tie in Europe responds to the infant's need for attachment, Mannoni adds that this tie "exerts a certain pressure on the individual" (p. 97), its effects generally registering on foreign soil, where hitherto undetectable traits in Europe can flourish as domination, cruelty, and misanthropy, each granting significant "emotional satisfactions" (p. 98) .40 Although Mannoni's thesis is quite interesting, it evidently betrays signs of a "repressive hypothesis" - an expectation that cultural suppression translates into psychic repression, in such a way that the former's removal permits the latter's emancipation. This is a non-Freudian account of repression, however, as is clear when Mannoni invokes Adler, Karl Abraham, and Carl Jung in order to describe the child's guilt at breaking ties with his parents (p. 33), an argument that comes close to representing culture as the troubled outcome of unresolved psychic antagonism. Elsewhere, especially toward the end of Prospero, these hydraulic assumptions recede, and an antiessential- ist perspective on colonial failure and what is "barely accessible to the conscious mind" replaces them (p. 82). As Jock McCulloch put it, referring to the thesis of Prospero and Caliban , "Mannoni is emphatic that there is no constitutional imperative governing the Malagasy's dependence com- plex. If a Malagasy were brought up in Europe he would exhibit inferiority and not dependence."41 Later still, the functional dimension of racism further transformed Mannoni's understanding of the symbolic and practical collapse of colonial ideals. Since Mannoni refused to "draw a hard-and-fast demarcation line between the civilized and the non-civilized" ( Prospero , p. 19), he ended up formulating two accounts of dependency. We could call these "the evidential," based on materialist perspectives on colonialism, and "the counterintui- tive," which highlights the unconscious satisfactions that become attached to colonial structures. When Mannoni's study comes closest to the latter approach, the symmetry binding "Prospero" to "Caliban" breaks down, exposing the commitment of Europeans to unfair social arrangements, including those resulting in personal and collective harm.42 At such moments, Mannoni destroys suggestions of interpersonal and interracial complementarity, arguing that unconscious aggres- sion and resistances mediate both. To many critics, this conclusion blocks transformation and discredits psychoanalytic perspectives on colonialism.43 But the point is better put the other way: the failure of Mannoni's Adlerian claims about complementarity in fact made room for his more sophisticated perspectives on enmity and relationality, including ones based on culturally- and psychically-contingent traits. Consequently, Mannoni's argument focuses on the unpredictable drives composing individu- als, regardless of race. This can tilt into a de-historicizing gesture, to be sure, in which policies 39.

In his introduction to Prospero, Mannoni claims that "contact is made, not between abstractions, but between real, live human beings, and the closest contact often occurs at the least desirable level" (p. 23), an argument that establishes more complexly the possibility and difficulty of interpersonal relations. 43.

But Mannoni uses this last term to refer to "the sum total of beliefs, habits, and propensities that make the individual a member of his group."44 He wants to implicate Euro- peans in a structure from which they "derive . . . some inner solace," partly to establish why they are "greedy for certain other - psychological - satisfactions," including but not reducible to profit ( Prospero , pp. 88, 32). Rather than fixing Europeans and Africans in predetermined roles, in other words, he views their "emotional satisfactions" relative to drives that are culturally sanctioned, including domination, and ones that are harder to understand, such as the impulse to rid the world of other people (p. 98). In "Psychologie de la révolte malgache," for instance, Mannoni emphasizes the French attempt to "justify" the genocide they had caused, the fact that they remained so "sanguine" about their brutality, and their conviction that their behavior had been neither fierce nor especially racist, but necessary, even inevitable. As he states in bitter irony, this feat allowed them to "pose as untroubled torturers, without a sense of wrongdoing, while responding to needs that in reality they wouldn't have dared give up [besoins auxquels elles n'avaient pas osé céder en réalité ]" ("Psy- chologie," p. 592). The psychological truism that man is, in Freud's words, "a wolf to man" is so obvious in this context that highlighting the gap between Enlightenment rhetoric and the French (or other Europe- ans') behavior "as untroubled torturers" might seem willfully naive.45 As Freud ruefully conceded in 1921, in a devastating indictment of human cruelty, "We are no longer astonished that greater differences should lead to an almost insuperable repugnance, such as the Gallic people feel for the German, the Aryan for the Semite, and the white races for the coloured."46 Many postcolonial critiques truncate these psychic emphases, as Fanon did, by viewing them as politically circum- scribed. By contrast, Mannoni tried to invert this expectation, thus revealing the extent to which psychic life exercises obscure but determining effects on colonial acts. Any fear that the French allowed themselves to experience was, he argues, a terror of their own enmity, projected onto the Malagasy, and then recast as a form of persecution, before which the French seemed helpless vic- tims. "The danger is above all imaginary," he stresses, "as in a nightmare, in which a man fights against himself" (pp. 591-92). Mannoni does not trivialize this argument about psychic conflict, as Césaire later implied 47 He insists that the French sustained a treacherous illusion that helped them ignore the collapse of all trust, government, and colonial rule. We could call this an "investiture crisis" on a mass scale, in which the "enemy," the colonial neighbor, is perceived as inhuman.48 By identifying with the plight of their supposedly persecuted fellow nationals, the rest of France managed, as Mannoni puts it, to "disavow not only a specific colonial situation, but also, implicitly, everything that is colonial about our politics concerning the population of Madagascar" (p. 595). 49 Only a crude mischaracteriza- tion could represent these arguments as apolitical, indifferent to cultural and ethnic differences. 44.

Black Skin, White Masks), including a well-known critique of Mannoni's book, "The So-Called [Prétendu' Depen- dency Complex of Colonized Peoples" (pp. 83-108). Strongly influenced by Césaire's attack on Mannoni's articles from the 1940s, Fanon faults Mannoni's book for "los[ing] sight of the real" and apparently divorcing colonialism from economics (pp. 83, 86); failing to understand the "real coordinates" of the Malagasy revolt (p. 84); advancing opinions under the guise of objectivity (p. 88); misinterpreting various Malagasy's dreams (p. 106); "mak[ing] the inferiority complex something that antedates colonization" (p. 85); and arguing that colonialism responds to a need for dependency (pp. 98-99). 50 Fanon's critique is both compelling and measured. But while he highlights deficiencies in Mannoni's argument, it is necessary to stress that uninterest in economics was not one of them. As Mannoni emphasizes in his introduction to Prospero - and again in his 1964 Note to the Second Edition - "we must not . . . underestimate the importance of economic relations, which [are] paramount; indeed, it is very likely that economic conditions will determine the whole future of the colonial peoples" (p. 32; also p. 8). 51 Moreover, Fanon mentions once, almost in passing, Mannoni's theory of colonial violence - "The Prospero Complex" - and has, we stress, nothing critical to say about it. "What is interesting in this part of his book," he says, "is the intensity with which M. Mannoni makes us feel the ill-resolved conflicts [ conflits mal liquidés ] that seem to be at the root of the colonial vocation" {Black Skin , pp. 107; 89). He then reproduces Mannoni's interest- ing account of colonial misanthropy, the suggestion that the colonial wants "a world without men" and so rejects "a world in which Others have to be respected . . . because he cannot accept men as they are. Rejection of that world is combined with an urge to dominate, an urge which is infantile in origin and which social adaptation has failed to discipline" Ç Prospero , p. 108, also qtd. in Black Skin , pp. 107-08). Rejection of a world of other people, we might say, is an impulse surpassing adaptation. It is a drive that no society can master or fully eradicate. According to McCulloch, Fanon accepted Mannoni's account of the Prospero complex because he agreed "that there was a connection between colonial racism and sexual guilt, and gave a similar account of the psychology of colonial violence."52 Indeed, since "the purposes informing [Fanon's] and Mannoni's work were strikingly similar," McCulloch calls Fanon's critique of other parts of Prospero et Caliban "in some respects surprising" (p. 122). Such insights are invaluable, although for important reasons Mannoni does not limit racism to sexual guilt. By interpreting links between colonial misanthropy and the collapse of political structures, he seeks to make clear la révolte malgache"; arguably, the insights it raises- which Mannoni revisited in "The Decolonisation of Myself '-under- mine her suggestion that Mannoni "was onto something that he never properly worked out" {Continental Drift, p. 86). 50. See also John Gaffar LaGuerre, Enemies of Empire (St. Augustine, Trinidad: University of the West Indies Press, 1984), pp. 166-90. 51. As McCulloch observes, "Apart from [the] inaccuracy [of Fanon's suggestion that Mannoni is unconcerned about economics], the general weakness of his attack upon Mannoni results from his own uncertainty on two issues: first, the nature of the relationship between political-economic conditions and psychological disorders; second, the nature of the political and economic system he would favour for the Antilles" ( Black Soul, White Artifact, p. 220). 52.

Taking the dependency complex as Mannoni's sole claim (and Fanon's sole interest), many readers have greatly exaggerated the scope of Fanon's critique, thereby ignoring what he most admired about Mannoni's study.53 His chapter on the "So-Called Dependency Complex" in fact begins by suggesting that Mannoni's "grasp ... of the psychological phenomena that govern the relations between the colonized and the colonizer" is "unfortunately too exhaustive" (p. 83), an ambiguous assessment to say the least. He also appreciates Mannoni's "sincere . . . purpose," his "conscientious . . . desire to examine the problem from every angle," which tendency results in his "investigating] ... the unconscious of the Malagasy" (pp. 100-1). Acknowledging Mannoni's stress on "the ill-resolved conflicts that seem to be at the root of the colonial vocation" (p. 107), Fanon criticizes his thesis about the path of these conflicts in colonized peoples. "The Prospero Complex" - hatred stemming from unresolved guilt and aggression - metastasizes for them both as the symptom par excellence of colonial rule. The reason it does requires further investigation into their shared intellectual concerns.54 * * * * Despite Fanon's debt to Lacan, whom he acknowledged for helping him develop a theory about antagonism in its imaginary register (see Black Skin , pp. 61n., 80, 152n., 161n.), both Fanon and Mannoni initially used Adler's individual psychology to "help us understand the conception of the world held by the man of color" (p. 62).55 These words are Fanon's, not Mannoni's, and in some respects their mutual turn to Adler is the most surprising and least discussed move of all. Manno- ni's claims about dependency and superiority - clearly the weakest elements of his book - stem directly from Adler, who broke with Freud in 1911 to advance conceptually impoverished claims about "self-boundedness," psychological archetypes, compensatory behavior, and the inferiority 53.

Nigel Bolland, "Mannoni and Fanon: The Psychology of Colonization and the Decolonization of Personality," New Scholar IV (1993), pp. 29-50. 54. This is something many critics ignore or downplay. See especially Sekyi-Otu, Fanon's Dialectic of Experience, pp. 6-8, one of the best books published on Fanon, which nevertheless radically underestimates Fanon's perspectives on psychic life. Mannoni's and Fanon's conceptual and political proximity is perhaps clearest when one reads Mannoni's 1951 essay "La plainte du noir" alongside Fanon's "L'expérience vécue du noir," which appears in the same issue of Esprit (pp. 657-79). Mannoni examines at some length the injustice, exploitation, and humiliation that nonwhites often suffer; Fanon focuses perhaps more tersely on "the actual experience" of racial anger and shame. To grasp the psychopolitical frustration fueling both essays, one need only read H. Aubin's fragment on "primitive pathology," "Notes de psychologie pathologique chez le noir," Hôpital XXVIII (mai 1940), pp. 185-87. 55. In including this material, I am partly responding to Nigel Gibson's complaint that rereadings of Fanon have "result[ed] in a Fanon rooted in Lacan against Hegel."

The logical corollary of this absurd claim is that psychic health stems only from compliance with one's culture, an idea preempting - because pathologizing - all forms of social criticism and political defiance. But while Fanon's and Césaire's contempt for this argument is quite understandable, Fanon briefly charges Mannoni with loyalty to a critical paradigm that none of them fully supported. His critique of Mannoni becomes disingenuous and tautological here, replicating an argument about inferiority that both anticolonials, in different ways, rejected (see "The Negro and Adler," a later section in Black Skin). Even at his most Adlerian, Mannoni never took the argument this far. He raised implicitly the dream of a "nondysfunctional" colonialism - not through "assimilation," but rather through the "mutual adaptation of two groups," rather than two races, "with different mentalities [la co-adap- tation psychologique de deux mentalités collectives ]" (pp. 28; 36). In theory, such coexistence would dissolve colonial inequities; in practice, as Mannoni soon conceded, it could as easily leave them intact. Later, he accompanied Freud and Lacan in calling the very insistence on adaptation an intolerable stress on conformity, a coercive pressure partly responsible for the violence that Adler hoped to eliminate.57 Mannoni came to view the ensuing "failure in adaptation" politically, in other words, reading Adler's stress on maladaptive individuals as a symptom of colonial forces thwarting social change (p. 102). For Mannoni, this "failure in adaptation" henceforth would rep- resent a break with colonial patterns rather than a demand for their enforcement. * ^ ^ * Seven years later, in Portrait du colonisé précédé du portrait du colonisateur (1957; trans. The Colonizer and the Colonized ), Albert Memmi joined Mannoni and Fanon in rejecting the idea that colonialism could be repaired. Memmi also insisted that "there is only a particle of truth in the fashionable notions of 'dependency complex,' 'colonizability,' etc."58 We cannot fault these claims, but note, too, that Memmi also echoed Mannoni's theory of colonial misanthropy when alluding to " The Usurper's Role (or, the Nero complex)" (p. 52). In his 1965 Preface to The Colonizer and the Colonized, he even acknowledged retrospectively that "certain parts of the book of great impor- tance to me were obscured - such as my analysis of what I call the Nero complex . . ."

Unlike his main respondents, Mannoni signaled the nonreparative effects of this drama by alluding to the subject's rapport with an impersonal phenomenon, the Other (pp. 114, 116). In this way, he made the colonizer's projections of enmity a basis for, rather than merely a response to, colonialism's volatile bond. More controversially, but no less importantly, his argument about colonial positions helps explain how tyranny may persist in countries that ostensibly have achieved independence, but are in fact ruled by despots emulating former colonial structures. By contrast, when Sartre, intro- ducing Memmi, later called this bond "a relentless reciprocity bind[ing] the colonizer to the colo- nized" ( The Colonizer , p. xxviii), he did so because Memmi had represented colonial guilt as bad faith, rather than as an unconscious structure. The former, arguably, is much easier to identify and to change; this might account for its greater popularity then, as now, among critics and activists. While Memmi followed Sartre in adopting this emphasis, Mannoni both appropriated and influenced the work of Lacan. Actively involved in the latter's early seminars, including making brilliant interventions into the meaning of repetition and intersubjectivity, Mannoni helped shape Lacan's de-anthropomorphic account of otherness.59 Given the implications of this critique for postcolonial theory, it seems vital to stress that Mannoni thereby bridged two different forms of colonial critique: the master-slave dialectic that Sartre, Memmi, and Fanon in different ways adopted from Hegel (see esp. "The Negro and Hegel," Black Skin , pp. 216-22);60 and the Lacanian perspective, which rejects sublation and reciprocity, viewing arguments about colonial trauma as relative to the real. Instead of representing an order of experience in which we take refuge, the real creates "'holes' in . . . meaning," indicating where sense and politics fail.61 There is no shortage of critics arguing that these arguments, apparently ignoring diversity and history, amount to little more than allegory. Mannoni and Lacan are often viewed as delinquent historicists universalizing political conflicts in order to suit their own ends. Just as Bloch makes this charge against Mannoni, so, surprisingly, given his thoughtful work on psychoanalysis and film, Stephen Heath voices the same complaint against Lacan, arguing that the "idea of the Other and the symbolic is crucial to Lacan exactly because it allows him to abstract from problems of socio-historical determinations."62 Such misperceptions of Lacan's arguments about causation, deferred action, and the symbolic order have, in turn, spawned ever more general and unsubstanti- 59. This is not to say that Lacan always agreed with Mannoni's formulations (see Seminari, pp. 19 and 192, and Seminar II, pp. 15-16, 19, 20, 33, and 319). But he did acknowledge that Mannoni's "mind is too sharp, too dialectical, not to raise . . . a question save in the form of a problem" (Seminar II, p. 35). We also note Mannoni's interesting admission in the same seminar: "At this point, ... I find myself at a watershed and I no longer know which way to go. I wanted to share my dif- ficulty. I don't have a solution, just a difficulty" (p. 34), a point that has some bearing on his analysis of colonialism, as he would acknowledge in "The Decolonisation of Myself," pp. 333 and 335. 60. For elaboration on this model, see Fuss, Identification Papers, pp. 144-45 and 167nn. 7 and 9. Fuss's account of Fanon engages clearly with the Hegelian/Sartrean model, but engages only with Lacan's argument about imaginary identi- fication. Missing from her account is a sustained assessment of symbolic and especially real identification, to which Fanon arguably gestured when discussing trauma. See, for instance, "The 'North African Syndrome,"' in which Fanon discusses "this pain without lesion, this illness distributed in and over the whole body, this continuous suffering" (p. 7), and Fuss's brief account of this essay in Identification Papers, pp. 162-63. 61.

From such mischaracterizations, one would never know that Lacan's "family played its role in the fight against colonialism," Lacan's step- daughter, Laurence Bataille, being imprisoned briefly for aiding the FLN (Front de Libération Nationale) after her visit to Algeria, or that Lacan himself was, in Jean-François de Sauverzac's opinion, "one of the only [intellectuals] to sound misgivings about the renewal of racism in the period following May 68. "64 For Lacan, as for Mannoni, the conflict between symbolic and real orders is inescapably specific to language and history, yet irreducible to both phenomena. This irreducibility frees up the psychopolitical deadlock that opposing critical models inadvertently strengthen. Moreover, it is Heath and Gates who advance an oddly limited conception of politics, which - bereft of psychic effects - can tolerate only empirical and practical considerations. We should add that throughout his career, Fanon never countenanced this idea of politics - not even when he seemed most distant from psychiatry.65 These arguments evidently have had profound political implications, especially in the repercussions for postcolonial theory of Mannoni's shift in emphasis from interpersonal exchange - broadly, "the world of Others [le monde des Autres ]" - to the idea that we connect to language, culture, other people, and especially our own self- strangeness via an impersonal Other [L'Autre].66 Although both phrases appear in Prospero and Caliban (pp. 108; 108), the emphasis on a "world of Others" belongs properly to Sartre, Fanon, and Memmi, whereas the impersonal Other figures in Lacan's and Mannoni's work alone.67 One of the first and most valuable effects of Mannoni's later argument is its pushing colonial relations beyond selfhood and interpersonal 63.

See for instance Fanon's late essay "Colonial War and Mental Disorders," in The Wretched of the Earth , pp. 249-310, and McCulloch, who argues that "all of Fanon's works form part of a single theoretical construct. This construct is both unified and essentially coherent even though the manner of Fanon's presentation of his theory is often fragmented and obscure" ( Black Soul, White Artifact, p. 3). The remark is an implicit rebuttal to Gendzier's statement that Fanon eventually "condemn[ed] the system he studied because he believed it to be destructive of human life ... He abandoned psychiatry for politics" (Franti Fanon, p. 64). 66. Here, my claim differs extensively from Apter's: "Mannoni's Prospero/Caliban paradigm carries the Hegelian dialectic of Herrschaft and Knechtschaft- or more generally speaking, the problem of psychic servitude- forward his- torically into Marxist decolonization discourses" (p. 79). Although Mannoni's relationship to decolonization strategies warrants reassessment, Apter's argument works largely in the context of Prospero and Caliban's opening chapters; the Lacanian implications of his thesis, emerging in later chapters of his book, complicates Mannoni's relationship to Hegel and to Marxism. Stressing the Other's impersonal quality also distinguishes my argument from Julia Kristeva's interesting study of the foreigner and racism, Strangers to Ourselves , trans. Leon S. Roudiez (1988; Columbia University Press, 1990), which, despite its obvious debt to Mannoni's work, makes no reference to him. 67. See "The Decolonisation of Myself," p. 328. In Intellectuals and Decolonization in France (University of North Carolina Press, 1977), Paul Clay Sorum references Mannoni's article "The Decolonisation of Myself" (p. 329) to buttress his assertion that " Psychologie de la colonisation was written ... in collaboration with France's leading psychoanalytic theorist, Jacques Lacan" (p. 80). Although I have not been able to disprove this claim, "Decolonisation" says nothing at all about authorial collaboration, and refers only in passing to Mannoni's analysis, without mentioning Lacan once.</page><page sequence="18">144 Journal of Modem Literature exchange - "beyond the imaginary level," as he puts it68 - because the ego can grasp reality only by inverting and distorting it. Mannoni stated in 1950 that the collapse of colonial structures not only is inseparable from, but also may by caused by, the violent eruption of aggressive fantasies that Europeans project onto the colonized. What concerned him in "Psychologie de la révolte mal- gache" was the specious disinterestedness that the French colonials claimed to uphold as justifica- tion for their brutal violence. The "minute particulars" of historically-specific hatred and trauma that Mannoni and Lacan in different ways outline are thus a prophylaxis against the "empire of the selfsame" - the kind of imperialist politics that, as Freud put it sardonically, stem from "His Majesty the Ego."69 Moreover, because of his growing interest in what escapes the imaginary order in psychopolitical terms, Mannoni's argument shifted over time, emphasizing less an individual unconscious, for- mulated according to specific drives, than an impersonal structure - contingent on language and history - that is tied to collective forces. As he remarks in "The Decolonisation of Myself," "racial differences have absolutely no meaning in the natural order. . . . [They] become the significants (to borrow a linguistic term) which allow us at last to formulate, whether clearly or obscurely, the terms of the deepest problems concerning human relationships" (p. 333). The basis of this argument also appears in his earlier work. For instance, in one response to Lacan's 1954-55 seminar on "The Ego in Freud's Theory," Mannoni modifies Lacan's perspec- tive on intersubjectivity by pointing to a form of repetition that "may not be detectable in the thing that's repeated" (Lacan responded: "I like what you're saying" [pp. 188-89]). What recurs in colonial structures, we might say, has political and non-social implications for all parties involved - Mannoni's way of highlighting, before interpreting, the lapsus that emerges between subjects and their symbolic structures. As he observes, "in interpersonal relations, something factitious is always brought in, namely the projection of others on to ourselves" (qtd. in Lacan, Seminar /, p. 147). This emphasis modifies Prosperò 's thesis in crucial ways, for the "factitious" element demonstrates tragicomically why colonial relationships in particular are so transferential, and thus aggressively volatile, in character.70 In "Decolonisation" Mannoni uses this understanding of transference and otherness to signal what impedes crossracial understanding. "It is," he remarked, "as though the meeting between black and white, far from being an encounter between two 'undifferentiated men,' were a distil- lation of the difference between them - a difference devoid of any intrinsic meaning - which becomes the symbol, at once obvious and absurd, of what goes wrong in human relations , and 68. Mannoni, qtd. in Lacan, Seminar II, p. 78. Significantly, there are also grounds for reading Prospero's masque in Act IV, scene i of The Tempest (1623), as a way of "de-imaginarizing" colonial relations. Shakespeare is of course an important precursor to Mannoni's claims. And although Prospero and Caliban does not invoke the masque, several critics have noted that this scene holds up an image of paradise the better to reconcile Prospero and others to a world they cannot inhabit; they grow accustomed to, and learn to love, what is "marr'd" (4.1.127). For elaboration, see Peter Lindenbaum, "Prospero's Anger," Massachusetts Review XXV (1984), esp. pp. 164-65, and Joseph H. Summers, "The Anger of Prospero," Michi- gan Quarterly Review XII (1973), esp. pp. 128-29.

This antiessentialist claim indicates not only how fantasy enables and corrupts race relations, but also, and just as important, why the races are not locked in predetermined roles - that contra Fanon, white and black are not as self is to Other (Black Skin , p. 21 5). 71 Because in Mannoni's formulation whites and blacks draw on a "difference devoid of any intrinsic meaning" (p. 333), his understanding of the Other as an impersonal category displaced the Hegelian deadlock that Sartre described and reproduced in Orphée noir (1948)72 and that Memmi and Fanon, in turn, solidified. Mannoni's insights into history and deferred action also pushed colonial critique beyond accounts of scapegoating and mimetic racism - what he and Bhabha (who echoes him, perhaps unconsciously) called "grotesque mimicry" ( Prospero , p. 23)73 - and toward an analysis capable of engaging with impossibility, trauma, and what Leo Bersani has termed "inaccurate self-replications."74 This is arguably one way of ridding politics of egoic imperialism. As Mannoni explains, "Nous sommes là dans le monde de l'histoire ; nous y entrons à reculons ," a phrase losing much of its allusiveness when translated: "We are in the midst of a historical process; we are entering upon it blindfold [literally: backwards, retrogressivelyT (p. 161, p. 167). In short, while Sartre's, Fanon's, and Memmi's accounts of prejudice remain ego-bound, Man- noni uncovered powerful connections among racial violence, unconscious imagos, and elements of psychic life that belie meaning and conventional temporality. Addressing different forms of socialization and impersonal relations, he came closest among these thinkers to offering an anties- sentialist perspective on psychic and cultural aggression in its colonial, postcolonial, and neoco- lonial forms. Not surprisingly, then, his work also differs widely from Meyer Fortes's 1959 study, Oedipus and Job in West African Religion, first delivered as a lecture in 1957, and Marie-Cécile and Edmond Ortigues' co-authored 1966 study, Œdipe africain, which together stress the collec- tive dimensions of the Oedipus complex and base palliatives for individual conflict on a person's symbolic reintegration into his or her culture.75 In response to the view of such psychiatrists that paternalism is an appropriate corrective to African psychosis, Mannoni - representing paternal- ism as a symptom of European aggression - broke conclusively with their racist precepts. * * * * 71. When disputing the Adlerian formulation "Ego greater than the Other," Fanon offered this Antillean perspective: White Ego different from the Other (p. 215) According to Fuss, Fanon views whiteness as "a self-identical, self-reproducing term, [which] draws its ideological power from its proclaimed transparency, from its self-elevation over the very category of 'race'" ( Identification Papers , p. 144). Neither Fanon nor Fuss would dispute that this model of whiteness is precarious and fallacious- that it requires violence to sustain the illusion of self-consistency. The question that remains, however, is whether Fanon's conceptual understanding of race solidified this fantasy or signaled why it fails and can therefore be surpassed. 72.

I include in this latter group H. L. Gordon, author of several essays on mental disorders and "sexual perversions" in Kenya; B. J. F. Laubscher, author of Sex, Custom , and Psychotherapy : A Study of South African Pagan Natives (1937); and Colin Carothers, author of numerous articles and two influential books, The African Mind in Health and Disease: A Study in Ethnopsychiatry (1953) and The Psychology of Mau Mau (1954).78 Six decades before Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray sparked controversy in the U.S. by publishing The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (1995), Gordon was conducting elaborate experiments on supposed "racial" intelligence and Africans' and Europeans' cranial size, as though late-Victorian critiques of phrenology had never occurred, or never applied to Britain's colonial realm. James H. Sequeira could thus declare, in a 1932 issue of the British Medical Journal , that "Dr. Gordon has found that a low degree of mentality is widely prevalent [in East Africans], constituting what in a European community would be a social danger. . . ,"79 Carothers - overall, the most liberal of the above psychiatrists - extended these experiments by writing on "Mental Derangement in Africans" (1947) and "Frontal Lobe Function and the African" (1951).80 In The African Mind , he summed up his colleagues' discoveries, calling them "European conceptions of the African [that] . . . represent the truth": The African . . . has been described as conventional; highly dependent on physical and emotional stimulation; lacking in spontaneity, foresight, tenacity, judgment and humil- ity; inapt for sound abstraction and for logic; given to phantasy and fabrication; and, in general, as unstable, impulsive, unreliable, irresponsible, and living in the present with- out reflection or ambition, or regard for the rights of people outside his own circle.81 76.

Although some of these arguments recurred in contemporaneous psychology, the latter works generally came to different conclusions about the etiology of these characteristics, viewing them as cultural rather than innate. While Gordon was working on East African cranial size, for instance, Sachs published his unorthodox analysis of John Chavafambira, a nganga (healer-diviner) from Manikaland, now in eastern Zimbabwe but formerly part of Southern Rhodesia. Black Hamlet , his account of the analysis / friendship, is an often self-reflexive statement about his own interest in Chavafambira's well-being. Similarly, although J. F. Ritchie - "a convinced Freudian" - also showed little theoretical interest in his or other Europeans' countertransference, he began The African as Suckling and as Adult (1943) by stipulating that he could "find no essential differences between the African mind and the European."82 Ritchie's study is far from being a radical docu- ment, but it asserts at the outset a profound conceptual break with psychiatry's racial essentialism, instead addressing - and frequently validating - warped assessments of cultural differences. Although it would be easy to dismiss this shift as bogus, given its residual biases, it helped dem- onstrate the mutability of prejudices by underscoring many of their cultural roots, in turn enabling Mannoni's profound contribution a decade later. Ritchie's text flounders on the epistemological gap between nature and culture that Freud began theorizing in the late 1890s and that Lacan highlighted in the 1940s before erasing the last remaining vestiges of biologism in Freud's work. One reason for this obstacle is Ritchie's (and others') inability to control assigned parameters for projection; in their model, transference cannot remain the sole province of the indigenous. The repercussions of this argument become clear when we see the liberties that Mannoni took with Ritchie's model, which argues that prolonged weaning is responsible for Africans' immaturity. Owing to a "long indulgence at the breast" (p. 27), says Ritchie, the African regards himself as faultless and perceives the outer world as responsible for his misfortune, an obvious way of thwarting - indeed, ridiculing - sociopolitical dissent. "He introjects all good from without," adds Ritchie, in a thesis Carothers would later endorse, "and projects all bad from within."83 When introducing Sachs's Black Hamlet , Rose adds an important historical dimension to this lamentable material. She offers a genealogy of the word projection , tracing its conceptual and clinical use from Freud's 1915 essay on "The Unconscious" to Ernest Jones's 1924 debate with Bronislaw Malinowski about the universality of the Oedipus Complex. From there, Rose follows the concept to Klein's account of projective identification in 1928; Géza Róheim's 1931 article on "Psycho-Analysis and Anthropology"; Sachs's and Ritchie's respective uses of the term projection in 1937 and 1943; and, finally, Mannoni's 1950 study, Prospero and Caliban}4 "Look again at the 82.

On what is the belief in the infantile nature of the primitive founded if not on a moment of projection?"85 Rose's point applies moreover to psychological-psychiatric arguments about alleged links between "inferiority" and "projection." For the latter, Ritchie assures us, is the imputation to the outer world of all badness and denial that there is any in oneself. Internally-determined danger and pain are repudiated, and all evil thoughts, intentions, impulses and activities are attributed to the outside world . . . The African tries to keep at a distance his sense of badness or inferiority - and he does succeed in keeping it out of consciousness most of the time ... He projects his own intolerably evil emotions and impulses and thus persuades himself that he is good again, (pp. 31-32) In this formulation, the African is the sole source of hostility - the European apparently devoid of aggression, acting as a neutral interpreter of African self-directed hatred. The extent of Mannoni's political intervention becomes clear when we watch him invert this argument, metaphorically substituting the term European for African. Imagine Gordon, Laubscher, Carothers, and Ritchie hearing the equivalent of "The European tries to keep at a distance his sense of badness or inferi- ority - and he does succeed in keeping it out of consciousness most of the time ..." ! This is not very distant from Mannoni's actual claims. In Prospero and related essays, roughly seven years later, Mannoni insisted that Europeans alone exhibit such neuroses. He ascribed the perception of "inferiority" to colonizers, deeming this a cause, rather than merely an effect, of colonial violence and discrimination. After bringing Europe into the picture, however, Mannoni also found his argu- ment wanting, agreeing to reprint Prospero unaltered in 1956 because its "obvious weaknesses" might shed light on a situation that "is now perhaps disappearing" (p. 6). Ten years later, in "The Decolonisation of Myself," he revised this claim once more, admitting that he "should undoubt- edly write a very different book now." He also anticipated Ngügl wa Thiong'o in "envisaging] . . . a study of the psychology of decolonisation" - "a difficult undertaking, but one of great intrinsic interest" (p. 327) - an undertaking, moreover, that Lacanian psychoanalysis helped make possible by its stress on individuals' complex relationship to their and others' self-strangeness.86 * * * * Still, Mannoni was not willing to discredit Prospero entirely. In "Decolonisation," he made it clear that his retention of earlier claims stemmed not from intellectual pique but rather from concern that the phenomena described in his book had disappeared neither from Europe nor from previ- ously colonized countries.

(pp. 328, 330). After stressing the profound hermeneutic importance of "many other points of view ... I even listed them - histor- ical, economic, political, etc.," he argued that materialist and crassly psychologistic approaches to racism just don't go far enough: "surely we should be deluding ourselves to imagine that the rooting out of every racist feeling (even if such a thing were possible in fact as well as merely in theory) would of itself bring with it the just and humane solution to racial problems?" (p. 330). As in his early essays, Mannoni focuses here on psychic elements that, resisting meaning and social transformation, nonetheless perpetuate racial violence. One wishes that Fanon had read this work more carefully and that postcolonial theorists would revisit this aspect of Mannoni's important and, alas, still timely argument. Instead of "deluding" himself with the fantasy of society's and his own complete transforma- tion, then, Mannoni returned to claims made more rigidly in Prospero , including his suggestion that an irrevocable self-strangeness determines our relationship - colonial or otherwise - to other people. While continuing to advance theories of racism "beyond the imaginary level" (qtd. in Lacan, Seminar II , p. 78), he also used the principle of "dislocation" to highlight forms of identification and fantasy that escape Sartre's crude "Manichean allegory" of self and Other. This accent on impersonal otherness is crucial to understanding racial enmity, for it not only rids colonial critique of all remaining vestiges of essentialism but also compels us to redefine what we take to be postcolonial reciprocity and relationality, which - inadvertently or perhaps even delib- erately - may replicate colonial hierarchies and fantasies. While refusing to equate the colonized with otherness, in other words, Mannoni's later arguments shatter the notion that Europeans are locked in the category of sameness and the colonized in a position of otherness. Yet by avoiding the poststructuralist and new historicist fallacy that the psychic is largely an effect of cultural-political forces, he exposes aspects of the colonial scene to which we are all unconsciously attached. Addi- tionally, Mannoni strengthens the need for - and the difficulty of attaining - a fuller realization of emancipation, as underscored by his epigraphic comment, "Dislocation can do the job of analy- sis [Le dépaysement fait office d'analyse ]."87 "Dislocation" makes clear, that is, where colonial and psychic structures prove unsustainable; it helps us "decathect" these attachments and indicates how we might live without them. The Martinican philosopher-poet René Ménil summed up the complexity of this transition in his recent fragment "Psychanalyse de l'histoire" when claiming eloquently that "the mystery of our impossible history lies not in the absurdity of the past but in the incoherence and inconsistency of our current social conscience."88 If our current beliefs are bound to an "impossible history," in the sense that it is traumatic and unrecoverable, then ignoring these beliefs almost guarantees that past atrocities will be repeated. We recall Mannoni's similar point about our failure to understand the past and each other, "as though the meeting between black and white . . . were a distillation of the difference between them - a difference devoid of any intrinsic meaning - which becomes the 87.

We hear the echo of Fanon here - "workfing] on the psychoanalytic level ... the level of the 'failures' [des ' ratés'Y {Black Skin , pp. 23; 20) - but without the accompanying promise of reparative triumph, the optimistic dream of "a white man and a black man hand in hand " (p. 222). Unlike Fanon's conception, "de-imaginarizing" colonial relations, according to Mannoni, entails relinquishing their hidden (although hardly secret) attractions. For Mannoni, then, what psycho- analysis gives colonial critique is neither certainty nor mandate or procedure, but, on the contrary, a politics built on the collapse of European and American hubris. Both culturally specific and politically astute, this argument surely puts to rest the fallacy that otherness is a simple abstraction of social relations and that Lacanians begin from the principle that they need "[n]ever historicize, never explain."89 Resolute about the difficulties facing Europe and Africa, while aware of "the pointlessness of any well-meaning sermonising" ("Decolonisation," p. 335), Mannoni continued to identify psychic elements that stymie progression, decolonization, and sense. He revisited a theory that, in failing to keep up with the times and in straying radically from theoretical orthodoxy, continues to make painfully clear how, in many parts of the world, "much of the old predicament survives in the new" (p. 327). 89.
