<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natig Rasul-zade. Risuiuptitsu. Moscow. Molodaia Gvardiia (VAAP, distr.). 1983. 240 pages, ill. 70 k. Natig Rasul-zade is a promising new Azerbaijani author, who writes prose in Russian. Born in Baku in 1949, he works in the editorial offices of "Literary Azerbaijan." Risuiu ptitsu (I Portray a Bird), his first book to be published by a central publishing house, contains a glowing introduction by Olga Kozhukhova praising the author as an "original, dis- tinctive writer, who sees the world and people at a visual angle that is peculiar only to him." Several stories in the collection justify this statement. The best is "Rain on a Holiday," in which the painfully reserved engineer Ibadov briefly escapes monotony to experience love. The hero's personality contains elements of both Gogol's Akaky Akakyevich and Dostoevsky's Underground Man. Committed to routine, Ibadov arranges the tables in his depressing room in the shape of a T, just as they are arranged at work. In a short-lived moment of rebellion over the loss of the woman who had awakened his love and given his life a temporary significance, he kicks over the table, destroying the stultifying T-formation. The artist Rustam, hero of "I Portray a Bird," makes no concessions at all to convention. Displaying antisocial be- havior, he spits gum and throws cigarettes into a newly painted pool and refuses to attempt marketing his work. He fails to reform in the usual Soviet tradition and finally aban- dons even love for the sake of art.</page><page sequence="2">RUSSIAN: FICTION 623 Although the selections mentioned above are outstanding, Rasul-zade's book also includes stories that are weak, such as "The Return," which contains loosely connected reminis- cences of childhood, and "About the Little Donkey," with its lachrymose anthropomorphism. "The Stranger" displays a tired, trite and morally reprehensible Soviet theme that stands in sharp contrast to those of the writer's better tales; here the author writes approvingly about a one-armed man entering a quiet village in 1944 to gun down his deserter brother. When Natig Rasul-zade deals with urban alienation and the portrayal of village life, he is a master of detail and psychological depiction. Although the stories in the volume are of mixed value, the author shows talent and promise. Bonnie Carey University of Montana</page></plain_text>
