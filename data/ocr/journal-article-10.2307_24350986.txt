Easily recognizable to anyone who picked up a comic book in the fifties and sixties, Charles Atlas is the bronzed god who promises to transform weak boys into strong men. His well-known ad cam paigns targeting insecure youths have come to epitomize the trivial commer cialism in comic ads and junk culture, enticing readers willing to gamble a stamp on his "free" book.1 Atlas is the lantern-bearer in trunks who can show you how to become a "new man." With a real-life physique that rivaled the muscle-bound superheroes throughout the comic books in which he appeared, Atlas has served as a symbol of male insecurity, an inspiration for bodybuilders and other muscle men, as well as a source of homoerotic fantasy (all perfectly woven together by Dr. Frank-N-Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show). But more than simply advertising his muscle-building regimen and selling fantasies, Charles Atlas's famous figure has become entwined with the cultural memory and experience of reading comics in general. His ads are metaphors of anxiety and metamorphosis, themes of both superhero comics as well as the lives of comic book readers; the figure of Atlas himself is a metonym for that reading experience. The transformation that Atlas advertised and still repre sents—from insecure child to confident hero, from vulnerable boy to physi cally imposing man, from unappealing wimp to desirable stud—is one that anthropologist Alan Klein has described, appropriately enough, as "comic book masculinity" (267). Masculine characters in comic books, Klein explains, "are so obviously exaggerated that they represent fiction twice over, as genre and as gender representation" (267). The Charles Atlas ads, in Klein's analy sis, appeal to the young men who—like Superman shedding his alter-ego of Clark Kent—want to transform themselves from Wimp to Warrior. In the model of Atlas, bodybuilders become the embodiment of this sensibility, devel Vol. 18, No. 2, Journal of the Fantastic In the Arts Copyright © 2007, International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts.</page><page sequence="2">A Half-Naked Muscleman in Trunks • 201 oping shells made of muscle to hide their insecurities behind an impressive physique. Of course, many insecure young men merely escaped into the fan tasy—and not the physique—of superheroes. Novels that capture the experi ence of young comic book readers, like Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay or Jonathan Lethem's The Fortress of Solitude, demonstrate the desire for escape or transformation that Atlas so successfully tapped into. The anxiety addressed in Atlas's ads already existed in the super hero comics themselves, and his audience was primed for his message. Superheroes have long been dismissed as male power fantasies, but Klein is actually more interested in the bodybuilders who try to live out that fantasy than he is in the comic books that inspire them. Though Klein's use of the modifier "comic book" indicates the cartoonish nature of this masculine iden tity, writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely make the term literal in their 1996 comic book Flex Mentallo. With an eponymous protagonist who is a parodized version of the character from the Atlas ads, Flex is at once a cri tique of hypermasculinity in superhero comics and an unabashed billet-doux to the playful and imaginative nature of the unsophisticated early comics in which those ads appeared. While Klein's analysis suggests how comic books have served as an inspiration for the bodybuilders who bought into the spirit (if not the actual product) of the Atlas ads, Flex Mentallo offers an analysis of the stereotypical fan who actually remained a 97-pound weakling. Morrison and Quitely's story suggests that all comic fans, both wimps and warriors, can relate to the Charles Atlas ads. Saturated with homoerotic subtext, transvestite characters, and displays of male heterosexual insecurity, Flex complicates and confuses coherent readings of gender and sexuality. As Will Brooker explained, working off theories put for ward by Judith Butler and Eve Sedgwick, Flex represents an already queered text, one that defies readings against the grain because the grain already goes both ways.2 But individual notions of gender and sexuality ultimately prove not to be the focus of Morrison and Quitely's meta-critique; rather, they provide a lens through which we can examine the generic identity issues of the comics indus try. Though legal conflicts with the owners of Atlas's trademark have severely restricted the circulation of Morrison and Quitely's book,3 enthusiastic critical attention has helped establish its cult status as an important, self-reflexive med itation on the meaning and value of superheroes in the culture at large. The character Flex Mentallo was first introduced into the DC universe by Morrison in 1991, appearing in the pages of Doom Patrol as "America's Merri est Crimefighter" (Morrison et. al. 46:3).4 Flex's persona is a clear throwback to what is commonly known as the Silver Age of comics—the wave of super hero comics from the 1950s and 1960s, when characters were often perceived as simple, happy, and moral figures who usually used their powers to stop trick sters, petty thieves, and bank robbers. Flex's origin story was almost exactly the JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="3">202 • Richard London same as Atlas's "Insult That Made a Man Out of 'Mac'" ad that appeared in countless issues of those early superhero comics. Despite this origin within the Atlas mythos, it was revealed in later Doom Patrol issues that Flex was actually a comic book character created by Wally Sage, an overtly geeky-looking man with large glasses, who, in his youth, had written his own hand-drawn comics only in the color green. Somehow, Wally's psychic powers pulled Flex out of his own comic book and into the "real" world of Doom Patrol. Possessing vague powers of "Muscle Mystery," Flex had the abil ity to read minds, see the future, or alter reality merely by flexing his body. Mov ing from his original hand-drawn comic "world" into the wider DC universe in which Wally was a character, the emergent Flex quickly found his former cre ator in need of saving. After Flex unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Wally from enigmatic villains, the dying Wally requests that Flex stop them from trying "to exterminate imagination and...strangeness..." by "building...death camps for our dreams" (Morrison et. al. 44:13, ellipses in original). Flex continued his defense of strangeness and imagination five years later in his own four-issue miniseries, again as a "fictional" character walking around in the "real" world. But the world within the Flex Mentallo miniseries diverges significantly from the pages of Doom Patrol. Wally Sage, for instance, is still the character who created Flex in the pages of his own hand-drawn comics from childhood, but he is no longer the geek with glasses who died in Flex's arms; he is now a depressed rock musician who decides to kill himself after a fight with his girlfriend. The comic bounces between two fragmented stories: Wally's reflections on "all those shitty, amazing comics" as he is wait ing to die (Morrison and Quitely 1:23) and Flex's search for superheroes who have gone missing from the earth at a mysterious time of impending destruc tion. These dual storylines finally intersect when Flex saves the world by sav ing Wally, who ultimately realizes how to reintroduce superheroes to the planet. But, weaving in and out of multiple parallel realities, Flex Mentallo is more centered on structure than it is on plot. Perhaps more interested in how to tell the story than in the story they have to tell, Morrison and Quitely cre ate a dense, four-issue meta-comic about the act of reading superhero stories itself. Flex could easily be described as what Geoff Klock calls the "comic book as literary critic" (153) because of how it reinterprets and revises established comic book tropes and traditions. As Corey Creekmur said of other revision ist comics that fit Klock's analysis, Flex Mentallo certainly does "interrogate the superhero narrative, often taking on the entire history of the form" (288).5 At the heart of this history is Charles Atlas. Faithfully reproducing the art and text from one of Atlas's best-known ads, Flex's initial origin story in the pages of Doom Patrol is a surrealistic recounting of "The Insult That Made a Man Out of 'Mac,'" where, in the background, the Grim Reaper paces up and down the beach, cruise liners sink dramatically at sea, a flock of pterodactyls JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="4">A Half-Naked Muscleman in Trunks • 203 roam the sky, and the persistence of a Daliesque clock obscures the temporal location of the flashback as it melts on the sand. Despite this phantasmagoric retelling, the story is immediately familiar: Mac's humiliation by the bully leads to his transformation into the muscleman now called Flex, who even appears throughout the rest of the story wearing only leopard skin briefs like those adorning Atlas in many of his ads and publicity photos. But Morrison's revi sion also dramatically diverges from the Atlas narrative: while the ad ended with Mac's girlfriend clinging to his side, declaring him a "real man after all," the character of Flex Mentallo responds by pushing the girl's face into the sand, saying "That's right. I am a real man and I don't need a tramp like you any more" (Morrison et. al. 42:10) .6 (See fig. 1.) THAT'S WIGHT. i AM a real MAM ANO I OOM'T ueeo a tmmp LIKE -iOU AMV MOKe'. OH, MAC'.

JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="5">204 • Richard London The Flex Mentallo mini-series often alludes back to this scene on the beach, though it is never reproduced. Onlookers comment on Flex's famous "build," just as the beachgoers did in Mac's ad; the words "Hero of the Beach," which appeared over Mac's head in the last panel of the ad, materialize over Flex's head as his "Hero Halo" whenever he attempts to use his powers; Flex even runs around in the same leopard print trunks. Besides referencing the content of those ads, the miniseries delves deep into the larger themes that Atlas introduced. Jason Craft helps explain what makes Morrison's parody so self-reflexive. In an online annotation meant to help readers sort through Mor rison and Quitely's dense and confusing comic, Craft suggested that, at its heart, Flex Mentallo was meant to illustrate: a) that superhero comic books are essentially product, debris, inseparable from their presence as stuff; they are consumed and then left as a constant reminder of "junk culture"; b) that superhero comic books are potentially transformative, that they engage in a multilayered system of representation and crossover that, in the end, implicates even the reader. Craft's analysis shows both the "shitty" and "amazing" side of the comics Wally Sage wants to talk about in the miniseries. Both of these themes point directly to Charles Atlas, whose advertisements about transformation are themselves reminders of junk culture. Miles Beller and Jerry Leibowitz used Atlas's famous "Hey Skinny!" slogan as the title of their book celebrating the hyperbolic sales pitches and cheap ads from early days of comics. Beller and Leibowitz suggest that these ads "were an essential part of the American experience, revealing more about the national character than the tony appeals in more respectable publications" (9). And, indeed, the fans writing to DC after Flex's initial appearance were clearly able to place Morrison's use of Atlas in the context of these memorably hyperbolic ads. One letter asked, "If Atlas's promise was fulfilled so easily for Flex Men tallo, were the rest of us missing out by having never ordered the X-Ray Specs advertised almost as frequently?" (Morrison et. al. 47:25). According to a for mer vice president of advertising for DC, these memorable ads were so intri cately linked to the experience of reading comics because, "whereas readers of magazines tend to skim the articles, the comic book reader pays close atten tion to everything, including the ads" (Beller and Leibowitz 12).7 The way advertisements often resembled the rest of a comic's content is unmistakably related to this level of acute attention—either as a cause or con sequence, but more than likely a little of both. Atlas may have even been the first advertiser to use comic strips in his ads, mimicking both the syntax and style of the comics themselves to underscore his sales pitch. In this way, the ads were part of the flow of the reading experience, not merely an interruption JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="6">A Half-Naked Muscleman in Trunks • 205 or distraction from it. The blurring of the line between comic and ad merely reinforces the reputation of comic books as "junk culture." Michael Chabon addresses this trashy reputation in The Amazing Adven tures of Kavalier and Clay, a novel that flirts with the real history of comic books through the eyes of fictional characters. Chabon celebrates both the "shitty" and "amazing" aspects that Morrison mentioned, arguing that comics are something to embrace because of—rather than in spite of—their lowly sta tus. The novel follows the lives of fictional comic creators Joe Kavalier and Sammy Clay, who fervently experience comics as both architects and con sumers of the medium. After a life of conflicted feelings about the value of comics, Kavalier comes to realize that they can be both junk culture and some thing more: Although all the world.. .viewed them as trash, Joe loved his comic books: for their inferior color separation, their poorly trimmed paper stock, their ads for air rifles and dance courses and acne creams, for the basement smell that clung to the older ones.... Most of all, he loved them for the pictures and sto ries they contained, the inspirations and lucubrations of five hundred aging boys dreaming as hard as they could for fifteen years, transfiguring their inse curities and delusions, their wishes and their doubts, their public educations and their sexual perversions, into something that only the most purblind of societies would have denied the status of art. (575) Chabon touches on both of Craft's points: that comics can be both "trash" and, at the same time, can transfigure insecurities into art. His novel plays heavily on the metaphor of escape: both Kavalier and the superhero he creates are escape artists by trade, but the escape that is valued at the end is the one that comic books provide to their readers. Of course, Chabon does not men tion Atlas or his ads, yet they remain the best known metonym for the explicit metaphors of insecurity and metamorphosis that saturate the novel. Clay describes the typical early comic fan as one who was a "little skinny guy like me...who believes there's life on Alpha Centauri and got the shit kicked out of him in school" (94). Clay never sought the muscles that would keep the bully away, though this was due more to personal failures than lack of desire. Comic books became his stand-in for bulging muscles; creating characters was his own escape, generated by "a longing—common enough among the inven tors of heroes—to be someone else; to be more than the result of two hundred regimens and scenarios and self-improvement campaigns that always ran afoul of his perennial inability to locate an actual self to be improved" (113). Clay may have remained the wimp, but he certainly had his own desire for the Warrior. His father, known as "The Mighty Molecule" or "The Genius of Physical Culture," was a muscleman on the vaudeville circuit, much like JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="7">206 • Richard London Charles Atlas was in the early days. In a critique that maps onto Klein's analy sis of bodybuilders, Clay explained that his father "was all muscle. No heart. He was like Superman without Clark Kent" (120). Because of this, Clay never sought out his father's physique for himself, though a visit to a Turkish bath house with the muscleman produced the first hints of homoerotic desire in Chabon's protagonist. Clay's embarrassed arousal in the presence of his naked father reminds us of Atlas's own beefcake status: he was an icon of either emu lation or adoration (or, sometimes, both). Though he is very much interested in the transformation that Atlas has come to represent, Chabon instead points to Harry Houdini as a symbol of metamorphosis. The Escapist, Kavalier and Clay's fictional superhero, is mod eled after Houdini. On the first page of the novel, Chabon explains that "Hou dini was a hero to little men" and represented for them a promise of transformation. Reminding comic fans that Houdini's first act was actually called "The Metamorphosis," Clay would suggest in hindsight that "Clark Kent in a phone booth and Houdini in a packing crate, they were one and the same thing.... You weren't the same person when you came out as when you went in" (4). In Chabon's treatment of superhero comics, the metaphors of anxiety and metamorphosis remain the same, but he looks for a different emblem in Houdini.8 This revision both reinforces the dual metaphors embod ied by Atlas and, perhaps, underscores his metonymic centrality. Unlike Houdini, Atlas expresses a relationship to superhero comics that is connected to both reasons identified by Craft: Atlas is transformative and trash, while Houdini represents more of the former than the latter. Chabon is not the first to highlight Houdini's role as a symbol of transformation. John Kasson has argued that Houdini, as well as the muscleman Eugen Sandow and the pulp hero Tarzan, "each appealed to the dream of the masculine metamor phosis, the possibilities for bodily transformation and, by implication, for a transformation of self and social standing" (223). All three actually preceded Charles Atlas in American popular culture; all three spoke directly to the mas culine anxieties of young men; all three celebrated the naked male body in a way that inspired as well as aroused their audience.9 What Atlas had that the other three didn't was his commercial stature. We know Atlas not because of a stage performance or an adventure story; rather, he is famous for his ads, for his promise, for his sales pitch. He is famous for his direct commercial appeal aimed explicitly at those anxious young men with comic books in their hands. Atlas was not just a product of mass culture; he was a piece of junk. Like Chabon, Jonathan Lethem understands how the comic ads were part of that experience of escape, but he manages to link them to Atlas explicitly. In his novel, The Fortress of Solitude, Lethem shows how those hyperbolic sales pitches lingered with the experience of reading about, and the fantasy of becoming, superheroes. For Lethem's protagonist, Dylan Ebdus—a young man JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="8">A Half-Naked Musclemari in Trunks • 207 who is bullied not by some tough guy on the beach but by the very city around him—comic books were a necessary escape. Comic books were Dylan's own Fortress of Solitude, like Superman's secret retreat hidden from the rest of the world. Comics may have been junk, but the superhero stories within transfixed Dylan to the point that his surroundings receded from his mind until all of their content had been consumed. Dylan would sit on the stoop of an apartment, just paging through, shoulders hunched to protect the flimsy covers from the wind, puzzling out the last dram, the last square inch of information, the credits, the letters page, the copyright, the Sea-Monkeys ads, the insult that made a man out of Mac. Then, just when you thought you were alone, Dean Street came back to life. (66, italics in original) For Lethem, comics are both junk and transportive, just as for Chabon they are both trash and transfiguring. And by locating Atlas in "the last square inch of information," Lethem positions the advertising icon as either a coda or addendum to the reading experience.10 Atlas was, of course, both: a conclu sion of, as well as a supplement to, the stories in the comics. As Craft's analy sis points out, this is what makes Atlas the perfect metonym for Morrison and Quitely. Flex Mentallo plays both with Atlas's promise of literal transformation and, at another level, his metaphoric potential for transformation. Flex's cri tique of the hypermasuline metamorphosis in Atlas's ad is not an end in itself, but instead is a self-reflexive examination of superhero comics; it underscores Morrison's plea that comic readers remember the transformative experience comic books present. The metamorphosis at the heart of Flex Mentallo is a voluntary one, rooted in Morrison's desire for readers to take comics less seriously and to enjoy the strange, magically imaginative experience associated with earlier Silver Age comics. Flex contains a multiplicity of transformative roles—transforming from a 97-pound weakling into a bulky muscleman, from bumbling alter-ego to dashing superhero, from passive reader to active participant—all of which point back to Atlas. This meaningful association of Atlas with the comic book industry was not lost on the readers of Doom Patrol. As one fan noted in the letters page, the entire story of Flex Mentallo was: a critique of hypermasculine representation, of the muscular male body as site of power and control.... Grant [Morrison] knows how caught up current comics and their mostly male readers are in this system with the current ultra-muscular fetishization of the male torso.... (Morrison et. al. 47:25-26) As this fan suggests, the muscular fetishization of power and control was the status quo in superhero comics when Morrison first created Flex, even JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="9">208 • Richard Landon more so than in the heyday of Atlas's ads. While Flex is himself a reminder of the Silver Age of comics, he is also a direct response to what Morrison and others have called the Dark Age of the 1980s and early 1990s. What is now known as the Dark Age "was typified by implausible, steroid-inspired physiques, outsized weapons...generous bloodletting and vigilante justice" (Voger 6).11 Most of these characterizations, though, were exaggerated cliches inspired by the two dark but genuinely revolutionary works of the 1980s, Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, which sought to give "real world" rationalizations of superheroes as twisted fascists who were more sadistic than philanthropic. Of course, with success comes imitation, and soon the suppos edly "realistic" psychological portraits offered in both works became exagger ated beyond recognition. Only three years after the release of the two dark classics, Morrison whined in the pages of another comic, Animal Man, "point less violence and death is 'realistic.' Comic books are realistic now" (Morrison and Truog 218). We might even say that the Dark Age resembled a time when most super heroes had bought into the Warrior fantasy Charles Atlas represents, trans forming from wimps into "hypermuscular men [who] are tough, super-strong, stoic in the face of pain, unemotional, and aggressive" (Klein 267). Echoing Klein's comparison of superheroes and bodybuilders, Scott Bukatman suggests that the appearance and behavior of many Dark Age superheroes brings to mind the notion of "roid rage" (60—61). Looking at Image Comics, a creator owned company founded in 1992, Bukatman observed that they "specialize in even more intensely exaggerated visualizations of the (barely) human body; there is a powerful hysteria working beneath the surface of muscles, cleavage, masks, and laser beams" (50). Formed by many of the highest-profile artists of the Dark Age, Image was initially criticized for the emphasis of art over story in its earliest titles. Filled with intricately drawn fight scenes and preposter ously formed heroes, but rarely an intelligible plot, Image Comics began the decade much like the bodybuilders Klein describes: appropriately named, it was all image and no substance. This privileging of appearance is embedded in comic book masculinity. Klein notes that there is a distinction among bodybuilders "between the notion of fear of being weak and fear of seeming weak," which proves that they have secured "only the trappings (form) of the hegemonic masculine ideal...rather than the essence" (273, emphasis in original). This distinction can be traced back to Charles Atlas. In the case of bodybuilding, those who enter the sport out of masculine insecurity do not do so to develop the strength to beat up the bully, like Mac did in the Atlas ads, but rather to develop the muscles that scare off the bully (one of Atlas's mottos was "nobody picks on a strong man"). The purpose of bodybuilding is not to have a body that will help you win a fight; it is to have a body that helps you avoid the fight. JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="10">A Half-Naked Muscleman in Trunks • 209 Because of this, bodybuilding often "fails to convince completely both those who do it, and those who are supposed to be impressed by it. It fails because it is structurally incomplete, lacking a functional component so critical to conven tional masculinity" (Klein 274). In this regard, as made obvious by his name, Flex Mentallo is the perfect bodybuilding superhero. His superpower isn't deter mined by what his body can do, but is determined by what his body looks like it can do; his powers of "Muscle Mystery" are activated merely by flexing at a vil lain, precisely in the same way that Atlas's system of Dynamic Tension helped build muscle mass by flexing the body rather than by lifting weights. But the misogynistic turn in Flex's story is what truly resembles the hyper masculine insecurity of the Atlas ads. As is made clear in the original "Mac" ad, emasculation is a gender-inclusive problem: it is caused by male bullies, not female scorn. For a man afraid of seeming "feminine," masculinity can only be nolo ~*niMAner+d into view. Figure 2. The hero flexes at the bomb, demonstrating that his powers are based not on what his body can do, but what it looks like it can do.

JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="11">210 • Richard London attained by distancing himself from women. This is why Atlas's ads define mas culinity only in comparison to or in competition with other men.12 The irony is that this fear of emasculation (Mac getting beat up by the bully) cannot be abated by female admiration or desire (Mac's girlfriend exclaiming that he is a "real man" after all). Klein explains that it is only through homosocial accept ance of others who embrace this masculine ideal that those who are insecure about their "soft," "feminine," or "wimpy" side can feel at ease. This is why the hypermasculine ideal often ends up so violently misogynistic (Flex pushing his girlfriend away, not needing a "tramp" to tell him he is a man). (See fig. 2.) This emphasis on homosocial bonding and the development of the male physique is what causes many to view the sexual implications of bodybuilding with suspicion. The insecurity and fear of emasculation is what fuels the desire to appear hypermasculine, which, in turn, attracts homoerotic attention that fuels more insecurity.13 The hypermasculinity of these Atlas ads is linked to the post-war gay pin-up maga zines that Thomas Waugh described as being thinly veiled with alibis of "fitness" or "physiculturist" interest. Morrison, eager to highlight this point, positions Flex Men tality in a role self-consciously similar to these early muscle magazines by evoking Fred eric Wertham's infamous homosexual readings of superhero stories. Speaking through Wally Sage, Morri son suggests that the themes in the comic books from the same era as those muscle magazines were simple to dis cern: "musclemen in cos tumes, idealized masculine figures. The Charles Atlas hard body. Homoerotic wish fulfillment" (Morrison and Quitely 2:16). (See fig. 3.) Figure 3. Flex is presented as a beefcake idol, evoking the homoerotic wish fulfillment of "physiculturist" magazines and complicating his reception as a seemingly innocent hero. From Flex Mentallo #1, June 1996, page 25. Copyright © by DC Comics, Inc. JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="12">A Half-Naked Muscleman In Trunks -211 Later in the comic, Morrison grounds this connection through yet a third origin story for Flex, in a faux editorial suggesting the character had a publish ing history dating back to the Second World War. But as Will Brooker points out, Morrison uses this false publishing history to tease with both gay and straight receptions of the hero. Not only does this editorial suggest that Flex was admired by the "small circle of enthusiasts" of "tales of Greek love" in the not-so-subtly titled Rassliri Men comic published by the even less-subtly named "Manly Comics" company, but he was also embraced by "children and [by] servicemen, who failed to discern the obvious subtext" (Morrison and Quitely 2:20). Flex, as Brooker explains, "may have had an alter ego as a beef cake idol for gay adults, but he was also seen as a mythical hero for children who remained innocent of the editorial intention" (10). One of the effects of the intentional ambiguity of Flex's sexual representa tion is that it complicates the nostalgia for a time when comics were more "pure" or "innocent." Like the surreal images seen on the beach in the origi nal parody of the Atlas ads (Grim Reaper, sinking ship, pterodactyls), where "the 1950s beach, even in Flex's nostalgic memories, offers only an illusion of innocence" (Brooker 8), his sexual ambiguity reminds us that earlier comic book heroes were "innocent" only when we choose to remember them that way. Even when there are adult subtexts running through the comics (explicit or implicit), children still find innocent or inspirational readings of the comics. In the miniseries, looking through his own hand-drawn pages of Flex Mentallo from his childhood, Wally insists, "when you're a kid you just do it. You don't even think about it. It's pure. It's totally pure" (Morrison and Quitely 1:9). This desire to return to the "purity" that comics had when they were intended for children instead of adults marks much of Morrison's work. But, ultimately, what Morrison seems to want is not a comic that is written for chil dren instead of adults, but rather, comics that allow for a childlike embrace, whether the reader is young or old. He wants to return the sense of wonder to comics—a staple of science fiction but also familiar in "the spirit of a forward looking Utopian America" that embodied the superhero stories of the Silver Age (Salisbury 217). He has suggested a need to return to a "veritable Mardi Gras of colorful costumes, bizarre powers and breathtakingly imaginative adventures" and to transform the "dour 'realism'" of the Dark Age of comics into "something strange and magical," like that once standard in comics (Mor rison 1996: 6, 8). Like the escape celebrated by Chabon and Lethem, this is the ultimate metamorphosis that Morrison offers his readers: a chance to lit erally believe those weird, magical, and fantastic superheroes back into exis tence. This is what Wally does at the end of Flex, and it is how he saves his doomed world. The reader is implicated as an active agent in this belief when Morrison reveals that "you have been inhabiting the first ultra-post-futuristic comic: characters are allowed full synchrointeraction with readers at this JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="13">212 • Richard London level" (Morrison and Quitely 4:22). Morrison is, in a sense, asking the reader to join Flex in defense of strangeness and imagination. Morrison's strategy is made clear during the confrontation between Flex and his creator. When Flex encounters a bitter and disillusioned teenaged Wally at the end of the comic, Wally begins to criticize the "pathetic fucking power fantasies for lonely wankers who've had so much sand kicked in their faces they look like the opening credits of Lawrence of Arabia" (4:17). He turns his hostility towards the ridiculous-looking Flex and demands, "Look at you! A half-naked muscleman in trunks. What's that supposed to signify? What are you? Do you know what you are?" (4:18). "Sure." Flex replies. "I'm a super hero. Being clever's a fine thing, but sometimes a boy just needs to get out of the house and meet some girls" (4:18). As Jason Craft explains, "Flex absorbs the obvious critique he provokes and moves his 'readers' beyond it; he repre sents Morrison's argument for a space beyond critique." What Morrison wants is a renewed role for comics that don't have to be taken so seriously, and Flex offers the transformative decision to the readers. Looking outward from the comic while exceeding the frame of the next panel, Flex extends his hand to the reader as if he were escaping yet another comic book world into our own. Breaking through the fourth wall, Flex addresses Wally while also speaking directly to the reader. "Gamble a stamp," he says, once again alluding to the Atlas ad. "I can show you how to be a real man" (4:18). (See fig. 4.) This transformation Morrison offers through Flex is not the hypermascu line one offered by Atlas. Klein argued that Atlas's transformation was ulti mately fractured, inspiring a misogynistic, gender-inclusive need for approval, which Flex's girlfriend-beating twist on the ad was meant to criticize.

For Morrison, the geeky and emasculated boy who reads comics is an anthropomorphic representation of the industry as a whole. But, whereas Atlas offered superficial muscles as an answer to ostracization, Morrison offers cre ativity and confidence as a better solution. Stating this metaphor explicitly in a 1999 interview, Morrison said: Comics have got so shy and embarrassed about themselves, they've reached adolescence after being in childhood for so long and are now stuck with specs taped up with elastoplast. What they have to do is get a girlfriend, get out and start being cool. The guys who run the industry now are frightened to go out, face the world and say we are sexy, and the stuff we are doing is fun and read able. (qtd. in Salisbury 218) Fun and readable is what Morrison wants superhero comics to be. This is what Flex Mentallo—the half-naked muscleman in trunks—signifies. And, for Morrison, it is what Charles Atlas—the half-naked muscleman in trunks from the age of exaggerated, "low" culture advertisements—signifies as well. After years of "serious" superhero comics, Morrison, by his own account, "expanded the parameters enough so that stuff that seemed stupid is starting to look inter esting" (Salisbury 224). More than exploiting a well-known trademark, Mor rison attempted to reshape the field of superhero comics by tapping into the cultural memory of its past. Notes 1 This was quite evident in The Who s 1967 rock album, The Who Sell Out, a cri tique of crash commercialism that, amidst assorted advertisements for anything from fast foods to acne remedies, promises that "the Charles Atlas method with Dynamic Tension can turn you into a beast of a man" ("I Can See for Miles"). 2 Brooker, following Judith Roof, also points out that the comic's fractured narra tive and multiple origin stories are themselves examples of a queered text. 3 Charles Atlas, Ltd. brought a trademark infringement action against DC Comics in 2000, alleging that the character of Flex Mentallo tarnished and diluted Charles Atlas's advertising campaign. DC eventually won the suit on First Amendment grounds, but the company has chosen not to reprint the miniseries. Flex's origin in Doom Patrol, though, has recently been republished in trade paperback format. 4 For comic book citation, 46:3 indicates issue 46: page 3. 5 A reviewer from the online community at Barbelith.com described Flex as the Cit izen Kane of comics. It is "a comic about the love for comics—the only way Flex could be told is through the medium it celebrates, much like Orson Welles's masterpiece."

Charles Atlas, Ltd. contended that the "sexist and vulgar portrayal of the character" sullied Charles Atlas's good reputation and tarnished the value of his trademark. The final ruling of the court, though, suggested that this dark, misogynistic, and very un-Atlas-like move only served to anchor the work's parodic value, protected by the First Amendment (Charles Atlas, Ltd., 337-39). 7 Writing for the occasionally pretentious and often elitist Comics Journal, Darren Hick went so far as to suggest that these ads were more memorable than the comics themselves. Hick described the famous Atlas ad as "Inconsequential Art," playing off of Will Eisner's often repeated definition of comic books as Sequential Art. 8 Later in the novel, Chabon further emphasized Houdini's metaphorical relation ship to superheroes in a footnote that argued, "the still-fresh memory of Harry Hou dini in the American mind thirteen years after his death.. .is a neglected source of the superhero idea in general" (120). 9 Echoing Chabon's argument for Houdini as a neglected inspiration for super heroes, Gerard Jones suggested that Tarzan also influenced the first superheroes, espe cially because of his own precursory comic strips. Jones explains that the naked Tarzan "embraced more than sex; he embraced all the wishes a boy holds about his body, his identity, and his future.... When a powerless boy yearns to be a man but cannot under stand how he will ever get there, a symbol like Tarzan can come to him as a revela tion" (78). 10 This was often literally the case, as Atlas's full-page ads would often appear on the back cover of the comics. 11 This was especially noticeable in Marvel Comics. Throughout the early 1990s, the company began to emphasize its most violent vigilante superheroes like Wolverine and Punisher while introducing others, like X-men's Cable. Cable was a poster child for Voger's description of the Dark Age: he was a ruthless and violent cyborg who com bined a "steroid-inspired physique" with implausibly large guns. 12 Such homosocial competition was common in the superhero comics of the Sil ver Age, where heroes like Superman and Batman would compete with each other for the attention of female characters, even though notions of marriage and domesticity were often more threatening than the villains. As Mark Best explained, "the bond of rivalry over the female lover is not only stronger than either man's desire for the woman, but that rivalry is also performed solely to preserve the homosociality signified by the rivalry" (88). 13 Klein points to the practice of hustling, "the selling of sex or sexuality by body builders to gay men," as being central to the cycle of insecurity and compensation (155).

Abstract Easily recognizable to anyone who picked up a comic book in the fifties and sixties, Charles Atlas's ad campaigns targeting insecure, 97-pound weaklings with promises of masculine transformation have come to epitomize the trivial commercialism in comic ads and junk culture. But more than simply advertising his muscle-building regimen, Charles Atlas's famous figure has become entwined with the cultural memory and experience of reading comics in general. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the DC comic book, Flex Mentallo, created in 1996 by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. Tying together the literal and metonymic themes from Atlas's ads with the trope of insecure adolescent comic fans, Morrison and Quitely's story celebrates both the trashy and transformative nature of comic books. With an eponymous protagonist who is a parodied version of the character from the Atlas ads, Flex Mentallo is at once a cri tique of hypermasculinity in superhero comics, as well as an unashamed billet-doux to the playful and imaginative nature of unsophisticated early comic books.
