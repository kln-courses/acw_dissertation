Tn one sense his great subject was himself. He was the conduit of a parti- cular misery'. Morley Roberts's assessment has been a common one and much Gissing criticism over the years has focused more on the man than the novelist. Too often Gissing has been treated as a romancier maudit cursed by marriage rather than drink, and the novels have been raided for possible autobiographical material to pad out the disappointingly sparse, reticent or censored personal writings. Lack of readily available texts and hard facts have encouraged the persistence of a Gissing myth at the expense of the novels themselves. Though Adrian Poole does not claim too much for his subject, he does consider that Gissing occupies a 'peculiarly central position' in late- Victorian culture. It would seem that Gissing' s misery was far from particular to himself; instead his novels articulate certain tensions crucial to an under- standing of the period. The book is divided into an introduction and three main sections: 'The Early Social Novels', 'The Writer and Society' and 'Desire, Autonomy and Women'. This last deals with the myth of the country house as bastion of culture, Gissing' s interest in female emancipation and its implications for modern marriage, and is mainly concerned with the middle-class novels of the 1890s. In the earlier sections, whole chapters are devoted to The Nether World and New Grub Street respectively. The approach is largely chronological, the groupings traditional, and no major revaluation of any novel is attempted. The stress is on Gissing as case-history, and he is used as a tool to expose some more general differences between mid and late -Victorian imaginative patterns as well as being set against more illustrious contempories like Hardy and Conrad to illustrate shared features. Though the later comparisons are of interest, Adrian Poole is most illuminating in the broader context. In parti- cular, his many comparisons of Gissing with Dickens are very suggestive. For example, discussing them as urban novelists at differing stages of London's development, Dickens's active assault on bricks and mortar is contrasted with Gissing' s impassive slums where 'metaphor in fact ceases to exist'. Thus his particular great moments like the description of the new Model buildings in The Nether World are seen to be heroic endeavours to smash through the in- tractable masonry that offers no 'Dickensian anthropomorphic encouragement' to the suffering human reality inside. Throughout this book, chapters on the historical background are inter- spersed with fictional criticism. The growth of urban consciousness is well- documented and we get a crisp survey of the new literary market in the 1890s showing the exhilarating possibilities that Gissing chose to ignore. However, it is the last section that has most to offer the Gissing enthusiast. Here we</page><page sequence="2">168 Urban History Yearbook 1978 get a fresh and original look at the later novels that takes up the theme of dis- location of the Individual and Society, Self and Other, that had been satisfac- torily fused in the progressive linear pattern of the Victorian novel. With such a frame of reference already set up in his thoughtful introduction, Dr Poole is well equipped to analyse the tension in Gissing between desire for inner freedom and outward conformity as dramatized in the predicaments of his later heroes and heroines; especially in the pressures of courtship and marriage, where the protagonists are endeavouring to reject old definitions yet find themselves unable to create new ones. Thus the 'grim energy1 of Gissing' s best work is seen as exposing a falsifying dream of autonomy; but he finally succumbed to his fantasy in The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft. Adrian Poole has given us a coherent reading of the major novels and an account of Gissing' s development that is stimulating without any pretence to being exhaustive. The scarcity of Gissing texts is being rapidly remedied by the Harvester Press with immaculate facsimile editions of early texts replete with introduc- tions and full scholarly apparatus. Demos, A Story of English Socialism (1886) was the subject of an important controversy between John Goode and Alan Lelchuk in Victorian Studies, 1968-9, and Dr Poole clearly sides with Goode, calling it 'Gissing' s most exasperating novel' because it is based on a faulty social thesis. In his impeccable introduction to the Harvester edition, Pierre Coustillas contents himself with facts, both of the details of the novel's recep- tion and the historical background. Mildly but firmly he rebukes those critics 'with heavy ideological basis' who condemn the book for not faithfully repro- ducing historical actualities and insists on its value as a document of working- class life of the times. A more recent addition to the series is In the Year of Jubilee (1894), a panoramic London novel exposing the evils of middle-class pretension and commercial vulgarity. Poole is discriminatingly critical in his brief treatment, praising the broader social analysis but feeling the novel is weakened by the characterization of the hero and heroine. Gillian Tindall's introduction is more general and vigorously enthusiastic. She notes the auto- biographical features of the novel and Gissing' s extraordinary gift for creating self-fulfilling prophesies in his fiction. She stresses the connection between jerry-built Camberwell and its inhabitants with their spurious 'accomplish- ments', but similarly declares the novel marred by the excessive wish- fulfillment of its conclusion. As both editors are in agreement as to the documentary richness of Gissing' s work, it should be a welcome relief to historians of the period and literary specialists alike that these novels are back in print.
