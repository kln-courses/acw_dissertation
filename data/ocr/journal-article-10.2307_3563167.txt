<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 Animals, Science, and Ethics edited by Strachan Donnelley and Kathleen Nolan Preface This is a report from The Hastings Center project, "The Ethics of Animal Experimentation and Research." As project members, we wanted to take afresh look at the complex ethical issues that arise in the scientific use of animals in a non- adversarial and non-ideological forum. We were convinced that these issues required a genuinely interdisciplinary approach. This meant including labora- tory and field scientific researchers; veterinarians; philosophers, lawyers, and scientists particularly interested in animal welfare issues; and physicians and philosophers with long-standing bioethi- cal interests but who previously had not confronted the ethics of the human use of animals. This Special Supplement to the Hastings Center Report is the outcome of two years of deliberation. The Hastings Center and the project members want to express their deep gratitude to an anonymous donor and the Marilyn M. Simpson Charitable Trust for supporting "The Ethics of Animal Experimentation and Research" and this Special Supplement. We would also like to thank those who made special presen- tations at our project meetings: Carol Ristau, Herb Terrace, Emil Menzil, John Sarno, Warren Heston, Raymond Frey, and Mary Midgley.

The Troubled Middle In Medias Res T he present public debate over using animals for human purposes shows no signs of abating. If anything, whether the issue is the use of animals in science, the wearing of furs, hunting and fishing for sport, or eating animals raised on modem "factory" farms, ethical contention is becoming more acrimonious. The protagonists in the controversy are characteristically ungenerous, accusing each other either of being blind to animal suffering and concerned only with self-regarding human interests, or of promoting radical and illegitimate political agendas based on inappropriate notions of equality, with a gross insensitivity to genuine human needs and the particular goodness of human life. Whatever the validity of these counter-charges, we are seemingly in a period of profound flux in our philosophical understanding of our- selves and our ethical relation to the natural, animate world. Perhaps this results from our finally taking seriously the full implications of Darwinian evolutionary theory and ecological science. Perhaps we are also feeling the impending threats to the viability and integrity of the biosphere from modem technolog- ical civilization and an ever- expanding world population. We are in any case being forced to confront ethical and practical issues that previously we have been able to avoid and for which we are philosophically ill prepared. The lack of a ready-to- hand and adequate understanding of our role in, and responsibilities to the natural and animate world seems importantly behind the distemper that marks the "animal controversy." We moderns do not like to swallow old Socratic wisdom, that is, to know that over such crucial matters we do not know. It stings our twentieth century pride and reminds us of our practical and theoretical finitude. Challenged by this contemporary situation, The Hastings Center has taken up the ethical issue of the use of animals in science. Our research had an important initial bias: We purposefully excluded those from the more polarized ideological camps of the controversy, who might inhibit a genuine exploration of the ethical and philosophic issues. Thus we laid ourselves open to the charge of, and at times charged ourselves with, lacking the vigorous representation of both the animal liberationist/rightist and scientific progressivist/human welfarist communities. In truth, we saw ourselves as "troubled middlers," variously in between these two extremes, wanting to serve judiciously both human and animal interests (which often directly conflict with each other) and to respond to the many ethical responsibilities that have a claim on us. This genuinely was and is our moral conviction. Moreover, despite the fullblown and often overblown rhetoric of the debate over use of animals, we think this is where most people, researchers and the public alike, find themselves. Most people want "to do right" by both humans and animals. Taking the middle position had decisive consequences for the project, essentially coloring its proceedings and results. We ourselves quickly discovered that we did not have final and adequate answers. We all had deeply felt moral convictions and favorite clues to the moral landscape. None felt totally in the dark. More- over, we genuinely wanted to learn from the various ethical arguments for and against the use of animals in science. But we were wary of "grand simplifiers," and no one philosophic theory or perspective seemed fully adequate to the prob- lems at hand. The moral picture was out of focus. Thus at its best the project involved real exploration and modifications of ethical views. We discussed various practical issues, for example, the different uses of animals in experimentation, field research, testing, and education; the use of pound versus purpose-bred animals; the creation of transgenic animals; and the difficulties surrounding the ethical review of scientific protocols and the care of laboratory animals. But behind these discussions loomed large and insistent questions. What is the particular goodness or value of human life and science that justifies the sacrifice of animals and the infliction of animal suffering and harm? What precisely is it about organic life and animal individuals that elicits our moral concern and bothers us about unreflectively using animals as instruments for our own human purposes? What ethical per- spectives and conceptions best cap- ture all things that need to be considered, helping us to decide practical ethical problems? We directly explored these questions, but they continued to haunt us. They kept and still keep us in medias res. To grasp the seriousness of the issue, consider that a 1986 OTA study found that in America alone, roughly 17 to 22 million animals (that is, vertebrates) are used annually in research, testing, and education. Three-quarters of these-some 12 to 15 million-are rats and mice, while birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles comprise an additional 3 million. The most closely monitored figures are for use of guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits (approximately 500,000 each), dogs (some 180,000), cats (about 50,000), and nonhuman primates (about 60,000). No reliable estimates are available of the proportion of animals used in laboratory research, drug development, and toxicity test- ing, though less than 1 percent of the animals are used for educational purposes.28 These numbers, however staggering, pale by comparison with the more than 5 billion animals killed each year in food production, of which some 90 percent are chickens and turkeys. 2</page><page sequence="3">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 Over the last decade, there has been mounting international and national concern about animal wel- fare within the scientific community, evidenced by the creation or revision of ethical guidelines for research. The latter include International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.'047 Since 1985, institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) have been mandated by U.S. federal law and public policy for most federally funded and monitored scientific uses of animals. A central charge is to oversee the care of laboratory ani- mals and to review scientific protocols for attention to animal welfare, specifically the legitimate use of animals (including appropriate numbers and species) and the min- imization of animal suffering, as commensurate with scientific goals. Three important theoretical issues emerged from an initial look at IACUCs. First, there is no general consensus, either in committees or among the general public, about the moral status of animals. Do animals have no moral status, a status equal to our own, or a status somewhere in between this all-or-nothing? And on what criteria is this moral status, or lack of status, based? Second, LACUCs lack a clearly formulated ethical theory or procedure to judge the particular scientific uses of animals. They operate by the prag- matic "seat of their pants" or with an uncoordinated assemblage of notions, such as individual interests, suffering, or rights, human steward- ship, or kinship with animals, bor- rowed from traditional ethical theo- ries. Finally, the nature, recognition, and moral significance of animal suffering are unresolved bones of contention, a controversy among scientists and ethicists alike. Yet "animal suffering" is a primary concern of IACUCs in their man- dated oversight of the use and care of animals in science. These unresolved master questions are addressed in the first three sections of our report. We have aimed at facing the issues squarely and carrying the discussion forward, without attempting to foreclose ongo- ing exploration. Though this defeats the desire for quick final answers, it offers the possibility of genuine progress in confronting still open- ended questions: "All-or-nothing" does not seem the characteristic mark of human affairs. Thus Section I discusses the moral status of animals as conceived from several theoretical and ethical perspectives. Though any one perspective might not be finally adequate, the juxtaposition of several ethical positions widens and deepens our understanding of the moral status of animals and of the responsibilities this complex status engenders. Similarly Section II, addressing the ethical justification of the uses of animals in science, does not offer "decisive" arguments for or against particular uses. Rather, conflicting values, goods, and responsibilities pertaining to both humans and animals are identified. Particular uses of animals demand the careful consideration of various ethical claims, which will always require the developed art and wisdom of ethical judgment and will never be reduced to a systematic science. Competing ultimate goods or values and the concrete complexity of the real world defy such rational, abstract, or logical harmony. Section III discusses the problem of animal suffering and its recogni- tion by "critical anthropomorphism," a serious and thoughtful attempt to bridge the gap between the under- standing of human and animal life. This is a method that involves critically using our human experience to recognize and alleviate animal suffering by checking our immediate intuitions about an animal's subjec- tive life against what we can learn from more objective scientific studies. Yet the necessarily imperfect or imprecise nature of any method to get "inside" the animal and to grasp what it subjectively feels accounts for the ongoing difficulties and contro- versies over the definition of animal suffering. Just how far should we adhere to an objective, "outside" or subjective, "inside" approach? Beyond the need for understanding the suffering of individual laboratory animals, Section III also discusses the particular ethological and ecological sensitivity required for animal research in the wild. The theoretical difficulties sur- rounding the moral status of animals, the ethical judgment of protocols, and the recognition of animal suffering are mirrored in actual practice, the focus of Sections IV and V. Section IV takes a close practical look at Animal Care and Use Committees, their history, mandates, and the impediments they still experience in trying to promote animal welfare and an ethical scientific use of animals. Section V examines the inadequacy of federal guidelines, regulations, and public policy in distinguishing between the uses of animals in experimental research, testing, and education, and recommends policy reforms for each realm. In this Supplement we have tried to identify the crucial issues that need to be addressed by researchers, educators, members of IACUCs, and the concerned public. As project members we have championed the "troubled middle" position and recognize there is much work still to be done. This should not be misin- terpreted. We are not advocating ethical flabbiness or failure of nerve. As a research group we were, in fact, one on many issues, including the conviction that any scientific use that causes animals harm is decidedly an ethical issue that requires its own properjustification. We agree that the greater the animal harm envisaged, the stricter and more compelling the ethical justification must be, and that a principle of proportionality- inflicting the least harm for the particular good sought-ought always to hold. There is, however, much territory between the extremes for middlers to stake out claims. As would be expected, some are more ethically moved by the human and scientific good, others by animal suffering, well- being, and integrity. This difference surfaced over animal uses and exper- iments that carry a heavy ethical cost in extreme animal suffering or irreversible threats to the vital integ- rity of animal individuals or commu- nities. For some, such uses of animals are prohibited a priori, irrespective of human need or gain. For others, there should be no predecided prohibitions. Each case should be judged individually on its own merits, 3</page><page sequence="4">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 taking into account both human and animal concerns, with serious attempts to reduce significantly the harm done to the animals. In any case, these are the most ethically agonizing uses, requiring the most compelling justifications, practical (e.g. the relief of a great human harm) or theoretical. In actual practice, there might be little difference between these two ethical positions. On one point we were in unam- biguous agreement. This was the dismay over the current, sometimes violent contention and level of public debate that surrounds the use of animals in science. Not only is there barbarism and intransigent, ill-suited ethical dogmatism. More importantly there is a blindness to subtle issues that we are only beginning to recog- nize and that urgently need explo- ration, such as the intimate and concrete interrelations of individuals, communities, and ecosystems that involve humans, animals, and other forms of organic being alike. We desperately need to think systemat- ically about our ethical responsibil- ities to these various interconnected forms and kinds of organic, biological life. But this is impossible if we short- sightedly pit humans against animals against the environment. Such ethical provincialism is a curse we no longer can afford. -Strachan Donnelley Section L Ethical Theory and the Moral Status of Animals MImbers of an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) spend much of their time inspecting laboratories and care facilities, and studying regulations. Yet one of their most important duties is to grapple with ethical problems: whether specific experiments involving animals are morally justifiable and whether they should be permitted. Yet this is often also the duty with which IACUC members feel most uncomfortable. Understandably, perplexed deci- sionmakers might turn at this point to moral philosophy for some guid- ance. They will be sadly disappointed if they hope to find an adequate and generally accepted moral theory that will generate unassailable, defensible solutions. For every ethical theory advanced in philosophic discussion, several oppose it, and consensus among moral philosophers is not to be found. Nevertheless, moral philos- ophy can still make an important contribution to the debate about the moral status of animals and their use in biomedical research by analyzing relevant intuitions and arguments. Our intuitions, specific decisions, and even feelings of conflict are implicitly shaped by and reflected in the ethical theories that historically have engaged the attention of moral philosophers. We can better under- stand and evaluate those intuitions and decisions if we understand more clearly the theoretical commitments that underlie them. Even our dis- agreements about specific issues often implicitly reflect deeper con- flicts between moral theories. Under- standing the nature of these conflicts is a necessary first step toward resolution. Thus, the following survey of ethical theories is intended to serve as a sort of toolbox for LACUC members to help them refine, eval- uate, and justify their decisions, and perhaps even to resolve or at least better understand conflicting intui- tions. We shall pay particular atten- tion to ways in which these various ethical theories fit together, and to how tensions between them reflect our conflicting intuitions about specific cases. This approach is grounded in a fact about both real- life ethical dilemmas and abstract debates in moral philosophy: a satisfactory answer is most likely to be found in ajudicious combination of theoretical commitments. How- ever, a plea for tolerance and com- promise should not be confused with accepting inconsistency, carelessness, or arbitrary switching from one theoretical ground to another- whether for the sake of convenience or to preserve intuitions and prejudices. Utilitarianism The most important version of teleological or consequentialist theo- ries-theories that focus on the consequences of actions-is "utilitar- ianism," which was first explicitly articulated under that label byJeremy Bentham (1748-1832), and developed more fully by John Stuart Mill (1806- 1873).422 The basic theory that grew out of their philosophy, now gener- ally known as classical utilitarianism, is essentially this: In deciding whether an action is morally right, we sum up the total amount of good the action will bring about, and weigh that against the total amount of harm that will be caused. An action is right if and only if it brings about a better balance of good consequences over harm than any alternative action. Bentham explicitly identifies the "good" in question as pleasure or happiness; pain, suffering, or the diminution of happiness constitutes "harm." Classical utilitarianism appears to fit well with many of our ordinary decisions, especially about the use of animals in research: Probably the most common justification is that the benefits gained from such research (e.g., curing debilitating illness) far outweigh the suffering of experimen- 4</page><page sequence="5">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 tal animals. However, this argument must be examined more closely. Inasmuch as animals are capable of feeling pleasure and pain we must include these goods and harms in our utilitarian calculation of whether an action is morally right. Bentham recognized this explicitly,4 and a contemporary utilitarian, Peter Sin- ger, has applied such calculations to animal research and concluded the vast majority is immoral.' This general argument has two prongs. First, much research pro- duces trivial, if any, benefit, and hence has little to weigh against the suffering caused to the animals used. To complicate matters, utilitarian calculations usually require us to factor in the probability of an expected benefit or harm, and since no experiment is certain to produce a hoped-for benefit, the "expected utility" will be reduced still further. Second, even if a particular research project promises significant gains, there may be alternative ways of alleviating suffering with less harm done. For example, instead of using funds for developing a new technique for open-heart surgery, we could do more good by using that money to convince people to change their diet and exercise patterns. Thus, classical utilitarianism issues a challenge to re- evaluate our almost casual acceptance of current levels of use of animals in research. Despite its obvious appeal, classical utilitarianism has been subject to important criticisms. First, the method of summing up or averaging the good or harm for all concerned is often seen as failing to respect those affected as separate and distinct individuals. For instance, utilitarian theories seem to condone secretly killing someone who contributes no good to society, friends, or family in order to transplant her organs into four or five worthy but dying people. Moreover, hedonism seems too narrow as a full account of "the good"; after all, many people freely forgo pleasure to obtain other things they deem worthy of pursuit. In response, contemporary utilitar- ians have offered two important modifications to classical utilitarian- ism. First, many advocate some version of rule utilitarianism. That is, instead of evaluating actions one at a time, we should identify and follow rules which, if adopted, would max- imize good consequences. Thus, an action may be wrong, even though it produces more benefit than harm, if it violates a rule that would, in general, yield better overall conse- quences. Second, many utilitarians agree that there are many goods in addition to pleasure that ought to be maximized, including individual autonomy, the satisfaction of prefer- ences and interests. These accounts are often referred to as pluralistic versions of utilitarianism. Unless one is prepared to argue that animals simply lack the capacity for morally relevant interests and desires, 1 any consistent form of utilitarianism that includes pleasures, suffering, or interests in its account of "good" must accord sentient animals a significant moral status. An act may therefore be wrong solely because of its direct effect on animals, even if it causes no harm to humans. Torturing kittens may or may not foster a tendency to be brutal to humans, but according to utilitarian- ism, it is wrong essentially because it harms the kitten. Although this view entails that any- being capable of suffering or having interests is morally entitled to equal consider- ation, it does not follow that animals have a moral status equal to that of human beings, or that the life of an animal and that of a human are of equal worth.40 Many values, such as choosing and carrying out a long- range life plan, moral autonomy (the ability to function as a rational moral agent), and complex personal and communal relationships, are relevant exclusively or to a much greater extent for normal human beings. One isjustified in giving "preference" to human beings insofar as doing so maximizes all good consequences, including those that have special value for human beings. In this way, utilitarianism does justice to the conviction that animals have some moral status-that benefits or harms to animals must figure directly into our judgment that an action is right or wrong-but also providesjustification for asserting that the life of a human being may have more value than the life of one or many mice. A pluralistic version of utilitarian- ism may also justify the intuition that, other things being equal, it is better to use a planarian than a mouse, and better to use a rat than a chimpanzee. A mouse is not only capable of feeling pleasures and pain, but also has other interests and preferences that can be satisfied or frustrated. A chimp has even more such interests, a richer network of personal relationships, and a greater sense of the future. For this reason, significant interference in the life of a chimpanzee is likely to produce more bad consequences than the same sort of treatment of a mouse. Concern for moral autonomy and other "higher" goods may supple- ment but nonetheless cannot sup- plant the demand to maximize hap- piness and the satisfaction of basic preferences or interests. Once we include the suffering and frustration of interests or preferences of research animals in our utilitarian calculation, we will be driven to the conclusion that a sizable proportion of current research is morally unjustifiable. Rule utilitarianism, no less than classical utilitarianism, demands a strict, fair, and complete "cost-benefit" analysis of the sort that many IACUCs today- in their insistence that considerations of scientific merit are outside their province-in fact abjure. Deontology and Rights The second important category of ethical theories is known as deontol- ogy. According to a standard defini- tion, a theory is deontological if and only if some acts are judged right [wrong] even though their conse- quences are, on balance, bad [good]. That is, a deontological theory rejects, at least in part, a utilitarian approach to ethics. The qualification "at least in part" acknowledges that many deontologists (notably, for our pur- poses, Tom Regan) distinguish "mod- erate" from "extreme" versions of deontological theories. "Moderate" theories allow consequentialist con- siderations to play a substantial role in moral deliberation, while still maintaining that "rights are more basic than utility and independent of it"S5 The rejection of consequentialism 5</page><page sequence="6">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 entails that we should not make moral judgments simply by asking whether the consequences of an action would result in the world's being "a better place" (happier, more pleasant expe- riences, more satisfaction, etc.). Instead, most deontological theories offer a concept of right (as in "right action," not necessarily "a right to x") that is independent of or logically prior to any specification of "the good." This emphasis on a special class of irreducible moral properties or "right-making characteristics"-- what makes an action right-of actions is especially common in twentieth century revivals of deonto- logical theories.34,36 The distinction between "right" and "good" suggests that the two concepts are to some extent incom- mensurable, even though a moderate theory should have some way of balancing the two. That is, in a strict deontological theory one cannot justify an action that would otherwise be wrong simply on the ground that it produces more good consequences than harmful ones. The rightness or wrongness of an action forms a barrier that cannot be breached by an appeal to consequences. If torture is wrong, we cannot justify torturing a terrorist merely because we can achieve considerable good by extract- ing information in this manner. For this reason, deontological theories often take the form of a rights-based account of moral obligation. More specifically, serious talk about "ani- mal rights" is more likely to find conceptual justification in de- ontology. Deontological theories differ widely on the issue of the moral status of animals and their use in research. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), who formulated the classic version of deontology, claimed that we have no direct duties to animals, that they have no moral status, and would therefore condone any research that might benefit human moral agents. By contrast, Tom Regan, a contemporary deontologist, argues that animals do have significant moral status, and that almost all animal research is immoral. This difference can be traced back to a disagreement about "right- making characteristics" and the more basic concept of inherent value. Deontologists can give substance to their disagreement with consequen- tialism by insisting that some things have value in virtue of the sorts of things they are, not simply in virtue of their contribution to the total amount of good in the world. The locus of inherent value is reflected in a concern for individuals as individuals of a certain sort. To use a metaphor that Regan often invokes, the individual is not merely a "re- ceptacle" for some impersonal good; he/she/it has moral standing simply in virtue of the sort of individual he/she/it is. Consequently, we can- not merely sum up the total amount of good contained in all the "re- ceptacles," or transfer good from one receptacle to another, without consid- ering the inherent value of the receptacle itself."5 Animals, then, have moral status insofar as they have inherent value, that characteristic by virtue of which they are worthy of moral respect. Unless we follow Kant in attributing inherent value only to moral agents, in which case we will have problems justifying our respect for infants, severely retarded humans, or other members of our own species incapa- ble of acting as a moral agent, it is reasonable to expect that at least some of the properties in which inherent value is grounded will be found to some extent in non-human animals. It is hard to move beyond this point, since the basis of inherent value is the subject of much dispute. For example, Kant took moral auton- omy as the basis for inherent value, while Regan argues that we ought to recognize inherent value of all "subjects of a life."35'39 These are by no means the only alternatives; whenever our intuitions prod us into an attitude of respect, awe, or wonder at something as it exists for its own sake, invoking a special moral com- mitment to its preservation, we may well be drawing on a deontological concern for inherent value. Philosophic discussion of inherent value is necessarily inconclusive; the concept nonetheless still helps to account for some of our intuitions about the use of animals in research, and to challenge others. As we have just seen, inherent value can explain why we ought to respect animals as individuals with lives of their own. The deontological emphasis on respect and justice for the individual often underlies the judgment that it is wrong to be callous or casual about the use of animals even where those attitudes don't result in actual harm. The reaction of most people to the videotapes of research on unanes- thetized primates at the University of Pennsylvania trauma lab exemplifies this perspective; the callous and casual attitude of the workers may have been at least as objectionable as the actual abuse. There is simply something morally wrong about laughing and joking about the con- dition of a helpless subject, whether or not any additional pain results. While there are serious difficulties in articulating what the moral obligation to respect other individuals requires and what sort of beings are entitled to respect, we still recognize that our moral theories ought to incorporate this requirement The deontological notion of inher- ent value and respect also affects our judgments about research in which animals are killed without experienc- ing any pain or distress. Utilitarians (although they have often struggled with this issue) have great difficulty explaining what might be morally wrong about killing an animal pain- lessly, especially if we have good reason to think that it is incapable of sophisticated concepts and desires such as the desire to live long enough to carry out a long-range plan.41 Nonetheless, many people are con- vinced that an experiment in which five animals are painlessly sacrificed is preferable to one in which ten are used to achieve the same result, and that any interference with the life of an animal, no matter how painless and innocuous, should require some moral justification. No animal should be killed wantonly. Despite the fact that deontology may attribute inherent value to at least some animals (Regan, for example, takes mammals over one year of age as his paradigm), deontology's partic- ular emphasis on specifically moral values suggests that moral autonomy will carry special weight. Thus, deontology, like utilitarianism, leaves room for arguments about the special status of human beings, and for 6</page><page sequence="7">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 appealing to a hierarchy according to which it is better to use a more "primitive" animal rather than a more complex one. Unlike utilitarianism, however, deontology produces confused results when addressing the issue of "higher" versus "lower" animals. Inherent worth is often taken to be an all-or- nothing characteristic, although it is not clear that this is a logically necessary feature of deontological theories. Given the lack of consensus on this point, the best we can say is that our belief that we should use "lower" animals rather than "higher" ones wherever possible is more congenial to utilitarian justification. This is yet another illustration that no single, "pure" moral theory has emerged as completely adequate for moral decisionmaking, and that our specific judgments will draw on a combination of approaches. Contracts, Kinship, and Organic Nature Philosophers often discuss moral theories that do not fit neatly into the utilitarianism/deontology dichotomy. While these theories are sometimes treated as alternatives to utilitarian and deontological approaches, we think it is more useful to see them as attempts to identify some of the values that, while compatible with either utilitarianism or deontology, are often neglected. We will here focus on three topics most directly relevant to the moral status of animals: contracts, kinship and community, and organic unity. Contractarian theories of ethics see moral obligations as growing out of mutual agreements between moral agents: I will refrain from doing x to you if you, in return, agree not to do x to me. Since most moral con- straints are never formulated so explicitly, contractarians typically present them as implicit agreements or even as convenient fictions-what a rational person would agree to if she were asked to enter into a new society of peers. Some philosophers (e.g., Thomas Hobbes) have argued that contracts would be designed to maximize benefits for all concerned, and so would be compatible with utilitarianism. Others (e.g., John Rawls) emphasize the fact that moral agents would, first and foremost, take care to secure the liberty necessary to function autonomously, and ally themselves with deontological approaches. Contract theories are by nature limited in scope. Only moral agents can enter into a contract; thus, any obligations we might have to infants, severely retarded people, and other humans who cannot function with the required degree of moral auton- omy, will not follow directly from the basic premise of such theories. On the other hand, they may explain some special obligations to human society; for example, a scientist's obligation to "repay" human society for her education and research support by emphasizing research that will most benefit that group. Kinship and the related concept of social group or community often surfaces in discussion of the use of animals in research.2 It is often asserted, for example, that we have stronger obligations to our own children and other family members than to strangers; this may be gener- alized to include one's community as a whole. Usually, this entails favoring one's own kin and conspecifics (one's species) over the lives of other animals. The same attitude can also be seen in the special obligations we seem to feel towards our own pets, domestic animals who have become part of our social circle. Some phi- losophers (particularly utilitarians) have argued that this preference is irrational, that a good moral theory must be impartial and completely fair. As our objective here is not to resolve philosophical disputes but to delin- eate connections between philosoph- ical concepts and specific decisions, it may be sufficient to articulate the point clearly, and to see how it fits with the two main types of theories already identified. Utilitarianism is often criticized for being impersonal, treating people as completely interchangeable, but even utilitarian theories can accommodate the special demands of kinship by arguing that good consequences will be maximized if agents concentrate their efforts to help those they know and understand best-family, friends, fellow citizens, and even conspecifics. Within a deontological framework, certain relationships may in and of themselves generate specific personal duties. Indeed, it is often deemed an argument in favor of deontology that it can account for the fact that our obligations to family members often count for more than our duties to anonymous strangers. Talk of "organic unity" represents a unique attempt to combine ethics and metaphysics.'4 The claim is that organic life exhibits a kind of indi- vidual unity, dynamism, purpose, and "neediness" that gives it inherent moral value. Organisms and commu- nities of organisms create, instantiate, or define ends in themselves, simply in virtue of leading a purposeful existence. Organic unity similarly presents a value that might be incorporated into either a utilitarian or a deontological theory: the goals exhibited by an organic unity might be taken as good consequences to be maximized, or as states inherently worthy of a special moral respect. This value system, perhaps more than any other, captures many fea- tures of our basic attitudes toward animals. It recognizes life and the striving purposiveness that accom- panies life as morally significant. Moreover, since complexity adds richness and value, more complex organisms are more valuable than simple ones. This value extends beyond the individual to the entire community in which the organism operates; here too, complexity and richness are characteristics to respect and protect. Thus an endangered species, or one that is part of an intricate and delicate ecosystem, gains extra value from that relationship, and therefore deserves more care and respect than, for example, a labora- tory mouse. Value systems such as these seem to capture the essence of certain very powerful intuitions we have about how we ought and ought not treat animals, and as such, must be acknowledged and investigated further. Moral Reasoning What are we to make of the preceding smorgasbord of alternative ethical theories and value systems? 7</page><page sequence="8">Hastings Center Report May/June 1990 We have tried to show how moral philosophy cannot give us a neat formula or algorithm with which to generate safe and defensible solu- tions but can still help us understand, evaluate, and occasionally change the decisions we do make. By focusing on the ethical theories that underlie our moral decisions, we are forced to confront considerations of consis- tency and justification that otherwise remain hidden. We cannot, for example, argue that an experiment that should not be done on a dog is permissible when pigs are substi- tuted if we are not prepared to identify a morally relevant characteristic of dogs (or pigs) that would justify the different evaluations. When we move from abstract theories to specific issues, we find important areas of agreement. The strongest and most defensible ethical theories all entail that animals-at least those which are sentient (capa- ble of feeling pleasure and pain) or "autonomous" in the wide sense of having preferences and the ability to pursue them-have a significant moral status. They cannot be treated as mere objects, and the effect of an experiment on them must be consid- ered when we decide whether the experiment is ethically justifiable. However, the values with which ethics is concerned are numerous and varied, which suggests that moral status is not an all-or-nothing char- acteristic. That is, the value systems most adequate for real dilemmas will recognize happiness, absence of pain, autonomy, experiential and cognitive richness, and many other factors as relevant to moral judg- ments. Since these properties are more relevant to the lives of some animals than to others, the result is likely to be something like a "moral hierarchy" of concern (although the relative weighting within the hierar- chy may shift from case to case, as different concerns become relevant). In adopting this approach, we have discovered that different theories and value systems are needed to dojustice to different aspects of the decision- making process, and to capture the conflicts that arise in hard cases. This reinforces the message conveyed by the history of moral philosophy: An adequate ethical theory is most probably going to contain elements of both utilitarianism and deontology, and will involve a pluralistic value theory. None of this is a license for promiscuity. One cannot justifiably select whatever moral theory happens to generate the conclusion one would like to reach. Legitimate areas of agreement, overlap, and compatibility must be carefully articulated and analyzed; our foundational theory may be eclectic, but cannot properly contain inconsistencies or arbitrary choices. To be sure, this is a difficult enterprise, but one that should result in a clearer understanding of our obligations regarding the use of animals in biomedical research. -Lilly-Marlene Russow, in collabo- ration with K Danner Clouser, David DeGrazia, andJames Stephens Section II. Animals in Science: The Justification Issue At the heart of the wide-ranging and seemingly unending controversy over the use of animals in biomedical science, whether in basic or applied research, toxicity testing, drug production, or education, is one burning question: Are we humans ethically justified in such a use of animals, in general and in particular cases? How we individually or collectively answer this question no doubt finally depends on our moral worldview, including the judgment of the relative moral status of human beings and animals, discussed in the preceding section. However, the very fact that controversy continues to rage among the more extreme animal liberationists/rightists and human welfarists/scientific progressivists, with the "troubled middle" caught in- between, provides evidence for a plurality of "ultimate" or primary ethical values, goods, and responsibilities that are not easily commensurable. In addressing the justification controversy, it is important to see precisely what is at issue. The central factors leading to conflict are the nature and methodological require- ments of scientific inquiry, the human values of science, and the complex values accruing to animals and organic life, including the ethical responsibilities that these values engender. We are caught in a cross current of seemingly ultimate ethical values and obligations from which we do not easily escape. The Nature of Scientific Inquiry Certain general features of bio- medical science (understood here as the scientific study of organic life for both theoretical and practical rea- sons) require notice. Whatever be the most adequate theory of the scientific method-the so-called hypothetico- deductive method with its infusion of rational imagination-modern bio- medical science is characterized by controlled experimentation for vali- dation of scientific ideas, knowledge, and techniques. Moreover, biomed- icine essentially involves an interde- pendence of various scientific disci- plines and areas of inquiry for generations of important scientific knowledge and practical tech- niques.11,19 This interdependence extends to the various "models" used in experimentation, whether mathe- matical, cellular, animal or human, in vivo or in vitro.19,45 Animal exper- 8</page><page sequence="9">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 imentation and use, for whatever scientific purpose, do not exist in isolation from the rest of science. Science and biomedicine are a dynamic, complex, and temporal, if loose web of cultural activity, not an aggregate of discrete episodes of research and experimentation. Another characteristic of scientific and biomedical inquiry is its overall tentative and "uncertain" character.46 Scientific theories or experimental results are never finally complete, but are subject to revision in light of new evidence or novel theoretical imag- ination. There can never be a guar- antee or certainty of the usefulness or importance of any one particular experiment, including those on animals. Finally, narrowly practical and useful biomedical knowledge in its overall genesis crucially depends on imaginative and explorative basic and non-clinically oriented research." In short, scientific advance, perhaps inherently, is not a rationally tidy affair. Science is an ever-beginning and never-completed exploration, always requiring a con- frontation with natural reality, includ- ing animal life, in the quest for ever more adequate scientific under- standing. The Human Values of Science These inherent features and requirements of science intimately interweave with its human and ethical values. Beyond the values of personal and professional gain to individual scientists and profits to corporations, a fundamental pragmatic value of biomedical inquiry to both humans and other animals exists: the relief of human and animal suffering and the enhancement of opportunities for individual activity and well-being. The relief of suffering particularly strikes us as an ultimate ethical imperative, underived from any more primary obligation. Despite the essential and positive role of pain in animal, including human life, taken by itself the relief of suffering is an intrinsic or inherent good, a fundamental response to our mortal and finite estate. "If possible, relieve suffering." The relief of human suffering in particular is a basic aim of biomedical inquiry and the central, if not sole, value behind the championing of the use of animals in science by human welfarists. Biomedical inquiry also is consti- tuted by the intrinsic human value and good of coming to know and knowledge itself.46 This speaks for the intelligent actor in us. Knowing is a fundamental capacity and activity characteristic of human life, in which we are not the only ones who might have a stake. We are an integral part of animate nature and seemingly are life's most emphatic, if not only, opportunity to know, understand, and explicitly appreciate itself. Curiosity arises from our organic depths, and the thrill of a novel idea or discovery infuses our whole bodily being. "By nature," theoretical knowing also strikes us an ultimate ethical value and imperative, unconditioned by practical or utilitarian considerations. This is the ultimate value of the philosophically minded scientific progressivist. Given the inherent nature of science as interdependent human activity, these practical and theoretical "virtues" together engender other important human values. Science is an ongoing adventure, requiring both intensely individual and cooperative efforts. Thus it has an inherently civilizing force, bringing people together for humanly noble reasons in a mixture of cooperation and competition that seems to mark vital, high civilization. This appears on local, national, and international levels and involves more than the scientists themselves, that is, all those who directly or indirectly participate in "scientific culture." Whole peoples can come to glory in their science. This civilizing force of science also seems to be a primary human and ethical good. This is not to claim, however, that science presents no barbaric dangers; the cultural hege- mony of science's view of the world and the threat of technologically rooted human and ecological disaster suggest otherwise. In virtue of the ultimate values embedded in the practical and theoretical aspects of scientific inquiry, as well as the civilizing capacities of science, biomedical research is at bottom an ethical endeavor or enterprise. Given the ethical imperatives of scientific inquiry and the integral role of animals in biomedicine, this seems prima facie justification for the scien- tific use of animals, both for the practical benefits to human and animal life and for the theoretical reason that animal and biological life is an intensely interesting, perhaps ultimately significant feature of the reality we by nature strive to know. With these centrally important goods and ethical imperatives underlying scientific inquiry, what can be said against the use of animals in science? The Value of Animal and Organic Life The problem undergirding this heated controversy is that the ultimate ethical goods of scientific inquiry are confronted and challenged by corre- sponding rival goods of animal life and organic reality and the ethical responsibilities they foster, which also seem ultimate and underived. Hence the specter of inescapable ethical conflict and controversy, which is especially acute since the biomedical, scientific good, both theoretical and practical, often can be pursued only by harming animals. This is the fate of our mortal and finite human condition. Most obviously, the reality of animal life includes the undeniable fact of animal sentience and espe- cially capacities for pain, distress, or suffering, difficult as these may be for us humans to judge. [See Section III.] The ethical injunction to relieve or minimize suffering ostensibly reaches beyond concern for humans to all sentient creatures. It is in the sentient animal's felt "interest" not to suffer, especially severely, and we are objec- tively or inescapably enjoined to take this interest into account This is the overriding ethical value of animal liberationists, especially those of a utilitarian persuasion who take pain and suffering to have paramount significance.40 However, the mere avoidance of pain or suffering is decidedly not the only animal good. Natural capacities of organic, animal being and activity are played out on various levels: subjectivity and individuality, subjec- tive preference and purposeful 9</page><page sequence="10">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 behavior, and interactions with animal others, including complex social relations. Individual animal actors by nature live in animal communities and/or larger ecosys- tems, necessarily interacting with many forms of biological life. Such living individuals and communities, in their mutual and concrete involve- ments, emphatically impress us as being a fundamental good, com- manding ethical responsibility. We feel the ethical injunction, "Take care, here is something that matters." This is doubly so if we consider that all the multiform natural goodness of organic life, animal, human, and other, has arisen within, if not out of a dynamic and temporally vast evolutionary and ecological process, the spatio-temporal interconnections of things natural. In fact, "taking care" of the breath-taking fact of biological life, human and other, is character- istically experienced as our ultimate worldly responsibility.'4 The appar- ently intrinsic value of organic individuals grounds the claim of animal rightists that at least certain animals should be treated as ends and not as mere means to human and scientific purposes.35 Finally, and this leads to unavoid- able dilemmas, it is precisely the experienced goodness of animate nature, emphatically expressed in organic individuality, purposive activ- ity, and relatedness to animate others, that lends an ultimate dignity and value to scientific inquiry and theo- retical knowing. It is a classic Greek insight that the object of knowledge must be intrinsically good for the knowing to be intrinsically worthy. The Inevitable Ethical Conflict This confluence of knowing, the good, and the real inevitably puts biomedical scientists and those who support their research in a complex and difficult position. What scientists characteristically care about or revere, that is, animal and organic life, and what they often must harm in the pursuit of significant knowledge, are one and the same. Animal individuals and biological life are squarely in the cross currents of the biomedical scientists' complex ethical impera- tives. To be ethically responsible, they must face several conflicting ethical ultimates or goods at once, none of which can command absolute alle- giance. There must be the judicious promotion of both the scientific, human good and the worldly animal and biological good. Neither ought to be pursued at the serious under- mining of the other. This requires a delicate, sensitive, and nuanced consideration of ethical re- sponsibilities. It is precisely this inherently conflicted situation that argues forc- ibly for the ethical scrutiny of par- ticular uses of animals in biomedical science, whether experimentation, field research, testing, or education. The intention of this ethical inquiry is usually not a dramatic "all or nothing," a go-ahead or stop to animal use. Rather it seeks ways to carry out legitimate scientific inves- tigation in a manner that best respects our ethical responsibilities to animals and biological life. This "ethical use" of animals in science will not satisfy those who claim that ultimate ethical duties to animals and biological life in general "trump" ethical appeals to human welfare and the intrinsic value of knowledge. However, such judgment seemingly ignores a fundamental fact of natural reality: all forms of animal, including human life must by nature use other instances of organic life in order to be and to flourish.'4 This precarious worldly interaction and "capture of energy" is a fundamental law of metabolic existence. And, again, the rigors of metabolic exis- tence and the ongoingly dynamic, competitive, and cooperative inter- connections of living things seem to undergird the evolving natural and specific goodness of organic life. (Here "natural necessity" and eth- ics-the real, the good, and the obligations they engender-meet.) This is not the world for "non- interventionists" or those who would keep their hands clean from all harm. In fact, the overall dynamic and interdependent character of science, if not the human "polis" itself, seems but a provincial, yet significant modification of the wider organic and metabolic realm. Thus as both scientific naturalists and ethical actors, biomedical researchers can appeal to the funda- mental and ultimately good fact of metabolic existence, life using life, in the pursuit of a science that involves the use and harming of animals. But then the ball of ethical justification falls squarely into their court. They must convincingly show that their scientific practice is an ethically appropriate use of animals, involving a proper and adequate regard for the needs and interests of science, humans, and animals. The rigorous requirements of thisjustification have spawned their own controversies, for example, the questioning of the methodological merit of research protocols and their human or social value. However, without such consid- erations, human and scientific imperatives gain an ethical carte blanche. 17 Several ethical dilemmas arising from the very nature and limitations of science are inescapable. For example, it has been forcibly argued that animal experimentation leads to important theoretical and practical results, benefiting both humans and animals."9 But it is also undeniable that many experiments lead nowhere, despite the animal suffering and loss of life. The difficulty is judging prospectively which particular experi- ments will lead to significant results and which will prove useless. Even with calculations of probability of success, how do we ethically face this "useless" use and harming of anim- als? There also are factors of seren- dipity, luck, or chance in biomedical inquiry, which defy rational calcula- tion. Given the many uncertainties endemic to the generation of impor- tant scientific knowledge, what con- stitutes a judicious and ethically responsible use of animals? These dilemmas do not even approach the more radical charge of the "useless- ness" of all animal research, that human and animal welfare, if not knowledge, are better served by means other than biomedical exper- imentation on animals, for example, by the change of destructive personal and social habits and preventive public health measures. Further ethical problems surround the adequacy of animal models in gaining scientific knowledge serving human welfare. In toxicity testing on 10</page><page sequence="11">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 animals, how relevant are the exper- imental results to human lives? Even if they are only partially or inade- quately relevant, what if no better alternatives are available? In addition, what are the differing human ends, both manifestly important (testing drugs for the treatment of AIDS) or relatively trivial (testing the safety of the latest shoe polish), served by toxicity testing? What difference should these ends make? For animal models presumably adequate to human beings, what ethical weight should be given to this very similarity, especially to those animals whose natural capacities approach our own? Should special ethical consideration be given to higher mammals that would halt potentially significant basic or applied research? These are ethical questions that may yield no clear or definite answers, but that must be practically decided nevertheless. It is here that a nuanced "taking together" of different ethical obligations comes into play, in which we seek to reduce overall ethical costs and to gain a measured and judicious "proportion- ality" between "goods" and "evils."'6 Moral Ecology and Particular Scientific Uses of Animals There can be no straightforward, unambiguous, and single ethical guideline for assessing each and every use of animals in science. In general, we may rank practical wel- fare concerns over theoretical curi- osity, important communal over optional individual goals, and human over animal life. But the many different types, purposes, and con- texts of animal use require different considerations, with perhaps a differ- ent relative regard for the ethical obligations involved. In laboratory research a chief concern might be the number of animals used and the pain, distress, or suffering of each individ- ual animal. With research in the wild the primary concern could well be in minimizing interference with ecosystems, animal populations or social groupings, and individual behavior, or with slow-breeding or endangered species. With testing, the concern might be the importance of the experiment's goal or the useful- ness of the animal as a scientific model. In education, the foremost concern might not only be with suffering and the number of animals used, but the competency of students to handle animals humanely, despite the educational and human signifi- cance of interacting with live animals. In short, each use of animals in science will have its own particular "moral ecology," its own interplay of ethical values and obligations. The appropriateness of the use is to be decided within this particular constel- lation of ethical factors. The "ought to do" comes at the end of the particular deliberation and arguably should not be decided beforehand a priori. Nevertheless, each judgment should be guided by the same general goal: the promotion of the overall good (human, animal, and organic) at the least or ethically tolerable overall cost. The underlying assump- tion is that the human, animal, and organic good ought not to be pursued independently of each other. Finally the human good should exist and flourish only within the wider animal and organic good, since all living beings are inextricably linked together within a single evolutionary and ecological context. With this general "ecological" premise, we can look briefly at specific factors that characteristically have to be "ecologically" considered in the ethical justification of a particular animal use, including the importance of the scientific end, the ethically appropriate means to the end, the competency of those carrying out the project, and the ethical cost to animals in terms of number and kind of animals used and the pain, distress, or suffering undergone. This mixture of scientific and animal issues is similar in kind to issues that IACUCs are mandated under federal law to address in reviewing research proto- cols. (See also Section IV.) The end or goal of animal use. The proposed goals for the use of animals in science vary from the humanly most important and compelling to the undeniably trivial. These include the use of animals in research to combat devastating diseases or to explore major theoretical advances, in the production of vaccines and drugs, in toxicity testing, in various levels of education, including high school fairs, and more. Here "moral ecology" and the test of "proportionality" begin to come into play on several levels. First, assuming the prima facie validity of the end, are the number or kind of animals used, or the animal suffering involved, proportionate to the importance of the goal? On a broader level, what would be the probable cost to the human, animal, and scientific good, relative to the ethical cost of the animals involved, if the use were forgone, as for example, in cosmetic testing or education? Causing death or signif- icant suffering for trivial reasons seems straightforwardly or intrinsi- cally wrong. Yet there are always "all things to consider," and toxicity testing for cosmetics and everyday household goods aims to obviate or alleviate foreseeable human harm. The ethical pressure here is to reduce ethical costs while upholding the human good; that is, to find alterna- tives to animal testing that cause significant suffering. There are other "ends" issues as well, particularly the clash of scientific with other ethically desirable ends. For example, what if highly interest- ing and potentially significant research in the wild threatens the stability of animal populations, the local ecosystem, or the survival of a species, pitting the scientific good against the organic good? Seemingly, we ought to disallow the research in absence of an overwhelming welfare justification. The idea of scientists at once studying and destroying an object that is an irreplaceable natural good goes beyond the proportions of reason. This issue pointedly arises with the use of chimpanzees, or any other endangered species, in biomed- icine. Does such use threaten their extinction? From a "morally ecolog- ical" perspective, which includes the human, animal, and organic good together, what "good reasons" could justify this?'5 The "clash of ends" reaches into the heart of human morality itself. Are there experiments, no matter how worthy the theoretical or practical ends, that are simply inadmissible due to the decided violation of our moral sensibilities, not to mention the extreme harm done to the animals? 11</page><page sequence="12">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 What of experiments involving intense and extended animal suffer- ing and the destruction of an animal's vital, individual integrity, as long- term isolation or restraint of primates. Can proportional, morally justifying reasons sometimes be given even here? Scientific merit. The goal of animal use spills over into review of the scientific merit of the use. Two distinct issues are involved, both controver- sial."7 The first is the scientific, human, and social significance of the proposed use that, at least in the case of research protocols, is difficult to assess due to the uncertainties and unpredictable course of scientific advances. The second is the method- ological merit of the research pro- posal, how carefully crafted and likely to yield the data required the protocol design is. Whether IACUC members or not, only scientific "peers," those knowledgeable in the particular field, can make the latter assessment. It has been argued that no one can judge with certainty the "moral worth" of a research protocol and that IACUCs are ill-equipped to judge methodological merit. While this may be true, the ethical demands remain: There can be no good use of animals without good science. Researchers ought to be able to give a persuasive account of the probable or possible scientific, human, and social worth of their projects, especially how the projects might fit into the wider web of science. Similarly, methodological merit ought to be reviewed at some point, usually in the funding process, and IACUCs have the duty to question, if not evaluate this merit. Otherwise science is reduced to an arational and amoral affair, which undercuts its own integrity as a rational and ethical enterprise. Science cannot be ruled by "Lord Chance." The proportionality of animal use to scientific goals. "Proportionality" bears upon both degrees of animal suffering and levels of animal capac- ities. Even moderate levels of unre- lieved suffering must be ethically countered by an arguably important scientific goal and a well-designed protocol. The more acute the suffer- ing, the more important the goal and the tighter the design, until we reach moral repugnance and the possible "beyond the pale" experiment. Sim- ilarly there is a certain and varying significance to animals arising from their natural capacities and active life within the world. It is ethically inappropriate to put the more capac- itated animals in untrained hands for scientifically trivial reasons. This is especially true in education. On the other hand, it emphatically serves the overall good to introduce students of all ages to the concrete reality and significance of the many levels of animal life. The respect for animal significance particularly calls for close attention to the ethically appropriate use of higher mammals, especially primates. Each use should honor their capacities as much as possible, with minimal interference in their characteristic habits. The necessity for using animals. Is the use of animal, sentient life, with its attendant harms in suffering and death, necessary to achieve the particular scientific goal? Underlying this question is the possible replace- ment of a proposed use of animals by other means of research, e.g., computer models and cell cultures. If scientifically practical, this seems an unambiguous ethical good. But there is heated argument over how exten- sively scientists could use these "alternatives" without compromising legitimate goals and how much effort should be deployed in their discovery. (Computer models, for example, are only as good as our understanding of the organisms they model.) Where present animal models are only moderately useful, as in certain toxicity testing, a call for non-animal alternatives should be more insistent. On the other hand, an appropriate use of animals in basic and applied research and education may be integral to some scientific inquiries and compatible with the fundamental values of theoretical knowing and an appreciative first-hand acquaintance with animal reality. The training of researchers and laboratory technicians; animal hus- bandry. The most important scien- tific goals and well-designed proto- cols are worthless if those who handle the animals are improperly trained or unskilled. Professional bungling and inadequacy of animal care, with ensuing animal distress, can skew experimental data and render the particular research use- less. Attention to the training of researchers and others involved with laboratory animals should be a primary concern of IACUCs. Sim- ilarly, the proper use and care of animals ought to be a primary goal of biomedical education and, in its own use of animals, integral to its ethical justification. The justification of animal use, especially in laboratory research and testing, requires attention as well to the laboratory care facilities, which have a decided effect on animal well- being. Good animal care (unstressed animals), good protocol design, and good scientific data go hand in hand. Animal numbers, suffering, and interests. Consideration and over- view of the use, well-being, and suffering of animals is the fundamen- tal charge and ethical raison d&amp;tre of IACUCs.16 Beside guarding against unnecessary duplications of animal experimentation, IACUCs must be especially sensitive to particular projects that overuse animals or cause unnecessary suffering. These are difficult, yet vital tasks. Judgments of the statistically appropriate number of animals for a given protocol often requires highly sophisticated and technical understanding, and the appreciation and recognition of animal suffering is a complex skill. Nevertheless, IACUCs characteristi- cally work under rough minimization principles. They look for the use of the least harmed species (the extent of suffering and interference with natural capacities), the least possible suffering, and the least number of animals commensurate with achiev- ing the project's scientific goals. This is the ideal "proportionality" of ethical costs to the overall human and animal good in the project's moral ecology. In experiments causing significant animal distress, this includes special attention to the "end- point" of the experiment and whether this needs to be death. The final ethical decision. The mere asking of the right questions and demanding full or detailed answers goes a long way toward promoting ethical science. But not the whole way. The final problem of assessing the strength of the many 12</page><page sequence="13">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 ethical obligations vis-ai-vis one another, the heart of overall "propor- tionality," remains. How much weight does each obligation carry? For this there is no overarching theory, but the ongoing need for broadly sen- sitive, educated judgment. There are specific aids in making final ethical judgments. The primary aid is a well-crafted protocol review form, which asks specific questions about the scientific and social purpose and justification of the research; the justification for the species and number of animals used; the degree of suffering expected and how this will be dealt with in terms of anesthesia or analgesics; the end-point of the experiment and the method of eutha- nasia; the qualifications of those persons responsible for the animals' care and the training of these profes- sionals; and explicit discussion and justification of any departures from standard practices of laboratory care, relief of suffering, or euthanasia. Beyond this, several general schemes or guidelines have been proposed to draw attention to the ethical use of animals and the reduction of use and suffering, such as Russell and Burch's "alternatives" to animal use, the three "Rs": replace- ment, substitution of insentient mate- rial for conscious living animals; reduction in the number of animals used to gain information of a given amount and precision; and refinement, decrease in the incidence or severity of inhumane procedures applied to animals still used."8 The Scientists Center for Animal Welfare offers a categorization and ranking of degrees of harm (suffering) to anim- als in relation to experimental proce- dures employed. This is meant to aid researchers and IACUCs in determin- ing the relative need for moral scrutiny of protocols, including the identification of experiments that are inadmissible due to the suffering inflicted." Patrick Bateson has fash- ioned a "decision cube" that plots the scientific quality of biomedical pro- tocols against the probability of generating medically important results against the degree of animal suffering. The cube allows discrim- ination between protocols that should, and should not, be allowed to go forward. All these tools, in a schematic way, are based on various rankings or weights, whether of animal harm, protocol design, or human and scientific purpose.1 The general aim is to gauge the ethical cost and legitimacy of a particular animal use. Unstressful uses of animals require less significant moral and less strict scientificjustification. As animal stress in research increases, so do the demands for moral justification, rigorous science, and significant results. Certain of the schemes hold that there is a point beyond which it is ethically inadmissible to go. At best these are only aids in final decisionmaking; areas of science that use animals for different reasons, e.g., research in the wild and various levels of formal education, may have dif- ferent harms and goods to rank. Thus it may be useful for the several areas of biomedical science to draw up their own list of central questions to ask in examining their use of animals. Nevertheless, the final ethical assess- ment of any particular situation or concrete "moral ecology" is going to be individually or collaboratively human, depending on a final, if tentative vision of the good and the bad, of animals and ourselves. There is no finished science of anything, especially morality. Our fundamental moral persuasions and responsibili- ties run deeper than our knowledge. -Strachan Donnelley, in collabora- tion with Rebecca Dresser, John Kleinig, and Rivers Singleton. Section III. Critical Anthropomorphism, Animal Suffering, and the Ecological Context Judgments about animal suffering are of central importance in evaluating scientific protocols. To make such judgments we must confront a set of problematic practical questions: How are we to predict the effects on animals of particular scientific protocols? How are we to recognize and evaluate animal suffering when it does occur? How are we to alleviate that suffering? How do we address larger issues of harm that go beyond the individual animal? Here, we examine ways of answering such questions, concentrating upon critical anthropomorphism. Critical Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism is the attribu- tion of human characteristics (includ- ing the projection of subjective states and feelings) to non-human entities. Such characteristics are usually applied to animals, but may also be applied to inanimate objects-such as when we talk about a "vicious" storm, an "angry" wind, an "aggressive" weed, an "insult" to the flag, and so on. Although these terms are obviously metaphors when applied to the inanimate, their use with animals can lead to uncritical thinking and invalid interpretations.5,6,20 In its most extreme form, uncritical anthropo- morphism can mean animals being "personified," or treated as if they actually were humans. In less extreme form, uncritical anthropomorphism may lead to misinterpreting an animal's behavior and hence to misunderstanding that animal's needs and emotional state (e.g., cattle kept outdoors in extreme cold may in fact be adapted to such conditions so that bringing them indoors can 13</page><page sequence="14">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 cause the animals heat-stroke; chim- panzees "grin" when aggressive or fearful and not, as uncritical anthro- pomorphism would claim, when amused or welcoming). Criticisms of animal research often rely on an intuitive and uncritical anthropomorphism and a misplaced empathy that reflects more on human sensibilities than a real understand- ing of the state the animal may be experiencing.' In spite of these pitfalls, our intuitions about what is best for an animal, based on a knowledge of ourselves and other people, may often be more on than off the mark.2s Indeed, if the similar- ities between animals and humans are deemed sufficient to extrapolate from animals to humans in medical, toxicity, neuroscience, behavior, and cognition research, by implication the possibility exists of extrapolating from humans to animals. Yet even in the human sphere, empathy based on self-knowledge alone cannot be the basis for scientific understanding. Similarly, our knowledge of people, no matter how sophisticated, will be insufficient for the task of under- standing animals. Thus we need a critical anthropomorphism (CA), in which empathy is tempered by objec- tive knowledge of the particular species' (or individual animal's) life history, behavior, and physiology. While CA does not ignore empathy and the assault on our sensibilities of animal treatment, it requires a willingness to incorporate objective knowledge of the animal's natural history, nervous system, domestica- tion, and prior experience, as well as an appreciation for the scientific literature on the treatment. It also incorporates the ethological view that animals are adapted to a range of environments by evolution and that removal of aspects of this natural environment (spatial, social, climatic, dietary, structural) should be done with care, preferably systematically. In practice, many laboratory animals have been kept in unnatural envi- ronments for generations and only now are attempts emerging to "put back" aspects that seem important. Thus we face the urgent task, man- dated by law in many cases, but ethologically mandated in all, to evaluate existing practices. Figure 1 Pain: Described by the International Association for the Study of Pain as an "unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage." Distress: A state in which the animal is unable to adapt to an altered environment or to altered internal stimuli. Prolonged or excessive dis- tress may result in harmful responses, e.g., abnormal feeding and social interaction behavior, inefficient reproduction, and can result in pathologic conditions, e.g., gastric and intestinal lesions, hypertension, immunosuppression. Discomfort: A minimal change in the animal's adaptive level or homeostasis as a result of biological, physical, social, or psychological changes in its environment. Physiological and behavioral changes may be observed in the animal, but these changes are not sufficient to indi- cate that the animal is experiencing pain or distress. Anxiety: An emotional state involving increased arousal and alert- ness prompted by an unknown danger that may be present in the immediate environment; e.g., a generalized, unfocused response to the unknown. Fear: Defined similarly, except that fear would refer to an experi- enced or known danger in the immediate environment; i.e., a focussed response to a known object or previous experience. AVMA classification of adverse states in animals32 Animal Suffering "Suffering" and its alleviation are usually the focus of critiques of the human use of animals. We will use "suffering" here to encompass the full range of adverse effects that might be inflicted on individual animals in research settings, which can be divided into three overlapping cate- gories: 1) the spectrum of aversive sensations generally caused by phys- ical assaults on the body (chronic or acute discomfort through to pain); 2) the continuum of stress to distress, which can be beneficial at one end but cause severe abnormal physiolog- ical changes at the other (e.g., the result of chronic overcrowding, temperature extremes, poor diet, frustration of normal behavior); and 3) the continuum from apprehension to anxiety, fear, and terror (often based on an anticipation of adverse effect to come but also seen in the panic responses of many dogs to thunder and other sudden loud noises, for example). There are interactions between these three states: for example, an animal in pain is often distressed and may also be fearful (especially when the pain is associated with a certain stimulus, such as the arrival of a particular scientist). Fear in itself can seem to exacerbate pain. Taking a pet to the veterinarian (or oneself to the dentist) often produces such a mixed response. It is therefore important to take a holistic approach in evaluating and relieving suffering. Pain-relieving drugs will do little to relieve distress or fear and anxiolytic drugs will do little to remove pain. It is also important to note that nociception or damage to the body may not result in pain or suffering; many internal body organs in humans can be damaged without a person reporting any pain or suffering. Although all of the terms used above have well-understood collo- quial meanings, it is difficult to gain agreement about their strict defini- tions. A recent American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) collo- quium has provided a helpful, but not definitive, basic descriptive scheme of classification for the different types of adverse effect (Figure 1). 14</page><page sequence="15">A Special Supplement. May/June 1990 Evaluation of Animal Suffering As Eric Cassell has argued with respect to human suffering or the suffering of a self (as opposed to feeling only pain), suffering is indi- vidual in its origin and expressions, so that to understand another's suffering in the deepest sense we must in fact "become as one" with that individual.' This, of course, is impossible: suffering is necessarily a private experience. It is, however, possible to recognize the expressions, gestures, and behaviors characteristic of someone experiencing suffering or pain. Thus if you have a headache, I cannot participate in that ache and experience it, but because we have a common nature and I have also suffered from headaches, I can appreciate your feelings. But gener- alization from personal experience has obvious limits: Can a healthy doctor or relative have this kind of knowledge about a person suffering from terminal cancer or a serious injury? More akin to the problems in crossing species barriers may be gender-specific suffering in people. Many women argue that men can have no inkling of the experiences of childbirth and menstruation. Thus empathy based on generalized per- sonal experience has serious limits in our own species and must be tem- pered by other kinds of information. In suggesting that we use critical anthropomorphism to evaluate ani- mal suffering in the laboratory, we must clearly recognize that there are differences among animals and between animals and humans, that there is much that we do not under- stand about the nature of animal suffering, and moreover, that the differences and lack of understand- ing often become more significant the further (in evolutionary terms) one moves away from humans. Nonetheless, where doubt exists in our interpretation of animal suffering we believe that the benefit of the doubt should lie with the animal; that is, if we, as humans, would be likely to suffer in any of the above three senses under the particular conditions imposed upon the animal, we should assume, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, that the animal may be similarly affected. In essence, we can use our human experience to establish where we might have cause for concern over the welfare of laboratory animals, and then rely on our understanding of the biology and behavior of these animals to assess whether or not our concern is appropriate. Where there is cause for concern, we can predict those relevant signs that the animals will show when experiencing a certain adverse state, and, from these predictions, we can construct guide- lines to assist those caring for the animals in recognizing and alleviat- ing the animals' suffering. We can recognize two main sources of suffering for laboratory animals: husbandry conditions, including the effects of restricted space, diet, social isolation or unusual social grouping, and environmental conditions, including noise and the smell of other animals; and scientific procedures involved in experimental research and safety testing. It is worth noting here that the adverse effects caused by experimental research, such as surgery, prolonged restraint, repeated procedures such as oral dosing or injections, induction of disease, and so on, are usually inadvertent unless the specific objective is, for example, research into pain or the develop- ment of pain-relieving drugs. In fact, such side effects can be a source of unwanted variability; it is therefore important for scientific objectives that these be kept to a minimum. On the other hand, in safety testing there is a deliberate attempt to produce toxic effects to assess the margin of safety or the risks associated with use of a particular substance; this testing is usually carried out by the adminis- tration of substances to the animals, such as by injection, by oral dosing or mixing in food, or by application to the body. Evaluation of Animal Husbandry For most of its life a laboratory animal is maintained in a cage; experimental procedures usually account for only a very small portion of an animal's time in the laboratory. In developing transplant techniques, for example, animals may be fully recovered from the experimental procedure (the transplant surgery) within a few days but, for researchers to see if the transplant is successful, the animals must remain in the lab for a further six months while their health is monitored non-invasively. In a slightly different context, animals involved in a long term toxicity study may be kept on a dose of a test compound that does not produce overt toxic effects for two years (rodents) or occasionally seven years (dogs). In these cases, a major source of suffering experienced by the animals will be the conditions under which they are maintained. Here, then, we might use the aspect of CA based on empathetic concern or compassion to hypothesize, for example, that "If I were, like that rabbit, cooped up in a small cage, then I would 'suffer' through feeling bored, depressed, frustrated, etc.," or that "if I were, like that mouse, kept in a cage next to a pen of animals for which I am prey (like those ferrets), then I would 'suffer' through being fearful and distressed." This kind of concern is the basis of "good stockmanship," or compassion for the animals from which a kinship may develop: the swineherd who thinks like a pig is a good stockman with pigs. CA mandates that we also formu- late hypotheses based on comparison of the conditions of the animals in the laboratory with the conditions of their wild counterparts. Hence we might suggest that "wild rabbits have lots of space in which to run about and have burrows in which they can hide, they can also engage in social interactions with other members of their species, forage for food, and so on; we might therefore suspect that laboratory rabbits kept in isolation in standard laboratory cages will 'suffer' (be bored, depressed, frustrated, etc.)." Or, "wild mice will flee and attempt to hide when faced with a predator: hence keeping laboratory mice in clear plastic cages, with no places to hide, next to a group of ferrets will cause the mice to be fearful and distressed." We must then attempt to evaluate such hypotheses by gathering objec- tive scientific knowledge about the animals. The major problem here, however, is that there are no absolute standards of well-being against which 15</page><page sequence="16">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 we can judge whether or not partic- ular animals are "suffering." Our evaluation must ultimately rest on objective comparisons between animals maintained in different kinds of husbandry systems as well as between laboratory animals and their counter- parts in the wild. Such comparisons could include physical condition and appearance, growth, normal behav- ior, and reproduction. Even then, their validity might turn on the importance of "domestication" in some laboratory animal species. Over many generations of artificial selec- tion for characteristics best-suited to life in the laboratory, it is possible that some laboratory species have come to have different "needs" (e.g., for space, for social interaction, places to hide, etc.) than their wild counterparts. In our objective scientific evalua- tion, we might, for example, compare the animals' health, growth, behavior patterns, and physiology (particularly those aspects relevant to the stress response-e.g., pituitary hormone levels, adrenalin levels, heart rate, and so on) in the different husbandry systems.2 For rabbits, a salient comparison might be between ani- mals housed in standard cages and animals housed in groups on the floor; for mice, of animals housed with and without places to hide, with and without ferrets in close proximity. A further means of evaluating our anthropomorphic hypotheses would be to allow the animals to choose for themselves which husbandry regime they prefer and how much "work" (pecking or pushing keys, opening weighted doors, etc.) they are willing to do to attain their preferred envi- ronment.13 In this way it may be possible to rank the suitability of cage types, food, and other factors by quantifying the amount of work carried out. Since there are no absolute stand- ards, or even true controls, for this evaluation of suffering in animal husbandry, it is important to make a wide range of measurements. Criticism of our empathic concern must be based on as broad a picture as possible of the animal's response to various husbandry conditions. When an animal's response does not square with an anthropomorphic prediction, the information acquired can be added to our biological knowledge of that animal. Evaluation of Scientific Procedures The use of CA to evaluate animal suffering caused by scientific proce- dures may be more straightforward since we do have "standards" against which to judge the validity of our hypotheses-the "norms" for that individual animal before the procedure was carried out and also control animals. In daily laboratory practice the key to successful evaluation of animal suffering lies in the maxim "know your animal." In addition to objective, scientific knowledge of the biology of a particular species and strain of animal, those responsible for evaluat- ing and attempting to alleviate suf- fering must also have a thorough knowledge of the behavior of the particular animal. This knowledge may be acquired through regular observation and handling. Although individuality is less distinct in inbred animals (rats and mice) than in the larger laboratory species that tend to be outbred (e.g. dogs, rabbits, cats), individually distinct behavior patterns can still be identified. With knowledge of the "norms" of behavior, and perhaps physiology, of the individual animal, it is then possible to look for deviations from these norms following a scientific procedure.25 Such deviations might include: * Changes in appearance of the animal, e.g., a change in the appear- ance of the coat (indicating a failure to groom) or a change in the animal's posture. * Reduced food and fluid intake, resulting in reduced feces and urine output and often a decrease in body weight. * A change in behavior, e.g., a reluctance to be handled or aggres- sion on being handled or the appear- ance of abnormal or unusual behav- ior (such as withdrawal, self- mutilation, or stereotypical behavior). * Physiological changes, e.g., altered heart-rate, changes in breath- ing pattern, dilation of pupils, a change in body temperature. * A change in the animal's "pro- voked behavior," e.g., a lack of inquisitiveness or the development of tenderness over a particular region in response to gentle pressure. CA is relevant here both in using human experience to judge which scientific procedures are likely to cause animal suffering and also in evaluating the significance of any deviations from the norm for that animal following performance of a procedure. This latter step in partic- ular will help us decide on appropri- ate means of avoiding or alleviating that animal's suffering. Again, we might say that we are trying to "empathize" with the animal: We can see that the animal has changed in some way following a particular scientific procedure and we then ask ourselves "how would I feel in that situation?" If the answer is, say, "in pain," then we would probably choose to administer analgesics to the animal to try to alleviate its suffering, and so reverse the observed changes. If the animal is "anxious" or "fearful" we might choose to give it anxiolytic drugs such as one of the benzodi- azepines. (Indeed, the reversion to normal after the administration of such drugs provides good evidence that the animal may have been in pain or fearful.) We might also try to find ways of refining the original procedure, consistent with attaining scientific objectives so that, in future studies, the procedure will cause less animal suffering. In this context it is important to monitor very carefully the first few animals subjected to a new procedure so that a short list of likely adverse effects and their signs can be drawn up and studied in depth.2 This approach in turn can be used to train personnel working on that particular research project, and/or to refine a particular protocol. A useful approach, developed for primates but of general applicability, is the framework developed to eval- uate psychological well-being by Novak and Suomi.26 They used four general measures: 1) good physical health, 2) performance of adequate species typical behavioral repertoires, 3) physiological evidence of distress (rather than stress itself, which may be beneficial), and 4) the competence of the animal in adapting and responding effectively to changes in 16</page><page sequence="17">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 the social and non-social environ- ment. Novak and Suomi claim that if the animal conforms to some agreed upon objective level on any two of these four measures, then it is in an adequate condition psycho- logically and behaviorally. A problem with this recommendation is that each of the four measures has tradeoffs. Providing an animal with social companions, for example, also increases the chance of physical injury and chronic social distress. But this approach nevertheless has merit and should be explored and tested in various groups. Wild Animals Our discussion thus far has dealt primarily with animals studied or reared in captivity. However, much research today involves animals in the field. Such research may be directed at obtaining greater under- standing of ecosystems, social organ- ization, predator-prey relationships, disease transmission, and other general areas of basic biological knowledge. However, applied work is also being done with the aim of aiding conservation of endangered species, reducing the negative impact of feral introduced species (be they burros in the Grand Canyon or medflies in Southern California), or eliminating entire species considered "bad" for humans, such as the tsetse fly in large sections of Africa that bar introduc- tion of domesticated species. The issues raised by field research, includ- ing research goals, species selection, population characteristics, habitat characteristics, site selection, observa- tional methods, capture methods, kinds of interventions and manipu- lations, and overall long-term effects on animal individuals, populations, and ecosystems, are far-ranging and many, but cannot be pursued in detail here. Even though research in the field eliminates husbandry and mainte- nance issues, we now face issues that lie beyond the suffering of individual animals, and we must weigh the benefits of gaining certain kinds of knowledge against the entire range of consequences of research efforts. Seemingly innocuous scientific proce- dures may have negative effects on We now face issues that lie beyond the suffering of individual anim- als, and we must weight the benefits of gaining certain kinds of knowledge against the entire range of consequences of research efforts. Seemingly innocuous scientific procedures may have negative effects on the target species as well as the ecosystem. In short, field research forces us to face directly the fact that humans are but a part of a complex system that needs many flourishing organisms if any are to survive. the target species as well as the ecosystem. In short, field research forces us to face directly the fact that humans are but a part of a complex system that needs many flourishing organisms if any are to survive. A particularly instructive controversy is the use of endangered chimpanzees in AIDS research. Would it be legit- imate to threaten their extinction for human ends? But the issue is far more pervasive than such dramatic conflicts suggest. For example, merely capturing wild animals to measure their growth may involve distress not only in capture, but also in any confinement imposed-including an inevitably closer relationship with a strange and perhaps mistrusted human species. The capture and release of wild animals and the performance of scientific procedures likely to cause those animals adverse effects are carefully regulated in the United Kingdom. A license of competence is required to perform scientific procedures on an animal and, before any animal is released back into the wild, an additional certificate of fitness from a veterinarian (or other qualified expert signing on behalf of a veterinarian) is required. This applies to all vertebrate animals-- including fish! Whatever their merits, such regulations are based on little empirical data and could actually increase animal suffering and poor health, as for example, in holding animals until a veterinarian can travel to the field site where the animal has been captured and maintained. On the other hand, premature release of animals after, for example, anesthe- sia, or excessive blood removal or loss, could also be detrimental. In field research our need is to go beyond an ethic based on suffering (however defined) of an individual organism to one based on the welfare of ecosystems and community life, and the intrinsic value of natural patterns of all types. Just as an individual animal should be given the benefit of the doubt when we have some basis for thinking it may be suffering, so too should the benefit of the doubt be given to the pres- ervation of ecosystems, communities, and species; intrusions should only be carried out after careful evalution of consequences and alternatives. A Morally Relevant Animal Hierarchy? Critical anthropomorphism as- sumes there is a great deal in common between humans and animals. This is certainly true for mammals but is less so the further one moves away from human beings phylogenetically, as neurological organization and other aspects of physiology and behavior become less mammalian in character. It is obviously much more difficult to generate and test hypotheses about the subjective experience of animals with which we have less in common. Can we, for instance, empathize with amphibians, fish, honeybees, or even an octopus? Martin Wells, who studied the behavior of octopi for many years wrote that They watch you. They come to be fed and they will run away with every appearance of fear if you are beastly to 17</page><page sequence="18">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 them...it is all too easy to come to treat the animal as sort of aquatic dog or cat. Therein lies the danger....The octopus is an alien. It is a poikilotherm, never had a dependent childhood, has little or no social life. It may never know what it is to be hungry. Simply because it is evidently intelligent and possessed of eyes that look back at us, we should not fall into the trap of supposing that we can interpret its behavior in terms of concepts derived from birds or mammals."s In such cases it would seem the only way forward is to try our best to understand such animals by acquiring a thorough knowledge of their general biology and, when keeping such animals in the labora- tory, of the normal behavior of each individual. This knowledge will at least enable us to judge that some- thing is wrong when we find a deviation from the norm, even if we are unable to judge the meaning of that "something" in terms of animal suffering. Generalizations across animals within the same taxon can also be suspect The octopus and oyster are both mollusks, though Peter Singer uses the oyster somewhat arbitrarily to separate the suffering sentient from the nonsentient.0 This example indicates that attempts to form a moral hierarchy on taxonomic lines that clearly demarcate experiences of pain, distress, fear, foreknowledge (anticipation), and other psycholog- ical levels are fraught with difficulty. Indeed, Darwin's complex and accu- rate "tree" metaphor" is unappre- ciated in attempts to draw taxonomic lines to short circuit more thoughtful, but less bureaucratically applicable, approaches. At best, flexible guide- lines should be set that take into account many considerations suggest- ing the occurrence of "harm." Nonetheless, to help in resolving inevitable conflicts, we tentatively propose some guides for a framework that bypasses a simplistic hierarchy approach by invoking a concept of "complexity" that recognizes several levels of interrelated systems.14 1. Physiological and nervous system complexity is important (we are not debating biting into a live radish), but so is behavioral complexity. Trying to draw a line between mentally com- plex behavior and that which is merely instinctive is a hopeless task, especially among vertebrates. We shall use "organic complexity" to refer to both nervous system and behavioral complexity. 2. Evaluation of organic complexity should be based on scientific knowl- edge or data-based inference, not crude anthropomorphic attributions of cognition and sentience or loose syllogistic reasoning. On the other hand, animals should be considered living subjects and not objects or complex machines.233 3. Rare and endangered species should be subjected to less harm than common or domesticated species of equal or greater organic complexity. 4. Social and community complex- ity should be given equal consider- ation with individual organic complexity. 5. Informed, not merely well- intentioned, attempts to reduce harm to individuals, populations, and communities are ethical imperatives. What is considered morally accept- able may vary with phylogenetic position, rarity, and other consider- ations, but use of any unitary cutoff (e.g., all primates should be valued over all rodents under all conditions) should be avoided. 6. At this point in time, how much we should rank pet species or indi- viduals over nonpets, friendly species over vicious ones, attractive over ugly animals, and so forth, is philosophi- cally and ethically uncertain. 7. Any claim that acknowledged that rare, highly complex, or ecologically valuable species should be sacrificed in the pursuit of possible short-range benefits to human beings should be treated with extreme caution and skepticism. Such a claim is analogous to proposals to destroy or endanger vulnerable habitats for the sake of human benefit (e.g., oil exploitation in Alaskan wilderness is necessary for U.S. survival). These kinds of argu- ments should be recognized as ethical "canaries" that alert us to self-serving, emotional, and short-sighted "bene- fits," while ignoring ethically less destructive and scientifically more defensible alternatives. 8. Species and communities should only be used insofar as the use does not threaten their existence. Thus the last chimpanzees in the world should not be used for any research purpose solely for a human health benefit that does not threaten a substantial percentage of the human species. Among other reasons, such use will permanently preclude later use for an even more threatening disease. As individuals, we all have our own self-interests, including allegiances to our family, local community, nation, and world. We must recognize that what is best for us as individuals, families, or citizens is not necessarily the same and may come into conflict. However adequate the preceding guidelines, we need to develop a consensus and a framework that will help adjudicate conflicting claims at different levels."44 Insofar as we develop specific guidelines from the framework, we must keep open the possibility of future scientific ad- vances that will make the guidelines suspect. For example, equating psy- chological well-being in primates with cage size is not valid given our present knowledge. There is a need to sensitize animal use committees and officials, not to provide them with concrete items to put on site visit checklists. The Moral Dimension A sensitive and informed attitude, along with scientific knowledge, are the basic elements of improved animal care and treatment in all areas including agriculture, recreation, conservation, and research. Critical anthropomorphism and ecological awareness are fundamental to the sensitive attitude we call for, although the role of each will vary with the relative focus on individual or eco- logical concerns. And although conflicts between concerns for indi- viduals, populations, and ecosystems are inevitable, they may prove valu- able in moving discussions forward. In any event, it is important that animal research in its entirety be addressed, not just that involving common purpose-bred domesticated species. The use of wild animals such as primates in biomedical research insures that more holistic ecological concerns cannot be evaded. Critical anthropomorphism should be especially valuable in improving our understanding of the effects of 18</page><page sequence="19">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 Section IV, Ethical Review and the Animal Care and Use Committee husbandry and scientific procedures on laboratory animals. In ethical terms, this improved understanding can have three distinct advantages: First, CA may help us to reduce the "costs" of experiments on animals with respect to both individual animal suffering and the numbers of animals used. Developed skills in CA, with its demand to integrate knowledge of the animals' biology, ethology, and psy- chology will inevitably lead to refined scientific procedures and improved conditions of husbandry, given the goal of less animal suffering. By reducing the variable and often unwanted "side effects" of experi- ments, we might also reduce the numbers of animals required to obtain a statistically significant result. Second, CA can help to improve the science in which laboratory animals are used. If scientists have a clearer understanding of the effects on the animals of their experimental regi- mens, they may be able both to improve the design of their experi- ments and also interpret their results more accurately. Third, CA should psychologically help many workers from technicians to principal inves- tigators in research laboratories to deal more openly and honestly with their own ambivalent feelings about causing harm, suffering, and death to animals.2 This would improve the morale of research workers as well as the care of the animals. Finally, consideration of the eco- logical context and implications of animal research is particularly crucial for field workers and those studying captive species imperiled in the wild. In fact, consideration of the ecolog- ical context from which any species evolved is important for all captive animal research.-David B. Morton, Gordon M. Burghardt, and Jane A. Smith T he use of animals in research, teaching, and testing in America began to grow in the late 1800s. In response, animal welfare groups began to protest such use and promoted legislation to restrict or stop what they perceived to be cruel and unnecessary animal experimenta- tion. To fight such legislation, some scientists established committees that were the precursors of today's animal care and use committees. The Animal Care Committee: 1900-1965 For example, in 1907 a committee was established at Harvard University, composed almost entirely of scientists engaged in animal experiments, to deal with faculty complaints concern- ing the scarcity of experimental animals (a problem that persisted for the next forty years). However, the committee also had authority to stop any experiment believed to be improper or unnecessary. One of its members, Percy Dawson, wrote: It is probable that although animals are well-treated in the operating room, their quarters are often mis- erable and the care of animals before they reach the operating table much worse than they should be. These facts suggest to me that there should be instituted some form of control of mammalian vivisection. Out of this concern arose sug- gested guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals at Harvard. Similar guidelines for laboratory animal treatment were issued in 1929 by the American Association for Medical Progress, and these were also adopted by the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in his "Rules Regarding Animals." The basic rules were as follows: * Vagrant dogs and cats should be held in the care facility for as long as they would be at the city pound and returned to the owners if claimed. * Animals should receive every consideration for bodily comfort. * Surgical procedures could only be conducted if they were sanctioned by the laboratory director. * In a procedure that caused dis- comfort, the animals should be rendered incapable of feeling pain (any exception to this rule would be made by the director alone). * At the end of the experiment, an animal should be killed painlessly, except when continuance of life was necessary. After the Second World War, committees of researchers faced a new set of issues. A first concern was the allocation of limited space avail- able for animal experimentation, exacerbated by the influx of money in the 1950s and 1960s for animal research without a corresponding expansion of new facilities. Researchers were also faced with renewed threats by the antivivisection movement, spearheaded by William Randolph Hearst, who ordered the editors of his newspaper empire to support the movement. The medical research establishment mobilized to counter the threat, and directors of laboratory animal programs and existing animal care committees became deeply involved in the controversy. A third concern arose among the relatively small group of veterinarians responsible for animal care at research institutions over the lack of knowledge regarding animal disease and care. Investigators tended to see 19</page><page sequence="20">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 veterinarians as interfering in research, rather than as experts whose advice could be helpful, and researchers objected to expenditures on disease control. If an animal became diseased, it was cheap to purchase another. Animal Care Committees became a means of adjudicating the conflicting claims of researchers and veterinarians. Committees also remained involved in animal procurement In the 1930s and 1940s there were only five commercial animal breeders in the U.S. and procurement of even moderate quality laboratory animal stocks was difficult For example, a major technical difficulty that Eli Lilly had to overcome when starting insulin production was the procure- ment of sufficient numbers of rabbits to standardize each batch of insulin. In response to this problem, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) was established in 1952 under the auspices of the National Research Council to oversee laboratory animal supply and quality. A significant ILAR contribution was the production of guidelines, commis- sioned by the NIH, on laboratory animal facilities, space, equipment, and personnel. The first edition appeared in 1963 as The Guide for Laboratory Animal Facilities and Care and has since undergone five revi- sions. It has become a standard reference for laboratory animal personnel and institutional committees. Institutional and Policy Developments In March of 1964, a report on laboratory animal facilities and care was published by ILAR, which stated that, as of 1961, 61 percent of insti- tutions surveyed had centralized animal facilities, but only 30 percent of the animal facilities had profes- sional supervision. In 1968, following passage of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (LAWA, 1966), the status of research facilities was again sur- veyed. Centralized animal care facil- ities were now operated by 54 percent of the institutions and a person was designated as the director of labora- tory animal care by 58 percent of organizations reporting. Forty per- cent of all institutions and about 90 percent of the medical schools reported they had Animal Care Committees. Committee roles varied: Three-quarters were involved in an advisory capacity to the laboratory animal program facility, 61 percent allocated space, 42 percent reviewed experimental protocols (though it is not clear what type of protocol review the committees were performing), and 37 percent reviewed animal housing space. In 1970, the LAWA became the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and was extended to cover not only the acquisition of animals, but also their care and husbandry in laboratories. Laboratories had to follow minimum standards set by the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture. The AWA mentioned the provision of veteri- nary care and "appropriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, and tranquiliz- ing drugs" for lab animals. Although birds, mice, and rats made up the majority of experimental animals, the Secretary chose not to develop reg- ulations for them under the AWA. In addition, the LAWA had contained a broad exclusion for research, and several research facilities had argued successfully that, since animals were in "experimentation" from the moment they arrived at the institu- tion, they were not covered by the Act In 1970, Congress rescinded the total exclusion of research overview and exempted from the Act only the design, outlines, guidelines, or per- formance of actual research. In sum, the AWA ensured that the researcher still held the key to the laboratory door, but that door was now intended to have a window in it The most recent national survey of laboratory animal facilities was undertaken in 1978. Of 1,695 facil- ities, 82 percent stated that they were in compliance with Public Health Service guidelines. Three-quarters of the non-profit research institutions now said that they had a person designated as the director for labo- ratory animal care."' The Contemporary IACUC Because of dissatisfaction in the 1980s with monitoring practices on animal use and experimentation, attention was given to adapting the existing Animal Care Committee structure to strike an appropriate balance between federal intervention and self-regulation. For despite some claims that committees were active in the 1960s and 1970s, the evidence indicates the opposite. Though the 1970 amendments to the AWA were meant to stimulate more institutions to form committees, the 1978 ILAR survey found that only 37 percent had their own IACUCs, the same propor- tion as in 1968. And NIH site visits to ten institutions in 1984 found that a significant number of committees existed in name only. Nevertheless, proposed legislation in Congress in 1981 promoted the idea of protocol review by a local institutional com- mittee, and some institutions began to upgrade or reactivate their committees. The Animal Ethics Review Com- mittee established at the University of Southern California (USC) came to be regarded as a model program. The committee consisted of a bioethicist, a humanist, a surgeon, a veterinarian, a lawyer, a biomedical scientist, an historian, and a lay member. All projects were subject to review by the committee, although approval was initially given by the director of the laboratory animal program. The committee used the relatively specific Canadian guidelines on animal care and use in its review process and expected investigators to make an informed assessment of the degree of pain (and its duration) likely to be caused by the research techniques and to justify the need for research that caused pain and distress.8 Spe- cific questions were raised in regard to such procedures as prey killing, fighting, and burn and freeze injuries, while use of muscle relaxants without anesthesia during surgery was deemed unacceptable. A wave of change has since swept through animal research institutions in America. Universities, research institutes, and commercial concerns have established institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) to review not only standards of animal care and husbandry but also to rule on the appropriateness of new project proposals, that is, the use of animals. Several factors led to these changes. 20</page><page sequence="21">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 Resources on IACUCs and Alternatives to Animal Use American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS), 70 Timber Creek, Suite 5, Cordova, TN 38018; (901-754-8620) Animal Welfare Information Center (AWIC), National Agricultural Library, Room 301, Beltsville, MD 20705; (301-344-3212) The Animal Welfare Institute, PO.

In addition, the NIH revised its animal care assurance guidelines in 1985. Under the new rules, IACUCs were for the first time required by legis- lation to review proposed research projects involving the use of animals. Finally, increased public concern about laboratory animal use and abuse forced prudent research insti- tutions to direct more time and resources to animal care and use. The current IACUC model reflects what John Braithwaite, an Australian sociologist, has called enforced self- regulation, as opposed to voluntary self-regulation and government reg- ulation. Under the strategy of enforced self-regulation, each institu- tion is responsible for drafting its own detailed rules and regulations, tai- lored to the particular needs and objectives of the institution, that meet the relatively broad guidelines for animal care and use established by the government. An institution's program is then approved by the overseeing regulatory agency. Citi- zens groups and other interested parties should be able to participate in the process to enhance overall credibility. A major strength of enforced self- regulation is that it summons the legitimacy of both state and institu- tional power to entice compliance, while the alternative regulatory models rest on the legitimacy of state power or institutional power alone. Most of the enforcement costs and duties are borne by the individual institution. Each has an internal compliance group that oversees the program and reports to the govern- ment when rules are not followed. Participation in this decision-making process increases acceptance of laws and alleviates suspicions between an organization and the government. Eventually, those institutions with smooth and effective programs can serve as models for those who are still struggling. Roles and Functions of the IACUC The modern IACUC has been assigned the following roles by guide- lines and legislation: to oversee animal care and husbandry; to review and approve animal research protocols (both expedited and full review); to review and approve educational use of animals; to educate and train investigators and other personnel with regard to practical ethical issues and aspects of animal handling, anesthe- sia, analgesia, and euthanasia; and to act as a liaison with concerned members of the community. Animal care and husbandry. The oversight of animal care and hus- bandry is the purview of the institu- tional veterinarian or laboratory animal program director. In the past, this individual may or may not have had to report to the Animal Care Committee. The situation now is that the IACUC with a veterinarian mem- ber is charged with reviewing the animal care program. Appropriate care for laboratory animals is an ethical obligation, not only for the individuals who provide the actual care, but especially for the institutions that operate such programs. The importance of institutional support cannot be overestimated. Since institutions provide the facili- ties, environment, personnel, and funds for the care of the animals, ultimate responsibility for animal welfare rests with the institution. If the institutional animal care program is inadequate, laboratory animals may be subject to unnecessary pain or distress. And unhealthy and/or distressed animals introduce uncon- trolled variables into research and reduce the quality of the data and the science. Since acquisition of knowledge constitutes the major justification for the use of laboratory animals, it is usually unethical to use animals in research when these variables of care are not minimized. Institutional responsibilities for quality animal care can be met by supporting and fostering dedicated, knowledgeable, and interactive staff working in harmony with the admin- istration. Detailed policies and proce- dures will, of necessity, vary from one institution to another, but they are best delineated in writing and made available to all persons responsible for animal care and use. Basic minimum criteria of care are set out in the Public Health Service policy, in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and in AWA regulations on Adequate Veterinary Care. Arguably, institutions should aim higher than these minimum recommendations and should, at the very least, conform to the standard set by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAAIAC). Regardless of the administrative structure estab- lished for animal care, the specific responsibility and authority of each person involved in animal care and 21</page><page sequence="22">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 use should be unambiguously spec- ified and made widely known. Protocol review. The second and third roles of the IACUC are to review and approve research, testing, and education proposals involving ani- mals before they are initiated. A number of issues require ethical review, but the one that confronts IACUCs most directly is the problem of analyzing the ethical costs of a research project versus its proposed benefits. As discussed in preceding sections, the ethical costs are assessed mainly through animal suffering and the loss of animal life. These costs are also immediate. The benefits identified include gains in human knowledge and the extent to which those gains may lead to improve- ments in the quality of human and/ or animal life. The benefits are usually not immediate but are likely to be received in the more or less distant future and are much more difficult to assess. The principles by which IACUCs might begin to compare these costs and benefits are set out in Section II. But such principles should account for and support the following claims. Human beings are ethically justified in using animals in research to generate knowledge, to educate health professionals, or to promote human and animal health, but only under the following circumstances: where the knowledge to be gained is potentially substantive and/or has the potential for protecting health or advancing health care; where suffer- ing is kept to the minimum consistent with good science and the needs of the research; where there is no alternative (namely, a technique that does not involve the death or suffer- ing of an animal); where research involving moderate to severe suffer- ing in vertebrates is permitted only after careful ethical and scientific review; and where research involving intense suffering in vertebrates, or the use of self-aware vertebrates is, if permitted at all, only allowed to proceed under the most stringent controls. In addition, investigators have strong obligations to minimize not only aversive stimulation of all types, but also distress caused by pain, anxiety, and fear, too little or too much stimulation, loss of control over the immediate environment, disease states, and general discomfort. Stronger justification for animal use in research is necessary for animals that possess the more morally signif- icant natural capacities and charac- teristics. Finally, the more distress the animal is likely to experience, the stronger the justification needed before the research may be approved. Education. According to the reg- ulations promulgated under the 1985 AWA amendments, each institution must establish a training program for its investigators and animal care staff. The program should, at a minimum, consist of instruction in several areas-the humane methods of animal maintenance and experimen- tation including the basic needs of each species of animal, proper handling and care of the various species of animals maintained at the facility, proper pre- and post- procedural care of the animals, and aseptic surgical methods and proce- dures; the concept, availability, and use of research or testing methods that limit the use of animals or minimize animal distress; proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tran- quilizers; methods whereby deficien- cies in animal care and treatment are reported; and utilization of services (e.g., National Agricultural Library, National Library of Medicine) avail- able to provide information on appropriate methods of animal care and use, alternatives to the use of live animals in research, prior animal experimentation to avoid unneces- sary duplication, and the intent and requirements of the AWA. The reg- ulations also require the research facility (in practice either the veteri- narian or the IACUC) to review at least annually the training and qualifications of all the researchers who use animals and to identify those who need additional training and provide such training. To date, this activity has been addressed by only a few IACUCs. Community liaison. The AWA regulations do not specifically require community outreach by the IACUC, but at least one member of the IACUC must be an institutionally non- affiliated member, who is charged with providing "representation for general community interests in the proper care and treatment of ani- mals." This presents a significant opportunity for establishing impor- tant contacts between the scientific and wider local communities to foster a greater understanding of scientific research and what constitutes an ethical use of animals. IACUC Administration While a few aspects of the IACUC administrative structure are specified in regulations and policy guidelines, most details are left to the institution to delineate. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for research with humans are often used as a model since they have been functioning for fifteen years (as opposed to the four to five years of most IACUCs) and have had to confront most of the troubling administrative structure questions. We here discuss adminis- tration and structural issues insofar as they bear directly on IACUCs' ethical mandates. Authority structure. PHS guide- lines and AWA regulations specify that the committee must be appointed by the chief executive officer of the institution. Whether or not IACUCs report directly to the CEO (from which they derive their authority) is unlikely to have a major impact on the IACUC's ability to reject research proposals, require modifications of protocols, or otherwise command investigator attention. Funding agen- cies have made a clear statement that infractions of regulations will not be tolerated. The relationship of the IACUC to the institutional laboratory animal program raises particular issues. The IACUC usually receives administra- tive support from either the institu- tion's research office or from the laboratory animal program. Appar- ently many IACUCs are run under the auspices of Departments of Laboratory Animal Medicine. Many infractions of animal use and care will involve the personnel of the laboratory animal program. If these same personnel are charged with providing administrative support for IACUC investigations of infractions and preparing meeting minutes and reports, the possibility of a conflict 22</page><page sequence="23">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 of interest is obvious. Membership. IACUCs need a range of university disciplines and skills. At a minimum, an IACUC should include research scientists who use animals, those who do not, a veterinarian, and non-scientists. It has also been suggested that commit- tees should include persons with legal and philosophic training, a statisti- cian, and administrators who under- stand the financial constraints of the institution and the varied programs within a large, complex organization. Laboratory technicians and grad- uate students can be particularly valuable to an IACUC. They probably are more aware of what actually happens in the research laboratory and the animal facilities than anyone else in the institution. Technicians, for instance, supervise the actual conduct of the animal experiments, and they may have more direct experience with animal handling and with the technical difficulties of a procedure than the principle investigator. More significant even than the actual skills represented on the committee is the need to develop a collegial, non-confrontational approach to ethical review. There will be arguments and disagreements, but these disputes need to be settled constructively. IACUCs must learn to interact effectively with the investiga- tors. If the IACUC is viewed solely as an intrusive Big Brother, its ability to change investigator behavior and attitudes is compromised. Another important issue is the appropriate balance of animal researchers, other scientists, and non- scientists on the IACUC. Critics of IACUCs argue that most members are drawn from the institution and that many have an ongoing interest in conducting animal research. Yet experienced research scientists are often those who have the most to offer in suggesting modifications to a proposal, although challenges to some of the fundamental premises of animal use are more likely to come from outside the research enterprise. A cross section of individuals serving on an animal care committee offers a symbiotic relationship between the scientific community and the public. It forces scientists to justify their work to the public. In return, the lay committee members develop a deeper and more complete under- standing of the research process and can help explain both the institu- tional commitment to effective ani- mal care as well as the justifications for any research that is challenged. It is also possible that the lay members could be critical of a particular research project, which underscores the importance of eliciting a very frank and open exchange of views on the IACUC when proposals are first reviewed. Decision-making procedure. The rules of decisionmaking have a decided effect on ethical review. If every decision has to be approved unanimously, individual members (including the outside member) will have the power of veto. A simple majority vote, however, could effec- tively isolate a member with a differ- ent point of view. In general, it appears as though most committees operate on a majority vote procedure, aiming for consensus. In these circumstances, it is vital that minority opinions and written minority reports be welcomed and documented as required by PHS policy. Enforcement. An advantage of the IACUC structure is that the committee members are likely to have, either individually or collectively, knowl- edge of the investigators applying for approval and understanding of their research. Thus the IACUC can take into account known eccentricities and foibles and can, relatively easily, ask the investigator to appear in person to justify a particular proposal. However, familiarity is two-sided. One is likely to be reluctant to administer a severe penalty to an individual who works just down the hall and whom one meets every day. A committee decision provides some anonymity, but perhaps not enough. The IACUC model implies that consultation and collegiality are the preferred approaches, and that severe penalties (rejecting a research proposal out- right, preventing an investigator from using animals) are only likely where individuals have been totally intran- sigent or have been found to be deliberately deceiving the IACUC. IACUCs should become more effective and have greater impact on their respective institutional animal research programs in the next decade. Already however, the power and scope of some IACUCs have gone beyond just attempting to minimize the pain or distress of laboratory animals. Different committees have severally assessed the qualifications of the scientists, students, and technical staff involved in the research; the rele- vance of the project; the appropriate- ness of a specified animal model; the number of animals used; the appro- priateness of proposed techniques; and the availability of suitable facilities for housing and post-operative care. However, committee review varies from one institution to another and a basic "model" system has not been developed. In addition, several con- troversial issues have emerged in the past few years that IACUCs must confront. Controversies Facing IACUCs Scientific merit. As suggested in Section II, certain scientists have argued that the IACUC should not be conducting peer review of any proposals. Even when projects are funded by intramural sources, they argue that the scientific review should be undertaken by separate commit- tees and not by the IACUC. In general, they claim that the IACUC does not contain the necessary scientific expertise to perform true merit review of proposed animal research projects. As a result some IACUCs avoid any questions that impinge upon research design, such as asking if the numbers of animals used are appropriate, or inquiring what alternatives have been consid- ered by the investigator. Other IACUCs appear to be much more involved in the scientific review of project protocols. They argue that it is almost impossible to evaluate properly any of the protocols that come before the IACUC without using some degree of evaluation of scientific merit. Thus, while an IACUC might not have the skills to evaluate adequately the science of a proposal, it is required to question its scientific design. If an IACUC takes its charge to eliminate unnecessary animal distress seriously, it must be able to recommend modifications to 23</page><page sequence="24">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 methodology aimed at reducing the costs to the experimental subjects. Non-affiliated member(s) and the critical public. Only 26 percent of all Animal Care Committees had a non- affiliated member as of 1985. The new AWA regulations informed by PHS policy have mandated participation by an outside member who cannot have a vested interest in the institu- tion, though this person is not required to be an animal advocate. In practice, institutions vary consid- erably on their selection of an unaffiliated member. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, where there are thir- teen IACUCs, selection of the non- affiliated member was based mostly on personal contacts, and the key requirement seemed to be that the unaffiliated person merely be a member of the community. No non- affiliated member had any connec- tion with an animal protection organ- ization and most had little or no knowledge of the research process. Institutions might use the mecha- nism of the non-affiliated member to build bridges between itself and at least some segments of the critical public. A key feature of the public debate over animal research is the virtual absence of meaningful dia- logue and the extreme distrust between researchers and animal activists. Given the level of distrust, activists are very suspicious of claims that research is more humane and caring. As a result, they have not been privy to the changes driven by the development of IACUC review. The unaffiliated member can help research institutions to become more open and accountable to the public, including the more critical public. The public at large has mixed perceptions about the various uses of animals in the laboratory, the effec- tiveness of current regulations, and the ability or desire of researchers to follow these federal guidelines. About 75 percent of the public agree that animals need to be used in research; however, a majority have questions about the treatment of the animals. Institutions should be concentrating their attention on public education and making use of the non-affiliated member to help reinforce claims that the institution is concerned about animal treatment Those institutions that have delib- erately sought out animal activists to sit on their IACUCs (e.g., USC, UC Berkeley) report both positive and negative experiences. Yet most insti- tutions are leery of bringing an animal activist onto the IACUC, and there is fear of the possibly destructive influence of having someone who will enter a minority report disagree- ing with every proposal using ani- mals. The current suspicion of animal protection members of IACUCs is a function of the distrust and lack of meaningful dialogue between the research community and the animal protection movement. The IACUC could be an important tool for changing this state of affairs. An animal advocate as a member of the IACUC. On human IRBs, it is common to appoint a specific advocate to represent the interests of a non-competent individual or group of individuals (e.g., children or the mentally impaired). Since animals are also non-competent, should not the IACUC similarly charge a specific individual on the committee with the responsibility of being the animals' advocate? If so, who should this be? While, at first glance, the non- affiliated member would seem the best person to fill this role, if one seeks an individual who understands research and who has a good knowl- edge of behavior, then the veterinar- ian would be a far better choice. The laboratory animal veterinarian is in a difficult role in the institution and on the IACUC. She is required by her professional oath to minimize animal suffering, but also required to serve the interests of a research enterprise that often results, unavoid- ably, in animal suffering. By appoint- ing the veterinarian as the animal advocate, IACUCs at least provide the animals with an advocate who is very well trained to represent the animals' interests in not being subjected to suffering. Such a responsibility should become a formal part of the job description and be clearly set out in institutional documents establish- ing the IACUC. Finding Common Ground A variety of fundamental issues affecting IACUC functions lack any detailed consensus; however, IACUCs need to move forward in gaining at least a rough consensus on, for example, the moral status of animals and animal pain and suffer- ing. An effective approach might be to establish a broadly respected group with the task of developing detailed and practical consensus statements on the moral status of animals, as well as on more specific topics such as "appropriate" post-operative care of animals; "adequate" use of analges- ics, anesthetics, or tranquilizers; prolonged restraint; and antibody generating protocols. Further, to achieve consistent and fair interpre- tations of guidelines, a national mechanism needs to exist to allow for an exchange of information among the committees. A national group, like the Animal Procedures Committee in England, or the Canadian Council on Animal Care, also would provide a vehicle to allow both sides in the debate (researchers and animal activists) to air their differences and, perhaps, find common ground. The IACUC is a very new structure at most institutions, and administra- tors are still feeling their way toward the development of an effective committee that meets both its ethical obligations and the standards of the Public Health Service and the amended Animal Welfare Act. For example, most institutions will have to make at least some changes to their protocol review forms in the wake of the new AWA regulations. Hopefully, continuing analysis of the structure and ethical mandates of IACUCs will disclose adequate conceptions and procedures for serving the needs and interests of animals, scientific researchers, and the concerned public alike. -Andrew N.

Policy Issues in the Use of Animals in Research, Testing, and Education Public policy about the use of animals in research in the United States acknowledges that animal experimentation is a needed part of science and that it must be conducted in accord with certain humane standards. National policies require registration and inspection of facilities, compliance with specified husbandry standards, and efforts to minimize animal pain, among other provisions. However, inadequate attention is given in existing policy to the ethical justification of research protocols involving animals, including standards to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable animal experiments. The degree of public concern over questionable or unjustified experiments suggests that public policy should more thoroughly address attention to justification standards. Justifying an Animal Experiment Each animal experiment that involves pain, death, or holding captive a sentient creature poses the issue of justification. The harms to the animal conflict with perceived societal benefits that will result if the experiment is conducted. This con- flict can be resolved by seeking the best possible reconciliation of human needs with concern for the needs and well-being of all other animals. As discussed in Section II, decisions to approve or disapprove any indi- vidual experiment, a task of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) mandated by federal law, are often very difficult to make because of the need to take into account several different issues, some of which are schematically presented in Figure 2. Among the major criteria for assessing justification of an experiment are: 1) the purpose of the experiment (including its social merit); 2) the sentience level of the subject of study (including philosoph- ical consideration of the moral status of the animal, which is, roughly speaking, greater the higher up the phylogenetic scale one goes); 3) severity and duration of animal pain; 4) the competency of the experimen- ter; 5) the application of "alternatives" to improve the justification; 6) the quality of the facility and resources where the work is conducted (this to some extent reflects the excellence of the husbandry standards); and 7) the level of public accountability. Applying these criteria creates a complicated decision-tree. Each deci- sion must take into account the weight to be given each criterion and how the many intertwining and often conflicting factors are to be resolved. A decision to approve or disapprove a particular experiment ultimately depends on the decisionmaker's value judgments. Nor are these criteria all- encompassing. Several others could be added to cover matters such as the previous life history of a particular animal, a group of animals, or species; whether dogs or cats obtained from pounds, which have been prior household pets, should ever be used, or be used just for limited purposes such as acute exper- iments, or whether purpose-bred animals should be substituted; whether a non-human primate intended for experimentation is wild- caught or purpose-bred; whether the species as a whole is endangered (such as chimpanzees used some- times in research and testing); or whether the conditions under which primates and other species are housed fulfill the psychological needs and permit natural expression of the behavioral repertory of that species. In the following discussion, we will concentrate on three central crite- ria-the purpose of the experiment, animal pain, and applying alterna- tives-while others that are fairly self- evident are mentioned only where particularly relevant. The Different Goals of Research, Testing, and Education (Criterion 1) Biomedical research is undertaken for two broad purposes, to add to scientific understanding of basic biological functions, processes, and behavior (basic research), or to improve human or animal health by studying the natural history of dis- ease, its pathophysiology and preven- tion, and by developing diagnostic and therapeutic methods (applied research). These are important and worthy goals. Public attitudes are such that, compared with other uses of animals, the use of animals for research (both basic and applied) would be granted the greatest sanc- tion. Presumably, the public would tolerate a greater degree of animal pain for the purpose of research than for either testing or for education. Testing is conducted to assess the potency, effectiveness, or toxicity of substances of established or potential usefulness for medical, scientific, or commercial purposes. For instance, by law, new drugs are tested for efficacy and safety on several species of animals prior to conducting clinical trials on humans. In addition, tests on animals are conducted to establish safety levels for humans of known toxic substances (for instance, those that occur as human hazards in the chemical production industry or as environmental pollutants from toxic waste deposits). Justification for these tests is based on the reasonable assumptions that adverse effects caused by chemical substances in animals are usually the same as those encountered in humans, and that the dose causing toxicity in animals permits risk assessment for exposed humans. So long as one accepts some animal experimentation, there are sound reasons to support some 25</page><page sequence="26">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 Figure 2 Illustrative Sets of Criteria for Assessing Justification for Animal Experiments Classification of Competency of Purpose of experiment' sentience level Animal pain3 experimenter to gain original non-biological systems none -highly skilled persons knowledge e.g., computer simulation with years of training in (high social worth) science and humane -little or no sentience techniques e.g., protozoa and plants -less sentient invertebrates for product safety and e.g., worms, insects -invertebrate animal pain - post Ph.D. drug testing' -highly sentient invertebrates e.g., octopi -cold-blooded vertebrates - graduate level (fish, amphibians, reptiles) - some short-lasting vertebrate animal pain for professional training - warm-blooded - undergraduate level vertebrates (birds, mammals) - non-endangered primates and marine mammals elementary and significant but secondary school level, for other educational endangered primates and unavoidable vertebrate novices of all educational purposes2 _ marine mammals _animal pain4 _levels Alternative methods for Quality of facility and improving justification resources where work done Public accountability LEGEND The bars represent several crite- ria for assessing justification for application of three facilities subject to -facilities with federal animal experiments; competency "Rs" of refinement, federal oversight and oversight (USDA, PHS, or of experimenter, purpose of exper- iment, degree of animal pain, and replacement, and meaningful inspection for FDA) that is effectively sentience level of organism used. reduction humane concerns enforced Items placed at the top of the bar (USDA, PHS) indicate the situations where there is the greatest or most readily con- ceded justification.

Nevertheless, some animal tests, especially safety tests on cosmetics and household products such as oven cleaners, have been a primary target of public protests. Activists and critics have argued that some procedures are unnecessarily painful to the animals and should be eliminated, that alternative tests exist, and that, in any case, some of the products being tested are nonessen- tial or of trivial social worth. In education, animals are used to teach humane concepts at all levels of education, and also to instruct students of the biological sciences in biology, physiology, pharmacology, and surgery. Student biology projects are by their very nature repetitive, because their objective is to teach the student established facts about fun- damental biological principles; sim- ilarly, pedagogical repetition may be required in professional schools to teach certain skills like surgery. The purpose is not to make original contributions to knowledge. There is thus little significance in the actual experimental results obtained, in contrast to research and testing where the results are all-important. The social worth of advanced educational projects involving ani- mals is that a next generation of scientists are trained-a reasonable and socially valuable objective. How- ever, an increasingly large segment of the population is convinced that these objectives can be achieved without resorting to harming and killing animals.l' United States policy regarding use of animals has been largely devised with research in mind. Nevertheless, the policies usually state that they are applicable in research, testing, and education alike and distinctions between these situations are not addressed. For instance, the Public Health Service (PHS) policy (one of the two systems of national policy) includes important basic principles that specifically designate their appli- cability "in testing, research, and education."47 Similar phrases exist in the Animal Welfare Act, the federal law governing humane use of labo- ratory animals and the second system of national policy. Future revisions of national policy should specifically address the signif- icance of different contexts and goals, rather than, as at present, treating research, testing, and education as all equally justifiable and governed by the same rules. Gaps in the coverage of facilities. The net of national policy does not, however, fall equally on institutions involved in the three practices of research, testing, and education. In general, most research institutions are covered by some national policy, while testing facilities and educa- tional establishments often fall out- side both the PHS policy and the Animal Welfare Act. These gaps in coverage occur in the following manner. The PHS policy applies only to recipients of federal funds for animal experiments. Thus, many academic research insti- tutions are covered under the PHS policy but, on the whole, commercial facilities that conduct research, such as pharmaceutical companies, are not. PHS policy also does not apply to testing facilities because these are overwhelmingly commercial enter- prises that receive no PHS funds. The Animal Welfare Act requires registration and federal inspection of facilities where non-human primates, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and other warm-blooded animals except rats and mice are used for experimentation. The exclusion of rats and mice means that approx- imately 90 percent of laboratory animals are not protected by AWA, in contrast to PHS policy. The Act covers many research institutions, both academic and commercial, but a few are exempt because they use only excluded species. Moreover, the exclusion of rats and mice effectively exempts most testing and many educational facilities. Although certain regulations ("Good Laboratory Practices") do apply to the use of animals in testing, these are aimed at ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of the tests and do not address animal welfare directly. In the many testing facilities that use only rats and mice, there is no official mechanism for oversight of animal housing conditions, no provisions for personnel training, nor are the protocols subject to review by an IACUC. What good standards as do exist stem largely from in-house quality control established by the commercial company itself. The use of animals in education is barely touched by any effective oversight. The Animal Welfare Act specifically excludes elementary and secondary schools, and the PHS policy does not apply because the federal funds that do go to education are not from the PHS. Expanding coverage to rats and mice. It is an anomaly peculiar to the United States that rats and mice are excluded from the Animal Welfare Act. Correcting this would have important institutional repercussions by bringing additional facilities (especially testing and educational facilities) within the scope of the law and would tend to eliminate unsuit- able facilities (such as high school students' homes) that are currently used for painful animal experiments. The impact would be felt, in addition, at educational facilities such as community and other colleges that presently have no effective oversight. For the first time, they would be subject to federal inspection. Including rats and mice in AWA would have some impact on research institutions, but this would be mod- erated by two facts. Many research institutions currently fall under the jurisdiction of PHS policy that covers all vertebrate animals including rats and mice, and, moreover, some research institutions already volun- tarily include rats and mice in their institutional animal welfare policies. Even so, expanding the scope of federal law to include these some- times despised but highly sentient creatures would have important symbolic and practical effects. Animal Pain (Criterion 3) Revising federal policy to include a classification system of experimen- tal procedures according to the degree of animal pain would help address several problems. It would provide a scale forjudging ethical cost in cost/benefit assessments; it would provide a concept for development of policies governing the use of animals in education (see discussion below); and it would encourage acceptance of the idea that some procedures are totally unacceptable 27</page><page sequence="28">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 Figure 3 Categories of Biomedical Experiments Based on Increasing Ethical Concerns for Non-Human Species' Category A Category B Category C Category D Category E Vertebrate Animal either no living materials, or extreme and plants, bacteria, significant but intolerable pain in intolerable pain in protozoa, or little or no some discomfort unavoidable conscious invertebrate discomfort (short-lasting distress or animals; severe animal species pain) discomfort deprivation, trauma, mutilation 'Adapted from Table 1, Orlans, "Research Protocol for Animal Welfare." See reference 30. (even though there remains contro- versy over exactly which procedures these are). There is good reason, therefore, to adopt such a system. In practice, many IACUCs have found a classification of animal pain surpris- ingly easy to apply and of great use in facilitating protocol review. Classification schemes. The several scales currently in existence',27,290-s,42 all share a similar concept of de- noting increasing ethical cost with regard to the pain or suffering of the animal. A number of countries have already adopted such a policy, includ- ing the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, and New Zea- land. The five-point classification system (Figure 3) has been incorpo- rated into national policy both in Canada and New Zealand. This classification was also recommended as official policy in the United States in the USDA's proposed rules of 1987, (Federal Register, March 31, pages 10313-14) but was subsequently rejected. There is a good chance that a similar proposal will be made again in the future with more success. In addition to the advantages already mentioned, there are other benefits of having a classification system for animal pain included in national policy. Detailed discussion of these fall outside the scope of this section, but such benefits can be listed. Practical uses include sensitiz- ing investigators to how much animal pain is involved in any procedure by requiring them to classify their own experiments; indicating to the over- sight committee the depth of review needed (for instance, those proce- dures involving little or no pain could be given expedited review, whereas procedures falling in category D or E would be given stringent review); and providing a system for national data collection on animal experimen- tation to enhance public account- ability. In applying the "pain scale," it obviously matters which species of animal is the subject of the pain. There are, thus, important cross links between the severity and duration of pain (criteria 3, Figure 2) with the sentience level of the species (criteria 2). Non-human primates are afforded a special status in the hierarchy of animals inasmuch as they have the most complex and highly developed nervous systems, are most capable of experiencing pain and distress, and are genetically most similar to human beings. (Chimpanzees share 98 per- cent of their genetic material with man.) It follows that inflicting pain on non-human primates carries significant ethical cost. Unacceptable procedures. There are some particularly egregious procedures which, irrespective of the scientific merit of the experiments, ought to be judged unacceptable because of the intensity of animal pain, at or near tolerance level (see category E, Figure 3). A concept of some procedures being beyond ethical justification has become widely accepted in human experi- mentation, and is gaining adherents in animal experimentation. In the process of justifying an animal experiment, a sequence of decisions must be made. First, it is necessary to raise a threshold ques- tion of whether the procedure is unacceptable. Is it justified to put animals into condition x, which will result in pain y, irrespective of any benefits that might be anticipated? Thus, we can ask if it is ever justified to blow-torch pigs, regardless of how much we stand to learn about burns. Only when this threshold question has been raised and answered affir- matively, can we then proceed to the second question of whether this particular form of animal experiment can bejustified. The criteria described in Figure 2 are applied at this second stage. It seems reasonable that cut-off points for unacceptable procedures 28</page><page sequence="29">A Special Supplement, May/June 1990 would differ depending on whether the animals are used in research, testing, or education. For instance, junior students ostensibly should be restricted to categories A and B, while for more advanced college students the boundary should be category C. Most testing and research work can be conducted within categories A, B, and C; occasionally there may be justification for category D experi- ments. Even for research and testing, many hold that no category E exper- iment should be conducted. Certain testing procedures judged too trau- matic to sanction could be identified as falling within category E. Public policy inclusion of a general concept of "unjustified under any circumstan- ces" would go far in sensitizing scientists to the ethical limits of permissible animal experi- mentation. Application of Alternatives (Criterion 5) A brief explanation is necessary regarding "alternative methods for improving justification." "Alterna- tives" represents an attitude of mind. It means that, prior to starting any procedure, a meaningful search should be made to find ways to accomplish the same ends with less harming or killing of animals. As mentioned in Section II, three major approaches are used either severally or together. One is refinement of the procedure to reduce the amount of animal pain or distress. (The concept of refinement can be easily conveyed by reference to Figure 3. The objec- tive is always to shift toward a lower category, for example from D to C, or C to B, etc.). A second is reduction of the number of animals used, and a third is replacement of animal studies with non-animal systems. These three approaches have proved to be re- markably useful in fostering humane concepts and practice. Unfortunately, the concept of alternatives is sometimes distorted by the presentation of only one aspect (replacement) rather than all three. For instance, scientists who argue against replacement of animal exper- imentation (and cogent reasons can be given to support this view) may infer from these arguments that the concept of alternatives as a whole is flawed. However, their claims neglect the refinement and reduction options. Certain patterns can be seen in the application of alternatives in research, testing, and education. In research, the state of the art is such that refinements are the most readily available option. Indeed, effective IACUCs expend considerable effort in applying refinements. In testing, all three approaches are available for immediate application and already have had beneficial effects. There has been progress in stopping some animal tests conducted for trivial purposes, and some advance in substituting tissue culture and other alternative methods that considerably reduce the numbers of animals used. The greatest opportunities for application of alternatives in the use of animals exist in education. A strong case can be made for immediately eliminating certain experiments: for instance, those involving infliction of vertebrate animal pain by precollege students. Any detriment to education from this restraint is highly question- able. Indeed the prohibition would diminish the chance of developing an insensitive attitude toward harm- ing and killing. Other important opportunities exist at all levels of education to replace pain-inflicting vertebrate animal experiments either with those that cause no pain, or with projects using species with lower levels of sentience, such as inverte- brates, or protozoa. All this can be achieved while encouraging the study of living organisms in education, including observational studies of vertebrate animals. In a welcome and important move in 1989, the National Association of Biology Teachers announced official support of alternatives "to dissection and vivisection" and are currently preparing materials to help educate teachers on these matters. Practices and Problems in the Use of Animals in Education Historically, the use of animals in education has been the least con- trolled. No agreed-upon national standards exist, and, on the whole, policies governing the use of animals in education are poorly developed. A few voluntary guidelines exist, rang- ing from permissive to reasonably stringent, but there is no consensus, and no effective mechanism for enforcement. This field is wide open for reform. Until recently virtually all college student work involving animal pain or death has fallen outside the purview of any effective review for humaneness. New regulations of the Animal Welfare Act require student activities conducted at USDA- registered facilities to be reviewed by IACUCs. These regulations, pub- lished in the Federal Register on October 31, 1989, have broad impli- cations, because for the first time there is a mandate that student work be subject to oversight committee review. This heralds the start of long- overdue improvements in the use of animals in education. At the state legislative level, a handful of states have enacted leg- islation to control the abuse of animals in secondary school projects. The purpose of these state laws is to restrict untrained youth from inflict- ing pain and lingering death on vertebrate animals in the name of science. These laws have come about because of strong public protests against appalling experiments found in secondary school science compe- titions commonly called "science fairs," which are extracurricular projects where students compete for monetary prizes. Typical science fair projects of the 1960s and 1970s included crude attempts at animal surgery on monkeys, rabbits, and other animals, often conducted in the unsuitable conditions of the teen- agers' homes. Other projects have included the blinding of sparrows, which were then starved to death, and the administering of well-known toxic substances to pregnant animals to see how many dead or deformed babies were born. Such projects have won prizes, thus exacerbating the contin- uance of inhumane standards. As a result of the sparrow blinding project in 1969, the Westinghouse Science Talent Search immediately changed its rules for competition. Previously, the rules had permitted infliction of animal pain, but since 29</page><page sequence="30">Hastings Center Report, May/June 1990 then, projects other than observa- tional studies of vertebrate animals have been forbidden. Other compe- titions, however, have not followed suit. Yet by the schema of Figure 2, and to common ethical sense, teen- age biology projects involving pain or lingering death seem among the least justifiable of animal uses. Public protests have now moved decidedly beyond high school science competitions. Many students them- selves are refusing to participate in projects involving harming or killing animals. The protests run the gamut from young high school students who refuse to dissect frogs, to veterinary students who refuse to induce patho- logical conditions in healthy dogs and cats, to medical students who refuse to practice surgery on dogs and goats. Patterns of animal use in educa- tion. In the elementary school, live animals are brought into the class- room for the primary purpose of humane education, but they are pets and not laboratory animals. In secondary schools curricula, few live vertebrate animals are used in the classroom, but many dead frogs are used for dissection. Currently, some 75 percent of junior and senior high schools conduct frog dissections. In high school science competitions (as distinct from classroom projects) considerable animal experimenta- tion exists, some of which is highly invasive, falling under categories C, D, and E in Figure 3. At the college level in biology courses, some dissec- tions of dead animals and some projects involving live turtles, frogs, rats, mice, and other small mammals occur. In medical and veterinary schools, live dogs and cats are sometimes used to demonstrate fundamental physiological responses, common drug reactions, and for practice surgery (such as removal of certain organs). Most commonly, these exercises are conducted by, or under the direction of, a fully qual- ified supervisor, and the experiments are "acute"--that is, the animals are fully anesthetized and never recover consciousness. "Acute" experiments are more humane than "chronic" ones because, if properly done, the animals will not suffer any pain whatsoever. The ethical cost lies in the death of the animal. In other pedagogic exercises in both medical and veterinary schools, pathological conditions may be induced in healthy dogs and cats for practice as part of the students' professional training. The ethical cost can be high in these situations because the exercise is often "chronic" so that the students may follow the course of the pathological condition. This is done instead of studying and treating an already sick person (for medical students), or client animal (for veterinary stu- dents). There is increasing pressure for students to study the course of naturally occurring pathological states in the subjects they will even- tually be treatirig. At issue then in assessing the justification of a partic- ular educational exercise is the educational needs of those students, whether the experiment is "acute" or "chronic," whether the pathological condition is induced or naturally occurring, and the availability of alternatives to teach the same or similar lessons. Recommended National Policy for the Use of Animals in Education Policies for the use of animals in education should be based on con- cepts shown in the pain scale (Figure 3). Novices should begin with cate- gory A procedures (non-vertebrate animal projects). Only as their edu- cational level advances should per- mission be granted to progress to category B (vertebrate animal projects involving little or no discomfort). Thus, secondary school student projects arguably should be confined to category A and B procedures. College-level students could be per- mitted to conduct A or B procedures and may, if committed to a career in science, conduct C procedures (ver- tebrate studies involving short-lasting pain). At some point in a student's training, the goal of the experiment switches from educational to real research in which there is potential acquisition of original knowledge. Most commonly this occurs at the graduate school level. In any particular instance,judgment on this must be left to the student's supervisor and the IACUC. Category D procedures (sig- nificant pain) should be reserved for research. Such procedures should only be conducted by persons who are highly qualified as scientists and who have received training in humane techniques. Adoption of such a concept would help eliminate the more unacceptable practices still encountered in science competitions. Enforcement of policies governing the use of animals in education can be effected in various ways. If national policy that required eliminating the infliction of pain on vertebrate animals in elementary and secondary schools were accepted, then the schools themselves and especially the science fairs would need to monitor compliance. Furthermore, any stu- dent project involving the infliction of vertebrate animal pain or lingering death would be required to be conducted in a facility that has a mandated IACUC. Finally, expansion of the Animal Welfare Act to include rats and mice would provide oversight to educational establishments that now fall outside the law. Needed Directive The Animal Welfare Act of 1966 and its strengthening amendments, along with the PHS policy, have served to improve humane standards for laboratory animals. The beneficial effects have fallen mainly on animals used in research. Still, several impor- tant refinements in public policy should be made in the use of animals for research. Moreover, it is now time to improve the policies covering animals used in education and in testing. Immediate attention needs to be given to devising and implement- ing policies on the use of animals in education. Steps in these directions would help establish humane stand- ards that are in keeping with the public's ethical concerns. -F.-E Barbara Orlans.

However, we also stressed that "animal ethics" is actually in its early stages and that there is still much work to be done, especially concern- ing the fundamental issues. With respect to the moral status of animals and ethical theory, we need to examine further the relative ethical significance that we should accord to animal pain, distress, and suffering versus the natural capacities of animal life and activity. This should be conjoined with the elaboration of a philosophically and ethically ade- quate conception of "animal hierar- chy." We also need to face the plurality of ethical theories and decide whether to accept traditional ethical articulations or to press on to more adequate and comprehensive theories. Further, we should decide whether we will accept principled "trumping," or absolutist ethical stances or whether we must look at particular cases and their conflicting values, the so-called "moral ecology," on their own merits. With respect to animal suffering, we noted the limitations and open- ended character of the method of critical anthropomorphism. A further, though controversial approach to understanding animal suffering is an exercise in philosophical, speculative imagination. This involves an attempt to understand what is required for any being, human or animal, to be able to suffer in the most emphatic, "personal" sense of the term, as distinct from experiencing pain or distress. Arguably such suffering at least requires a concrete, organic individ- ual or self, with a genuine and conscious sense of the past, present, and future, and with capacities both for images or ideas and for life plans or more immediate goals that can be frustrated. When the individual self s vulnerable, subjectively felt integrity ("oneness") is actually or potentially threatened, the individual being suffers, as opposed to merely feeling pain.' The future philosophic task, espoused by Eric Cassell, among others, is to give an adequate spec- ulative account of a "suffering being," to identify those animals (if any) capable of such suffering, and finally to decide what relative ethical status to give the suffering individual. Yet of all the unfinished business, none is more pressing than the need to "take together" and to consider systematically our ethical responsibil- ities to human beings, animals and animate life, and the environment. Parochial, adversarial interests and the lack of a wide coordination in our ethical thinking sooner or later will lead to disasterous practical consequences for both human com- munities and individuals and the wider animate realm. It is our ethical responsibility to avoid such moral failure.
