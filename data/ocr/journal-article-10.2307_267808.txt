<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOMERIC METAPHOR CARROLL MOULTON M ETAPHOR is a comparatively neglected feature of Homeric imagery. Scholars and critics have focused attention on the extended similes that are so prominent in the Iliad and Odyssey; discussion of Greek metaphor, on the other hand, has almost invariably concentrated on lyric and tragedy.' Furthermore, previous appraisals of Homeric meta- phor have given rise to some influential misconceptions. The purpose of this essay is to reaffirm the vitality of metaphor as a significant poetic device in the language of the epics, particularly the Iliad. We will start with a summary sketch of previous analyses, and proceed to examine a selection of examples. The metaphors in the analysis have been chosen specifically to illustrate the range and sophistication of figurative language in Homer, and to invite comparison with the survey of previous analyses. We will conclude with some suggestions for further research. W. B. Stanford's definition of metaphor is useful: "the process and result of using a term (X) normally signifying an object or concept (A) in such a context that it must refer to another object or concept (B) which is distinct enough in characteristics from A to ensure that in the composite idea formed by the synthesis of the concepts A and B and now symbolized in the word X, the factors A and B retain their conceptual independence even while they fully merge in the unity symbolized by X."2 Stanford was far readier than A. L. Keith or Milman Parry to allow the presence of a number of imaginative, striking metaphors in the epics. But his main thesis, that words in Homer's time lacked precise definitions and that therefore the poet was deliberately cautious in using metaphor because he ran the risk of sacrificing clarity, will not survive serious scrutiny.3 C. H. 1. E.g., A. L. Keith, Simile and Metaphor in Greek Poetry (Chicago, 1914), p. 33, declared, "The most striking difference that the metaphors of the Iliad present as distinguished from the similes is the almost universal lack of deep feeling." W. B. Stanford, Greek Metaphor (Oxford, 1936), pp. 135, 143, felt that the partial overlap in material between similes and metaphors (e.g., vkoos iret4a at II. 4. 274 and the simile of the cloud at 4. 275-79) could be explained by Homer's desire to clarify possibly confusing metaphors through extended similes employing the same image. A recent study which focuses on the metaphors of the lyric and tragic poets (though not quite to the exclusion of Homer) is the interesting book of M. S. Silk, Interaction in Poetic Imagery (London and New York, 1974). 2. Greek Metaphor, p. 101. The definition is adopted with approval by W. K. Wimsatt, The Verbal Icon (Lexington, Ky., 1954), p. 128. 3. Greek Metaphor, pp. 118 (n. 1), 121. The hypothesis that words themselves lacked precise definitions in Homer's time is vulnerable to the results of numerous recent studies of Homeric vocabulary. See, e.g., A Parry, "Have We Homer's Iliad?"

(1) Few metaphors in Homer are sustained beyond the single word; it is thus impossible to determine with the majority if the poet had the notion of metaphor in mind.' (2) Metaphor in Homer is a "casual poetic device," seldom used to heighten emotion or a crucial narrative incident.7 (3) A large number of the extended metaphors are vague and problematic in meaning.8 (4) Many metaphors are used so often that they retain no force greater than that of the ordinary word. These phrases are "fixed" metaphors in their context; although they may possess decorative charm, their semantic force becomes eroded to the extent that it is "felt" rather than "understood."9 Parry was scrupulous in his emphasis on the contribu- tions of mood and propriety which traditional diction, including the fixed metaphor, had made to the poems.10 Nevertheless, we are inescapably left with the impression that the vast majority of metaphors in the Iliad and Odyssey are "fixed," and consequently devoid of meaning. In the decades since Parry, the criticism of an oral Homer has demon- strated that repetition, by itself, does not automatically act to deprive a phrase of meaning; recent studies have inclined more to the hypothesis A. L. T. Bergren, The Etymology and Usage of HEIPAP in Early Greek Poetry (State College, Pa., 1975); P. Vivante, "On Homer's Winged Words," CQ 25 (1975): 1-12. Despite the disappointing quality of Stanford's more general arguments, he performed a con- siderable service in classifying Homeric metaphors "according to the degree of their imaginative force" (p. 129), and his description and appreciation of some individual phrases are instructive and observant (e.g., pp. 136-37 on eirea rTepo6evTa and &amp;1rTeposjuvMos). 4. See IIomer and the Heroic Tradition (Cambridge, Alass., 1958), pp. 102-27. WNhitman shows credibly enough how certain metaphors in the poems have their counterparts in action sequences; e.g., the image at Od. 5. 383, KaTifb77E KEXeov)s, is literally part of the scene at Od. 10. 19-27, when Aeolus binds the winds. In such cases, the distinction between action and image breaks down; by way of further illustration, Whitman provides a brief analysis of the mingling of literal and figurative clouds in Iliad 16-17 (pp. 151-53). But when he speaks of words such as 4aKoS or aoir's as "metaphors," or as "symbolic of all that a heroic shield should be" (p. 126), Whitman's rhetoric merely embellishes the fact that Homeric heroes usually wield good shields competently. He is forced, then, to see the shield of Achilles as a "tremendous expansion ... a metaphor of the whole heroic world" (p. 126). The last part of this statement may be true. But the shield of Achilles stands out precisely because it is not like any other shield at all (cf. 20. 262-72); its description at 18. 478-608 is thoroughly differentiable from all other shields in the poem and cannot usefully be related to the supposed "metaphorical" qualities of such shields. 5. See Keith, Simile and Metaphor, passim. Parry's arguments were first published in an abstract, "The Homeric 'Metaphor as a Traditional Poetic Device," TAPA 62 (1931): xxiv, reprinted in idem, Making of Homeric Verse, p. 419. His contentions were argued more fully in "The Tradi- tional Metaphor in Homer," CP 28 (1933): 30-43 = Making of Homeric Verse, pp. 365-75.

Our selection of texts from the Iliad will attempt to gauge the effectiveness of repeated metaphors, as well as to assess the contributions of unique phrases. The specific illustrations have been chosen both for their intrinsic interest and for their value as responses to one or more of the theories that we have outlined. In addition, these texts have been largely ignored in commentaries and in the critical literature. Collectively, they comprise an argument for the poetic vitality of Homeric metaphor. Limitations of space will permit us to consider only a small fraction of the metaphors in the Iliad, but the selection is diverse enough to represent the images' considerable variety and importance.'2 We begin with a group of brief metaphors which are restricted to single phrases and which occur only once in the Iliad: 1. 81 e't rep yap -re XOXOV 7E Kat abr7itap Karalri4/ 1. 170-71 oC6&amp; a otco &amp;v0a'b arI4.Los &amp;Zv &amp;PEvoS Kat 7rXoUrov ai 4t,l. 1. 231 &amp;7ttof36pos 8aatXeVus, E7rel obrtbavoJatv dva'aaeLs 1. 243-44 au 6' evWoA Ovjuov a,uutes xcow6vos 6 Tr aparov 'AXaW,v oV etretaas. Parry, who analyzed the metaphors of Iliad 1, comments, "[They] may, for a while, keep the force of their metaphor because they are not elsewhere found in Homer. But because there is nothing outside the word to show the reader that Homer had the notion of metaphor in his mind, and because he soon ceases in reading Homer to look for any active force in such single words, they too finally become for him simply epic words with no more meaning than the usual term would have."''3 But in all these cases there is sufficient evidence of the literal usage of terms elsewhere in the poems to establish the phrases as metaphorical. For example, compare with KaTa7r47 at 1. 81 the literal meaning of ierku at Odyssey 7. 119 (= ripen).'4 With &amp;4vewv at 1. 171, compare aobuaaw at Iliad 1. 598 (= draw off a liquid). For the metaphor in aiuVaIs at 1. 243, we may note &amp;juuaaw at Iliad 19. 284 (= lacerate). Finally, with respect to the compound 85,1o3o6pos at 1. 231, Homer has two other literal compounds of Ni,uos: &amp;i?7,uloepyOs at Odyssey 17. 383 and 19. 135 (= public worker) and &amp;;,uojykpwp at Iliad 3. 149 and 11. 372 (= elder of the people); compare also the verb Kara5vy/.sof3op&amp;@ at Iliad 18. 301. The presumption is certainly 11 Cf. the studies cited in n. 3 12. Stanford, Greek Metaphor, p. 120, acknowledges that metaphors "far outnumber" similes in the epics, but provides no comprehensive listing. As a rough indication of the frequency of metaphor, consider the following statistics for three diverse narrative segments of the Iliad. Book 6 has thirty-one metaphors in 529 lines (vs. five similes), Book 11 has fifty-two metaphors in 847 lines (vs. thirty-three similes), and Book 24 has thirty-nine metaphors in 804 lines (vs. twelve similes). 13.

II. 1. 225), is metaphorical.15 Thus, contrary to contention (1) in the list of theories, it is often possible to establish the metaphorical character of a single phrase by examining lexical usage elsewhere in the poems. Even in cases where we may encounter difficulties, that is, with phrases involving terms whose precise meaning is debatable, or terms with a considerable range of meaning, close analysis is useful for arriving at a balance of probabilities. For example, however we regard the Homeric concept of OvAo's, it seems clear that such phrases as Ov,uo\Xf4i (II. 5. 639, 7. 228), pls OvAofo3pos (II. 7. 210), OvJAo.v KaTr&amp;w (Ii. 6. 202), and 7ra'aLV b 7rapaL 7roaL K(7n-reae OiAVOs (Ii. 15. 280) are all metaphorical. We face similar problems in applying a definition of metaphor to phrases with cpeves, for example, with pipes. . .. AE'Xatpa (II. 1. 103; cf. 17. 83). Yet it is likely that a phrase such as MaKE be cpe'Pa "EKTOP&amp; ,.A3oS (II. 5. 493) is metaphorical."6 Compare also ToP 8' a'xoS Ov&amp; KaTa cpe'aS TV'41E f3aOEiap (I. 19. 125). In both of these latter instances, we are aided by literal usages of &amp;aKpw and Tvi'rTw elsewhere in the poems. But even when we do not possess the "control" of a term's literal usage, we may safely categorize certain brief phrases as metaphorical; consider, for example, aipejorpe4es e'yXos at Iliad 11. 256.17 These illustrations confirm that, even when an image is not extended beyond the single word, we may identify metaphor through analysis of usage. Let us turn now to assess the claim that metaphor in Homer is a casual poetic device, seldom used to heighten emotion or a crucial narrative incident. 3. 54-57 O0K eV -ro Xpacroii K'aps Tra Te &amp;Xp' 'A4,po5Lr,S, v rE K0/L? r6 re etbos, 6r 'v KOVi?laT4 /.yftI17S7 tXX&amp; ,u aXa TpCcs beljwoves ?1 Tf KCV E 7 X&amp;ivov &amp;'ooo XlTrva KaKAV eveX' aTOa eop-yas. There are two striking metaphors in this passage, the conclusion of Hector's first reproach of Paris. The only parallel to the phrase at 3. 55, or' 'P KOVPlUat MlYElybs, is a verse used for the deaths of Dolon in the Iliad and Leodes in the Odyssey: c0eyyo,uvov 8' apa roi} 'YE Kap?7 KovplUaLV 4slxGn (II. 10. 457 = Od. 22. 329). Mlayw, of course, is frequently used in a variety of formulas for sexual intercourse (cf. vi/utYt 47XIP Ol7Tt Kal ei'w at II. 3. 445). Given the prominent erotic motifs of Iliad 3, it is surely possible to argue for an ambiguous, ironic significance in Hector's expression: he implies, meta- phorically, that Paris will clutch at the ground, as in lust."8 The unparalleled expression Xaipop E00o XLT,pa at 3. 57, which almost 15.

Thus, ironic reference to a garment, XLTwOp, at 3. 57 is not to be ruled out. The metaphor itself is probably related in conception to others which picture shame as a garment; compare VaiL6ELa7V ebrLeL/eLe (irtewip4os) at Iliad 1. 149 and 9. 372. Both of Hector's images, at the climax of his speech, combine to emphasize the forceful tone of outrage, tinged with irony, of the reproach. 6. 327-31 Xaot ,Aip .kc&amp;Oovct 7rept 7rT6Xtp aLiru Te TeZXOg /IapPLuEPoc 0OE 6 ECPEK' )VTj7 Te 7rr6XeA6s Te aoUY Tr6' diAtbib7leO oifu 6' v a.taX&amp;faLo Kat &amp;lXXc, oP TWa 7rou uAce-OtpTa '6ots orTwyepoU 7roXkoto. tXX' &amp;va, Air T6aXa &amp;oTV 7rups 6rnLtooo OipTcTat. This passage also shows Hector reproaching Paris. The metaphor of battle and the war cry "blazing" around the city is certainly to be related to a group of images with the simple verb baLco: ,iaJX71 cvo7or re 6e6?1EL (II. 12. 35), 'Or&amp;avos 7roX'AoLo 6'bie (II. 13. 736), pts 7roX\ijoLo 6'brve (II. 17. 253), liaX7 ro'Xcio'sr 6r6ne (II. 20. 18). The metaphor, with the verb in the same position in the verse, is also used of rumor (II. 2. 93 uer&amp;a 6- U4oLTLV "Ouoa 6e6?1EL) and of Hector's eyes in battle (II. 12. 466 7rvpL 6' 0o-e 6e6veL).20 Virtual- ly all the contexts are martial, and the notion of the metaphor is to be compared with the repeated, short simile, cws ot Au'v Auappapro 6e,ias rvpos aWAo,u4voLo (II. 11. 596, 13. 673, 18. 1). But whereas the simile is a brief, summarizing image employed in transition passages, all but one of the metaphors of "blazing war" occur in speeches of apprehension and urgency. These emotions are especially evident in Hector's speech in Iliad 6, where the verbal structure of the image differs most markedly from the norm (note the enjambement), and where the hero's fear for Troy, expressed in the last verse (331), transfers the motif of fire from imagery to narrative. The rhetorical power of the metaphor is thus reinforced by its context. 11. 241 WS 6 jAy act 7reocW KOL/flo-aTO X&amp;XKEOP iUTPOP This phrase, employed for the death of Iphidamas at the hands of Agamem- non, is unique in the poems, although the epithets XaXKEos and 7roXVXaXKOS are used in other metaphorical contexts. In the nominative, Xa'XKEos alter- nates with o6fpliIos when Ares is to receive an epithet in the adonic segment of the verse; compare Iliad 5. 704, 859, 866, 7. 146, 16. 543. It is scarcely surprising, then, that the majority of the epithet's figurative uses occur in martial contexts. In the invocation to the Catalog of Ships, the poet imagines an unbreakable voice and a heart of bronze (II. 2. 490 covi1 6' app7KTOS, Xa'XKEOP 66 IOL iTrop ivEL?). Achilles shouts at the trench with a brazen voice 19. Cf. W. Leaf, The "Iliad," vol. 12 (London, 1900), ad loc. 20. Cf.

At Iliad 11. 241 the image of bronze sleep for death is particularly striking. Agamemnon's slaying of Iphidamas is considerably elaborated: in ring composition, we are first given details of the warrior's background and marriage (221-28), then the combat scene, and finally a pathetic close, which focuses on the bereaved wife (242-45). The finality of Iphidamas' encounter with Agamemnon is accentuated by the unique metaphor for his death. 15. 694-95 . . .TOP 6U Ze6s )oep 67rto-e XetPt /SAiXa Se-y&amp;X, eTPV OE Xao &amp;A' auTc. These lines occur just before Hector takes hold of the ship of Protesilaus and calls for fire at the end of Book 15 (cf. 716-25). The action has reached a climax. The context is plainly the apogee of the glory granted to Hector by Zeus (cf. the prophecy at II. 11. 192-94). Leaf (ad loc.) calls the passage an ''anthropomorphic metaphor": we need not suppose that Zeus is present in person on the battlefield. He then compares Iliad 13. 358-60 as "the nearest parallel in Homer." But the context there is one of even battle, and seems scarcely analogous to the present situation. Here the "interven- tion" of Zeus may be compared to the literal intervention of Apollo at Iliad 16. 791-92: o-ri 5' 6 `Irev, irXiev 66 per4apepov Eispff r' W'U. / X%lp' KaTrarppVEl, o-frpec-6tvqOv 6b oF 6Ooe. In view of the close narrative connection between Hector's drive to the ships and Patroclus' entrance into battle, and the thematic links that relate Hector's limited success, Patroclus' death, and Hector's mortality, these unusual passages are appropriately taken together. But there is a fine shading of differences: Apollo intervenes as a hostile god, and with immediate consequences; Zeus intervenes ostensibly as the patron of Hector, but there is something ominous about his standing behind the Trojan, pushing him on to achievements that are perhaps beyond him, and limiting his grant of glory to a brief period, which will expire at sunset.24 There can be no doubt that Apollo is literally present in the battle in Book 16; the physical effects of his action are described. In the absence of such details, the strong presumption is that the passage at 15. 694-95 is metaphorical. The image of Zeus's intervention, with its under- 21. The simile which directly precedes this verse and compares Achilles' voice to a trumpet (219-21) is possibly to be associated with the metaphor. 22. The epithet o-tOipetos also has a variety of metaphorical usages; cf. II. 22. 357, 23. 177, 24. 205 521; Od. 4. 293, 5. 191, 12. 280, 15. 329 = 17. 565, 23. 172. Both XaXKeos and o6,ipetos (ot6ripeos) are applied to obpav6s and AjTOp. 23. Dolon is described as 7roX&amp;Xpvoros 7roX&amp;XaXKos at II. 10. 315. 24. Zeus's plan and Hector's doom are recalled shortly before our passage at 15. 610-14.</page><page sequence="7">HOMERIC METAPHOR 285 currents of ambiguity and foreboding, is placed at a major turning point in the narrative. 18. 107-10 cS 9pts (K TE Nei4 9K T' &amp;vpnrwp &amp;irAXotro, Kat X6XoXs, OS TX k4VKE 7rloX4poPi 7rep xaXerivca, OS Te 7roXJ -yXVKLOP JiXtTOT KaTaGXefO/2upoto &amp;v6ppo ip o0TOeootp aeteTat 7iWTE KarPos. Achilles' words on anger occur in his meeting with Thetis. Parry compared the passage with the metaphor used of Nestor at Iliad 1. 249: roVi Kac A&amp;ro -yX7oofs iXrTOs yXVKLWV pkeer ami?. He argued that the latter image was "the one active metaphor of the first Iliad," but found it deprived of any signifi- cant poetic effect since it recurs at Hesiod Theogony 83-84 and 96-97. Parry then adduced the more complex phrase of Achilles to show "clearly how little Homer felt its force, unless one should wish to make Homer mix metaphors with all the ruthlessness of an Elizabethan."2" But the recurrence of the image at Iliad 1. 249 in Hesiod does not automatically deprive it of poetic effect, unless one clings rigidly to the theory that repetition of a phrase cancels its semantic force. More important, Achilles' image, far richer and more concentrated than the bare comparison of soothing speech to honey, should be appreciated for its psychological insight. The attractive- ness of anger and the sweet satisfaction with which it is nursed over time fuse in the image with the notions of danger and emptiness, conveyed by the brief, internal simile ivVTf Ka7rpos. The two vehicles of honey and smoke, taken together, produce a sense of clash which is in turn mitigated by the appropriateness of each separate image. As a whole, the complex description of anger is just what we might expect from a character so familiar with that emotion; the graphic images of honey and smoke, correlated by the antithesis of KaraXe43ojAipoLo and a&amp;cETaL, are produced by a character of singular imagination.26 The last five examples of Homeric metaphor have suggested that figura- tive language may indeed be employed in the Iliad to heighten emotion or to underline the importance of a particular narrative incident. The following three analyses illustrate the poetic significance of complex or extended metaphors. 19. 221-24 r'4a Te qvX6t6os 7rXeTat K6pOT &amp;vOpW&amp;rotact, s Te IrXeIoT71P /iP KaXyIAv1P XOoPL XaXKOS 9XEVEv, 61A7sTos 6 O6X'ywoTos, iriP KXP p7t T&amp;XapTc Zeus, O'S T' a&amp;vOpWrrwP Ta/.h7s 7roXE/oto TETVKTat. Odysseus' description of war as a reaper who cuts down much straw and gathers a mean harvest comprises a dense fusion of images: satiety in war- fare, the bronze which scatters the straw, the poor harvest, Zeus poising his scales, the god as the steward of warfare (19. 224 = 4. 84). Leaf aptly compares the simile at Iliad 11. 67-71, which likens the Greeks and Trojans to reapers: 25. Making of Homeric Verse, p. 374. 26. Achilles' entire speech at II. 18. 98-126 is rich in metaphor; cf. 102, 104, 114, 117.</page><page sequence="8">286 CARROLL MOULTON ot 6, W s T 4?TiPCS EpaPTLoL LXXi7XoLcYtp 0EyAop iXavpCwoLp avopps AaKKapos KaT apoupav 7rUpCop v KpLOCP' Ta 6 Op6vy/AaTa Tapcf4a 7rrTer cs Tpc2fS Kac 'AXatot E7r br&amp;XXXotof OOpOPTTs 5noVP, o65' eTEpOOL APCO0PT XOOZO 0f6Oto. Yet the simile is less complex and suggestive than the passage in Book 19. The former presents one principal point of comparison, with little detail, whereas Odysseus' metaphor is far more unusual.27 It occurs in the context of his exhortation to Achilles to allow the army time to eat before it goes into battle; the soldiers will thus be better prepared to endure hardship (cf. 19. 155-70, 225-29). Thus the images of satiety, harvest, and steward- ship are aptly contrived for the context. Leaf (ad loc.) interprets Odysseus' principal metaphor to mean that hard work in battle outweighs a small reward, just as the straw in the field is greater than the grain that is har- vested; therefore, the soldiers require food to be strengthened for their task. M. M. Willcock partially concurs: the thin harvest "indicates that the armies have great labor but little reward." He interprets the straw, how- ever, as a metaphor for the bodies of the dead.28 Willcock is surely right; the bronze (222 XaXKOS) is to be understood figuratively as the weapon which slays in battle.29 The straw (KaXa,nlAv) is thus to be interpreted as the dead; compare Odysseus' use of the word to mean an old, worn-out man, battered by sorrow (Od. 14. 214). The thin harvest should be equated with the men who are left alive, rather than merely with the reward of battle. Zeus's poising of the scales (223-24) always occurs in the Iliad in contexts of deliberation between life and death (cf. 8. 69, 16. 658, 22. 209), and Odysseus proceeds in this passage to draw a contrast between the numerous dead warriors (226) and those who escape the battle alive (230). The meta- phor thus becomes more of a generalizing comment than Leaf's interpreta- tion would suggest. Satiety in warfare (i.e., rushing to battle without proper preparations) is said to result in the grim debacle of a tiny harvest (i.e., few survivors); the antithesis of KOpOS (221) and OWI7tiros (223) emphasizes Odysseus' pointed contrast. The repetition of aVOpcOproLtLp (221) in a&amp;Op&amp;zrWv (224) helps to unify the entire metaphorical statement through a type of ring composition.30 27.

With the metaphor at II. 19. 221-24 one may compare Aeschylus' famous image of Ares as a gold changer, who converts men's bodies in war to the ashes held by funeral urns (Ag. 438-44): o xpvoa1oL#3's 6' 'Apt7s oCwcTaCrOv / Kal aXravrouXo- Xv /uaxf Oopos / rLpcoOev e 'IXiov / ftXOLcrL 7riA7r-EL fap3u / kj?7y1a 6V76AKpUTOV, dVT- / jivopos o7roboO -yqf- / ?wv Xf3v7ras ebOirous.

Zeus as the steward of war who poises his scales. Living men become ashes in Aeschylus' image; the passage in the Iliad likens them to straw cut down by bronze. There are no Aeschylean counterparts for the notions of satiety (KOpos) and harvest (51A?Tros) in the Homeric passage. It is fair to say that the verses from the Iliad are just as complex and rich in imagery as the lines from the Agamemnon. E. Fraenkel, Aeschylus: "Agamemnon" (Oxford, 1950), ad 438, denies any reminiscence of Homer in the Aeschylean passage; but cf. A. Sideras, Aeschylus Homericus (G6ttingen, 1971), p. 211.</page><page sequence="9">HOMERIC METAPHOR 287 16. 745-50 &amp; 0r6rot, r ut&amp;X' EXa4p's 'vPp, cts heLa KUVL0T7. et 7roU KaL TrVTc (V LXOU&amp;VTL 71VOLTO, 7roXXOuS av KOpOELaEv avr3p O6e T7Oea 6t4C2w, P76S a7rOpqO-KwV, ELt Kat horuqeEXos E1v, s PuP i' IreSLcq et 7'rrcov pEa KVfL0T7.

This passage, the vaunt of Patroclus over Cebriones, is the only truly extended metaphor in the Iliad, and resembles many of the similes in its structure. Its ironic effect, however, sets the speech apart from the similes. Patroclus' sustained pretense of discerning an acrobatic tumbler or diver in the dying Cebriones has little in common, for example, with the poet's elaborate comparison of Ajax with an acrobatic horseman at Iliad 15. 679-84. The speech, too, is clearly distinct from the short diver simile that precedes it at 16. 742 (apvevrinpt CoLKW's).3' The verb KVotoT-rCa is used at Iliad 21. 354 (of fish leaping out of the water), and the noun KV0LotYTflTr?p recurs in literal contexts at Iliad 18. 605 = Odyssey 4. 18. Patroclus' metaphor is organized through ring composition (cf. pjeZa KVf3tcTtL at 745, 749); the elaboration of the diving image contains a contrast between the grim situation of the narrative and a constructive activity (here, diving for food); there is the addition of a gratuitous detail (748 et KaL 8vo-r.uPeXos e'I07). All these features are typical of similes in the Iliad. But perhaps the closest analogue to the passage's tone is the heavily ironic speech of Achilles to Lycaon in Book 21. 21. 54-63 c lr6lrot, i7 pu4ya Oaiu3a r6b' 6OaXuooatv 6pG4sac 7i ju&amp;Xa 5r?

No explicit metaphor is sustained here. The speech is carefully structured around the notion of "holding in check," "restraining" (59, 62, 63 'piVKW). Like Patroclus at Iliad 16. 745-50, Achilles opens with a cry of ironic surprise (co wro6rot): the Trojans are indeed courageous if, once slain, they can return from the dead (54-56). This is hyperbole, since Lycaon was not in fact slain, but rather sold into slavery on Lemnos by Achilles on a previous occasion. But Achilles equates him with one of the dead: now he has come back, since the sea journey has not deterred him (57-58). Let him have a taste of Achilles' spear, so that the latter may know for certain if Lycaon can perform a second miracle and come back from there (KEZOEP), or if the 31.

The literal "restraint" of the sea in the first half of the speech is transformed into a metaphor in the second portion: the idea is that Lycaon, once he has been killed by Achilles, may yet be struggling to "return from the earth." The grim rhetoric is enhanced by Achilles' illogical, but effective, assimilation of Lycaon to the dead in the first place (55-57 Tp-es ... ovs rEp EIrEWovv / av'Ts avaoTVprYovTaL viro ?b4ov 'EpOEVTOS, / OioV 6' KaL 68' iXe). The speech itself is highly metaphorical in individual phrases, for example, uiro 0o4oV i7EPOEvros, v,)XE-S i iiap, bovpo' aKsaK7K2S 'rTipOLO -yEVUOTaL. But the overall conception, which is that of killing Lycaon for the second time, is a suppressed metaphor which dominates the entire passage, making all the more pathetic Lycaon's own recollection of his previous capture and ransom. 32 Let us pass now to the issue of "fixed" metaphor. Here we will discuss a number of images that occur more than twice in the Iliad in either identical or slightly varied form. A fair assessment of Parry's theory-that these metaphors are deprived of meaning through repetition-may concede at the outset that certain phrases appear to lack much distinctive color and seem to have been repeated numerous times as decorative, metrical "fillers." For example, an inspection of the metaphor 1roLtpfvL/a Xa'v (repeated fifty-six times, always in the adonic segment of the verse) shows that the phrase is applied to a wide variety of characters, with little discrimination. On the other hand, a recent examination of the numerous occurrences of swrea ir-rpoevra (123 times by Parry's count) has defended the phrase's vitality and the appropriateness of its placement.33 Careful analysis of such repeated metaphors on an individual basis is called for, if we are fairly to evaluate their effectiveness as poetic devices. In particular, we should probe the relationships of a group of metaphors to variations of the same image; we must study features of context which may act to reinforce the rhetorical intensity of any given occurrence of a repeated metaphor; and we should investigate instances of "clustering," or the grouping of similar or identical metaphors within a distinct narrative segment. As illustrations of such analysis, let us consider the following passages. 11. 574 (r4 ore 8oupa ... p yacp tarapro, XtXaLt6Mea Xpo6s aToaL.

With respect to the speech of Patroclus at It. 16. 745-50, whose ironic tone resembles that of Achilles, it is interesting that the juxtaposition of death in the narrative and diving for fish in Patroclus' image is refracted at II. 21. 126-27 in the vaunt of Achilles over Lycaon: Achilles says that a fish will jump to break the surface of the water as it feeds on the body of the slain Trojan (cf. 't-o's a&amp;7roOp4 KWh at 16. 748 with Op40KWV at 21. 126). Achilles does not employ meta- phorical language here, however. 33. See Vivante, "On Homer's Winged Words," pp. 1-12. 34. For other examples, see Stanford, Greek Metaphor, pp. 138-39. Aristotle seems especially to have admired the vivid personifications of the battle narrative; for his comments on Homeric metaphor, see Poet. 1459a4, Rhet. 141 1b31.</page><page sequence="11">HoMERIC METAPHOR 289 av8popfLoLo) and a related expression, containing an even more grotesque image, at 5. 289 = 20. 78 and 22. 267 (a'4IaToS aoal "Ap?7a TaXacwpLvov rOXe,UAl0T7jV). In the Iliad, one can have one's fill of mourning (23. 157, 24. 717) or of war (19. 402). But to speak of sating Ares with blood, or of spears eager to glut themselves with flesh, is obviously a figurative trans- formation of eating (cf. the literal 64/0V TX aoaL/.u at II. 9. 489 or the grim feasting of dogs pictured at II. 11. 818 and 24. 211). It is noteworthy that, although our phrase and its cognates are repeated, metaphors involving the verb aw come gradually to be concentrated on Achilles in the last books of the Iliad; compare 19. 402 (Achilles' speech to his horses), 20. 78 (his hatred for Hector), 21. 69-70 (the capture of Lycaon), 21. 168 (the encounter with Asteropaeus), 22. 267 (Achilles' refusal to treat with Hector), 23. 157 (his speech to Agamemnon). This cluster of metaphors is in turn linked with Achilles' literal abstention from food (cf. aw at II. 19. 307) and with the themes of grief and revenge in the last books."5 The metaphor with which we started (11. 574) must thus be viewed as part of a system, which is manipulated with increasing intensity as the narrative builds to its climax. 36 3. 212 .U.. sbouS Kai juilbea &amp;aotv ufatpop This is a key metaphor in the Odyssey, although it is important in the Iliad as well. The literal usage of 0ataLVw (= weave at the loom) is clear enough at Iliad 3. 125, 22. 440, Odyssey 2. 94 = 24. 129, 15. 517, 19. 139. Our metaphorical phrase never recurs exactly, but to be compared are vlpaLveLv 7PXETO /flTLV (II. 7. 324 = 9. 93), 8oXov aXXov vi(4aLve (Ii. 6. 187), st TLS AOL V4OLP?utp 8O6Xop av'TE (Od. 5. 356), 6oXovS KaL /.L?TLV VccatpoV (Od. 9. 422), A.L?TLV ukaLvov (Od. 4. 678; cf. Od. 4. 739, 13. 303, 386). Of the six Odyssean usages, four are directly concerned with Odysseus at suspenseful crises in the narrative: the landing on Scheria (5. 356), the escape from the Cyclops (9. 422), and the meeting with Athene on Ithaca (13. 303, 386). All these scenes are described in elaborate detail, and in two of them other rhetorical features combine to underline the importance of /.LflTLS; compare the puns at 9. 410 and 414 and the repetitions of the word or its compounds at 13. 293, 299, 311, and 382. The other two Odyssean usages occur in the narrative of the suitors' plot to kill Telemachus: the first is used of the suitors (4. 678), the second of Laertes by Penelope (4. 739). The Iliadic usages are dis- tributed as follows: the plot of Proetus to ambush Bellerophon (6. 187), and the attempts of Nestor to counsel the Greek chiefs, first to build the wall and the ditch (7. 324), and then to send the embassy to Achilles (9. 93). The metaphor at 3. 212, in Antenor's account of Odysseus, also concerns an embassy. The point of this elaborate speech (the longest in the Teicho- 35. I am grateful here to Julia Heskel, who, in an unpublished essay entitled "Banqueting in the Iliad: A Study of Homeric Metaphor," has analyzed in impressive detail this group of images and its links to important narrative themes. 36. There is no reason a priori to believe that such ordering of imagery is inconsistent with the oral theory, whatever the processes of composition or the circumstances of performance. For this question and detailed discussion of the ordering of similes in the poems, see C.

Although both Odysseus and Menelaus are said to "weave words and counsel" for the assembly, it is clear that Odysseus surpasses Menelaus (cf. 3. 223). Shortly before the metaphor (200), and shortly afterward (216), Odysseus is given the epithet roMA1p7TLS, exclusively reserved for him in the Odyssey and, with but one exception, in the Iliad also (eighteen times).37 On the whole, the metaphors involving 64alvw occur at suspenseful points in the narrative of both poems, where they underscore the evolution of particularly momentous (or treacherous) plans by the characters. At Iliad 3. 212, the suspense inheres in the assembly's recognition of Odysseus' true powers, barely suspected from his appearance, but revealed as extraordinary when he speaks (cf. the contrast of the simile at 219, aspdE 4UTwL EOlKCbS, with the simile at 222, 'Eri-a via46e3aaLEcTv EOLKOTa XEL/LAEpL7acLv). The "weaving of words and counsels" results in a dramatic reversal of expectation. 4. 274-75 rc. 5i KopVO-40077Pv,5 a,ua 6e vPeos e'rero 7rEiv.

The omission of the metaphor's second term results in a lexical variation and enjambement at 20. 417-18: yvu (5' Ep1 'l olcbAtas,5 vE44Xi77 6/V a/v4AEK6XXUE / KVacL 17, KTX.

In everv case, the cloud is associated with death or extreme danger. The metaphor is extended beyond the single word so often that the figurative meaning cannot be in doubt. The last three examples occur at highly emotional moments: the death of Hector's special companion Podes (cf. II. 17. 575- 96), the announcement of Patroclus' death to Achilles, and the point at which Laertes gives up hope for news of Odysseus.38 The verbs TElVCv and Tav'w are employed metaphorically in the Iliad in contexts of evenly matched battle (cf. 11. 336, 12. 436 = 15. 413, 13. 359, 14. 389, 16. 662, 20. 101.)39 These verbs are also used of Zeus's sending of 37. The exception is at II. 21. 355 VroXuV1'rLToS 'HOalaoroLo.

Helen's reference to A'L7ea ruKP&amp;a at II. 3. 202. 38. At II. 4. 274-75, the metaphor is followed by an ominous extended simile involving a cloud; the same technique appears at Od. 19. 205-9, where the simile of melting snow precedes the image of Penelope's cheeks "melting" (208).

Il. 16. 365 and 567). It is in Iliad 17, the single episode of the fight over Patroclus' body, that such metaphors are concentrated. The first striking occurrences of Tavi'w are literal usages in the famous simile of the oxhide. The image is placed squarely in the center of the Leichenkampf, and serves as a grotesque emblem for it (17. 384-95): roLs 6e 7ravpq1eploLs ppLbos Oue'/ya PELKOS OpWpEL ap-yaXer7s KaAdcrw, 5 KacL lbpci vwXeAejs aLel -yopuard rE KP7/IcaL re 7ro5es 0' V7ru'EPOEPv eKdarov X4 PES r' 6o0aXitoL re 7raXa6ooero AapcaEpPc oL/P &amp;Ito' &amp;yaco6 Oepac7rovra T ro&amp;wKEOs ALaKl'SaO. c4 6' 6r' avxlp raupoLo f3oos Ae-ya'XoLo 3oelp' XaoZowLp baTn raJaiJ, AEOuovaap aXoLO5 Eta'AepoL 6' apa rot -ye &amp;Laardvres rapbovol KVKX6O', &amp; aoap Seire TIKEAS 'e/i&amp; , uvpe 5 T' a'XoLor 7rVOXXP iXKoPTWv, rdvvral 6e re 71oaa &amp;airp6 Wo y' Evyea KaL gVOa 4KVP OXiypn VtL x(cPnp 'XKEOV &amp;AOoTEpOL- KTX. The repeated Tavbw (390, 391, 393) is closely associated with the soldiers' dragging of the body to each side (393 fXKOVTWV, 395 -'YXKEOV). The narrative proceeds to emphasize the expectations of each army, Greek and Trojan; the battle was so savage that not even Ares and Athene could have scorned it. The poet then reintroduces Tavbw, this time in a metaphorical usage, as if to remind us of the image of the oxhide (17. 400-401): ro7op Zus 'brL lIarp6KXq. &amp;VSPp(V rE KaL iarLrwv 1J/IarL reC eird&amp;vTE KaK6J 7r6vov KrX. One may note the specific touches which are added to the phrase here: the mention of Patroclus' name (400) and the enjambed verse (401), with the expression iAaTt T-. After the episode of Achilles' horses and Automedon's short aristeia, the poet returns to the main action with a metaphorical usage of TELVw; this expression, too, is fuller than usual (17. 543-44): d4, 6' e(rl IHaTP&amp;KXy reraro Kparepp Voa,uliq &amp;p-yaX,q 7roXbSaKpVS, KrX. Shortly after these verses, Athene's descent to the battlefield to stir up Menelaus is described in an unusual simile, where Tavbw is employed for Zeus's "stretching" of the rainbow (17. 547-52): tjre 7ropcvpe'q tpIl OJvqroLoL raoJI%p Zeus it obpacWe6v repas e,AEvaL I 7roXe'AOLO J Kal Xa/uCpVO SvuoOaX7r&amp;eos, 6s pa re gp-ywv &amp;vOpcnrous &amp;Peiravaep E'rL XOovl, A7XcLa 6e Kjbfl, cs ?J Prop'upEp vEOEXp lruK'aoTaoTa 9 abriv bIaer' 'AxaLou2 Mvos, -yeLpe 8F fora (Kaarov.</page><page sequence="14">292 CARROLL MOULTON The notion of Zeus extending the rainbow from the sky may be compared to his sending of night at Iliad 16. 567 and his creation of the tempest at Iliad 16. 365. But, as commentators have noticed, there is a curious merging in the simile of image and narrative reality; since Athene wraps herself in the purple cloud (17. 551), her journey to earth is associated with a physical transformation into a rainbow, before she takes on her disguise as Phoenix.40 The ominous ve44Xtq at 551 is to be noted within the context of Books 16 and 17, where there is a strikingly effective interaction between literal clouds or darkness and cloud imagery.4' The passage is thus particularly suggestive: the simile itself becomes an omen of evil in the narrative, associated with the prominent cloud imagery of the episode (cf. 17. 243, 591, and 755 for metaphorical clouds, and 17. 269, 368, 594, 645 for literal clouds or mist), and also linked through ravuw with the motif of the stretching of battle at 543-44.42 The final occurrence of the metaphor in Book 17 comes at the point when Menelaus and Meriones lift the body of Patroclus: a furious battle ensues. Here too the passage is immediately followed by a simile, although there is no connection of motifs (17. 735-37): Wcs oL y 74AeAa(ZcLWTe V P V +POP kK rOX/sOLO vias 'Erl -yXacvpas err 5i 7rreAuos 7 rerar76 o-v a-ypLOs jiTE irup, K-X. It is noteworthy that all the metaphorical usages of TL Vw/rTavVw in Book 17 occur in the second half of the episode, after the unsuccessful attempts of Menelaus and Ajax to defend the body. Perhaps the poet wished to reserve the intensity of evenly matched battle on a general scale for the climactic stages of his long narrative of the Leichenkampf.43 The initial confrontations of Menelaus with Euphorbus, and of Ajax with Hector and the Trojans, give way to a more general battle scene about the midpoint of the episode; compare the speeches of anonymous warriors at 415 and 421. It is interesting, too, that the literal usages of Tavvcw occur first-in the context of the oxhide simile. That unusual image conditions our response to the ensuing metaphors: each recurrence of the phrase for the stretching of battle reinforces the grotesque, literal struggle on the battlefield for the possession of Patroclus' corpse.44 Thus this particular metaphor, closely 40. Cf. the simile at II. 4. 75-79, where Athene appears to be transformed into a shooting star, also a rkpas for mortals, before she completes her mission to earth in the guise of Laodocus (4. 86-88). On both passages, see Fenik, Battle Scenes, pp. 182-83. 41. For a summary analysis, see Whitman, Homer and (he Heroic Tradition, pp. 151-53. 42. A similar connection is to be observed in Book 16; note that Zeus's sending of night at 567 (PViKr' oXoi7'7 r7aoEPv) and his "stretching of strife" at 662 (fp'La KpaTEpi?v iTa&amp;vTooaE) both occur within the context of a Leichenkampf, this time the struggle over Sarpedon. 43. Indeed, at the culmination of the episode (17. 722-61) the narrative is virtually recounted through the imagery of five full similes and their applications; see Moulton, Similes in the Homeric Poems, pp. 75-76. 44. This is not tantamount to asserting with Stanford (Greek Metaphor, p. 135) that simile "clarifies" metaphor. Both the oxhide simile at 17. 389-93 and the metaphor for the stretching of labor that follows it at 400-401 are equally intelligible on their own terms; the close juxtaposition serves to make each image more powerful. Such reinforcement is also the case in the juxtaposition of the metaphor at 543 with the simile at 547 (TrEivco/rap'o common to both passages); but the principal vehicle of the second passage, the rainbow, differs in content from the metaphor. Another</page><page sequence="15">HOMERIC METAPHOR 293 allied to formulaic phrases in other passages of the Iliad, acquires consider- able poetic force in Book 17. Through repetition, slight variation, and skillful placement, the poet is able to employ metaphor for a powerful, sustained effect.45 At least in this instance, neither repetition nor formulaic composition seems to have deprived a metaphor of meaning. Indeed, these factors, combined with the concentration of an image in a particularly appropriate context, contribute to the cumulative force of a single metaphor. The examples and discussions in this essay are intended to convey the range and variety of Homeric metaphor, and also to respond to the con- tentions and theories that have tended to dismiss its significance in the epics. Much remains to be done, and the analysis here can only claim to be a prolegomenon. Specifically, as our insights into Homeric vocabulary become more precise, we need detailed exploration of problematic phrases, for example, w7Area6at "Ap-i (II. 7. 241) or EVTUvras 'v xXatvp (II. 24. 163), which can be apprehended as striking images but which are decidedly curious in meaning.46 We surely stand in need of more discussion of the "fixed" metaphors and their variants. And a review of the distribution of images, with a comprehensive list, would aid further analysis considerably. How does the poet of the Iliad apportion metaphors among speeches and narrative? And does the distribution in speeches indicate significant differ- ences in the characterization of the heroes? The latter question is particularly interesting, given the evidence that other poetic devices (e.g., similes, apostrophe) are occasionally employed to individualize character in both poems.47 Finally, a comparison of metaphor in the Iliad and the Odyssey, in which the role and characteristics of similes display important differences, would be informative. For the present, the evidence assembled here should confirm that metaphor is a vital, significant part of the language of Homer.48 Emory University variation of the technique appears in the relationship of metaphor at 736 with simile at 737-39. Here, two images in rapid succession emphasize the ferocity of the battle, and thus may be said to reinforce each other; but there is no overlap whatever between them in content or diction. 45. One may compare the metaphors with aw used of Achilles; cf. p. 289 on Il. 11. 574. 46. A recent example is Bergren's The Etymology and Usage of IIEIPAP in Early Greek Poetry. 47. On the similes used, e.g., of Menelaus, see Fenik, Battle Scenes, p. 161. For apostrophe, see A. Parry, "Language and Characterization in Homer," HSCP 76 (1972): 1-22, esp. 9-21. With regard to metaphor in speeches, one might compare, e.g., Antinous and Eurvmachus in the Odyssey. That the characters are doublets, and yet subtly individualized in a variety of ways, has been demonstrated by B. Fenik, Studies in the "Odyssey," Hermes Einzelschriften, 30 (Wiesbaden, 1974), pp. 198-205. Antinous speaks more often than his comrade (twenty-three speeches for 212 lines vs. Eurymachus' thirteen speeches for 126 lines). Yet even allowing for this disparity, there is a wide discrepancy in metaphorical content between their speeches: Antinous is made to employ nineteen images, with two unique expressions (cf. Od. 16. 389, 17. 448), whereas Eurymachus speaks only three metaphors, all of them with many parallels. The significance of this differentiation is probably related to the typical conduct of the two chief suitors. In the main, Eurymachus is deceptively friendly, hypocritical, and smooth; Antinous, on the other hand, is direct, boastful, violent: his language is exaggerated and colorful (cf. Od. 16. 379, 17. 377, 446, 448, 18. 79, 21. 88, 299, 302). 48. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the helpful suggestions of M. W. Edwards and S. D. Atkins, and of the referees of CP.
