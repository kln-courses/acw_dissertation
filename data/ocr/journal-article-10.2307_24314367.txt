<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZAPOPAN</page><page sequence="2">¿W/torúfl Margarita de Orellana Every region explored by Artes de México is surprising for its uniqueness. And part of our task is to communicate this interest and as tonishment to our readers. In this case, under the powerful protective wing of an expecting Virgin, we have discovered a place of sharp contrasts between urban and rural life. Amid vast industrial zones we find fields of intense green vegetation, and alongside them, an impressive deep ravine that has inspired great painters, photographers and poets. Za popan has a rich and complex history stretch ing back to the sixteenth century, and yet the municipality is still largely unknown outside its limits, which abut those of the city of Guada lajara. In Náhuatl, its name means "place of abundant zapotes!'—the sapodilla fruit that grows throughout tropical America. For cen turies, it was considered a quiet village where time was measured in the trips its Virgin made to and from Jalisco's capital every year. But in the mid-twentieth century, it experienced a development boom, beginning with the re structuring of the downtown area with shop ping malls, a new municipal palace and oth er important new constructions. Despite the fact that Zapopan may be con sidered part of greater Guadalajara, it has pre served distinct traits, not only in the municipal seat, but in many of the towns lying within the district limits. These are especially prominent for their religious festivities of dazzling inten sity and vibrancy. Moreover, every time Artes de México deals with some part of Jalisco's culture, we benefit from the support of academics and special ists. Many of them have a particular fondness for Zapopan, resulting in a twofold approach to this region: scholarly and nostalgic. The is sue opens with Guillermo García Oropeza's keen observations on modem Zapopan and its roots in history, and its relationship to Guadalajara. Ana Maria de la O. Castellanos transports us back to Zapopan in the early twentieth century, using a variety of sensa tions to draw us a picture of what daily life was like: the parched sensation of the hottest days of April, the penetrating dampness of the rainy season, as well as the seductive aromas and flavors of the different dishes prepared with corn. Guillermo de la Peña goes back a fur ther fifty years to tell us about the first industri al magnates who galvanized the moderniza tion of the entire region. Lina Mercedes Cruz speaks to us of the decline of an age-old eco nomic activity that was common in the area of the ravine: mule-driving. José Maria Muría combats the widespread ignorance about the municipality with his reflections on life in this com-growing town and its inhabitants' awareness of their identity. Meanwhile, An drés Fábregas explains the role of El Colegio de Jalisco as a center for reflection located in Zapopan but important for the entire state. The second half of this issue focuses on one of the determining characteristics of Zapopan: the devotion to the Virgin of Expectation. Re née de la Torre describes the annual fiesta of October 12, the day on which this holy image crosses the wide avenue that unites the cap ital of Jalisco to the former village on its way back to its sanctuary. Each of the 3000 dancers taking part thanks "La Generala" in his or her own way. Alfonso Alfaro's essay re veals the origins of this type of celebration. Juan José Doftan offers a portrait of an intel lectual landmark in Jalisco's society: Fray Luis del Refugio de Palacio, a Franciscan monk from Zapopan who lived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and was the author of an exten sive body of work—though he described himself as an "unworthy Franciscan." We close this edition with Guillermo de la Peña's description of the ancient tradition of the Tastoanes—a ritual feast commemorat ing the intervention of the apostle Santiago in the sixteenth-century battles against the Spaniards to liberate the Indians of the region. In several towns around the municipality, this annual offering, brimming in movement and color, is not only a fascinating and moving spectacle but a community-building activity that makes each participant feel part of a spiritual entity, where each individual plays a special role. Translated by Michelle Suderman. MULTIPLE CONTRASTS Guillermo García Oropeza To understand Zapopan, at least in demo graphic and economic terms (compared to Mexico City and Monterrey), we must first understand not only the original town but al so the vast and unusual conurbation of Gua dalajara that is now, to many people's sur prise, one of the country's largest cities, because this "clear city," as Agustín Yáñez dubbed it—the capital of Jalisco and, it could be said, of western Mexico—has a peculiar or even unique history. Unlike Mexico City—the eternal imperial seat, bom to rule—and unlike other cities in New Spain that were established near productive mines or alongside important trade routes, Guadalajara is somewhat the fruit of a whim... or even of resentment. Indeed, Guadalajara was born to be the capital of a failed king dom, "Greater Spain," that Ñuño Bertrán de Guzmán established to compete with New Spain, Hernán Cortés's visionary creation. Bel trán de Guzmán was a most successful villain among sixteenth-century conquistadors: driv en by ambition and greed, in the aftermath of his abuse of power at the Audiencia de Mé xico (the viceregal court of law), he devoted himself to discovering and conquering a northwestern kingdom in the deserted conti nental area stretching from the limits of the Tarascan nation and the present-day state of Colima to the Canadian border. He even planned to extend it as far as the cities of gold of the Amazon. And though New Galicia (as the realm of Greater Spain was more mod estly called in the end) never outshone Cor tés' realms, it was indeed a vast "kingdom," however impoverished. In order to govern it a capital had to be created, which would later be called Guadalajara, in homage to Beltrán de Guzmán's shabby hometown in Spain. But the dreadful conquistador never did see his capital founded as by that time he had in curred the wrath of the king of Spain and was on the run. Guadalajara was nonetheless es tablished in a valley in western Mexico after being displaced many times, as settlers had to flee from rather unneighborly Indian tribes. From the outset, colonial Guadalajara had three distinguishing traits: it was wretchedly poor, highly institutional, and yet with a pop ulation of mainly European stock. The city's poverty was due to the fact that it lacked mines and exportable produce; some of its institutions were secular, but the most impor tant ones were religious—its bishopric would extend its influence over much of largely un inhabited territories of North America. The eth nic homogeneity derived from the fact that "Guadalaxara" (the original spelling of the name) had been a city of Spaniards whose residents were "people of reason and of light colored eyes," segregated under ridiculous Apartheid-like rules from the natives who dwelled in "satellite" towns—if we may bor row the modern urban planning term. Thus, to the east of Guadalajara, beyond the San Juan de Dios River, lay Analco, Tlaquepaque and Tonalá, while to the south, Mexicaltzingo was inhabited (as its name indicates) by the Mexicas who had lent Beltrán de Guzmán a helping hand in his campaign of conquest. Mezquitán and Huentitán languished in the north, while in the northwest, on a yellow plain far, far away from the city, was Zapopan. Evidently, the Indian villages were very use ful, as they were a source of meek-spirited and yet highly skilled manpower for the ta patios (as Guadalajara's residents are called in Spanish) who lovingly cultivated an elegant laziness, as well as the terrible greed which, in these parts, served to supplant their re pressed sexuality. While the inhabitants of Analco, Tlaquepaque, Tonalá and Mexicaltzin go were expert artisans, Zapopan's residents were definitely peasants, since even then it was the land of maize and shady orchards. Zapopan, founded in 1542, the same year as Guadalajara, was moreover a Franciscan community. The Friars Minor were as impor tant in the west as the Dominicans and Au gustinians were in other parts of Mexico. After converting the natives who had survived Beltrán de Guzmán's war of conquest, they established religious edifices throughout the region, including one in Zapopan, where they Page 65: Basilica of Zapopan. 66 • Margarita de Orellana Michelle Suderman. Guillermo García Oropeza</page><page sequence="3">erected a monastery and church that even tually graduated to the rank of basilica as its fame grew thanks to the local Virgin. This image, made of sugar-cane paste in Mi choacán, is not precisely a work of art (neither a beautiful "Italian Madonna" nor an attrac tive "Andalusian Virgin") but it is indeed a very capable, energetic and delicate icon. Its trav els began during the Conquest, when it hung as a medallion from the neck of Fray Antonio de Segovia as he preached to the natives over hill and over dale, before being placed safe and sound inside its monastery. Around April 1721, the bishop of Guadalajara request ed it on loan in order to save him as well as the city from a devastating plague and from the terrible floods and lightning storms which were taking place. Since both the bishop's prayers were answered (though he died soon after ward), the statue was thereafter invited back to visit Guadalajara's churches during the rainy season. Each year it is returned to Zapopan on October 12, which in Guadalajara is not Día de la Raza (a national holiday celebrating Mex ico's ethnic roots) nor Columbus Day, but the day of an enormous pilgrimage in honor of the "passage of the Virgin." Of course this Virgin does not stand alone; rather, she forms part of a divine, iconograph ic trio which further includes the Virgin of Talpa (made famous by writer Juan Rulfo) and that of San Juan de los Lagos. 'The three coma dres," as chronicler Juan López calls them, are the three provincial creóle virgins who compete with the federal, centralist, indige nous Virgin of Guadalupe-Tonantzin. Zapo pan, then, is the creation of a Virgin who, in spite of her small stature (thirty-four centime ters without the crown), has garnered many titles and honors, among them that of Gene rala and patron of traveling merchants, not to mention her continued supervision of hydro logical matters, which is why to this day she is carried in a procession along the shores of Lake Chapala, in the hope that she will ac complish the improbable miracle of filling it up again to its former waterline. For years Zapopan was that very remote corn-farming village where the Virgin spent the beginning and end of each year. It was a lackluster town, like so many others in Jalisco, but it had its monastery, the roughhewn, ru ral baroque church and its Generala. But then Guadalajara began to grow—in 1964, it cele brated the birth of its millionth citizen and be stowed upon him the honorary titles of gov ernor, mayor and archbishop. From then on the city could no longer comfortably fit with in its own boundaries, and it began to spread in a northeasterly direction, toward the mu nicipality of Zapopan, creating a posh district equivalent to London's West End (the east and the south, let us remind ourselves, are for lowly Indians). The first suburbs to sprout up were spacious developments still surrounded by cornfields; those that followed were direct urban exten sions of Guadalajara—most of them affluent communities, especially those laid out on hills to afford residents a panoramic view; they bore such names as Lomas del Valle, Lomas de San Javier or Jardines del Bosque. The lat ter was somewhat faithful to Luis Barragán's city planning project, with its inevitable Ma thias Goeritz sculpture, while others aspired to outclass Cholula in sheer quantity of church es, or included among their landmarks a repli ca of Teotihuacán's Fyramld of the Sun. And we should not fail to mention Bugambilias, a neighborhood perched atop the southern hill of Cerro del Coli that is a kind of acropolis overlooking—and taking pity on—the polluted city of Guadalajara on the plains below. Today Zapopan—the conurbation—is where many of the wealthiest tapatios live, especially those who have transformed cornfields into "preserves," i.e. gated communities which are indeed selective and supposedly off limits to people who are not society "acquaintances" or otherwise well-mannered gentlefolk. But of course Zapopan also has middle-class and working-class neighborhoods, and its population count must now have broken the million mark. To provide services for this grow ing multitude the pioneering Plaza del Sol shopping mall was created, purporting to be the largest in Latin America. Others have been built, each new project more ambitious than the previous one; they function—as they do everywhere—as the only centers of commu nity life, for want of old-style squares or parks. None of them, I am afraid, would win a design prize, although they do feature the dernier cri in postmodern or high-tech architecture, two styles that emerged with globalization. Zapopan of Guadalajara, occupying a vague territory whose north-south axis is approxi mately twelve kilometers long, is not only a residential or bedroom community, as it is the home of some of the metropolitan area's most important institutions, like a miniature tapatio version of Wall Street whose squat skyscrapers peer over the green pastures of yet another wealthy community called the Country Club. There are aiso some luxury hotels, private universities (four or five of them), as well as hospitals where one can die an elegant death—if one does not have the means to do so in Houston. This am biance extends to the exemplary industrial zones which are supremely clean, well or dered and environmentally friendly, and exist in sharp contrast to Guadalajara's chaotic old industrial area, which grew outward like the rings of a tree. While Guadalajara is—with the exception of a handful of colonial buildings—a city of both the nineteenth century and the "modem" era (that is to say, the first eighty years of the twentieth century), the conurbation of Zapopan is pri marily contemporary, featuring a chaotic, cheerful, typically Mexican mix of eclectic ar chitectural genres (including a sort of neo colonialism that is fond of mini-domes and tile roofs, self-styled Barragán imitations ut terly devoid of his architecture's spirit, or the unlikely tapatio version of the Provengal style) as well as bold avant-garde projects and un classiflable, delirious styles. This Zapopan (and I am not referring to the old town with its basilica, to which has recently been added a vast plaza that is a charming example of a certain colonial-ranchero breed of kitsch) is surely not a city of art like Puebla or Oaxaca, but it is a very good example of the congested, heterogeneous, chaotic, Mexico of today which nonetheless displays undeni able vigor. Covering all of western and north western Guadalajara, this strip city is, whether we like it or not, one of the country's most dy namic centers. The conurbation of Zapopan is obviously suffering from an identity crisis, or perhaps a legitimacy crisis. It no longer bears any hint of the ancient corn-farming village peopled by devout worshipers of Mary, and Guadalajara perceives it as something built overnight, devoid of memories and history. Living in Zapopan is like living in a no-man's land, in suburbia, on the outskirts, nowhere. It is a city without a center, lacking a community identity, and yet it is only concerned about its growth—just like a teenager—and no one knows when this will stop. This Zapopan occupies a tiny part of the southernmost section of an 890-square-kllo meter municipal precinct. Towns inhabited pri marily by campesinos continue to preserve their humble traditions on this vast territory, and they have little to offer the traveler seeking visual pleasure (except for the odd, very minor pre-Hispanic ruin or romantic industrial hacien da, such as that of La Escoba). However, one of the most important national parks in west ern Mexico (La Primavera) is also located here, and in the northeast lies the magnificent Barranca, a monumental gorge at the bot tom of which flows the Rio Santiago (for merly known as the Lerma). One of the fa vorite sites of Mexican painter Dr. Atl, it separates the rolling plains of central Jalisco from the majestic, untamed Sierra Madre. Be yond the gorge lies the beginning, one could say, of the Far West, while the district's west em section borders yet another unique land scape: the blue hills of agave from which tequila is brewed, that wealthy country which, to paraphrase a local poet, was be queathed to us by a Devil who fights the Virgin of Zapopan for the soul of this land and of this city—a city unburdened by a past and therefore a place where everything, in the future, is possible. Translated by Richard Moszka. NOSTALGIC CONTRASTS Ana Maria de la O. Castellanos In the former village of Zapopan, it seems as if the day never comes to an end, because • 67 • Richard Moszka. Ana María de la O. Castellanos</page><page sequence="4">the moment the sun sets the fluorescent lights automatically turn on. However, it is at this hour of the day that memories begin to flow from those members of the community who have lived for decades in what has now been designated the seat of the municipal govern ment. Some recall Pancho, the night watch man, who was in charge of lighting the forty oil lamps that illuminated the streets of the town in the early twentieth century. This was prior to 1907, the year electric lighting was installed. At that time, public transport in Zapopan con sisted of the so-called tranvía de mulitas, a tram drawn by mules, which was open on the sides so the passengers could feast their eyes on the changing landscape during the hour or so it took to reach Guadalajara. They passed fields of vegetables, corn, barley, wheat and beans, the Gigantera barrio grow ing up along the track, the Zoquipan brick works, the Atemajac factory, the cantina in La Moromusa and the streets of Mezquitán. Fas cinated by this scenery, the travelers also had to pay a price, because during the dry season they would reach the city covered in dust. The mules were changed in the station at Ate majac, with the fresh ones making the return journey between Atemajac and Guadalajara. In Zapopan, these animals were stabled in the portico of the so-called station behind the present town hall, where the first electrical plant was installed. The tramway was the hot spot of Zapopan's life at that time. The locals called one street Los Rieles (the Rails), and another La Curva (the Bend), because the vehicles, having circled the town, set forth for Guadalajara from there. Even before the arrival of electricity, there were several established neighborhoods in Zapopan, such as Arriba, Huaracha, Panteón, and, some time later, Sagrado Corazón. The main streets were Calle de la Ancha or del Sanctuario, Cedro (los Padres Torres, la Venta or Solis), Romero, los Orozco, la Curva and Tesistán, at the end of which lay Margarito's shop, El Chigüilín, a popular meeting-place for the cowboys and muleteers from Tesistán and San Cristóbal. The streets often bore the last name, nickname or first name of a person who lived there. For this reason, Calle 16 de Septiembre was also known as Calle de los Orozco, because there were two families in Zapopan with this last name who were relat ed to almost everyone else. Soledad Orozco de Ávila Carracho, who became the first lady of Mexico, is part of this family tree. With the arrival of electricity during the first decade of the twentieth century, the children could spend more time outside on the street corners, where lights were installed, though they only illuminated a small surrounding area. The electric trolley, which ran along the main streets of the town, was also built at this time. Cars were not a danger for pedes trians in those days, but people had to be careful to keep out of the way of wagons and the odd runaway horse. The land was another daily cause of con cern. Since the streets of Zapopan were not cobbled until the end of the 1930s, dust storms swirled through the town during April and May. The children also raised clouds of dust when they pushed the volantín (a kind of merry-go-round) around outside the church on the Virgin's feast days. While the children played, the adults would meet on the cor ners early in the morning to bask in the sun and on the sidewalks in the afternoon to play lotería (similar to bingo). The wagons would be parked next to the houses, perhaps still laden with the com harvested at one of Zapo pan's ranches, such as El Vergel, Los Bele nes, La Tuzanía, El Zapote, El Vigía, which have now become residential districts. The Orozco family owned these ranches and the hacienda known as La Venta del Astillero. One of the most important and most splen did was San Antonio, now the Ramón Corona Air Force Base, where there was an orchard full of fruit trees and a ranch called San Acacio. During the rainy season, some of the more affluent families from Guadalajara went to Za popan on outings and for picnics in the coun try. The road to Tesistán was one of the busi est routes. Each family rode in a wagon, and a long line of them could be seen rolling down the road. When they returned in the evening, the animals drawing the wagons were guided by campesinos carrying lit torches, while the family sat quietly in the wagon. Other popu lar places for outings were the new parish of Seattle, where people could have a meal and spend a peaceful afternoon, and El CedraJ or chard, the property of the owners of La Es coba textile factory. After the earthquakes of May 1912, many fam ilies left town to live on their ranches for a time. These had large corrals for shucking com and beans, which were placed in piles that dis persed as the horses went round and round trampling them. Then the husks were picked up, aired and cleaned. The countryside around Zapopan looked beautiful at harvest time. Late In the afternoon, wagons laden with corncobs arrived in the town, mainly from the Tesistán Valley. These would be unloaded on the sidewalks where they were snapped up by families (aided by farmhands) eager to share in the harvest. Most houses had a granary, and the com in those days was better, according to some. The houses had brick floors, which the more house-proud would cover In tile, and flat roofs supported by wooden beams. The passage at the entrance had benches along the walls. This was often used to herd the cattle Into their corral behind the house. Domestic dairy production played an Important role In daily life, because a large number of Zapopan's women used milk to make sweets, cheese, drinks (such as eggnog), cajeta (butterscotch spread) and desserts. With the passage of time, even cooking methods changed. Previously, people would light the fire with ocote pine, which they could buy in the market for one or two cents per bundle. It is said that this reddish wood "even seemed to drip honey as it burned." Then the fire was fed with com husks that were kept in the granary. Some people made their tor tillas over a wood fire in the yard, which was generally full of soot. The rest of the food would be cooked Indoors on a charcoal grill. Fuel was a privilege: loads of wood and charcoal were left at wealthy homes once or twice a month. With the arrival of electricity, however, the lo cals changed to electric grills, and later to oil stoves and finally, gas cookers. Essential items in the kitchen included nixtamal (com for tor tilla dough), ingredients for mole sauces, the metate (grinding stone) and clay sinks. Housewives boiled com for nixtamal every day, and then vigorously ground it on the me tate because they had no mills. One woman remembers how "one could hear the crunch, crunch of the grains of corn splitting." When the first mill arrived in Zapopan, a measure of nixtamal cost two cents. The women fre quently complained that the millers gave them less nixtamal, because it was below the chalk line marked on their pots when they arrived. The price was marked on the dough with a fin ger; each fingerprint cost one cent, and a full hand cost five cents. The day began very early on the ranches, when one could hear the corn being ground and the milk squirting into pails. On Sundays and the Virgin's feast days, the main meeting place was the central plaza of Zapopan, also known as the grand garden, with its trees trimmed into animal and basket shapes. In bygone days, the space was di vided by a low fence In order to segregate the masses from the elite: those in sandals walked along the side and the others walked In the middle. A band from San Juan de Oco tán would often entertain the crowd with their afternoon concerts. The young people's curfew was usually when the public clock, which could be heard In every corner of the town, struck ten. Rich families celebrated a saint's day by or ganizing dances at home. On these occa sions, they would kill a hen or a turkey, or cook pork in pipián (sauce made of squash seeds) or adobo (sauce with various dried chilies). They accompanied this with a hot drink called ponche, made with hibiscus, Spanish plums, pomegranates and oranges. When it was a very special occasion, such as a par ty for the heads of the household, relatives and neighbors were invited to help them pre pare a tamale feast. Some families organized soirees, or staged short theatrical works using the appropriate backdrop in someone's house. At these events, women wore their "Sunday best or dressed up for the occasion." At that time, shawls were of many different styles and colors, such as those from Santa Maria and • 68 •</page><page sequence="5">one design called masón, which was of black and red silk squares, while others were mot tled. They bought them in Guadalajara, be cause there were no large stores in Zapo pan. Magazines and newspapers also came from Guadalajara, except for a local weekly newspaper, which published news of social events and pictures of debutantes. Young women wore stockings which were first made of poplin and later of silk, although the hems of their dresses had, of course, to cover them to their toes. As time went by, fashions changed and they wore their hair short and straight. Later, dress hems were raised to just cover the knees, which was shocking to many. Rich families who vaca tioned in Guadalajara brought the latest trends in fashion back with them, which the local young women inevitably copied. Rich women would go to the local seam stresses, taking along fashionable fabrics such as crepe, silk foulard, and Charmeuse. And since the young women had to learn the manual arts, teachers would come from Guadalajara periodically to give courses in embroidery, dressmaking, and flower arrang ing to a small group at somebody's house. Poor people wore baggy calico pants which were often worn rolled up. However, when they came into Zapopan they would have to put on tailored pants upon reaching the out skirts of town, to avoid being fined. They wore a navy blue or red sash to tighten their pants, but did not tuck their shirts In. Calico was made in the Rio Blanco or La Escoba factories. Peasant women's wore clothing made with percale from the Atemajac factory. They used wide pleated and frilled petticoats and, like the rich women, invariably had a shawl thrown over their shoulders. There was no market as such in the town. The pilgrims who came to visrt the Virgin dur ing the early decades of the twentieth cen tury had to make do with a meal from one of the stalls on Calle Sola or in the porticos around the square. This generally consisted of noodle soup, followed by pork in mole, mole de masa (with corn dumplings), mole ranchero (with chilies) or stew. There was al so a stand that sold sorbets of different fla vors—hibiscus, guava or milk—scraped from a block of ice into a ball. As times changed, stalls selling birria (roasted goat or mutton) were introduced and they soon became very popular among the visitors. The grocery stores on what is now Eva Bri seño Street sold brown cane sugar, salt, rice, corn, beans, refined sugar and chocolate, which the grocers ordered from a local woman. In every neighborhood, there were corner stores which sold essential items; some offered alcohol to their customers, which was obviously sold under the counter because if it became common knowledge they would get a bad name in the communi ty. Goods were sold by the honor system, partly because the locals knew that the shop owners, aware of their standing, weighed everything correctly, and also gave away the powder from the bottom of the sugar bin and leftover lye for laundering clothes. Zapopan's most important merchants at that time were Antonio Orozco and Modesto Briseño. One daily topic of conversation was water, its sources and distribution. In fact, Guadala jara's water supply came from the Tesistán Valley which was within the municipality. The aqueducts designed by Father Buzeta in the late nineteenth century carried this vital re source along its canals from the rich aquifer ous layer of the region. The townspeople gen erally had to get their water from hydrants and public fountains located on street cor ners, but some had artesian wells in the house, or used the water carriers, who deliv ered water to many homes. Many went to Potrero de los Padres and to the monastery orchard behind the church to fill their pitch ers from one of the two water lines which came directly from Tuzania. As the people of Zapopan used to say, this water "tasted like Mexican gum." Other sources of water were the Colomos River, which never dried up, or the source of La Campana Creek west of the town, where, it is said, "the water sprang warm from the ground," unlike the one at El Vigía ranch. Here there was a reservoir in which the young sters often bathed, but most people bathed in the river, where the women would do the laundry with the current swirling around their waists. On more than one occasion during the rainy season, however, the washerwomen as well as others were swept away by the current. Other popular bathing places were the Colomos reservoir and La Castañeda and El Profundo public baths, which had sinks where one could wash one's clothes for a few cents. There was a major transformation in the coun tryside around Zapopan when two armed movements ignited Jalisco during the first thir ty years of the twentieth century. This gave rise to a flux of migrant rural workers seeking security in Zapopan. In the late 1940s, the electric trolley disap peared and was replaced by modern buses. Their noisy engines soon drowned out the whistle of Don Chemita, the postman, and the cries of the aguamiel ven dors and water car riers. The change did not come about from one day to the next; it took the locals some time to get used to the bus. They gave one the name of El Atlántico, because the driver was a very tall and muscular young man. The early buses followed the route the former trol ley car had taken. This daily transit back and forth gradually led to the absorption of the municipality of Zapo pan by the developing metropolitan area of Guadalajara. This was confirmed, in particular, by the opening of two new avenues: Sole dad Orozco, also known as Prolongación Américas, and Manuel Avila Camacho. Traf fic now flows along these roads day and night. At times, the residents of Zapopan find it dif ficult to demarcate the boundary between what was formerly their town and what is to day a huge city. Translated by Charlotte Broad. j\¿/leteent/i - (x'/t/ttr// fTric/orú'x Guillermo de la Peña The dust had barely settled after Mexico's wars of independence when a group of en trepreneurs had the idea of emulating the progress of nations in more northern climes. They proposed to set up modem factories for mass-producing goods, taking as their mod el the industrial colonies that had been flour ishing in northern England since the eigh teenth century. Symbols of the imaginative drive of the epoch, they were located on the banks of rivers and canals to take advantage of the hydraulic power. Generally, they manufactured thread and cloth, woven on mechanical looms. Workers and their families resided in living quarters inside the Industrial complex where there were on-site stores as well as religious and recreational services available to them. Lucas Alamán, politician, impresario and conservative ideologue, had been exposed to them during his years of study in Great Britain. He sensed their great advantage in the fact that they established a system of direct control over the workers, which, while benefiting them, also guaran teed their loyalty. The new style of Industrial organization was set up close to Jalisco in 1838, with the estab lishment of the Jauja factory in Tepic. Sub sequently, the major textile concerns were in stalled in the municipality of Zapopan because of the availability of water and the proximity to Guadalajara, the mercantile hub of the west ern region of the country. Thus, the colony called La Prosperidad Jalisciense commenced with the water supply assured by an enor mous aqueduct erected in the ancient pueblo of Atemajac del Valle and by a dam built at the La Escoba hacienda, in the township of the same name. The colonies La Experiencia (1851) and Rio Blanco (1866) followed, both founded on uninhabited lands. All took ad vantage of protectionist policies and gov ernment loans (though there is no evidence that any was received from the Alamán-spon sored Banco de Avío). In the case of La Pros peridad Jalisciense, the Jalisco state govern ment even sent prisoners to work directly on the construction. Government officials, the elite and the common folk alike shared the hope and pride in what they saw as the ad vent of modernity and abundance. The most spectacular and emblematic of the establishments was La Prosperidad Jaliscien se, better known simply as the Atemajac •69» Charlotte Broad. Guillermo de la Peña</page><page sequence="6">factory. In 1857, Marvin Wheat, a U.S. citizen writing under the pseudonym Cincinnatus, published a series of letters about his travels in western Mexico in which he offers a de tailed description of the place. About the huge hydraulic wheel at Atemajac, he mar veled that it was, "well-proportioned and can be dismantled. [...] It is strong and beautifully symmetrical." Forged in New Jersey, it meas ured forty feet in diameter (about thirteen meters) and Its movement was "smooth, graceful and magnificent," driven by the wa ter flowing through the majestic aqueduct and regulated by a gate. The factory was housed in a one hundred by thirty-meter building. From its inception, it had ninety looms where two hundred Mexican opera tors labored, along with several American mechanics. The systematic arrangement of the machines and the precise coordination of the work were notable. Though smaller, the factory at La Escoba equally impressed this traveler. The owner, Manuel Olasagarre, had taken it upon himself to construct taste ful buildings surrounded by gardens. He brought in trees from other regions of Mexico as well as "from the finest nurseries in all of New York and New Jersey," and even some Lebanon cedars, to create a forest without equal in the region. According to the traveler, Olasagarre represented the prototype of the modern Mexican businessman—educated in England, enterprising, generous, and open to the winds of change. What Marvin Wheat's letters don't mention is that his part ners, Manuel Escandón from Mexico City and the Barrón brothers from Teplc, were using La Escoba as a front for smuggling contraband textiles into the country. Cincinnatus returned home without getting to meet two more of the region's great entre preneurs, José Palomar and Francisco Mar tinez Negrete. Neither one had enjoyed a privileged youth, nor had they studied in top drawer schools. José Palomar, bom in 1807 in La Magdalena, Jalisco, was the son of a Span ish businessman from the Aragón region who, in 1811, along with other gachupines (Spaniards), got his throat slit by Miguel Hidal go's troops. Orphaned and obligated to help support his family, he went to work at a young age for Jalisco's top three businessmen, Jo sé Estrada, Juan Manuel Caballero and Ma nuel García Sancho. In 1834, he married Garcia Sancho's daughter. Thanks to his many con nections, José Palomar founded one of Gua dalajara's first modem warehouses, and a few years later, was able to invest part of his capital in the creation of La Prosperidad Ja lisciense. His first partner was Francisco Mar tinez Negrete, a Spaniard bom in 1797 in Can tabria, near Santander. He had crossed the ocean in search of his fortune, stopping first in Mazatlán, then moving on to Guadalajara. He was another protégé of the top business leaders, and with his second marriage, be came part of the family. Palomar and Martinez Negrete were soon competitors in the textile business, as the lat ter became the principal stockholder in La Experiencia. However, they didn't let this get in the way of friendship, as they teamed up to start other businesses. Later on, their nu merous descendents were to weave a complicated web of relationships between the families. Both men operated in a broad range of innovative activities—commerce, in dustry, finance, transportation, agriculture, re al estate, mining, communications. Together, they founded a paper mill, El Batán, which op erated on hydraulic power from Atemajac. In their old age, they hooked up once again to pioneer the Guadalajara Telegraph Company. And, just for good measure, José Palomar was active in the conservative politics that favored protectionist policies for the coun try's enterprises. To a large extent, the success of the Zapo pan textile mills in the midst of political turmoil and social upheaval is due to the multifaceted personalities of these entrepreneurs and the moral influence they exerted over the workers and society at large. Upon their deaths within a year of each other (Palomar in 1873 and Martinez Negrete in 1874), they were lauded as benefactors and philanthropists. An im mense multitude gathered for Palomar's fu neral, and the workers of La Prosperidad Ja lisciense were right in the front row. They published an obituary praising him as a "fa ther-figure, full of consideration for his work ers [...] a boss who knew how to respect the dignity of the working man." His beneficiar ies—sons and grandsons—did not enjoy the same success. Toward the end of the centu ry, the Zapopan plants passed into the hands of a French consortium whose fortune had al so been staked on commerce. The industrial colony model began to lose ground. No longer was the housing destined exclusively for the workers. Wrth the coming of electrical ener gy, plants no longer needed to be located close to water. Even so, La Prosperidad Ja lisciense, El Batán and La Experiencia, con tinued operations for several decades. Then came the Revolution, and workers acquired a new, more militant awareness. The old pater nalistic style was out; labor unions were in... But that is another story. Translated by Harry Porter. (lf}/u'/Y f%aoe y{// t/l£ {/)/'() O (TX Lina Mercedes Cruz The ancient profession of mule-driving con tinued to be practiced well into the twentieth century in the area of the ravine next to Ixca tán, Zapopan, due to the region's particular geographic features. [...] During the colonial period and much of the nineteenth century, it was indeed the only means of transportation in the area, and for this reason a great number of people were employed in the trade. Since it was an essential means for the transport of goods, individuals were required to carry out specific tasks, and thus ensure the trade's proper functioning. But this specialization dis appeared as the importance of mule-driving dwindled, so much so that in the whole ravine area there now remans but a single drove of mules, and one muleteer and herder em ployed in the business. THE CASE OF IXCATÁN When construction began on the highway to Zacatecas in the late 1940s, the practice of transporting gpods on mule-back began to disappear from the area of the ravine. Local mule-drivers point out the fact that long stretches of their bridle path were used in building the Zacatecas highway; however, they add, their route was more direct than that of the highway Dionisio Casillas, a herder from Ixcatán, a town in the district of Zapopan, recounts how it used to take him six to eight hours to transport his wares to Guadalajara; it now takes thirty minutes. In Ixcatán, most of the townsfolk employed this method to trans port their goods to various sites. The vil lagers were farmers, as they continue to be to this day, and mule-driving was the only means they had to convey their merchan dise to markets. The products they sold from July to March were firewood and coal, and occasionally cal abash and guava, when they were in season. April, May and June were high season, that is to say the harvesting period for such fruits as plums, guamúchil, mangos and soursops. At this time of the year in addition to Ixcatán locals, out-of-town mule-drivers who owned their own teams of donkeys or mules put them to work in the area. They came from Atotonilco, San Martín de las Flores, Tonalá, San Juan de Ocotán and Jocotán, to men tion but a few. On their way back from Guadalajara, these muleteers bore loads of farm equipment, cloth, kitchen utensils, medicine and supplies which could only be found in the city and which they generally purchased at a store named La Luna, located on Del Moro Street— destroyed when Federalismo Avenue was built—where the owner gave them credit. In the city they stayed either at the La Palma hostelry on Reforma street or at the Mesón del Refugio, which is now a park, next to the Refugio Church—depending on where there was room. They never spent more than a few hours there—just enough for a quick rest while their mules were fed. Firewood and coal were usually sold in Ate majac. During fruit season muleteers went di rectly to Guadalajara to distribute their pro duce at the Corona market. Occasionally at the height of the season they made two trips in a row, with one day of rest in between so • 70 • Harry Porter. Lina Mercedes Cruz</page><page sequence="7">the animals would be strong enough to bear the journey. Mule-drivers finally stopped traveling to the marketplaces in the mid-1950s. Though there was no government interference, they them selves gradually decided to retire from the trade; moreover, the distribution process changed with the appearance of middlemen who formed camps where merchandise was received, stored and then taken in pickup trucks to the markets, usually the Corona Market, and then the Abastos. Dionisio Casillas recalls that around the 1950s they earned thirty pesos for three days' work as coal muleteers, while as laborers working on the Paso de Guadalupe bridge—where some of them found jobs—they earned seven pesos a day. While a mule-driver earned a to tal of sixty pesos for an average of two trips per week, a laborer only earned forty-two pe sos for a six-day work week. Laborers were only paid every two weeks; fur thermore, a few pesos were taken off each salary as a mandatory contribution to a so called retirement fund. They were paid from an office in an area of closely-packed row houses near the Atemajac factory, near pres ent-day Fidel Velázquez street. A pickup truck took them there, but they were left to their own devices on their way home. This certainly benefited the town of Atemajac, as laborers crossed it to seek transportation back to their villages. From there buses trav eled to Zapopan, itself a transfer point for oth er buses en route to Ixcatán. Often, a good part of the workers' salaries was spent in Ate meyac's cantinas, establishments with which the muleteers were indeed familiar. By 1949, for instance, seventeen blocks of row-hous es had been built in Atemajac, and though not all of them were yet inhabited, several cantinas had already opened for business. The most popular were that of Don Simón, another with an old-style jukebox next to the bridge, and Los Tres Equípales, located quite close to a hostelry on Trabajo Avenue (today Federa lismo) where Ixcatán muleteers usually spent the night when they carried firewood and coal. This hostelry was one of many businesses on which "modernity" took its toll: as their pa trons—the muleteers—began to vanish, so did they. Translated by Richard Moszka. UNEXPLORED CONTRASTS ¿/n//? 0(0/i Za/w/) an José Maria Muriá I have heard more than a few knowledgeable tapatios (the people of Guadalajara) affirm that the seat of the municipality of Zapopan is nothing more than a modest population cen ter that lives in the shadow of the sanctuary founded there over three hundred years ago. Perhaps I myself would have been able to attest to such an outlandish idea if it had not been for a certain mayor of Zapopan who, ten years ago, had the sense to give asylum to El Colegio de Jalisco in the wake of the criminal gas-main explosions of April 22,1992, which obliged this institution of higher learn ing to abandon its original home, built ex pro feso in the old neighborhood of Analco, on the other side of the San Juan de Dios River running through Guadalajara. The aforementioned Colegio was thus sal vaged and also commenced a romance with the very old town of Zapopan and its inhabi tants—a relationship which I believe to have been of some benefit to both parties. The fact of the matter is that my daily life for the last decade has permitted me not only the pleasure of sharing many things with the peo ple of Zapopan but also the opportunity to gradually increase my knowledge of and fondness for the place, even to the point of laying down deep roots there. I have realized, among other things, that de spite its accessibility to millions of tapatios to day—many of whom sleep, study or work, un beknownst to them, within the municipal limits of Zapopan—for the majority, the old "com growing township" is unexplored territory. As of now, only a few brave souls make incur sions, preferably by night, into the rich and var ied restaurant zone that has arisen from its gutters, a kind of cultural byproduct of El Cole gio de Jalisco, but they don't venture any fur ther; the same goes for most of the habitués of the public activities of that institution. Za popan's haciendas and markets, the cultur al center, La Generala charro ring, some of the attractions in outlying communities... these are rarely frequented by visitors to the area, though now more than before, as it is no longer possible to make those summer "out ings" to the country that were so common yesteryear, given that there are no longer many rural areas close at hand: "When the rain/ from the mountain/ didn't allow us/ to go to Zapopan." Some educational institutions with campus es in this municipality don't even seem to be aware of the fact: the imprints on their spo radic publications indicate they are located in Guadalajara. Only El Colegio de Jalisco has kept its center of bibliographic production in defectibly ensconced in the municipality of Za popan, for which reason—to the horror of so many other institutions—there are months in which this town boasts the largest editorial production in Jalisco, just as at one time, no one in the country could beat Zapopan in the cultivation of com. I agree that Zapopan's drawing power is owed primarily to the vast popularity of the diminutive image of the Virgin Mary that is venerated here, along with its magnificent basilica and enormous convent. One only has to recall the song: "O Virgin of Zapopan,/ You have seen my misfortune,/ Let me weep for the pain,/ In case I never see you again." Outsiders think of such demonstra tions of devotion before anything else when they hear the name Zapopan. It is also com mon knowledge that the image—"tiny but quite miraculous"—forms part of the large contingent of Mexican officers without the command of any troops. In 1823, the local Congress saw fit to name her "General of the Armies of Jalisco," thus perhaps confus ing her indisputable leadership qualities with mass killing. Nevertheless, besides conventual life, and of tentimes completely removed from it, if not entirely opposed to it, Zapopan possesses an extremely rich and attractive social history, which would be worthwhile examining more closely due.to the geographic and economic plurality of this vast region. Next to the convent—whose shadow pro jects far beyond the limits of the state of Ja lisco and even beyond those of the former Franciscan province of Santiago de Xalisco— live and have lived people of pure Zapopano stock. These are individuals who are fully aware of their identity—an attitude that many other municipal seats in the country would do well to emulate. True, its proximity to Guadalajara has had an excessively strong impact on the population of Zapopan. It could not be any other way, giv en the rapid growth of the capital of Jalisco over the past eight decades. Still and all, Za popan is far from being just another satellite town. It leads its own life and is not a depend ency of the metropolis, though its relationship with other districts of this sprawling urban area have necessarily become closer than ever be fore, given the awkwardness that would result if every municipality were to take different po sitions on common issues, such as public transportation, drinking water, the police force, sanitation, and so forth. However, it also has the right to determine which relationships will hinder its development and harmonious existence. But there is still much to be said on the subject, and above all, we must not lose sight of the fact that be fore long, Zapopan will be one of the most prominent communities in the country. Translated by Michelle Suderman. Sface/or Andrés Fábregas Puig Zapopan is a district unequalled in all of Mex ico in terms of the number of institutions of higher learning located within its confines. In fact, it shelters most of Jalisco's universities and academic institutions. Of these we can not omit El Colegio de Jalisco, whose pro grams focus on investigation in the social sciences and humanities and on producing high-level researchers. Founded in 1982 by Alfonso de Alba— a writer from Lagos de Moreno who died without see 71' José Maria Muriá Andrés Fábregas Puig</page><page sequence="8">ing the project become a reality—El Colegio de Jalisco had a troubled early history. All signs pointed to it closing its doors before it could fulfill the mission for which it had been creat ed. But the new government which came in to power in 1991 created a more favorable climate for the institution's survival. On Sep tember 11, 1991, historian José María Muriá was sworn in as president of El Colegio de Jalisco, and, with the help of three other his torians (Angélica Peregrina, Jaime Olveda and Agustín Vaca), set up a program for the study of the state of Jalisco. However, the venture was faced with unex pected obstacles: with the terrible gas-main explosions of April 22,1992, El Colegio de Ja lisco was forced to abandon its original home in the magnificent building known as the "patio de los Angeles" in the heart of the Analco neighborhood. Muriá managed to convince Zapopan's town council to loan him a house, free of charge, located at the cor ner of Cinco de Mayo and Francisco Javier Mina streets. This marked the beginning of a new phase in which the institution was shown to be viable. However, in order to achieve its goals, the col lege needed a library to support the work of its researchers. Under the circumstances, José Maria Muriá and Miguel Mathes, an American historian specializing in Northwestern Mexico, came to an agreement for the latter to do nate his book collection. Thus was bom the Mathes Library, originally consisting of forty thousand volumes, a number which has since been doubled. El Colegio de Jalisco has become a respect ed institution thanks to the work of those in dividuals who form part of it. Forty-six issues of the magazine Estudios Jaliscienses have been published, as well as two hundred books, making El Colegio de Jalisco the state's most important press. Furthermore, the college has developed a diploma program for primary and secondary school teachers. Other complementary programs which the in stitution offers are the master's degree in re gional studies and a doctoral program in so cial sciences. The college is also home to a large, beautiful garden—in Náhuatl, a xochimapictli or "bou quet of flowers" which encourages the cre ation of a tlatomapictli, or "bouquet of words." The garden is the hub of the institution, of fering views of the whole college: the admin istrative offices, professors' cubicles, and the auditorium named after Francisco Tenamax tle—the visionary Cazcan Indian leader who fought tirelessly for the rights of his people, and died in battle in Valladolid, Spain—as well as the Mathes Library with its glass facade, the classrooms and the offices of the diplo ma programs. El Colegio de Jalisco fosters intellectual and creative production. Forming part of the mu nicipality of Zapopan, an ancestral land at the heart of Jalisco, the college's academics write history and analyze society and culture, thus contributing the fruits of their intellectual labors to the town's rich daily life.

WANDERING CONTRASTS i~77u&gt; clirgins&amp; Lfy/yrmuryi' Renée de la Torre THE AWAKENING OF DARKEST MEXICO AND HOLLYWOOD PICTURES The pilgrimage of the Virgin of Zapopan, a religious event which brings together a large part of the population of the district of Zapo pan and its neighboring areas, is not an ex clusively religious event; it is rather a ceremo ny which aims to preserve, revive and even reinvent local traditions. If something has dis tinguished the region of Guadalajara it is not indigenous heritage, but rather deep Criollo roots: charros, mariachis, the Jarabe Tapatío (the typical regional dance). All these ele ments are featured in the parade of October 12; however, many of the region's dwellers re fer back to rituals which existed long before these symbols appeared. On October 12, buses, trucks and cars fall silent and sounds from the past fill the air: those of horses and mariachis, military bands, and finally those of the ubiquitous in digenous dances. Many pilgrims don multicol ored headdresses as if to remind us that in Jalisco, at least on this day, Darkest Mexico— the country's indigenous heritage, rooted in pre-Hispanic traditions—remains unforgotten. Some of the choreographies performed bear clear ties to the history of the colonization and evangelization of the region; certain dances al lude to the Chimalhuacan rebellion that took place in 1541, on which occasion the miracu lous statue of Our Lady of Zapopan appeared for the first time, making peace between the Cazcan Indians and the Spaniards. There are close to 300 quadrilles; their mem bers normally wear regular street clothes but on this day they proudly dress in the appropri ate garb to restage the ritual dances of our in digenous ancestors, though they themselves do not pertain to any native ethnic group. Three thousand dancers take part in the pil grimage and make a physical offering of their bodies to the Virgin, whom they call "the Great Mother." The quadrilles are independent groups, i.e. they are not associated with any of the local parishes (expressions of faith such as this one have always formed part of popular religion and, though historically the Church has con doned them, neither are they officially encour aged). Each quadrille is distinguished by the rhythms and instruments its members use, the choreography, but above all by their ap parel. One can see concheros and "Aztec" dance companies staging pre-Hispanic rituals and scenes from the Conquest. They wear great feather headdresses, breastplates and loincloths. The lanceros are newly formed groups whose members dress like Amer indians (such as Apaches). The sonajeros re create traditional regional folk dances and their music is characterized by the sound they make with their leather sandals' metal soles. The matachines perform dances whose origins lie in the state of Zacatecas, using car rizos (lengths of reed) and sonajas (gourds filled with seeds) as instruments. Some dance companies have managed to conserve age-old traditions through a partic ular family's cultural heritage. This is the case of Grupo Azteca, made up of members of the Sandoval family. Close to sixty individuals form part of this quadrille (including parents, chil dren, grandchildren and great-grandchildren). The costumes are contemporary adaptations of Aztec attire: headdresses with feathers from exotic birds and brightly colored cloth ing decorated with rhinestones and sequins. Each year the group creates a whole new wardrobe, family members taking charge of costume design and manufacture. The com pany performs every month for Our Lady of Zapopan, and its members also take part each year in other important pilgrimages. Many dance companies have only recently been formed and their dancers are teenagers or even children from newly developed ur ban areas. These groups can be distin guished from more traditional ones due to the fact that their attire is inspired by the aes thetic of North American Indians. In 1991, Ramiro Ramos founded the Compa ñía de Lanceros del Colli. He designs their costumes himself, finding his inspiration in a popular Mexican comic book, El libro vaque ro. His group consists of thirty-five members who gather each week in their neighbor hood's main square to perform before locals. For Ramos, the goal of the dance is for the performers to express their happiness, in or der to please the Virgin. Moreover, he de mands that members abide by a puritanical code of ethics: none of them are allowed to smoke, drink or dance banda—a style of mu sic and dance he deems inappropriate. To this company, dancing is a way of life: "One must be genuine. That is why I do not let drug-addicts or drunkards form part of my group." However, not all companies impose these kinds of restrictions on their dancers. Another new group formed by middle-class youths (including some college-educated professionals) identify with Mexicanist and New Age movements. Their recreations of in digenous dances are part of a greater quest for transcendental mystical experiences. They wear simple white cotton clothes and carry out purification rituals during their dances. There are many unexpected elements in the ritual. The pilgrimage becomes a carnival of masks. Wardens are put in charge of keeping a semblance of order. They wear grotesque, •72» Renée de la Torre</page><page sequence="9">fantastical costumes and crack their whips, playfully scaring anyone who might be get ting out of line. Among the many costumes, some of the most striking are of ferocious animals: wolves, bears, gorillas and orang utans; however, costumes based on char acters from American horror movies have also become popular—Freddy Krueger, Jason from Friday the Thirteenth, Beetlejuice—in ad dition to the members of the flashy pop-metal band Kiss, whose lyrics were said to summon the devil. Besides these, one can also spy a Winnie the Pooh among the pilgrims, sweet ly waving and blowing kisses to the onlook ers. Nonetheless, the outfits that attracted the most public attention were those of ex-pres ident Carlos Salinas, who was booed, and Vi cente Fox, who was greeted with applause. THE VIRGIN ON PARADE One knows that Our Lady of Zapopan is about to appear when the tone of the procession, in both visual and musical terms, changes from the secular to the religious. After the charros, horse-drawn carriages, mariachis, village bands and dancers, we catch sight of a systematically ordered Church, with eccle siastic and military music playing in the back ground. This faction bears standards from diverse Catholic associations and flags of several parish groups who assemble on designated evenings to worship the statue of Our Lady of Zapopan. From a Volkswagen van, Franciscans recite the rosary, urging the crowd to join them in prayer, though few of those present actually do so. Other young seminarists play the guitar and sing pastoral melodies. Theology faculty students incite onlookers to shout the traditional cheers: "Hail our holy martyrs! Hail Christ the King! Hail the Generala!" They are followed by the military band—a sign that the Virgin is approaching. The image is accompanied by the Cardinal of Guadalajara (wearing pilgrim's attire), bish ops, Franciscan monks, guards of honor, es corts and army bands. On this day over 1000 "soldiers" (and another 500 who come from Mexico City to offer their services) keep an eye on the statue, forming a human shield to protect it against any possible danger and maintaining order among the pilgrims. When the procession passes through Zapo pan's neighboring area, Our Lady's guard of honor consists of over 500 people, all dressed in blue and white, the Virgin Mary's charac teristic colors, bearing her coat of arms on their vestments. They occupy a particular place in the parade, accompanying and guarding the statue, rehearsing all year to march in orderly fashion. The military bands, composed of approximately 150 musicians, play the melody of the Catholic militia (creat ed in response to the Mexican government's anticlerical campaign of the 1930s) to the sound of drums and trumpets. Young boys don blue soldiers' caps for the occasion, while married women wearing black mantillas and typical Andalusian dresses make up the rearguard. The "custodians" (men who have served in the guard for over a decade) sport dark blue suits. The central and lateral crews, made up of adult men, are given the task of pulling the Virgin's float. The cardinal and bish ops walk behind the statue. The most impres sive brigade—in terms of its elegance and for the contrast of its period clothes with con temporary fashion—marches to each side: these are the men of the royal guard, fitted out in striped velvet uniforms with bronze hel mets crowned with feathers, carrying swords and spears—this apparel is in fact a replica of the Vatican's Swiss guard's uniform. They are followed by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, who parade with long white capes and Spanish berets. As the statue of Our Lady passes by, the roar of the crowd grows more intense; some spectators even break into tears from the emotion. On the one hand, the Catholic Church of Gua dalajara, as a decidedly formal institution, at tempts to create a highly orthodox or even militaristic atmosphere of sacred order and worship. It thus evokes recent history, a time when believers had to defend their faith be fore an anticlerical state—a circumstance which has little to do with the present situa tion of the Church in Guadalajara. On the oth er hand, locals and especially dancers at tempt to reinvent an indigenous heritage which transports them back to a past that is more imaginary than real, but that nonethe less speaks of cultural resistance before Spanish colonialism and Catholic orthodoxy. Both these elements are present in the same ritual, though separately. It is curious how the pilgrimage turns into a game of reflections: the members of one faction become the spectators of other groups. They are all present; they all lay claim to the symbolic meaning of the ceremony; they are all protagonists and, at the same time, they are the audience of a festivity that becomes a mirror through which we as the region's inhabitants look at ourselves. Translated by Richard Moszka. FERVENT CONTRASTS &lt;J7w c7//6(Zatio ri of f) . &amp; . ty C&gt;xpccUr//o/i Alfonso Alfaro However impressive the streams of people accompanying the return of Zapopan's effigy to its shrine (City Hall reported three million pil grims this year), the ceremonies surrounding October 12 are merely the tip of the iceberg. There exists a huge family whose tasks and daily routines, aspirations and rejoicings, re volve around this exemplar of Marian devo tion. Among the faithful queuing in long, or derly lines inside the Guadalajara cathedral to wish Godspeed to the Virgin on the last night the small image molded from a paste made of com stalks will spend in the city, there are many who will be lining up again tomorrow, with the same patience, ready to welcome her back to her own basilica after escorting her all the way there on foot. On the evening of the October 11, the travel ers unfurl their blankets under the arcades and over the plazas of the center of town, where they happily spend the night with their loved ones (including the elderly and the very young) until just before sunrise when the cortege is ready to set out. Those who are unable to undertake the whole journey on foot will then be pressing as close as they can to the edges of the broad human torrent on whose surface the tiny figure appears to bob along, dressed in the traditional sombrero and cloak of the pilgrim. Though the faithful have gathered from far and wide—as far away as the United States— the bulk of the stream is made up of people who live in the former pueblos that have been absorbed into the metropolitan sprawl, along side residents of the eastern barrios (and a handful of western ones, such as Santa Tere sita or El Fresno). The alien city of shopping malls, gated communities and housing devel opments seems bemused by the irruption in to its streets of this other country, joyous and devout, from which it has become estranged. Long past are the years when members of the Country Club would attend the Virgin's progress from their golf course next to the Carretera Vieja (now Avenida de las Améri cas). Now only the men and women of the Holy Sepulchre, dressed in their smartest at tire, turn out for the more solemn occasions of the Zapopan liturgy. In contrast with the sit uation in other countries, such as Spain, over the course of the last century in Mexico this kind of phenomenon increasingly lost its func tion as a bond between social classes. This feast, like others of the same nature, al lows for various levels of participation. You can be an occasional visitor, the member of a fam ily group, a young person attracted by the crowds, the harvest, the fair... Yet a mass mo bilization such as this would be inconceivable without a firm structure organized around the inner core of devotees who are profoundly marked by their conviction and commitment (many of whom are enlisted in the Virgin's Guard), and moving outward in concentric cir cles to include the zealous members of, say, a dance group, or individuals who faithfully observe the calendar of the Pilgrim Virgin's wanderings, revere holy images at home, and above all, cherish this Marian image at the heart of all their joys and tribulations. The Zapopan Virgin enjoys the rank of Gene rala—bestowed on her as patroness of the Army of the Three Guarantees—and her ad herents recall that as early as the sixteenth century, she intervened efficiently to put down indigenous revolts. As time went by, she established a close symbiosis with urban 73 Alfonso Alfaro</page><page sequence="10">Guadalajara: for generations, this image— which is also revered as a protector against lightning and storms—has spent the entire rainy season touring parishes and chaplain cies within the city. This is a land of harsh sunshine, tempered only by the strange interlude of summer af ternoons. It is then that cool gray skies can be enjoyed for a short time, though it is also deeply ominous. For it precedes the immod erate and sometimes devastating exuber ance of the heavens as they boom with thun der and dissolve in rain. After the storms, the fields stay freshly tinged with green for sev eral months that are the pleasantest of the year, the season that in other latitudes they call autumn. In a city and region whose ecological condi tions seem to have been systematically ig nored by planners and developers, the op posite menaces of drought and floods are present in recurrent, simultaneous fashion. The summertime visits of the Virgin's statue echo this disjointed rhythm, and address the paradoxical relationship with nature that is the lot of the local people. Her presence in Guada lajara coincides with the longed for yet dread ed intermittence of the rainy months. This ur ban journey, creating a time outside ordinary time as all rituals do, brings with it both the gai ety of the fiesta and the soothing balm of re assurance; exultant as the rockets and tow ers of fireworks that fizz brightly into the night sky once the thunder and lightning have re ceded, protective as the trailing mantle that almost smothers her diminutive, fragile frame. In the homes of her devotees, the effigy continues to radiate this inextricably dual sense of security and delight, of festive ex ceptionality and benevolent succor. For them, her influence is constant all year round; it is not restricted to October 12, the day of the llevada or "carrying away"—which from Zapopan's point of view, of course, is the traída, or the "bringing back" to her sanctu ary—and December 18, the day that marks the Feast of the Expectation of the birth of Jesus. On the eighteenth of every month, a considerable flock gathers at the basilica to celebrate a moment that, though invested with minimal importance by the official litur gy, nonetheless evokes one of the most privileged dimensions of human existence. For in the very notion of "expectation" lie un certainty and confidence, hope and sus penseful emotion. These feelings are com pounded when what's expected is a birth, let alone the particular birth that is, for Christianity, the great sign of a redemptive alliance with our maker. Remembrance of Mary's jubilation as the ex pectant mother of her son not only stretches beyond the "time of waters" (the rainy sea son): it also spills out of the urban perimeter. During the rest of the year, one of the two im ages kept at the shrine (the one known as La Peregrina, the Pilgrim or Wanderer, which since the 1990s has stood in for the original sixteenth-century image to spare it the rigors of touring) repeatedly dons her pilgrim's cloak and hat in order to resume her journey. "My mother [the image] is a proper gypsy," says one fond worshipper, a youthful member of a police corps. "She can't keep still for a minute. So many children all over the place and all of them wanting a glimpse of her." And thus she arrives by bus with her retinue of pilgrims at the Mexico City Cathedral (where she has an altar next to the great retable of the Kings) and at the Basilica of Guadalupe; she goes up to Los Angeles to visit some of the areas of migrant concentration in California and Texas; and though she hasn't been to Paris yet, she is already represented there, in the Guadalupan chapel of Notre Dame. She also makes stops at temples in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara she wasn't able to cov er during her official tour, and pauses for high profile encounters with her faithful followers (in Tesistán, for instance, she is welcomed by a committee of young men in charro costume who will harness themselves with their own rebozos to the heavy vehicle bearing the Virgin, in San Juan de Ocotán a sumptuous banquet Is offered by her devotees to the whole population, in Chapala she is trans ported by boat around the lagoon, and in Za potlán the Peregrina is conveyed aloft on an illuminated litter). Many members of the Virgin's Guard began as children, and the main contingent is made up of young people from Catholic back grounds whose zeal has far outstripped the pious practice of their families. With veritable enthusiasm, they perform their duties as members of a crack corps which today numbers around 500 people of all ages. What drives a young man or woman, whether a professional or a laborer, to consecrate all of his or her spare time to a religious associ ation? Faith and emotional attachment, no doubt, but what are the ingredients of this de votion? Three things, perhaps: joy, trust, and a sense of belonging we might call commu nal. In this Marian focus they have found a fes tive, yet ordered space—not unlike the guilds of the olden days—that enables them to harmonize their past, their present and their future plans, their family and their social lives. They come together around a maternal fig ure which has provided them with a free, open terrain of their own, like a prolongation of the warm atmosphere of the ideal home. Thanks to the jubilant and protective image of Mary Expectant, their yearnings for the ab solute can find an outlet that leads to aes thetic experience. The tenor of their words when trying to de scribe their religious life has much to do with beauty and sensation: "I get butterflies in my stomach;" "I've loved to see her since I was little, I thought she was so beautiful;" "We used to follow her around everywhere, slipping between people to get a better look." The same attitude displays itself in the affection ate compliments called out to the Virgin as she goes by, the enthused comments on her fine clothes and glowing jewels, and the earnestness with which every change in her expression, caused by changes in the light and/or her trappings, is discussed: "Some days she looks like a girl without a care in the world, even a bit mischievous; other times she seems serious and thoughtful, like a la dy, why, she can even look like an indulgent grandma sometimes." This is why her guards are so willing to spend their leisure hours practicing in the brass band, helping Fray Maceo Salcedo decorate the shrine for some ceremony, giving a hand to any parish priest scheduled to receive a vis it from her, organizing the citizens to erect floral arches along the path of her progress or preparing the party for friends and neigh bors when one is lucky enough to have her pass right by one's front door. The male mem bers of the Guard of Honor are additionally entrusted with the strenuous job of pulling the Virgin's float by means of a set of thick cables; they must also cordon off the pro cession by forming a double security line. In their eyes, such physical exertions are a spe cial form of prayer and homage. Indeed, their boundless devotion may sometimes produce remarkable aesthetic results: here is one youth who has poured all his care and imag ination into decorating a church with garlands, festoons and hangings inspired by "the art I like the best, called baroque," and has also amassed an astonishing collection of docu mentary photographs relating to the image; another has turned into the prolific and metic ulous painter of one solitary subject, the figure of Mary Expectant; and yet another, a talented needleworker, loves to embroider the dazzling garments that make up the wardrobe of both statues, the Original and the Pilgrim. Such an emphasis upon the emotions, such a commitment to a specific advocation and in deed to one precise representation of the Marian figure (a particular sculpted image) are typical of certain currents of piety that have occupied a preeminent place throughout the history of Christianity. The starting point for such religious fervor (these specific ways of relating to the transcendent world, these par ticular displays of faith) is the acceptance of a principle: groups of believers who find them selves united by some affinity (based on ter ritory, kinship, trade, etc.) will more easily ar ticulate themselves Into communities around some supernatural figure with which they can establish an exclusive bond of affiliation. Com parable phenomena exist in many religions, adapted as one would expect to a given the ological tradition and the structure of the com munity of faith concerned (the Marabouts, an Islamic sect that evolved in North Africa, are a case In point). In all the various religions, the manifestations of belief tending toward models of the kind we 74 •</page><page sequence="11">have described are also founded on a further premise: that the paths chosen by the su pernatural powers to reveal themselves and make their presence felt (the forms of hiero phany) may vary. Not all rely upon the revealed word, the consensus of the community or the internal voices of conscience. There might be places and objects capable of becoming the vehicle and testimony of divine goodwill. That is what prompts the faithful to embark on regular pilgrimages, and grant a special, privileged treatment (differing from one reli gion to another) to sacred places and objects. The expressions of faith of this sort that have arisen within Christianity are grounded in an optimistic vision of human nature (allowing adepts to overcome the fear of idolatry, al ways a possible threat where any intense re lationship with a created object is concerned), and an equally positive attitude with regard to the status of earthly matter itself (worthy of being used by God for his own lofty designs). Such a great esteem for the human figure, entailing the worship of anthropomorphic im ages, is reflected in the very principle of in carnation: if God himself did not scorn to take bodily form, why should formal representa tions of resurrected or glorious flesh trigger either doubt or repudiation? Misgivings about the legitimacy of the cult of icons did shake Christian communities to the core, especially in the Eastern churches, and gave rise to a damaging and heated polemic between iconoclasts and iconod ules that was only resolved in the eighth century with the victory of the latter, who ad vocated the veneration of sacred images. Even today, the various strains of Orthodox Christianity conduct a rich and fruitful rela tionship with this tradition. Later on, in the West, some of the most prominent schools of medieval spirituality played a major part in the consolidation of those religious Impulses that sought theo phany with the aid of devotions centered on the loving veneration of heavenly beings, which they represented by means of the vi sual arts. The stress on Mary's human, motherly traits proved a key element in powering the up surge of Christianity that swept across Eu rope from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. (After the Reformation, this ten dency would endure in revitalized form with in the Catholic sphere, while the Protestant world, by contrast, accorded an ever-dimin ishing importance to the Mother of God and her representations.) The reinforcement of an image that trans mitted values of caring and affection—as opposed to the distant majesty of the Byzantine theotokos—involved a host of char acters and movements which were to play a fundamental role in the process. St. Bernard was a key figure in this respect, due to his encouragement of the forms of contempla tive prayer that in their spiritual absorption might propitiate a greater inner closeness to the "Slave of the Lord." However, perhaps the most decisive boost came from the mendi cant orders, and especially from the Franciscan family, which turned out to be acutely attuned to the issue that concerns us. St. Francis of Assisi was the founder and divul ger of an intensely emotive and joyful spiritual ity, in which the worship of the mother of Jesus took pride of place. The apostle of poverty made much of the accessible, recep tive character of this personage whose only power resided in the awareness of her own helplessness as a created being, leading her to acknowledge and surrender to the in scrutable, overwhelming fact of divine mercy. The rapid spread of cults such as that of the Nativity are a measure of the scope of this Franciscan spirituality, unafraid as it was to re sort to sentiment and feeling. From St. Bonaventure or John of San Gimig nano, to Jacopone da Todi (to whom some have attributed the Stabat Mater), the influ ence exerted by the spiritual writers belong ing to the Franciscan order in the construc tion of a faith grounded in a bond of affection with the figure of Mary in her various accep tations, was of utmost significance. Meanwhile Duns Scotus, a first-rate intellec tual who was also a Franciscan, became one of the foremost theoreticians of Mariology (he caused a stir, for example, with his sub tle reasoning in favor of the Immaculate Con ception of Mary, against the objections of St. Thomas). And thus these forms of emotion al piety—so consoling and accessible that they spread like wildfire and took enduring root among the populations of the Christian West, especially among the poorest and most excluded who were the main targets of the Franciscan missionary effort—were further en dowed with a solid theological underpinning. Besides the Friars Minor, it is important to recognize the contribution of another great family of mendicant friars, founded by St. Do minic, or Domingo de Guzmán. His Order of Preachers was equally crucial for the estab lishment of a Marian, image-loving religiosity, primarily as a consequence of the major in novation launched by the Dominicans: the recital of the Rosary, and the veneration of the Marian image that was linked to this practice (particularly on the heels of the Dominican St. Pius V's pontificate). Historians have tirelessly drawn attention to the fundamental part played by the cult of Mary In the formation of the axiology and rep resentational systems that came to charac terize Western civilization. This came about In particular through its introduction of the no tions of compassion, tenderness and kind ness as universally acceptable values for a society in formation, one that was still exces sively reliant upon harsher, more brutal In stincts. Furthermore, European cultures were decisively shaped by a religiosity that exalted the maternal aspect of the female image. Devotions favoring the pursuit of the expres sion of divine compassion also favored hu man solidarity, which was a decisive element for building and stabilizing the medieval space. For Christians of the time, the paths of faith, hope, God's love and brotherly charity were necessarily guided by the worship of images which for them were a sign and a reminder of the most important moments in the epic of their salvation, fundamental reference points in their cosmogony and an incentive to consolidate and put into practice the im peratives of a moral character. In the medieval Western world, if those ex pressions of faith that gave priority to aesthet ic sensibility and the human representation of divinity acquired such extraordinary reso nance, it was due in large measure to the works of two great artists: Giotto, who was patently influenced by Franciscan spirituality, and the Dominican Fra Angélico. The two may be viewed as the emblematic figures of a chain of aesthetic movements that provided the cult of images with a truly sublime visual language, both in its formal perfection and in its capacity to forge links with the spectator. The stature of the artistic masterpieces asso ciated with these currents of spiritual life had an indisputable bearing on the profundity and endurance of the religious expressions spon sored by the mendicant orders; indeed, echoes of this Marian fervor can still be per ceived in the works of Piero della Francesca or Botticelli. Thus it was that the products of the most rarefied intellectual and aesthetic milieus were able to merge with the products of popular culture around a piety that was essentially sensitive and emotional. The sage, the artist and the peasant could be as brothers moved by one and the same emotion, uttering one and the same prayer. The first cracks in this exceptional conver gence began to appear during the Renais sance, as European societies grew increas ingly diverse and the idea of Christianity, already battered by the great schism with the East, was hopelessly wrecked on the rocks of the Reformation. The sense of faith that emphasized the pri vacy of religious experience, relied exclusive ly on the revealed Word for its theophany, dwelt on the ethical consequences of reli gious commitment, and put reason before emotion—in short, the contrary of the faiths that were predominant during the last cen turies of the Middle Ages—began to draw off the most educated strata from all the vari ous clans of Western Christianity. These might be Catholic (with leanings toward Erasmus) or Protestant (Lutheran or Calvlnist). The Eastern Orthodox persuasions, for their part, were more successful in holding together their vari ous churches thanks to a brilliant deployment of theology, in conjunction with a religious art (icons, sacred music, ceremonial opulence...) that shines on into our own day. • 75 •</page><page sequence="12">The new currents in Renaissance humanism attracted some eminent Franciscan mis sionaries, such as Bishop Juan de Zumárra ga. Likewise, the echo of modem devotion emerging in the countries of the North could be detected in the great evangelizers from Flanders, such as Fray Pedro de Gante. These men's spiritual tenor inclined them to favor a religious behavior that would be more pared-down and less vehement. Their think ing clearly governed the first decades of Chris tianity on Mexican soil. Years later, however, during the second half of the sixteenth century, Catholicism abrupt ly shifted direction to re-embrace its heritage in the medieval styles of theology and spiri tuality. The Council of Trent lent new impetus to the religious tradition that sought a path to transcendence via the emotions, stimulated the collective airing of religious experience, and encouraged the cult of images, especial ly those of Marian dedication. It was natural that the social groups already immersed in a communal kind of reality were the most receptive to this spiritual agenda, a cross between medieval tradition and human ist thinking that was quick to find applications in the missionary context: the great enter prise of converting Mexico prospered as it did largely thanks to this model. Tridentine religiosity became the backbone of Catholicism for the next few centuries. Like its medieval predecessors, it too could com mand authoritative backers and legitimization: St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross and St. Igna tius Loyola supplied powerful mystical foun dations for its beliefs, while the Council the ologians, followed by those of the baroque period, provided intellectual sustenance. Monuments of spiritual life such as St. Charles Borromeo and St. Philip Romolo Neri defined its course. Rubens and Bernini, for their part, endowed it with a vigorous and original aes thetic idiom, thanks to which it could claim to be at the vanguard of the cultures of its day. This movement made its mark on vast tracts of the known world, including New Spain. Let us recall that the forms of faith it endorsed were flourishing not only at the apex of a civ ilization (implying rigorous scholarship, art, and new vehicles of symbolic communica tion), but also deep within the broad base of popular piety. There was, of course, one major difference between medieval and baroque religiosity. For all its virtues, the option represented by the art and thought of Tridentine Catholicism was no longer the only one available to a whole civilization, as it had been during the heyday of Gothic art and scholastic philosophy. Now its hegemony was locally circumscribed, basical ly restricted to the territories of the Habsburg, Bourbon and Wittelsbach dynasties (while a Protestant baroque, of a scope that was scarcely less sublime, found its tutelary fig ures in Bach and Rembrandt). Deism and ra tionalism were also beginning to rear their heads, not to mention the cultures of agnos ticism and atheism, destined eventually to conquer most Western elites. The Catholicism that was so effectively re layed to Spanish and Portuguese America, therefore, was heir to the ancient lineage that sprang from the Byzantine iconodules and received its first explicit formulation in the deeply emotional piety of St. Francis, along with Duns Scotus' intelligence in the service of love; among the central pillars of this Catholicism stood Marian devotion. The recently founded Society of Jesus played a decisive part in the formulation of the spiritu al project of the Council of Trent, but it also became an enthusiastic champion of icon odulist religiosity. This faith invited man to ap proach God by way of aesthetic pleasure, expressing the profundity of inner lived ex perience with recourse to the languages of the body, and to do this in common with his fellow men, fusing together in the space of the ritual in a fraternity that reconciled the senses and the feelings, so that one might momentarily lay down the painful burden of individual awareness and stimulate the af fective drive that lay behind acts of charity. It embraced the possibility that a supernatural presence might be manifested in special places or through special instruments, ob jects whose material being were simply a vehicle for arousing in men the desire for God's grace. And this is the religiosity that lives on to this day in the majority of the Mexican population, and can be perceived in the tokens of love extended to the Zapopan image by its devotees. The cult of this image was promoted by the Franciscan monk Fray Antonio de Segovia, and its shrine is still part of a monastery of the same order. The imprint of the followers of the saint of Assisi remains clearly stamped upon the modes of this cult. Unlike what happens in many indigenous or Mestizo communities in this country, where popular devotion is the business of layper sons and amounts to an expression of the group's communal autonomy, in this case the keepers of the image and the propagators of its veneration are the friars. Hence they al so act as the guardians of orthodoxy, and have developed an entire pastoral project based upon it. They must also take the credit for the high lev el of religious culture exhibited by the inner most circle of the flock, the precision with which its members apprehend the nature of each of Mary's forms of intercession, the clar ity with which they handle concepts such as dedication, and the understanding they pos sess of the classes of worship defined by the Church: dulia for the saints, hyperdulia for the Virgin, and latria or adoration reserved exclu sively for God. The pastoral labor of the Franciscans also lies behind the subtle ex planations advanced by members of the congregation with regard to the ethical impli cations of their commitment to the image of Mary. Even more striking are their sponta neous displays of generosity and disinterest edness, true evidence of a fraternal spirit that cannot but impress the visitor. Moreover, the existence of two alternate stat ues with the same dedication (the Original and the Peregrina) makes it easier to grasp the symbolic nature of the acts of worship they inspire. The risk of placing too much value on significant objects thus tends to be minimized. This dual representation emphasizes the fact that an image is exactly that: a specific and circumstantial evocation. For the more cultivated followers of this devotion, the stat ues of Zapopan are simply signs that permit them to remember and share in Mary's jubi lation in the days prior to the birth of her son, and to strengthen the ties of kinship that unite them to her. The Friars Minor appear to be actively en gaged in elaborating a formula for transpos ing the multisecular tradition of Franciscan spirituality to our own time. The believers com memorating the joy of the Expectation have banded together in a group that functions both as a space for catechism and as a com munity environment steeped in a sense of be longing and solidarity. During the latter half of the twentieth centu ry, after Vatican II and especially during the pontificates that preceded that of John Paul II, the overall thrust of the Catholic Church tended toward positions that were not far removed from those advocated by the ear ly Renaissance reformers of the church, from Erasmus to Thomas More; hence the kind of models that were encouraged by the spirit of Trent (with the accent on sensory expression, collective manifestations, im age-worship and pilgrimage) retreated into more traditionalist social territories, such as rural areas. That medieval strain of religiosity, once reha bilitated by the Council of Trent, today finds itself somewhat cut off from the major trends of contemporary thought that might have endowed it with fresh theological or mystical credentials to replace those which under pinned its glory days during the Middle Ages or the baroque period, despite the numer ous points of objective convergence with certain dictums of postmodern cultures. It has failed moreover to produce any commu nicative tools or aesthetic idioms that might compare in terms of originality, power and resplendence with those that sustained the contemporaries of Giotto, Botticelli or Rubens. If on top of all this we take into account the growing irrelevance of Catholic intellectual elites in an ever more secularized world, then this type of religious sensibility might seem to be facing a gloomy future. And yet, in spite of everything, such a way of approaching the religious experience has found a new momentum in the natural spaces it had withdrawn to, of which it was itself the • 76*</page><page sequence="13">natural expression: the social spheres that are still swayed by communal modes of culture. Today, the vigor of this spirituality can be con firmed in the unalloyed enthusiasm of children and young people from all over Mexico and beyond as they throw themselves into such festivities as the performances of the Passion during Holy Week, or the morismas (the Fes tival of Moors and Christians), the Santiago and Tastoanes dances, which all hold in com mon the feature of staging a theater of effi cacy, known for its power to gratify the be ings who inhabit the heavens. The fervor that overflows in countless places of pilgrimage packed with worshippers and the extreme tenderness demonstrated by rural Mexicans in their celebration of All Saints' Day bear wit ness to the vitality of a world that in the eyes of many of our contemporaries, seems terminal ly bizarre and incomprehensible. One token of the renewed energy instilled in to so-called pre- (or post-) modem cultures is the proliferation of dance troupes that have emerged in recent years, all of them organ ized with the aim of paying homage to the Virgin of Zapopan. The newer groups have become more and more northern Mexican in style and garb, reflecting the rapidity with which the state of Jalisco—once a prime pro ducer of symbols of national identity—is be coming integrated into a new cultural zone whose capitals are located up in Texas or Cal ifornia. This shift can also be measured in terms of the displacement of the formerly dominant charro tradition or the ranchera aes thete: today, despite the fact that charro as sociations head the procession, the fashions and music of the border are quite probably those of the majority at such gatherings. The dancers are split into dozens of groups so that pseudo-Aztec costumes compete with country music or Amerindian looks, alongside more eclectic get-ups inspired by television. Yet despite the variety in styles, the ceremo nial structure and aesthetic idiom remain much the same as those adopted by their distant ancestors, fresh from being baptized by Father Motolinia (and similar, too, to the proceedings followed by many religious adepts in all the world who likewise believe that the divine powers cannot be adequate ly thanked by faith and good works alone). Many Christians are convinced that an earth ly matter molded from the clay of paradise, and long ago redeemed by another such— identical to the first in all but sin—is not con fined to acts of charity, silent prayer or spoken supplication as the sole means of contact with transcendence. Thus the devotees of Mary Expectant (Santa Maria de la O, revered at her Zapopan shrine) both invoke and praise her in a language that is incompatible with the canons of modernity: a prayer of the blood and the breath so as to be melded into a new body—that of the spiritual family built by all of these men and women in unison, obeying an elementary but rigorous choreography. And thus each of the exact, uniform beats sound ed by the rattles and sandals with metal soles soars like an ejaculatory prayer not uttered by the throat, a psalmody chanted by no oth er voices than those of straining muscles to the accompaniment of drums and reedy flutes, an oratory sung by the body of every worshipper, all with infinity in their eyes and tenderness in their hearts. Translated by Loma Scott Fox. ERUDITE CONTRASTS c!7ttt/&lt;e/1 i&amp;r/ado: Cf(hc , (Jan of Za/)o/)a/t Juan José Doñán How Cod would laugh at the ventures of those whom the world celebrates as heroes! Or pity, rather, is what the knowledge of our smallness will inspire. Fray Luis del Refugio de Palado In 1888, the year that Guadalajara and its sur rounding region celebrated the arrival of the first train that, as of May 15, connected the capital of Jalisco to the rest of the country, one Guadalajara resident or tapatio (as they are called in Mexico), unlike his fellow citizens, did not take part in festivities. He had a sim ple reason for not being present at the "great celebration of progress" (as the local press qualified the event): at the youthful age of nineteen, he had chosen to live in isolation at the Franciscan monastery of Cholula, in the state of Puebla. In fact, the year before he had applied to this monastery's apostolic college, since at this time the Franciscan monastery in Zapopan had no novitiate. At a moment such as this, when "progress" was the watchword for the country's urban youth, it was indeed strange that the only son of a well-to-do family would give up an auspicious future— whether in the business world or in one of many promising liberal careers—by affirming that his true vocation was religion. And not on ly that: he further refused to join the regular priesthood—the most common order which, besides being recognized as a guide to peo ple's souls by antonomasia, has always exert ed a certain influence over believers—prefer ring an isolated life and the greatest degree of poverty within an order that since its founda tion in medieval Italy had been considered one of the most self-sacrificing. This is a story set in Guadalajara at the height of Porfirio Diaz's rule: that of Fray Luis del Re fugio de Palacio, formerly known as Manuel de Palacio Basave, bom on August 19,1868— a man who, in time, would not only become the very image of humility, a model of dili gence, the incarnation of modesty and an ex ample of Christian charity, but also someone who was well-versed in a thousand and one fields, including colonial art, religious music, the restoration of altars and other sacred or naments, the life and miracles of Franciscans in Mexico, and especially everything related to the Virgin of Zapopan. The latter is a mat ter for which he received recognition from ac quaintances and strangers alike, remaining the "highest authority" on the subject more than sixty years after his death. This is due to the fact that, though he wrote few books strictly about Zapopan (no more than half a dozen), one alone from 1904 entitled Compi lation and Facts Related to the Miraculous Statue of Our Lady of Zapopan and Her Col lege and Sanctuary consists of sixteen vol umes, of which only the first three have been published to this day, all posthumously. THE CALL OF THE CLOISTER The scant biographical information conserved about Father Palacio show him to be—in his early years, which he spent pampered and in dulged by his family—someone who held lit tle interest for school, had a rebellious dispo sition and was not particularly fond of the games children played at the time. In a few pages he wrote himself, almost at the end of his life and upon request, he mentions having received "horrible grades" and was involved in "even worse mischief;" he crowns his anti resume with more unfavorable judgments: "I was very sickly, very lazy and idle, and, they say, I was so bitter about my lack of abilities, that in the evening I was as a fool in terms of all I had learned in the morning's classes." Historian José Cornejo Franco, who knew Fray Palacio during the latter years of his life and would later become one of his main ad vocates, contradicts these severe judgments, arguing he never wanted for "prizes and gold medals" in his studies and surmising that the harsh self-criticism of his past might be due to the fact that his true inclination lay elsewhere—in a precocious "taste for the af fairs of the church and the monastery" which not only distracted him from his duties at school, but also soon led him to "relinquish the easy life" and amuse himself "with Campeche wax saint's statues and decorating altars." Emphasizing the early signs of Palacio's cler ical vocation, Cornejo Franco mentions how as a child he "pulled his nanny's apron strings so she would take him to church rather than playing in the plaza gardens." This and his in sistence on being dressed "like an altar boy, in a blue habit" which was worn by Francis cans at that time—before 1897, when Pope Leon Xlll imposed the brown habit which has characterized the order ever since—con vinced his parents (Benito de Palacio y Valois and Jacoba Basave Treviño) that what the fu ture held in store for their child would neither add to their progeny nor to their fortune. Thus, after the child completed his basic studies in 1880, they were utterly unsurprised when he did not enroll at the boy's lyceum like most other tapatio teenagers at the time, but in stead decided to continue his studies at the Conciliar Seminary of Señor San José. In ad dition to Latin, music, religious and secular •77» Loma Scott Fox. Juan José Doñán</page><page sequence="14">literature, the seminary's five-year program taught him with certainty that he was not to be a common priest reciting mass, but rather meant to serve God body and soul—though far from the hubbub of worldly life, as another Fray Luis (his last name de León) would say centuries before. Thus, shortly before his seventeenth birth day, Palacio left the seminary and told his parents that he wished to take his vows with the order founded by St. Francis of Assisi. They tried to convince him of the advan tages of other orders; his father was partial to the Society of Jesus, while his mother suggested the discalced Carmelites. But their son stood his ground. Years later, Fray Palacio reminisced about the difficulties he had faced to be accepted by the order: "In order to be admitted [to the apostolic col lege in Zapopan], Fray Teófilo García Sancho had me come back again and again, putting my pertinacity to the test." Finally in 1887, presented with the irrefutable argument that the Zapopan monastery did not have a novi tiate at that time, the stubborn candidate left his native city, whose population had not yet reached seventy thousand, and traveled to Cholula, Puebla, at whose Colegio de Propaganda Fide he enrolled on July 1. The new novice was admitted as a waiter and helper in the monastery's kitchen and infir mary. Without ever neglecting his studies, for four years he carried out these humble tasks which would be so useful to him in the future; if he did not continue to do so it is be cause at the end of 1891 the monastery was taken over by the government and all its for mer occupants were thrown out into the street. Two years earlier, the tapatfo aspirant had professed simple vows and, proving be yond a doubt that he desired a radical change of lifestyle from the outset, he changed his name from Manuel de Palacio Basave as it is inscribed in the register, to a truly longwinded one—Fray Luis de Nuestra Señora del Refugio de Palacio Basave y Valois Treviño, which he later shortened to Fray Luis del Refugio de Palacio. It is with the latter that he signed his extensive oeuvre, a good part of which remains unpublished to this day. YEARS OF PILGRIMAGE Immediately after Palacio was expelled along with all his brothers, he decided to return to his home town. For some time he lived in cloister at the Zapopan monastery, and then com pleted his novitiate at the remote mission of San Luis Rey in California. During the long, gru eling trip there, passing through Zacatecas, he took his "solemn and perpetual" (i.e. per manent) vows at the Franciscan monastery of the town of Guadalupe. After a year and a half at the San Luis Rey mission, he was finally named subdeacon and shortly afterward, on December 21, 1894, he received the title of deacon and presbyter at the cathedral of Los Angeles, California; the ceremony was offici ated by Bishop George Montgomery. He then returned to the San Luis Rey mission where, days later, on January 1, 1895, he sang his first mass and was designated "mas ter of novices." From that time onward—by then he was twenty-six years old—Fray Palacio went through a period of itinerancy that, for a little over a decade, led him to travel through much of Mexico, some parts of the American Union and even to Europe. In our country, he preached in Durango, Zacatecas, Coahuila, San Luis Potosí, Colima, Aguascalientes, as well as in several towns in his home state: Ocotlán, Tuxpan, Unión de Tula, Amacueca, Bellavista, Santa Anita, El Batán, Guadalajara and, of course, Zapopan. He would return to the mission of San Luis Rey at the beginning of the twentieth century with a new position, that of lector, but was repatriated soon after wards and given the most diverse postings and jobs within his order: "master of novices," "provincial delegate," "guardian," "president in capite," "commissioner of the Holy Land," etc. In 1906, at the petition of the order's commis sary general, he traveled to Rome to deal with matters related to the Pope's project of sup pressing the order's so-called propaganda colleges, which were indeed closed two years later. Palacio's travels through Mexico led him to visit countless places, many of which he de scribed in rich detail. The book El Santo De sierto de Tenantzingo, for instance, published in 1965, is a report of his "impressions" during a trip he made with the Carmelite José Ma ria Figueroa, on which occasion he visited some twenty sites in the states of Guana juato, Michoacán, Puebla, Morelos, the State of México, Tlaxcala and Guerrero. His erudi tion is evident in his detailed description of the exterior and interior of a masterwork of architecture such as the monastery of El Car men in Celaya; his capacity for observation is also stunning, as he captures the wonders of nature as clearly as the minute details of everyday life. And yet, of all the places that Palacio visited throughout his nearly seventy-three years of life, no town ever seemed as welcoming to him as Zapopan. Due to his assignments and apostolic missions, he was often obliged to travel; but he always returned to his home town, sooner rather than later, as it was a place he was fond of for several reasons: for its people, its climate, its monastery (which he always considered his home) and, above all, for the "Miraculous Statue of the Virgin of Expectance," to which he always remained most fervently devoted, considering it a gift of Providence to this part of the world, pre sented by a distant spiritual ancestor of his: Fray Antonio de Segovia, who, on his trip through Pátzcuaro, had brought it to Jalisco in 1542, the same year of Guadalajara's foun dation in its current location. HOMO FABER, HOMO SAPIENS Fray Palacio not only wrote the greatest part of his extensive oeuvre in Zapopan—though, in a gesture of exaggerated modesty or even of self-contempt, he qualified his work as "heaps of straw," written simply "for [his] own entertainment"—he also served the monastery and the brotherhood there, car rying out both liturgical and domestic activi ties. During his long, profitable sojourns in Zapopan, he spent his time studying and praying, but also washing, sewing, singing, sweeping, cooking, playing the organ, paint ing, designing altars and facades, embroi dering and restoring priestly garb, and above all, trying to be a worthy keeper of the Virgin of Zapopan, though he always signed his letters as the "unworthy Franciscan." In his eyes, the festivities—religious as well as popular—that took place in town to honor the statue were beyond compare. He had witnessed the religious festivities of Assisi and Rome, but even then he emphatically stated that "there are none like those of Zapopan." Cornejo Franco mentions how he was so attached to the life he led at the Zapopan monastery that when his commu nity was driven out of its premises and he was forced to go live at his parents' or sis ter's houses, he took along dishes from the cloister and some "unpainted wooden chairs" so as to pretend he was still living In "[his] holy monastery." Fray Palacio's character featured a happy combination of practical abilities and intellec tual talent. This knowledgeable man was so sought after that he could not keep up with all his assignments: designing architectural projects and announcements for religious festivities, composing sermons and liturgical reports, and providing advice on all sorts of subjects, among them the cleaning of reli gious ornaments. For instance, according to Cornejo Franco, the Guadalajara cathedral's ornaments were in such a "pitiful" state that they were considered beyond repair, "but Fray Luis remade them completely, stitch by stitch, with incredible patience, re-embroi dering garlands and fruits and arabesques; with water in which lentils had been soaked, he revived the colors of the faded silk, so one could once again behold their beauty, though he purposefully did not retouch a comer of one of the cloaks so one could note the difference." Among the more im portant tasks he fulfilled punctually was the reconstruction of Guadalajara's San Francisco church, after a deplorable fire had destroyed its interior in 1936. He also designed the al tarpiece of another tapatio church, San Agustín, and, toward the end of his life, the altars of the church of San Francisco in San Luis Potosí—a job which, in his own words, "demanded a thousand sacrifices, amidst the agonies of death." This man of unusual talent was also a man of proverbial modesty. Nevertheless, his iron will • 78 •</page><page sequence="15">to be charitable and humble did not lead him to the extreme of tolerating ignorance, idle ness or foolishness. On one occasion he wrote something that, once published— though without his prior consent—offended another order. Some of those who took of fence said that the publication of this work was an affront to the principle of charity. Not long afterward, a member of the order went to the Zapopan monastery for some other reason; upon hearing of the visitor's arrival, Fray Palacio went to meet him, prostrated himself before him and, kissing his feet, begged to be forgiven for his lack of charity. The disconcerted visitor tried to lift him to his feet, telling him he was forgiven. Immediately Fray Palacio stood up and told the monk, "But everything I have said is true." Fray Luis del Refugio de Palacio, whom Agustín Yáñez considers one of Jalisco's in tellectual pillars of the early twentieth centu ry ("keeper of the [Zapopan] monastery, art critic and narrator of delightful old stories") died on July 18,1941. Since then, his remains have not left the place he loved most in the whole world: Zapopan. Translated by Richard Moszka. RITUAL CONTRASTS 5HÍ&amp; of~t/e &amp;os¿oane&amp; Guillermo de la Peña A DIABOLIC RITUAL? For centuries now, the Festival of the Tastoa nes has been celebrated in the barrios of Za popan and surrounding areas. The name Tas toán is a perhaps jesting deformation of the Náhuatl word tlatoani, meaning lord. Accord ing to Alberto Santoscoy's interpretation (1984) of the colonial-era chroniclers Antonio Tello, Alonso de la Mota y Escobarand Matías de la Mota Padilla, the festival began as a com memoration of Saint James' miraculous in tervention in several battles during the Mixtón War. Thanks to this warrior saint's aid, the Spaniards were able to suppress the nativist uprising of the Cazcan Indians. In the chron iclers' accounts, Saint James' terrifying as pect astride his white horse became the fore most factor in mediating between the annihilation of the indigenous people and the consolidation of the conquering culture. In its beginnings, the Tastoán drama was perhaps limited only to staging the battle. In time, however, it became a mix of disparate ele ments taken from the Passion play, the Christmas pageant and the Moors and Christians fiesta. All of these elements were originally built into a framework of narratives that together represented colonial domina tion as inevitable, the fulfillment of Divine Will, and the natives' salvation. Nevertheless, I will attempt to demonstrate that the action un folding during the event provides an al ternative interpretive framework that allows for the inversion of the central symbol. A hundred years ago, this evolution was the cause of a curious occurrence amongst in tellectuals of Porfirio Díaz-era Guadalajara. In 1892, the city celebrated its proud Spanish her itage with great fanfare. Not only did it mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the New World, it was the 350th anniversary of the founding of Guadalajara, a hundred years since the death of Bishop Antonio Alcalde (the great benefactor, set out as a symbol of the generosity of the colonial re gime) and the centennial of the founding of the Royal and Pontifical University of Guada leyara. In the heat of the moment, city officials decided to ban the Tastoán festival that was to take place in Mezquitán—an indigenous community very near to Guadalajara—as it didn't quite fit in with the city's European im age. Historian and ethnographer Alberto Santoscoy was the only person to defend the festival because of its ethnic importance, but his statements were greeted with a storm of criticism. However, in 1895, the distinguished U.S. anthropologist Frederick Starr came to Guadalajara expressly to witness and record the spectacle, and Santoscoy was able to get the ban lifted. Once again the local newspa pers were afire with vehement protests. Vic toriano Salado Alvarez beseeched Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza (who had personally led the Spanish forces during the Mixtón War) to recall that it had been the indigenous medi cine men—seeking to establish the reign of Tlatol (the devil)—who had instigated the up rising. Therefore, the glorification of Indian folk ways was an open invitation to the Prince of Darkness. He ended one of his most crushing articles with the declaration, "We find the Tas toanes most offensive; indeed, the specta cle is suitable only for savages. [...] More than antiquarians, more than devotees of folklore, we are lovers of culture, of disseminating en lightenment, of all that serves to further the species, not regress it." Agustín Yañez had an equally negative reac tion to the celebration in 1925. When he wit nessed the fiesta in the town of Moyahua, he was horrified by those outlandish characters who "cover their faces with repulsive masks, paint their bodies in different colors, attaching ox hair to their hands, their legs, their chests. They howl like demons [...] and get into fist fights in the streets of the town." THE RITUAL PROCESS: SUBVERTING THE CULTURE OF CONQUEST Just what goes into the making of this much maligned festival? Today, as in the past, any where from fifteen to fifty actors may partici pate—depending on where it is held—and it lasts from three to seven days. Though each place has its own variation of how it is staged, it inevitably consists of four fundamental stages or phases: the Tastoanes introduce themselves and take possession of the inhab ited space; the Tastoanes enter into negoti ations with Saint James regarding the owner ship of the land; the Tastoanes fight against Saint James, vanquishing and killing him; Saint James comes back to life and the Tastoanes pay him tribute, but at the same time, there is a transformation of Saint James' significance: he has turned into a healing force, not a de structive one. At the moment of their introduction, the Tas toanes are readily identifiable as playful be ings. Indeed, the different phases are known as jugadas (plays). They are also pagans and savages, the adversaries of Christianity. Their faces are hidden behind wooden masks with the features of different animals and are topped off by caps or wigs made with cows' tails and horses' manes that dangle to their waists. At dawn, accompanied by the music of drums and flutes, they roam the central streets and plaza of the town or barrio. They shout and strike passersby with their wood en swords. They chase the children who, in turn, throw pebbles at them. In some localities they have the right to enter cantinas and grocery stores where they can eat and drink for free. Usually, they are provisioned with bottles of tequila and mescal, and they make good use of them. They have names like Herod, Lucifer, Satan, Averrugo, Cham belú, Cuhisí, Coscoquita, and so on; in other words, "Moorish" demonic names or those of biblical personages who appear as the enemies of Christ. An elder Tastoán is in charge of the proceedings. Saint James' arrival on the scene exorcises the chaos that has reigned in the streets, sig naling the second phase. He is astride a white horse, brandishing a steel machete and dressed in the old Spanish style: a wide brimmed leather hat sporting white plumes, and Spanish boots and cape. His servants (two or more) accompany him. They are called Moors or tracking dogs (in Jocotán), or sergeants (in Ixcatán). The Tastoanes beat a retreat before this figure that, in the Nextipac version declares himself to be the king of New Spain and New Galicia. But then, in a procession headed up by Saint James, they all march to the plaza or the church atrium where a wooden platform, called the Castle, has been built. This is where the negotiations for the land take place. While this is going on, the Tastoanes are marking off the ground with ropes, and getting into longwinded, un intelligible speeches with a smattering of Ná huatl while, with grand gestures, they signal toward the cardinal directions. Three crowned kings (and, at times, a queen) intervene in the negotiations. Sometimes the kings look European (with blond braids, in Ixcatán) and at others, they evoke the different ethnicities of the Wse Men of the Epiphany. For instance, in Jocotán, one is white, another black, and the third is indigenous. The kings symbolize the earthly powers and, curiously, turn against • 79 • Guillermo de la Peña</page><page sequence="16">Saint James in the end. In some versions, the kings even sentence the apostle to death. Cirinero is an additional character who starts off as a kind of helper to Saint James, but pitches in with the Tastoán side for the trial. This character is perhaps inspired by Simon of Cyrene who in the Gospels and the Passion play, assists Christ in carrying the cross upon which he will be crucified. The persecution and attack on the apostle begins after three Tastoanes—the Elder, Lu cifer and Pontius Pilate—have directed three long speeches at him, and ends when he is forced down from his horse. In the third phase, when Saint James is de feated and joyfully and spectacularly put to death by knife or machete (in Ixcatán he is gutted by the fair-haired queen), the ritual process has led to the apostle figure sym bolically being stripped of his previous attrib utes. No longer is he the invincible soldier who terrifies and chops up Indian warriors. He doesn't even stand for Good anymore, as he was censured by the kings who in the popu lar imagination are associated with the benef icent powers of the nativity scene and the Christmas pageant. By the same token, the Tastoanes lose their chaotic connotations and turn into the defenders of justice, symbol ized by the territory. In their speeches, they accuse Saint James of being an impostor and having "violated Mosaic law." Between the third phase, Saint James' death, and the fourth, his resurrection and reconcilia tion, there is some transitional business. Gifts (called tokens or offerings) are exchanged between the Tastoanes and the townspeo ple. The Tastoanes once again become play ful, chasing the children and shouting, while Saint James, wrapped in a blanket, reposes in the atrium. Now, though, they are trans formed into more cohesive characters and are less crude. Saint James' resurrection produces a great commotion. His former tormentors fall to the ground, but the saint thereupon cures them by touching them with his sword, which has become an instrument of healing. He then joins in their rowdiness. The playfulness has decidedly lost its demonic quality. Further more, the apostle is now imbued with new qualities of beneficence, cooperation and brotherhood. The climax of the fourth phase is when the resurrected Saint James, installed in the chapel or church (in the case of Nexti pac, in the presbytery) "heals" the faithful who form long lines to receive the curative impact of the sword. The healing can go on for hours, days even. The saint's beneficent nature is thus confirmed, permitting the worship of him to continue for the following twelve months in the local chapels and churches. In the worship of Saint James, his help is sought to cure the sick and ex-votos are offered in thanksgiving. Finally, the Festival of the Tastoanes winds down with a grand banquet at the mayordo mo's house. As the person who shoulders the bulk of the celebration's costs, the mayor domo is usually the one who plays the role of Saint James. The banquet is also the occa sion to elect the mayordomo for the coming year. He will be assisted by a multitude of helpers who, out of devotion to Saint James and to the community, promise to collabo rate in the festivity. Generally the younger men play the parts of the Tastoanes. Their families have traditionally participated in the festival for generations. Evidently, I've simplified the festival quite a bit. It would be a mistake to think of it as being pompous and solemn. On the contrary, it is a hilariously comic spectacle. Even when Saint James plummets from his horse, sliced to bits and with red "blood" spurting up like a geyser out of his chest, spectators and ac tors are all laughing, which contributes to the ambiguity of the complex symbolic frame work. On the whole, the festival re-creates archetypes that are preserved and repro duced in the historic memory, or perhaps it is Hobsbawm and Ranger's so-called "invent ed tradition" that is created and re-created distinctly by victor and vanquished. In a re gion that makes much ado of its Criollo and Spanish roots, where the Indians are con fined to museums, the Tastoanes celebration helps them to step out of such limits and stick out their tongues at urban Mexico, all the while subverting the symbols of the conquer ing culture. Indeed, this public affirmation of the Indian is one of land rights, as well. It is precisely one of the characteristic features of the Cazcan peoples who, throughout the colonial period, fought for the restitution of their communal lands. It goes without saying that those who partic ipate in the festival nowadays belong to the most impoverished strata of society, day la borers, street vendors, menial construction workers, and cultivators of tiny plots of land. They are completely immersed in the mer cantile world and are a part of heteroge neous and culturally fluid situations. Society categorizes them in terms of class. If some one calls them Indians, the word lacks the stigma that it would carry in, let's say, Los Altos of Jalisco or Chiapas. Nevertheless, to ignore the ethnic dimension of these groups is to deny them the possibility of constructing their own history, distinct from the one writ ten from the point of view of those in power. Official history Interprets events as a function of the homogenization, consolidation and re production of the dominant system. How ever, in the extra-official history represented in the Festival of the Tastoanes (among oth er cultural manifestations), life cycles, ran dom events, even catastrophes, can be in terpreted and assimilated as a need for strengthening the local social fabric, and a proclamation of the right to be different. Central to this project is the experience of community life present in the practice of se lecting mayordomos and holding celebra tions, as the breeding ground for the collec tive identity, in the midst of the abuses and uncertainties of industrialized society. Translated by Harry Porter. &lt; hunt t Agustín Yáñez A group of votive Santiagos, or Saint Jame ses, at the feast of the bellicose (and apos tolic) patron, mount fine steeds and take up machetes to fulfill their devout promise—one standing in the vestibule of the parish church, the others in the plaza. "Give me ten, as hard as you can, compadre; that's what I promised Santiaguito when I had that problem with the runaway horse." And ten for this one, that one wants twenty, and the other forty; over there, they only want one, two or three lashes with the belt. The Santiagos even break a few sabers, and they fall into bed exhausted by their ministries. When they hit hard, they stand up in the stir rups and then let fly. The least fatigued is the Santiago in the church vestibule: he only belts little children, even infants, women, the old and the Infirm. "It's tougher to be a Santiago than to take fifty or a hundred good lashes with the saber, señor," vows one Indian man. I don't know about that. But I saw penitents who had promised to do the via crucis, crawl ing and hobbling around the four sides of the plaza on their knees or in shackles, followed by a Santiago whipping them without mercy. Men are Tastoanes either as a votive offering or through the confraternity. If it is because of the confraternity, they are called the slaves of Saint James and are consecrated to him at a young age. For the fiesta they dress in gar ish clothing, cover their faces with repulsive masks, paint their bodies in different colors, attaching ox hair to their hands, their legs, their chests. They howl like demons and when the time for combat strikes, they start to hu miliate the Santiagos, frighten their horses, and at the slightest carelessness, they knock them to the ground where they are dealt terri ble blows, not just on the back but wherever they fall. "Just imagine!" exclaims the parish priest. "They say that last year one of the Estrada daughters and one of the Reinosa girls were Tastoanes—and those are two of the better families! Some of the women just shout and roll on the ground in the plaza, wearing masks but they don't attack the Santiagos. An atroc ity, sir! You have seen how the men's backs look afterward, when they lift up their shirts. You have seen how the plaza is wrecked. And..." the priest went on under his voice, mysteriously, "my predecessors who had worked to abolish this barbaric form of wor ship died inexplicably."
