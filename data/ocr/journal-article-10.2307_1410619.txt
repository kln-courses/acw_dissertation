<plain_text><page sequence="1">of sources, insights, and points of view. The introductory and concluding essays by the editors give a historical outline and provide a good account of changing public attitudes and developing influences on the protection of rights, based on sociological evidence, opinion polls, and psephology, as well as official reports and legal sources. This points up the difficulties inherent in offering an assessment of progress on the protection of individual rights, and provides important indications of where further research is needed. It also recognizes that shortage of information probably makes it impossible to be other than impressionistic in auditing the British protection of rights. The appendices contain a mine of information and, with the bibliography, are likely to prove a starting point for research on rights for some time to come. Blackburn too has expert authors, but the essays tend to be less discursive and are tied to ideas of citizenship, which (as already mentioned) has some advantages in terms of coherence. Readers will emerge with a clearer view of the significance of citizenship to different kinds of rights, and of rights to the notion of citizenship in particular and public law generally. Both books should be widely read by lawyers, political scientists, politicians, and social theorists, and will significantly enhance the quality of what promises to be an increasingly voluble debate.

COOK (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994, 643 pp., ?20.95) In 1983, I went to university to study law. The following year, in torts class, I met the reasonable man. His allure was overwhelming: here was a dream boy, the boy-next-door type, who oozed ordinariness 'free both from over apprehension and from over confidence'.' The reasonable man never stood one up, but was always available, travelling that never-ending journey on the creaking, old Clapham omnibus, 'with [his] bowler hat and umbrella, sitting neither too far forward nor too far back and keeping a careful look out in case the driver should lose control of the horses.'2 He seemed the sort that even mothers would approve of: an everlasting, ever-reliable knight in shining armour. By 1985, my feelings of affection for the reasonable man had turned to a sense of affliction. As torts class had progressed, the reasonable man had multiplied wildly, unpredictably and inconsistently, hogging any available 600 ? Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995</page><page sequence="2">space on the omnibus for his peers, including the right-thinking man, the officious bystander, and a host of other 'reasonables'.3 Together, they made a frightening bunch, fudging torts' key policy questions 'in the best English tradition' of 'compromise and intellectual muddle'.4 I felt as if I had to break free. Years later when, through the work of Leslie Bender, Martha Chamallas, and Lucinda Finley,5 I found out about the reasonable man's even more vicious gender trap, I congratulated myself on my pre-feminist foresight. Anyhow, back in 1985, already haunted by the reasonable man, I was determined to track down final-year options which had not been colonized by him and his marauding troupe of 'reasonables'. Labour law looked likely to furnish one safe haven, promising archetypal 1980s 'unreasonable' men in the guise of sex harassers or trade unionists. International human rights law, by contrast, looked like an option to be avoided. It appeared truly colonized by the reasonable-man mind-set. The same 'false gender neutral- ity'6 seemed to lurk in the universal 'human' of international human rights law as in the newly fashionable 'reasonable person' standard of tort law, concealing the gendered standard beneath the surface. The subject's pre- occupation with issues of statehood, sovereignty, and self-determination loomed like sexist obsessions. The state action doctrine, which limited governmental responsibility to the classical duty not to interfere with indi- vidual human rights,7 resonated with the hateful public/private split that feminists were just beginning to identify as contaminating law's reach.8 International law's dichotomy between hard law and soft law was similarly problematic: you just knew which side of that lop-sided line women's rights would be on, if they surfaced at all. Course outlines for the subject read like a Boys' Own debate: acquisition of territory, dispute resolution, the use of force, and the question of state responsibility were all key topics. And the remainder of the course looked like little more than dull, self-legitimating stuff around the nature and sources of international law and the historical development of international institutions. It's now 1995 and I have realized that, ten years ago, I made a mistake: I should have taken international human rights law. Infused by the potential of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and angered by international law's primness and propensity for tradition, feminsim has recently been sweeping through this terrain. Its progress is faltering but also inspirational, energizing, and rewarding. Human Rights of Women is testament to the vitality and comprehensiveness of this feminist breakthrough. Paralleling feminism's surge within international human rights law, this collection extends in breathtaking fashion: twenty- two individual contributions, in five different sections, slotted together with an impressive introduction by Rebecca Cook. Its origins lie in a consultation of lawyers from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe that took place in August 1992 at the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto. The experience, imagination, and vitality of that grouping leaps out at one from the pages of the end-product. These qualities also allow the group to scale 601 ? Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995</page><page sequence="3">an impressive intellectual mountain of theoretical concerns and international, regional, and national strategizing: contributions in the second section spell out theoretical concerns; the third and fourth sections expose a plurality of international, regional, and national approaches; and the final section zeroes in on specific human rights violations of particular concern to women, searching out strategies to address them. Throughout Human Rights of Women, one feels oneself being nurtured or moulded in the ways of human-rights strategist. The collection is not anti- theoretical: it is simply that theory is not its inspiration or its way of working. The title of Cook's opening chapter, 'The Way Forward' hints that this is a book about the tangible, not the theoretical. That signal is accurate; the final product is better described as an activist's almanac rather than a theoretician's tome. At least two-thirds of these contributions are peppered with the language, manoeuvring, and mind-set of the human-rights activist. Hidden behind the final section is further evidence of this mind-set in the shape of a human-rights instrument ratification chart and a list of resource organizations. These features combine to produce a result-oriented end- product of invigorating relevance, credibility, and tenacity: 'the real impact ... will appear only when the findings of the consultations are brought to bear on the prevention, investigation, and punishment of violations of women's human rights' (p. 3). Human Rights of Women spotlights just how alluring international human rights law has become for feminism. The attentions of Catharine MacKinnon, the media, and, most recently, in Beijing, Hilary Rodham Clinton turn up the glare of these already bright lights and ignite a troubling question: is the sparkle and glitz of feminist international human rights law ephemeral or truly long-lasting? Frightening allegations have been levelled against the feminist take-up of international human-rights law. It has been said to repre- sent Western feminism's gleeful flight from the postmodern tornado which is destabilizing its violently exclusionary politics. Can this be the case? Is Western feminism gearing up to play out the same modernist power games around its political subject, 'Woman', on the international stage that post- modern and postcolonial discourses have peppered holes in across national barricades? Early, prestigious law review pieces did sometimes make it appear that liberal feminism had a stranglehold on women's human rights.9 Awkward juxtapositioning of unknowables like 'Woman' and 'Third-World Woman', of 'developed' and 'developing' worlds, of 'most oppressed' and 'most privileged' women occurred in much of the feminist international law scholarship which they presented, trapping the movement's energy in the inertia of violently lop-sided binary oppositions. These binarisms also con- jured up the monolith of the 'Exotic Other Female',10 robbing women in the Third World of their power and agency in a traditionally colonialist manoeuvre.11 There was also evidence of Carol Gilligan's A Different Voice being invoked anew in a troubling manner;12 this time, to ground the feminist onslaught on traditional human rights law and to reassure us that Woman 602 C Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995</page><page sequence="4">and Third-World Woman could 'cosy up', attaching further colours, shapes, and sizes to liberalism's ever accommodating 'pop-bead necklace'"3 plural- ism. Moreover, the trap of 'arrogant perception'14 also loomed large in the Western feminist preoccupation with female genital mutilation and in its importation of the public/private distinction to the territory of international law, where it was used to tar the subject, particularly its state-action doctrine. This latter manoeuvre was a tempting but troublesome one, necessitating an assertion of the universal relevance of the public/private distinction in the face of ongoing opposition which cited state refugee policies and the co- option of women from the Third World into domestic service as evidence that they might not have had either 'the benefit of the economic conditions that underlie the distinction [or] the luxury of a private sphere'.15 The liberal feminist stranglehold is now easing up in the law review repre- sentation of feminist international human rights law.'6 It seems likely that, given the postmodern predilection for crisis, it was always overplayed. International gatherings - like Nairobi (1985), Vienna (1993), Cairo (1994), and Beijing (1995) - have grounded feminist progress in international law, exposing its wilder excesses to the pragmatism and experience of a plurality of non-governmental organizations. These international gatherings may also have helped to sift out homogenizing tendencies at local, national, and regional levels because they create a need for participation by increased numbers of women in order that local preparations be finalized in advance of the international process.17 It is also the case that black feminist scholar- ship, which has been hammering away at the closures in 'dominant' femin- isms since the 1970s, continues to gain audience exposure on the ground as well as in the pages of our law reviews. Postcolonial feminist scholarships are now being allowed to present themselves, replacing earlier outsider sketches of the 'essentially truncated','8 powerless lives of their subjects with contextualized, substantiated, local stories. Human Rights of Women is up-front about the struggles which may halt the current swirling momentum and topple the new feminist tower of women's human rights. Careful to acknowledge the contradictions of rights- talk, the stalemate capacity of relativism, and the fear of replaying feminism's past on the international stage as the biggest bogeys, it ignores the predicted impasse and, instead, presses on to tackle these concerns with gusto and also, importantly, with discretion and sensitivity. Hilary Charlesworth and Celia Romany offer contributions that bounce off one another, exposing the magnetism and the myopia of the language of rights and of the public/ private distinction. These are complemented by many of the other contri- butions, including those from Adetoun Ilumoka, Radhika Coomaraswamy, and Sara Hossain which detail the barriers to 'indigenizing' rights in Africa and South Asia. Amidst the range of contributions, there are remarkable coincidences: Kathleen Mahoney's expose of the Canadian courts' gender equity impoverishment and Maria Isabel Plata's description of Colombian women's groups' use of human rights to promote equality and reproductive 603 C) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995</page><page sequence="5">health both conclude by nominating judicial education strategies as an essential component of forward planning. At the close of Human Rights of Women, one is left with the feeling of having watched feminists from Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the United States of America, and Zimbabwe really talk to one another, in a conversation about the lessons of the past and the potential (and pitfalls) of the future of feminist politicking in international law. Their generosity and experience combine to make this a brave, honest, and invigorating text. Its composure, balance, and eyes-on- the-target mind-set mingle together to infuse the reader with an unexpected combination of calmness (in the eye of the forecast internal storm) and eager- ness for action (to harness the untapped potential of the subject, fighting against the stalemating tendencies of relativism and over-theorizing). These qualities also allow the text to surface above the current vogue for post- modern and postcolonial 'crisis' rumblings in feminist international human rights law. In fact, Human Rights of Women may even remind us that 'crisis' can be a wonderful thing: embrace it and we will live on, hide from it and our imaginations will run dry.
