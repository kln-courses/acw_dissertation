<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 75 The The Attributes of God. The Gifford Lectures delivered in the Uni versity of St Andrews in the year 1924-1925, by Lewis Richard Farnell, Rector of Exeter College, Oxford. (The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1925.) Dr Farnell remarks that though his subject was explicitly men tioned in the deed of foundation of the Gifford Lectures, none of his predecessors has given it any systematic exposition. He calls his work an essential chapter in Comparative Religion, but its significance goes beyond this empirical study. It must be regarded as a valuable contribution towards the elaboration of the new type of philosophy of religion which some thinkers are endeavouring to formulate. This philosophical significance notwithstanding, Dr Farnell does not make it his chief concern. He does treat definitely of Problems of the Philo sophy of Religion in his last lecture, and there are frequent incidental considerations of a philosophical character throughout the volume, but there are many points where the need of a general philosophical con sideration and a more definite and more fully stated position are keenly felt by the philosophical mind. To enumerate these here would demand too much space. It is, however, worth quoting Dr Farnell, a student of historical religions, in contrast with the opinions of a former Oxford Gifford Lecturer. He says that י religion in any sense in which it has yet been recognized ' is instinctively repelled by the idea of divinity as the sum of all reality. The cry of the Indian saint ' the worship of the Impersonal laid no hold upon my heart' appeals, he says, and we think rightly, as the voice of all real religion. It is only at a certain stage that the idea of divinity becomes suffi ciently definite to serve as a focus for many attributes. In fact, Dr Farnell contends that ' our inquiry only begins to be fruitful on the plane of personal deities or θΐοί'. From a consideration of the em pirical data he concludes that theriomorphic representation has tended to promote an attitude of fear, while anthropomorphism has been more conducive to love. Later attempts to treat theriomorphic imagery as symbolic have been favourable to indefinite forms of mysticism. The early mind could not grasp the idea of divine omnipresence, and early forms of anthropomorphism, especially those associated with idolatry tended to militate against its recognition. Dr Farnell seems right in maintaining that we can only satisfactorily understand idolatry on the ground that the worshippers regarded the image as in some sense ' full of the mystic essence of the deity'. In this connexion he dwells on the different kinds of offering and sacrifice to the deities, and leads on to a consideration of similar implications in the doctrine of the death of Christ. He says that none of the reinterpretations of this</page><page sequence="2">76 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES doctrine have satisfied the developed modern conscience. Here he appears to treat our 'religious theory', in which vicarious sacrifice is still a prominent dogma, as lagging behind in the onward march of thought. In our secular law and ethics we have ' risen far above it But may it not be asked whether this is indeed true ? Are there not signs, not merely in modern legal practice but also in government and in political theory, which point to a definite recognition of corporate welfare demanding and rightly accepting the sacrifice of individuals ? I venture to think that Dr Farnell's attitude in this matter needs re consideration. It is a reflex of an apparent assumption of an indi vidualistic personal religion as its highest form. The doctrine of vicarious sacrifice may yet help us to withstand an exaggerated indi vidualism, and to come to a more profound understanding of ex perience than that can give us. In his discussion of anthropomorphism Dr Farnell treats of the pre valent attribution of sex characteristics to the deities, and he appears in the main, if not indeed entirely, to regard the eradication of such attributes as an advance. This is a delicate and difficult topic, which must needs be seriously handled in the theology, especially the moral theology, of the future. For the present it must suffice to insist on the implications of even Dr Farnell's own statement: ' For a comparative study of the attributes of Godhead it is important to bear in mind that the Mediterranean old-world religions, all save the Hebraic, agreed in regarding the processes of the propagation of life as divine.' A less prejudiced consideration of some of the religions of the East should also teach us something in this connexion. Goddess cults have often fostered the growth "of the ideas of divine mercy and pity. Dr Farnell regards Judaism and. Islam and Unitarian Christianity as the truly monotheistic religions. In practice he thinks that the Third Person of the Trinity is hardly a living power for the mass of believers, the majority of the earnest of whom have addressed their prayers to God and to Christ as two distinct personages without any thought of the triune dogma. To this must also be added the cult of the Virgin and the saints in many countries, so that י the current popular religion of Europe should be rather described as a high spiritual polytheism, tempered and restrained by the Athanasian Creed'. However, the whole discussion of polytheism and monotheism raises the question of the existence and place in religion of beings intermediate in nature and power between men and a Supreme Being or God, and if there are such, whether with our present terminology we should call these deities. Many doubts have been thrown on the purely monotheistic character, in the absolute sense, of Islam in practice. (Cf. for example S. Curtis Semitic Religion To-day I)</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 77 Although Dr Farnell dissociates himself from those who seek in Nature-worship the chief source of religious ideas he agrees that some thing towards advanced and spiritual concepts is derived from the realm of nature. The sun-god Shamash became the god of righteous ness, the law-giver, and in the hymns to Re-Aton, well described as masterpieces of religious poetry, a nature-god could be conceived as a ' High Power of the Spiritual lifeThe sun's light has been con stantly associated with purity and truth. Nature worship gave men a sense of a beneficient deity in the sources and elements of their own terrestrial life. 4 We have lost the old Pagan sense of the divinity of those things in which our physical life depends and some of the joie de vivrevivre that goes with that sense.' And, it may be remarked, even poetry does not make up fully for the neglect of this side of religion. The most interesting event in our religious history, says Dr Farnell, is 4 the progress from the tribal-particularist phase to the universal concept of God'. This was not the reflexion of a political universalism : Israel was never a wide empire. There were in Orphism and in Homeric utterances a transcendence of national limitations. But the chief ground of this broadening and universalizing ,of the idea of God,, the author seems to find in the emergence of an individualism of tense and direct communion with God. 4 The developement of personal religion quickened and facilitated the birth of the concept of a universal God standing everywhere in the same relation to the individual soul.' With this conviction, Dr Farnell again insists on a criticism of 'our own Christology ' which is not yet delivered 4 from the fetters of group morality'. Thus the form of universalism, to which he points is not that of a universal community but that of a universal freedom for individual communion. 4 The history of progressive religion justifies the old belief, strongly held by the Cambridge Platonists, that God as the source of all soul-life reveals himself most profoundly to the indi vidual soul in solitude.' But may it not also be true that the full fruition of this revelation is in communion with Nature and mankind? The record of men's ideas concerning the moral qualities of deity makes strange reading. Nevertheless, certain traits come into pro minent relief in the course of history. In the higher religions of the old world, justice appears to have been the most definite attribute, and it was a task frequently undertaken to find a means of reconciling the injustices of this life with the justice of the deities. Yet the attributes of mercy and compassion have rarely been wanting in conceptions of the divine. Purity is applied to men and deities, while holiness is essentially a characteristic Of the supernatural. The infusion of solemn awe which comes with the recognition of the quality of holiness in the divine helps according to its greater or lesser degree to differentiate</page><page sequence="4">78 the Journal of theological studies religions. But there is surely a sense in which we may also attribute holiness to true saints. In his consideration of the attributes of Beauty, Wisdom, and Truth, Dr Farnell finds his best data in the religion and thought of ancient Greece. In his discussion of divine power he treats also of its expres sion in the world, indicating the attitudes which have seen this (i) in the miraculous and (ii) in universal law. Incidentally he raises the question of the implications of prayer in this connexion. Here again Dr Famell's individualistic view appears. For, suggesting that prayer may have its one real effect within the consciousness of the individual who must realize it through his own freedom, he concludes that (so conceived) 'prayers for an individual other than oneself have no validity ', ' And herein, more conspicuously than elsewhere is revealed the wide cleavage that at present exists between the highest theistic thought and the popular religion.' But are we so certain that it is popular religion which is wrong ? The preceding paragraphs are quite inadequate to indicate the scope and importance of this book. But no work of Dr Famell's needs any one to commend it in order to ensure it due attention. For my own part I would thank him for this most valuable and interesting volume.</page></plain_text>
