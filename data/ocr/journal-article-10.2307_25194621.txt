It is no doubt to be attributed to the obscurity which hangs over the older parts of the Avesta that each student attains</page><page sequence="2">THE YASNA HAPTAHATI 975 to a different result. The religious terms, such as vohu mano, have been interpreted in nuances varying from purely abstract nouns to highly anthropomorphic divine beings. The authors of Avestan texts unhappily did not think to anticipate these difficulties, and the context does not decide. To this uncertainty is added the small compass of the material which entices the student to use the dangerous e silentio argument, as is noticeably the case in the present book. Hence the reader will find on most pages assumptions or assertions which do not convince. As, for instance, that yazata-, fravaSi-, and other words were introduced by the composer of the Yasna Haptahati, or that baga- was deliberately rejected by Zoroaster. Yazata- at least has its counterpart in the Indian yajata- and by the method which traces rta- to the Indo Iranian period, yazata belongs there too. As to the etymology olfra-vrti-, so much has been proposed that it is hardly worth while to point out a further possibility, that of a connection with vrti- in Av. ham-vardti- and Pahl. gurt. The present study stresses the importance of the Yasna Haptahati as a stage in the development of Mazdeism. Its difference from the Gathas is clear, but it is hard to believe that Zoroaster would have found much to object to in it. Too much is urged from the view that Zoroaster does not use certain words or phrases in the Gathas. Surely we should remember that a large number of words occur only once there (myazda, zaotar-, Yima, and the like) ; the Gathas hardly contain systematic theology. The matter becomes still worse when it is proposed to cut out passages from the Gathas as being not from Zoroaster. At once there arises the confusion of unified and dissected Gathas and additional uncertainty. The etymological method to secure meanings is obviously dangerous, as when on p. 3 haydman- is said to emphasize " die innere Haltung " of friendship. It is admittedly hard, however, to be satisfied with a non liquet. The author has made a courageous attempt to bring light into this dark matter, and there are deductions of value to</page><page sequence="3">976 NOTICES OF BOOKS be found here. As to the date of Zoroaster, still in dispute, it is perhaps of interest to call attention to the name pariuas " Persia " in the Nineveh inscription, the name of the country over which KuraS was ruling in 630 B.C. " on the far side of Elam", JRAS., 1932, p. 239 (of. Weidner, Archiv. fur Orientforschung, 1931). The same phonetic form is found in the ninth century for a district in the north-west of Persia. The word may therefore have retained its ninth century form in the Assyrian documents, but may equally well represent the phonetic form of 630 B.C. In any case with -6u and -s it represents archaic Persian compared to the Achaemenid inscriptions, and suggests the need of caution in pushing back the Gathas (compared to which pariuas is equally archaic) to an early date. 248.
