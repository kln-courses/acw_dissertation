<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS The Radical Spinoza. PAUL WIENPAHL. New York: New York University Press, 1979. Pp. xiii, 281. As against the usual interpretation of Spinoza's metaphysical doctrine as monism, i. e., as the view that there is only one substance, Wienpahl maintains that according to Spinoza, reality is substance- less. That Spinoza has been misunderstood, Wienpahl believes, is largely due to the fact that the influence of the Hebrew language on him has not been taken into consideration. Referring to Spinoza's view that the ancient Hebrews used "God" also as an adjective and an adverb in a superlative degree, and that almost all the words in the Hebrew language were originally verbs, Wienpahl attributes adjec- tival, adverbial, and verbal meanings to some basic terms in Spinoza's Ethics, which are usually put into other grammatical categories. categories. Thus he holds that Spinoza had the adjectival and adverbial use in mind with his idea of God. And when Spinoza used "Being" as the name for God, the word has the verbal sense of an act of being, and not the nominal sense of a being. Spinoza also uses, Wienpahl says, "mind" and "body" in a nonnominal sense. But although he treats these words as adjectives, he allows them to function as subjects of sentences, thus reconciling the view that there are no substances with the logical and grammatical requirement that the subject-word of a sentence must refer to something. This way of understanding Spinoza finds expression in Wien- pahl's translation of the Ethics, which is contained in the Appendix. Thus, e.g., the phrase essentiala involvit existential" in Def. I, Part I, which is rendered by Elwes as "essence involves existence," is translated by Wienpahl as "being involves existing." "Per Deum in- telligo Ens absolute infinitum" of Def. VI, which Elwes translated "By God I mean a being absolutely infinite," is translated by Wienpahl: "By means of God I understand Being absolutely infinitely. Wienpahl who wrote a book The Matter of Zen (after a practical association with Zen Buddhism), sees a profound resemblance be- tween the belief that there are no substances and the Buddhist doc- trine of egolessness. He even suggests that Spinoza's experience of egolessness provided the empirical basis for his account of God. In this sense Spinoza's conception of God is anthropomorphic, but, 238</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 239 unlike other forms of anthropomorphism, it is based on an adequate understanding of oneself. Wienpahl's interpretation of Spinoza is very ingenious, but perhaps not always convincing. It is, in particular, doubtful whether thinking in Hebrew tends, more than thinking in other languages,, to see the world nonsubstantively. More pertinent is the question whether Spinoza was influenced in this way by his study of Hebrew. One may also question whether attributing to Spinoza the doc- trine that reality is substanceless is compatible with the view that the God of Spinoza "was the God of his fathers" (p. 57). SHIA MOSER.
