<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mwona Figurines T he Mwona form a small agricultural com- munity about eight kilometers from Bam- bam on the recently completed Gombe- Cham-Numan road in North-Eastern State, Nigeria. Before the construction of the road, the territory in and around Mwona Village was almost undisturbed. The figurative ter- racotta pottery of these people is used in divi- nation, curing of disease, protection of the fetus during gestation, and protection of chil- dren until the age of puberty. This anthropomorphic terracotta work is produced entirely by male artists and is totally different from the traditional Mwona utilita- rian earthenware made by their woman pot- ters. The figurines are used not only to ensure the well-being of children and to treat human sickness, but also to counteract misfortune and to cure livestock and cattle diseases. Persons who are sick or afraid, or those feeling the need of a charm against possible disaster, first consult the local diviner. His compound is characterized by a separate mys- terious building, the diviner's hut, regarded by the people with awe. It has no windows and is entered by a small doorway covered by a grass mat. Inside, among the diviner's other paraphernalia wedged between the forks of a tree branch embedded in the earth floor of the hut, are two rare and important anthropomor- phic vessels: male and female earthenware flagons (Figs. 1, 2). Supplicants, after entering the dimly lighted hut, pose their problems to the di- viner. He then consults his male or female oracular vessel, depending upon the sex of the petitioner. After having received the "words" he communicates them to the supplicant, who is advised to obtain a certain type of figurine. An artist specializing in this work is approached, and for a consideration he produces the correct figurine. It is taken back to the diviner, who once again consults his oracle. After a final ceremony and further "words," he invests the figurine with power by means of a libation. Among the many figurines produced and used by the Mwona are those especially fa- vored by mothers. When a woman becomes pregnant she wants a terracotta charm to safeguard her and her child until birth. This is a small terracotta vessel, sometimes plain, sometimes decorated with tassels or miniature cowrie shells. Protuding from the side at an acute angle is a stylized head representing the fetus (Fig. 3). Possessed of this charm, the woman feels secure until her baby is born. Following delivery the woman again con- sults the diviner and obtains another charm; a small pear-shaped vessel with a baby carried 3. CHARM TO PROTECT UNBORN CHILDREN 4. CHARM TO PROTECT YOUNG CHILDREN on the mother's back. In this photograph (Fig. 4) only a glimpse of the baby's head and its hand below the mother's breast can be seen. The wide-open mouth of the parent figure, with the tongue showing at the base, is typical of the genre, as are the protuberant eyes and supra-orbital ridges indicating forehead and ears combined. Some present-day Mwona terracotta ob- jects are said to have lost their power or served their purpose and are no longer in use, but are still kept in or near the villages. They are given to children as playthings, or are respect- fully placed on propitiatory mounds on hilltop sites. The pieces illustrated here were all made by the same well-known local artist, but ritual ceramics are widespread in Nigeria to- day, and anthropomorphic pottery of the kind shown here is far more prolific and varied than undecorated utilitarian ware. During re- search for this article 153 Mwona figurines were brought forward for my examination. F 1. EARTHENWARE FLAGON, FEMALE. 46cm. 2. EARTHENWARE FLAGON, MALE. 38cm. 23</page></plain_text>
