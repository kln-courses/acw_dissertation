Fundaciön Pam pero, Caracas, 1987, 387 p.,ill. Texte en espagnol, français et anglais. This interdisciplinary study is meant to provide a lavishly illustrated introduc tion to the aesthetics, archeology, and symbolism of Venezuelan rock art, as well as an attempt at definition of geographically circumscribed petroglyph styles in this country. The work is the result of a rock art project carried out by the Department of Anthropology of the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Caracas, and supported by the Pampero Foundation, Caracas. The participants included Jeannine Sujo Volsky, who has studies the subject for years, and published a monograph on Venezuelan petroglyphs in 1975 ; Ruby de Valencia, a landscape architect, who</page><page sequence="2">COMPTES RENDUS ET NOTES DE LECTURE 257 photographed numerous rock art sites in seventeen Venezuelan states ; Rafael Lairet, a geographer, whose interest in archaeo-astronomy led him to apply image digital processing techniques to the study of rock art; and Patrick Alminana, a medical psychiatrist, who is interested in the symbolic aspects of prehistoric rock art. The first chapter of the work (further referred to as DPV) retells — without any reference to sources — the myth of origin of the Tamanaco Indians, a group which formely lived in the Cuchivero-Orinoco area. This story has a direct bearing on the study of Amerindian rock art, as, apart from Tamanaco beginnings, it explains the origin of the rock drawings in their habitation area. The myth is recorded by the eighteenth-century missionary Gilii (1780-1784, II : 234-235, III : 4-5, 19-20), and became widely known from Alexander von Humboldt's travel reports (Humboldt and Bonpland 1814-1825, II : 238-239, 586-588 ; 1821, IV : 471-472 ; V : 595-600 ; Humboldt 1859, I : 170). It has been retold by many authors since (see Dubelaar 1986 : 58-61). According to one version of this myth, the 'culture hero' Amalivaca created the first Tamanaco, and, simultaneously, made a series of drawings on the Tepumereme, an isolated rock a few miles east of Encaramada, a village situaded in the Caicara region on the right bank of the Orinoco River. Humboldt also refers to another version of the myth, according to which the petroglyphs were not made by Amalivaca, but by the first Tamanaco themselves. In the epoch of the 'great waters' they went to this rock in their canoes. The boulder had just been created by Amalivaca, and, as a result, was still soft and malleable. The Tamanaco then made the drawings with their fingers (for a similar story, told by Indians from the Marowijne River, Suriname, see Dubelaar 1986 : 56). Unifortunately, DPV only presents the first version. It is illustrated by two photographs : one showing a petroglyph rock at Cairaca, a few miles northeast of Encaramada, and a second one showing a rock drawing from the Estado Falcôn, some 800 km northwest of Encaramada (obviously, the name Casiquiare Riveron p. 28 should be Cuchivero River). From various accounts written on this Tepumereme it doesn't become obvious whether this boulder showing drawings of crocodiles, boas, giant tigers, domestic utensils, images of the sun and the moon (Rojas 1907, II : 183) has ever been identified and recorded. The description by Rojas seems to point to a number of different engraved rocks in the Cuchivero area, rather than to one and the same site. Marcano (1890 : 102) writes : « Une tradition nous a été conservée par le Père Gili : la légende de la roche de Tepumereme. Quelques écrivains anciens, se conformant à l'acception Tamanaque du mot, disent indistinctement tepumeremes ou rocas pintadas (roches peintes). On l'applique exclusivement aujourd'hui au rocher situé à quelques lieues de l'Encaramada, au milieu de la savane... ». The 'Graphic Catalogue' in DPV, which shows the Cuchivero area on p. 248-249 (nos 34, 38, 55-1, 55-2, 56, 60), mentions the Tepumereme on p. 265 (list Bolivar n° 8), but doesn't present a picture either. The remainder of the book can be divided into two parts : firstly, a section including studies on various aspects of Venezuelan rock art (pp. 29-211), and, secondly, an elaborately illustrated listing of the rock art sites in Venezuela (pp. 213-386). The contributions by the four authors are varying in importance and quality. De Valencia presents an analysis of petroglyph design structure. Using a</page><page sequence="3">258 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES technique she calls 'highlighting', outstanding characteristics are defined : 'purity of form', 'harmony' (including the principles of symmetry, balance, and proportion), 'economy of elements', and the predominance of frontal, two - dimensional or linear designs. Twenty-three geometric forms are identified, including parallel lines, concentric circles, simple, double, and closed spirals, etc. De Valencia believes that each of these geometric elements had a specific meaning (p. 44). Although the reviewer doesn't doubt that rock drawings had a significance to their makers and fellow tribesmen, he feels that ascribing specific meanings to geometric elements constituting these drawings is unjustified. Apart from geometric forms, non geometric or 'free' forms represent a major part of the figurative motifs in Venezuelan rock art. De Valencia divides these motifs into characters representing a model taken from nature, and characters not representing such models. Human figures or part of them, birds, mammals, fish, saurians and other reptiles, and plants belong to the first group. The second category shows a tendency leading from naturalism to abstraction. She doesn't present a comprehensive application of her classification to the body of Venezuelan rock art (or even part of it). Sujo Volsky discusses the significance of petroglyph making to the Amerindian society. She feels that the drawings functioned as territory markers, and were considered as sacred objects. She is of the opinion that the Venezuelan petroglyphs date from before the ceramic age (i. e. previous to about 2800 B.C.), but doesn't give convincing arguments for this supposition. A series of geographically defined rock art styles in Venezuela is recognized, and compared with maps showing linguistic and archaeological distribution. Sujo Volsky concludes that, firstly, the majority of Venezuelan petroglyph sites are to be found in open spaces. Secondly she notes that the sites North of the Orinoco are mainly situated in hilly country, whereas those South of this river are predominantly to be found along river courses. With respect to the technique of execution she concludes that 56 % of the petroglyphs show linear low relief, and 35 % combine line and plane low relief, while the remaining 9 % are divided over various other techniques. The average depth of the engraved lines is 1.24 cm, the average width 1.71 cm. Analysis of petroglyph shapes leads to a stylistic differentiation into three zones. North of the Orinoco two styles can be dintinguished, i.e. a West-Central zone, in which geometric figures dominate, followed by anthropomorphic and then by zoomorphic figures, and a Western zone, in which geometric figures are predominant as well, but zoomorphic ones are more abundant than anthropomorphic shapes. Sujo Volsky includes the region South of the Orinoco into a Southern zone. It is characterized by a preponderance of geometric forms, followed by zoomorphic and then by anthropomorphic forms. In this it resembles the Western zone, but it shows marked differences with the latter with respect to techniques of execution and site locations. Analysis of rock paintings didn't result in a definition of particular stylistic horizons. Red colours predominate, followed by black and white, whereas yellow is scarce. Most paintings are positive ; only two cases are known showing scenes formed by interconnected figures. Rafael Lairet distinguishes six physiographical provinces in Venezuela : firstly, the Continental Shelf, Islands, and Coastal Plain ; secondly, the Coastal Mountain Range ; thirdly, the Highlands and Valleys of Falcon, Lara, and Yaracui ; fourthtly the Andean Mountain Range ; fifthly, the Plains (Llanos) ; and</page><page sequence="4">COMPTES RENDUS ET NOTES DE LECTURE 259 finally, the Guayana Region. Riverine petroglyphs are dominant south of the Orinoco ; north of this river petroglyphs are mainly found in the mountainous regions (this tallies with one of Sujo Volsky's observations ; see above). A second contribution by Lairet demonstrates the application of image digital processing to petroglyphs recording. Finally, Patrick Alminana provides a psychological approach to the study of petroglyphs. The most important part of the work is formed by its descriptive section, a presentation of the rock art in the various states of Venezuela encompassing in all 683 photographs of petroglyphs or rock paintings. Another 231 sites are listed without illustrations. For some additions to this elaborate collection of data, see below. Most photographs offer clear pictures of the rock drawings. However, in some cases they are of little or no use because of their vagueness, e. g. Site Estado Barinas 195/0/1. Incidentally, only parts of the drawings on a rock are pictured ; e.g. at Site Estado Falcon 113 only one group of drawings out of six is shown (see Tormo 1951 : 560). In order to get better pictures, the petroglyphs were chalked before photographing. There is a growing opposition against chalking rock engravings, as absolute dating using differences between the patina which forms again on the lines after engraving and the patina on the nearby untouched surface is made impossible (see Bednarik 1990). Possibly, image digital processing (see Lairet, above) can m^ke chalking unnecessary. A comparison between the numbered site entries in the Catalogue with the site numbers shown on the accompanying map gives rise to the following remarks. The folding map has three inset maps. The upper one shows the sites in the states of Carabobo, Distrito Federal, Aragua, and Miranda. Unfortunately, the boundaries of these states aren't indicated on this inset map. A number of sites shown on this map don't appear in the Catalogue. These include Nos 22, 30, 103, 131, 192, 249, 302, and 321 (the map and list of the Estado Lara have also a n° 192). Furthermore, Catalogue sites Aragua 45 (incorrectly shown on the map of Guârico), 126, 148 on p. 221, 148 on p. 228, Carabobo 422, Distrito Federal 304, Miranda 204, don't appear on the map. According to the Catalogue, n° 317 is situated in the state of Miranda. However, n° 308, which, according to the map, is situated to the east of 317, is listed in the Catalogue (p. 293) as to be found in the Distrito Federal, i.e. west of Miranda. The second inset map, Tâchira, shows a n° 344 which is not listed in the Catalogue. On the other hand, the Catalogue has a n° 244 which is not shown on this inset map. This probably means that n° 344 on the Tâchira inset should be 244. Finally, the third inset map, Amazonas, has a n° 239 which isn't listed in the Catalogue. The main map gives rise to the following comments. Aragua : Nos 86 and 204 aren't listed in the Catalogue (n° 204 is apparently the Miranda 204 site which is missing from the upper inset map ; see above). Amazonas : A series of site numbers shown on the map aren't listed in the Catalogue, including nos 34, 62, 98, 152, 186, 302, 399, and 401. Furthermore, n° 97 is shown twice on the map (c. 2° N. lat. and c. 2° 40' N. lat.), while n° 276 is both shown on the inset map and the main map, but at different locations. N° 277 is twice on the map (c. 2° N. lat. and c. 4° N. lat.). The map omits to show Catalogue numbers 9, 138, 260, and 414-421. Finally, nos 123 and 299 are indicated on the map of Bolivar. Bolivar : Map nos 16, 140, and</page><page sequence="5">260 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES 165 aren't listed in the Catalogue. Map nos 123 and 299 are listed as situated in Amazonas. Catalogue nos 34 and 65 aren't shown on the map, while Catalogue n° 62 is shown on the Amazonas map. Guärico : Map n° 45 is on the Aragua list. Lara : Map n° 167 isn't listed in the Catalogue. Its n° 330 isn't shown on the map. Mérida : Map n° 357 isn't to be found in the Catalogue. Carabobo : Item 422 on the list is incomplete; it doesn't mention the location of the site. Delgado (1976 : 225 and Fig. 71) relocates this petroglyp " cerca de Aguirre ". The Bibliography, finally, has 261 items, including 43 cases of 'personal communication'. It contains only titles which are referred to in the Graphic Catalogue. Of course the authors are entitled to this decision ; however, a " Bibliography of Venezuelan Rock Art ", completing and, where necessary, correcting preceding bibliographies on this subject (Sujo Volsky 1975, Delgado 1976, etc.) would have been very welcome. Checking his " Bibliography of South American and Antillean Petroglyphs " (manuscript ; c. 3500 entries), the reviewer found more than a hundred literature references regarding Venezuela which don't appear in the DPV bibliography. Although no systematic search was made by the reviewer, he came across some references to sites which are missing from the Catalogue. These include Saint-Roque, Copey Mountains near the Tuyo River (Marcano 1889a : 64-65), Raudal de Mantecal, Cuchivero River (Passarge 1933 : 184-185), a large, beautifully carved monolith from a site near Puerto Cabello, now in the National Museum, Copenhague, Denmark (Birket-Smith 1948 Fig. 290), and Hacienda Estancia, 1 Z* hours by jeep from La Victoria (Sadao Hashimoto 1970). DVP lists literature published up to 1986. There are some incomplete references (Nos 12, 14, 26, 30, 31, 32, 42, 103, 115, 129, 145, 166, 172, 207, 217, 227, and 250). A reference like 'El Nacional 1968' necessitates one to leaf through a whole year of issues of this daily newspaper. And what to do with references to articles dated 19.. ? Finally, the reviewer noted down some type setting errors in the bibliography. N° 20 : 1972 instead of 1979, 1 de Noviembre i.s.o. 1 de Febrero ; N° 66 : 152-157 i.s.o. 152-177 ; N° 83 : De Valencia and Huizi i.s.o. Huizi and De Valencia; N° 93 : 1977 i.s.o. 1976 ; N° 96 : 36-47 i.s.o. 36-42 ; Nos 106 and 116 : titles with spelling errors ; N° 230 duplicates N° 228 ; N° 232 : 1978 i.s.o. 1979 ; and N° 253 : p. 36 i.s.o. pp. 16-21. In spite of these inaccuracies, El Disefio en los Petroglifos Venezolanos can be characterized as an important study, containing much information for students of Venezuelan rock art. The fact that it is written in three languages significantly enlarges the number of potential users. In the opinion of the reviewer, the presentation of data forms the most important part of the work. (With thanks to Dr. A. Boomert, Alkmaar, The Netherlands ; Dr. J.
