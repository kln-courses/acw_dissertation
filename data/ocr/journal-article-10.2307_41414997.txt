The importance of recognizing meaning's capacity for sublimation from "something" to "nothing" is a major point of the play, and it constitutes a stage of knowledge for the subject whose identity is in transition. This stage, in which the subject comes face-to-face with radical absence, is crucial to the work of two contemporary poets, Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon, as they move from an identity grounded in biographical and sociopolitical realia to an abstract view of identity located in a so-called "nothing" and composed of conceptual and imaginative structures. After an early career that positioned the self in a tangible geography, these two poets, in their middle work, seek to inhabit a space between and outside of established paradigms of belonging, a space that Seamus Heaney calls "a bright nowhere." Heaney's "Clearances" sonnets deconstruct an emotionally charged space and luxuriate in the potential of "a bright nowhere;" they may be juxtaposed to Mahon's "Leaves," which deconstructs the position of the subject in the space of its own life. These metaphors of disassemblage are balanced by two poems of reconstruction: Heaney's "Markings" builds up the perceptual process itself by showing how the mind marks space to construct meaning upon it; Mahon's "A Garage in Co. Cork" reconstructs both an abandoned site and the perceiving subject, who gains agency by means of his/her ability to transform a ruin into an ideal space. The political idea of absence, as a colonial imposition upon the subjected land, is rejected in favor of a necessary abstraction and depoliticisation of absence; this abstraction enables the poet to assert lyric form as a constructive mode in which to rethink and re-create space. One cannot transcend history "on the ground" but one can sublimate it above the local ground and, finally, re-embody it in the materiality of poetic language. The beginnings of these poets' careers shed light on the crucial space-clearing gestures that they make in the middle of their writing lives. Mahon and Heaney are often dichotomised as two members of the Sixties Generation who took radically different poetic paths, one leading away from the local ground, and one leading further into it. They were both young talents who published their first poems as university students. Heaney's early poems put down roots into his local County Derry soil, whereas Mahon's enact a rebellious gesture away from his Belfast home. Two such early poems, Heaney's "Digging" (published 1966) and Mahon's "Spring in Belfast" (published 1968) epitomise these positions: the former boastfully assesses a family tradition of working the land even while the speaker reaches for a pen instead of a spade to dig into origins; the latter presents a speaker walking amongst "[his] own" people and proclaims his decision not to engage the troubles around him. These situations recur throughout the poets' oeuvres, yet critical accounts of Heaney and Mahon's development have been hampered by the strength of their poetic débuts. These débuts over-influence discussion of their later work. The fact is that these poets underwent radical changes at several points in their careers, and they vociferously contest their initial statements of self-positioning in later poems. After several volumes of poetry that essentially continued his initial poetic trajectory, Heaney begins, in Station Island (1984), to write an increasingly deracinated verse, or rather, a verse in which roots were simply not at issue, for a period of time (essentially until "Electric Light, 2001). Of course not all of his middle-stage poems differ so markedly from his early work - they still contain many memories of childhood, and poems planted in the soil of the family farm - but there is also a new strain: a reaching toward abstraction, a consideration of emptiness, and a conscious un-learning of place and association. Heaney's particular poetic problem, shared partially by Mahon, is that, due to his early poetic reputation, he has become overly invested in one particular poetic identity. Heaney is too quickly labeled as a poet of physicality and roots. This reputation rests mainly on his early work until North (1975), a volume in which grouped nouns ("antler combs," "bone pins," etc.) "glitter like sacred artifacts," according to one scholar (Crotty 195). Objects are too quickly historicised and, simultaneously, made mythical, and their potency is consequently over-emphasised by Heaney's readers. This sort of poetry stacks up parallels between ancient and modern societies and plays with the idea of a primeval "Northern" identity. Literary critic Stan Smith criticises Heaney for "playing up to English attempts to settle an identity on Ireland" (Smith 143), and this flirtation with settled identity takes place on the individual as well as the social level. He has been too quick to know his place, and in order to attain a broader self-knowledge - including one of the self's capacity for un-settlement - he makes a serious space-clearing gesture. This gesture must be partially abstract because of his felt need to transcend particularity. Heaney's abstract allegories, though, are not always his most successful poems (see "The Disappearing Island"). The "Clearances" sonnets succeed because they do not abandon the physicality that Heaney conjures so deftly, but they insist on breaking it down. CJIS/RCÉI 35:2 21</page><page sequence="2">David Lloyd, one of Heaney's most sophisticated political critics, situates Irish culture within the matrix of British Romanticism and connects Irish cultural production to a nationalist project of giving the people paternity. Rootedness in the "primary soil" of Ireland, as accomplished by deploying metaphors of grounding, will make the Irish mind distinct, though Lloyd recognises the "anomalous" quality of a society that is fundamentally divided even as its nationalist ideology seeks an unifying bedrock. Although Heaney briefly considers the concept of deterritorialisation, he ultimately does not explore the quality of dispossession. Rather, Lloyd holds, Heaney relocates an individual and a social identity through the re-territorialisation of language and culture (14-20). Lloyd, however, does not account for the subgroup of poems in which Heaney purposely lifts himself away from questions of territory and fails to account for an important split within the voice of Heaney's (and of Mahon's) poems: the private and the political do not always easily mesh. More than that: they often differ, struggle, and clash. The myth of a unified poetic voice covers over a very real problem in this work, and perhaps in all writing that aspires to have a broad reach. The voice of an angry young man who makes histrionic political gestures sometimes gives way to a different voice in midlife, one which values privacy and wishes to sublimate questions of blood and belonging into questions of spirit. This statement is true of both Heaney and Mahon. Both poets share a focus upon the self's relation to its place yet neither is satisfied with ideology, even a promising ideology. Their poetic voices reveal that the private is not always political. Yet the type of privacy that readers and critics allow Heaney and Mahon is inevitably tinted by the knowledge of their public backdrop. When both poets were in their late twenties, they began to publish through English presses, Heaney with Faber and Faber and Mahon with Oxford University Press. This is not a surprising choice, since postcolonial writing must, traditionally, be endorsed by a metropolis in order to have a global reach. The two ambitious poets reached for prestigious and widely distributed presses (it should be noted that in the mid-eighties Mahon started publishing with Peter Fallon's Gallery Press, housed in Oldcasde, Ireland, although Oxford functioned as distributor for certain volumes). The publishing center for poetry in English has traditionally been London, the home of Faber and Oxford. For this reason I disagree with the scholarly opinion that so-called Anglo-Irish writing ended when Ireland achieved independence in 1922. A. Norman Jeffares writes that "[t]hose born after that date are, surely, Irish writers, writers no longer torn between the old pulls of English and Irish culture and history; and so the history of Anglo-Irish writing may end at that point" (Jeffares 94-95). My concern is less with the semantics of the "Anglo-Irish" label than with Jeffares' assumption that the achievement of independence marks an end to "the old pulls" of colonised and colonizing cultures. The relative marginality of Ireland in Western culture is due to its colonisation, its exploitation, and its poverty (before the Celtic Tiger bared its fangs). The old pulls continue, and they include both a pull toward the colonial center (London) and a countervailing pull toward 22 KAY Heaney and Mahon local commitment. Romantic Ireland is not quite dead and gone, as Yeats would have it in 1916, but is present in the postcolonial dilemma of Irish writers who do not wish to be "irresponsible" toward their birthplace but also do not want to be ideological poets or, just as bad, poets of local colour. Perhaps Heaney and Mahon's concentration upon emptiness, in the middle point of their careers, is additionally motivated by a wish to create work that does not fulfill the metropolitan taste for picturesque detail. Heaney, in particular, has been accused of this tendency; the derogatory adjective "Heaneyspeak" has been coined to describe an emotionally overloaded, self-indulgent aestheticism. Yet at a certain stage both Heaney and Mahon refuse to satisfy a taste for exoticism by creating clearly discernible local landscapes that are tinged with a mysterious otherness. Instead, they reach toward an abstract space beyond the here and now. This space allows for the poet to become, however temporarily, a deracinated visionary, free to "ramify" outward instead of gripping down on roots: I thought of walking round and round a space Utterly empty, utterly a source Where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place In our front hedge above the wallflowers. The white chips jumped and jumped and skited high. I heard the hatchet's differentiated Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh And collapse of what luxuriated Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all. Deep-planted and long gone, my coeval Chestnut from a jam jar in a hole, Its heft and hush became a bright nowhere, A soul ramifying and forever Silent, beyond silence listened for. (Heaney, "Clearances" VIII, The Haw bantern , 32) The poem is an act of purgation: specific place is consciously turned into abstract space. Both Derek Mahon and Seamus Heaney point toward the value of empty space for a poetic voice that feels claustrophobically enclosed in its "home" place. Perhaps the speaker can locate himself in the gaps between the binary terms that so often structure postcolonial thought, such as "here" and "elsewhere," "local" (authentic) and "global" (corrupt). Post-structuralist theory has proven the cognitive potential of absences and gaps in meaning; postcolonial theory has explored the potential of cultural limina. This latter concept has been provocatively applied to the field of Irish Studies ever since Declan Kiberd's influential Inventìnglreland (1995): Ireland's liminality is seen as a definitional problem firsdy, as the country is "pressed into service" to meet English demands and fantasies and is defined from the outside looking in (Kiberd 1). It is a theoretical problem secondly, as Ireland's complication of traditional colonial categories (as a Western European colony; as white yet racially "othered"; as partially complicit in British colonizing missions elsewhere) renders it conceptually "unstable" (see Graham 94, on Ireland as a "superstructural predicate"). It is a retrospective category as well, as scholars such as Andrew Murphy discuss fictional Irish characters in these terms; for instance, Shakespeare's stage-Irishman Macmorris (of Henry K, in which he famously asks, "What ish my nation?") is discussed in reference to a hybridised yet simultaneously liminal, uncertain, Irish identity (Murphy 118-</page><page sequence="3">19). These conceptions of liminality are thoroughly political. My own use of the term conjoins the epistemologically disruptive character of Irish liminality, as Ireland at least partially resists the binaries of postcolonial thought, with another type of disruption, that of the political domain itself. In other words, when Heaney's sonnet turns specific place into abstract space, it also seeks to divest itself of much of the political weight that specific place bears. It momentarily escapes, with relief, from the politically tense place that the speaker inhabits, and luxuriates in a "bright nowhere." This is one of the main reasons, I believe, why such "clearances" are attractive to Heaney and to Mahon. The specific philosophical influences that may come to bear on this concept are less at issue here than the way in which Heaney and Mahon animate a rich conceptual field and the specific significance that this has for their poetic oeuvres. Heaney allegorises spatial evacuation in "A Disappearing Island," a poem in which vision is connected with the disappearance of solidity; the later "Postscript" locates the sense of being caught "neither here nor there" within the self, referring obliquely to Yeats 's romantic eschatology in "The Wild Swans at Coole," but vivifies the perceptual fullness and drama surrounding the speaker rather than plumbing the in-between space itself. The "Clearances" sonnets best exemplify the process of moving from solid "something" to airy "nothing." The above-cited poem begins with thinking in order to connect thought to material. Yet materiality is consequently erased. The physicality of rhythmic pacing connects thought and earth: "walking round and round a space / Utterly empty, utterly a source." Verbal and physical repetition sanctifies this absence in an almost ritualistic manner, so that we hear a rhythmic invocation of the visionary "source" that demands the demolition of the tree's "place." This rhythm is opposed to the "differentiated" and "accurate" hatchet cut. It belongs to the realm of spirit; in the background one may hear the Byzantine Yeats exploring the process whereby "fresh images" rooted in mortality undergo a purgative dance through fire in order to become eternal symbols of the Anima Mundi. Heaney, however, does not wish to piece together a Yeatsian symbology, but to enact a highly personalised process of purgation. The familial ring of the fourth line ("our front hedge," "the wallflowers") keeps us at the childhood home. This emphasis on biographical detail, even while the poet looks beyond earthly existence, keeps the speaker from becoming a Yeatsian spirit-summoner. His goal is not to follow the soul on its path but to insist on its infinite ramification. The reader is told to shift her focus from the singularity of the object to the space into which it disappears. As his language pitches itself "beyond silence listened for," spatial specificity becomes submerged in the linguistic act of venturing beyond what is specified. The subject loses its distinction as the language reaches beyond metaphor. This sublimation may seem odd for a poet associated with "roots and graftings." Yet Heaney has also, from his earliest work on, been an elegist. The elegiac impulse remains in this poem memorializing a chestnut tree. It is pursued past invocation into sublimation, past personality into infinite silence. Heaney explores the quality of absence in a manner congruent to, but not identical with, Wallace Stevens' famous "The Snow Man," which insists upon the necessity of "a mind of winter" in order to assess a bare landscape, ... [to hear] the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place For the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. (Stevens, Collected Poems, 9) The poem is a relevant intertext because it strongly evokes a process that Heaney grasps more tentatively than Stevens. The listener must clear his own mind of "[n]othing that is not there" in order to accurately perceive the bareness of his place and the concomitant similitude of sound, movement (wind), and place: evacuation brings a new unity into sight. Stevens highlights the abstract quality of his paradox in his repetition of "nothing" and his playful confusion of subject and object. Heaney enjoys the material nature of the same basic paradox: "Deep-planted and long gone," the tree has had "[i]ts heft and hush become a bright nowhere." A certain satisfaction can be discerned in his juxtaposition of deep roots and long absence, and in the fanciful nouns "heft and hush" transmuted into brightness and "nowhere." This satisfaction is not present in Stevens' poem, which bears down upon the same stressed words insistendy and unforgivingly: the "same wind" in the "same bare place" is matched by "nothing himself" and "nothing that is," where each repeated phrase contains multiple stresses that gather in an almost menacing manner. This ponderous nothing-that-is- somethingis a different "nothing" from Heaney's "nowhere" even while both poems desire a similar attunement, and the clotted rhythm of Stevens' lines underscores the difference. Whereas Stevens pushes his listener to conjoin physical and emotional self-transcendence in order to behold his surroundings with the abstract exactitude of a mind of winter, Heaney pushes his thinker to move seamlessly from personal space-filling memory to a space that transcends the personal but is marked by potentiality rather than presence. "The nothing that is" forms a non-representational layer around and above the misery of the winter landscape; the "bright nowhere" forms a space that cannot be "listened for" at all. Stevens provides Heaney and Mahon with a sustained effort to think through poetic abstraction from poetry's own point of view. At the same time, he is noteworthy for his insistence that we willingly believe in a "supreme fiction" with full knowledge of its fictive nature (which does not undermine the value or necessity of the fiction). Both Stevens and Heaney insist upon the negative act of rejecting the anthropomorphic sound of the land, or the physicality of the coeval tree, yet Heaney insists upon the purity of this space, which is concomitant to its impenetrability. Stevens explores the possibility of a poetry that attempts to exceed its own conceptual definition; Heaney wishes to step into this space of possibility for sociopolitical as well as artistic reasons. Although Heaney's poem is a sonnet, the speaker is not enclosed in a small room but in an expansive liminal zone between full absence and full presence. He fuses the emotive power of elegy, the tight sonnet form, and the power CJIS/RCÉI 35:2 23</page><page sequence="4">of abstraction in order to purposefully inhabit and then dis- inhabit a space by reaching beyond what is listened for. The new space of knowledge "beyond silence listened for" is also beyond the already-inscribed and much-fought- over earth. It is beyond the loud silences of the colonised and the subjugated. These are the silences that postcolonial artists and scholars actively listen for, and rightly so, but this speaker wants to reach a new silence that may furnish him an alternate space to find, and exert, authorial agency. Cultural theorist Paul Gilroy recommends "[the] principled and methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history," especially in turbulent political climates, in order to reach a broadly multicultural understanding of one's one place ("cosmopolitan" in the best, most inclusive sense of the word). Gilroy's statement is situated within a defense of translocal solidarity, a concept that has become tainted by a suspicion of imperial arrogance. Yet he is not the only scholar attempting to resuscitate the spirit of cosmopolitanism in a non-homogenizing, anti- imperialist framework; this concept has been perhaps the single most debated nexus of ideas since the 1990s (Gilroy 75). His call for a degree of estrangement from one's history may seem surprising, but this estrangement is exactly what Heaney is cultivating when he metaphorically cuts down the thick growth around his home place. Gilroy's statement usefully extends the conceptual reach of Heaney's poem. Heaney is more than capable of resuscitating the tree and the first-person plural "we" lurking behind his sonnet ("our front hedge"), but here a different act is taking place, for the eventual purpose of broadening the scope of his poetic. Utter emptiness is tantamount to utter possibility ("utterly a source") - the more empty the space, the more complete its potential. This epistemological revelation is especially important for a poet in a postcolonial country, where space may be filled with elements not of one's choosing. Gilroy's claim for translocal solidarity by means of self-estrangement represents an attempt to combat the over-determination of personality by negative politics, as does David Lloyd's claim that the project of postcolonial studies is "to open the spaces within which unsubordinated narratives can resonate." These spaces must be initially cleared by writers who insist that we look beyond what we are taught to "listen for" - in other words, beyond the simplistic binary of victim and oppressor, victim's tale and colonialist's tale. If colonialism may be viewed as a violation of space, and a forced perversion of the individual's relation to his or her place, then the purposeful evacuation of space can be a mode of resistance as well as outreach. This act must be at least partially abstract because space can never be fully emptied. It must step beyond the communication of material realities - and beyond satisfaction with realities that are merely material. This space has the potential to signify a vantage point away from the unhealthy social order that motivates the act of clearance. The search for a space beyond a place ruled by material conditions, and the situation of one's self beyond the pressure of material causes, also animates Derek Mahon's "Leaves." This poem, however, enacts a sort of self- disassemblage. Whereas Heaney empties out space, Mahon 24 KAY Heaney and Mahon effaces the spatio-temporal coordinates of the self in space. The poem's philosophical background is existential, as it takes apart our notion of the constructed subject: The prisoners of infinite choice Have built their house In a field below the wood And are at peace. It is autumn, and dead leaves On their way to the river Scratch like birds at the windows Or tick on the road. Somewhere there is an afterlife Of dead leaves, A stadium filled with an infinite Rustling and sighing. Somewhere in the heaven Of lost futures The lives we might have led Have found their own fulfillment. ("Leaves" in Mahon, Collected Poems , 60. First published in The Snow Party, 1975) The speaker effectively de-constructs (but not demolishes) the position of the subject in his/her own life. The focus here is on the open potentiality of the moment of choice and its necessary closure in what we call "real life," which may not correspond to the life of the imagination. The mind is located between actuality and possibility, between identity and desire. The unity of the personal realm - i.e., the life and acts of the individual subjectivity - is cracked apart so that we can see the lost possibilities that are unaccounted for by biography or by history. The intensely private, unvoiced nature of the unmade choice leads this poem to the frontier of "the nothing that is" within an individual's life story. Heaney has noted that in Mahon's work, "place symbolises a personal drama before it epitomises a communal situation." At the same time, Heaney points out, Mahon does not often impose his authorial personality upon the sensed image, and place is often made general or symbolic rather than biographical (Heaney in McGuinness 139). Here, the "personal drama" itself is made abstract, as the coherence of the subject - the unity of its "personality" - is problematised. In both "Leaves" and "Clearances" VIII, the abstract concept is active enough to stage its own poetic event. There is no clear subject writing the poem - "the prisoners of infinite choice" are discarded after their choice is made in the first stanza. The speaker is not placed and available in this poem, but he is clearly present in its emotional stance and its unusual verb tenses: the moment of choice is pinned down in the perfect, the leaves' journey is in an increasingly vague present that becomes "infinite," and our un-led lives, un-made choices, are couched in an odd subjunctive that links past possibility with future fulfillment. This compositional complexity points toward the complex nature of the agency it exerts. The poem foregrounds its verb tenses because it pulls apart the idea that one life can be represented as a temporal continuum. A falsely prevalent notion of temporal belonging is parallel to a falsely-assumed notion of spatial rootedness: "The lives we might have led" are collected in a "Somewhere" which may have greater value for the individual than the</page><page sequence="5">"actual" spatio-temporal coordinates which imprison him. This "Somewhere" may contain his thoughts and emotions far more readily than an indicative here and now. These poems are aware of the inevitable situatedness of the self in social space, which serves as the bedrock for their idealist desire for transcendence. The desired space must be ideal if it is to serve as an imaginative counterweight to the disabling materiality of the self on the ground. It must be indicated by the vagueness of "somewhere," "nowhere," and the subjunctive mood, in order to work against the social re- grounding that its linguistic concrétisation would accomplish. Poetic metaphor, though, must be material: Mahon imagines a stadium, and Heaney a chestnut tree, thereby "placing" their poems in urban and rural contexts and anchoring them in concrete images. The problem moment, the locus of tension, is in the present. Heaney's "nowhere" is specified in Mahon's poem as a "somewhere" because this speaker cannot situate fulfillment in the present. Heaney can because he allows for a greater unity of self behind his ritualistic entrance into absence. Mahon, on the other hand, presents a self who wishes to dwell in the limina between made choices, to involve himself with what-could-have-been. The poem builds a sense of diminishment by devolving from a constructed choice to an unspecified, unsituated, and unmetaphorised site of eventual fulfillment. This site is unimaginable: the fourth stanza contains no grounding metaphor, no singular image that clinches the deal between past possibility and future fulfillment. The vacant space between metaphors is where the subject definitively slips the poem's grasp. As long as he produces metaphorical images, the reader can place the author in a matrix of cultural referents, however vague or commonplace (house, road, leaves, Dantean forest) they may be. Yet this speaker dismantles his unitary character, stripping away choice, boundedness (in life, in place), and the indicative mood, in order to dissolve into a horizon of lost possibility. The project of historicizing literature should be approached with caution, for it may entail certain dangerous closures for the text. Mahon's poem may be read historically - as I will soon demonstrate - but its subjunctive phrases warn us away from the assignment of definitive historical values. The self-deconstructing subject simply cannot be read as a singular historical actor. We may recall Yeats's insistence that style is authenticity, and the subject must wear a mask in order to perform his/her subjecthood socially. "Leaves" insists upon the existence of a plurality of masks and selves who are, somewhere, present. Here in our placed conditions, we can only have access to the "bright nowhere" of their absence. Self-knowledge is compromised by the imperfect choices one has made. The self to which we have access is necessarily contingent and relational, poised on the brink of another imprisoning choice. Is it possible to trace back a set of "lost futures" to their origin, when the self was a blank page ready to be inscribed with any possible narrative? An originary "blank" self is as much of a chimera as an authentic "native" culture unmarked by difference, and these poems about nowheres and lost futures may be read as attempts to dislocate the self from an un-chosen historical condition. Jean-Paul Sartre's maxim that "man is condemned to be free" lies beneath the surface of the poem. Mahon's speaker wishes to negotiate the consequences of his freedom to choose but also to make clear the necessary partiality of that freedom: a choice for one option will always foreclose others. The conditions of choice are not free, and freedom is not equal to fulfillment. Reading at the most obvious political level, the establishment of a "free" independent Ireland in 1922 did not coincide with a sense of fulfillment for much of the population. The freedom to define national identity was only partially given, since the Irish Free State would continue to bear the scars of its semi-colonial, internally divided situation. Mahon's stadium full of dead leaves "rustling and sighing" may not have active political agency, but it furnishes a pathetic sight for those who have built a house of their choosing. The poem does not consider whether the "heaven of lost futures" might disturb the peace of the house-dwellers unless we read "peace" ironically, as an impossible condition for "prisoners of infinite choice" to have in the first place (hence, perhaps, the near-rhymes which cannot quite be made between "house," "choice," and "peace"). In "Leaves," one's existential freedom jars against the repressive conditions of history - existentialism needs to be modified in a postcolonial society if it is to serve. The incapacity of the poet to truly believe in being "at peace" is one of the emotional nuclei of the poem. Mahon has been strongly criticised for refusing to place himself inside the social world. This world has no "compelling substantiality" for him, as it has for Heaney; he is "severed from [a] sustaining rootedness" in daily life (Waterman 39-41). It is true that the free movement of the leaves compels the poet more than the finished act of construction. Mahon is drawn to deracination rather than to roots. Yet Waterman's unquestioned association of "compelling" with "substantiality" and of "sustaining" with "rootedness" dismantles the veracity of this critique. From an ontological point of view, the palpable reality of nothingness demands poetic response - one feels a compulsion to confront it not just in Mahon but in Stevens, Beckett, Larkin, Heaney, and Walcott, to name just a few recent writers who seek to make peace with "too much nothing" (Walcott's phrase). From a historical point of view, the very notion of "sustaining rootedness" implies a valorisation of attachment that overlooks the forcible disconnection of roots in a postcolonial land. Rootedness is sustaining if one can legitimately believe in salubrious continuity. When roots prove to be tangled, hybrid, and occasionally cut for good, this notion must be questioned. In Mahon's poem, the un-placed leaves are in an in- between place, "somewhere" and nowhere, dead and yet still present. They are unrooted and possibly uprooted, travelling fitfully toward a telos, the river, which is itself traveling. The leaves are unhoused and vulnerable in their lack of substantiality. They scratch at the house. They "tick" like a walked bicycle or, perhaps, like a bomb. This spare, short- vowelled monosyllable may be read as an indirect reference to the May, 1974 bombings in Dublin and Monaghan, which occurred shortly before Mahon's volume (The Snow Party) was published in 1975; within the poem, ticking gestures CJIS/RCÉI 35:2 25</page><page sequence="6">toward the possibility of violence in the act of choice. The slant rhyme between "house" and "peace" evinces a latent desire to avoid this ominous ticking by forging a Utopian equivalence between the enclosure of home and the condition of peace, strained as it may be. These leaves are on the margin of history. This is the most compelling place for poetic articulation to Mahon. The poem's structure, though, leads one to ask whether it is the mainframe of history that is marginal, since it is not consonant with the speaker's imagination. The poet's emphasis here is on unrecordable histories, with suspicious ontologies, that will remain unsituated in intellectual and historical space. At the same time, Mahon does not gesture toward transcendence. His poem depends on an opposition between the far-off "heaven" of fulfilled futures and a dry, diminished natural world, with human life located in the in- between. The speaker lives apart from the land of infinite possibility, as does Heaney's speaker. He can only see through a glass darkly, or brightly as it were. Samuel Beckett is the main influence behind the dominant image of "Leaves," and Beckett's resolute refusal to accord the self transcendent status furnishes Mahon with his main problematic. His image of leaves comes from Waiting for Godot Estragon: All the dead voices. Vladimir: They make a noise like wings. Estragon: Like leaves. Vladimir: Like sand. Estragon: Like leaves. [Silence.] Vladimir: They speak all at once. Estragon: Each one to itself. [Silence.] Vladimir: What do they say? Estragon: They talk about their lives. Vladimir: To have lived is not enough for them. Estragon: They have to talk about it. Vladimir: To be dead is not enough for them. Estragon: It is not sufficient. (Beckett, Waiting for Godot , 40-41) Vladimir's attempt to open out the metaphoricity of "all the dead voices" is quashed by Estragon; this necessary limitation is picked up by Mahon, whose poem also seeks to open the metaphoric potential of one single life into a plurality of subjunctive "afterlives" (the title of another poem). Yet the plural "we" in the last stanza of "Leaves" - "The lives we might have led" - is not sufficient to erase this singularity. The fact that this condition is shared does not compensate for the self's inability to encompass all other possible lives. Mahon creates a non-compensatory universalism out of our common inability to reach fulfillment unless we move into the bright nowhere of the life not led. Beckett's community of "dead voices" cannot transcend their incapacitated state - they are not "like wings" - or break out of solipsistic communication - "each one [speaks] to itself." Communication with the living is "not sufficient" for either group; the whispering leaves do not help Vladimir and Estragon to adequately define a space of fulfillment. 26 KAY Heaney and Mahon There is a necessarily imperfect fit between liminal self and unitary life. "Leaves" presents an epistemological difficulty: if authenticity is infinitely displaced by a chain of imperfect choices, then one's ability to know and differentiate self and non-self is compromised. If the poet draws his images from imagined communion with an absent soul "beyond silence listened for," then it is wrong to associate his empirical coordinates (social, historical, biographical) with the source of his poetry or with his poetic self. Heaney has been ill served by critics who read his poetry as proof of "how political the self is, how the self-in-isolation is perhaps a fiction" (Healy in Lynch, Fisher and Coates 59). The story of the political self is only one aspect of a life-narrative, and not always the most important aspect; the "fiction" must be reclaimed, perhaps as Stevens' "supreme fiction," which must be abstract, must change, and must give pleasure. Mahon and Heaney assert the value of abstract space in order to un-link the empirical from the imaginative self, thereby asserting the presence of immaterial ideality and the necessity of looking toward it in order to know the self. The supreme fiction changes in response to the proliferation of "lives we might have led" and in response to desire. It would be aesthetically irresponsible not to recognise the capacity of emptiness to give pleasure: Mahon and Heaney do not escape the concrete "here and now" solely because of their desire to escape unfavorable historical conditions, but also in order to take legitimate pleasure in the construction of an ideal space. The terms "ideal," "abstract," and "empty" are of course not synonymous, yet these poems create an important link between them. The "bright nowhere" that Heaney speaks of is an empty place that has become "utterly a source" for the poetic imagination. The physical tree has become an idea, abstracted from its actual presence. Mahon's "lost futures" are abstract by necessity - they are not embodied - and are rendered ideal by the individual fulfillment that each finds. Yet pure abstraction is a chimera - Stevens' "mind of winter" is an absolute and uninhabitable state. Stevens seeks to define a particular type of vision that focuses on seeing the idea rather than the empirical surface of the world (even while the idea must be accessed through empirical perception), and this is the type of vision that Heaney and Mahon are trying to establish in their poems. None of these poets claims privileged access to a noumenal realm, but they seek it in order that it may provide guiding ideals for the creative act. Noumena can only be reached through acts of clearance. The idea of a clearance, though, must still be kept within the human mind, as another of Heaney's sonnets on the death of the poet's mother makes clear: The space we stood around had been emptied Into us to keep, it penetrated Clearances that suddenly stood open. High cries were felled and a pure change happened. ("Clearances" VII, The Haw Lantern, 31) Empty space can be purposefully internalised; the manner in which it is "kept" becomes personal. At the same time, the individual does not have omnipotence over these "clearances." When the poet tries to summon "[a] soul ramifying and forever / Silent," he finds it "beyond</page><page sequence="7">silence listened for." The "pure change" referred to above is, perhaps, at least partially the realisation that "all the dead voices" cannot be summoned at will; instead, one must contend with their absence, with an empty space. Yet this complex passage describes evacuation of outside space as a phenomenon with a necessary concomitant, the internalisation of presence and realisation that internal emptiness is being filled. It is not being filled by the "real" presence of the dead but by their ideal presence. Material transmutes into idea, and into memory. This "pure change" may bring about a radical re-thinking of the poetic act. Elegy turns into philosophy; philosophy leads to new vision. The elegist becomes responsible for filling and elucidating the "bright nowhere" that passes from the outer to the inner world. Their painful, if momentary, severance from the experiential world (through the death of a loved one, or through regret at a "lost future") leads Heaney and Mahon to construct metaphors of transcendence. Each poem may be radically contingent, marked by the self's inevitably changing nature, but contingency need not call forth a skeptical view of the ideal space which the poet strives to establish. These poets take obvious pleasure in their imaginative reconstruction of "something" out of "nothing," emphasizing the movement of transformation rather than the finished construction. Their transformed spaces are ideal - based upon idea rather than empirical necessity or politic strategy - yet they are not idealised in the colloquial sense of being almost inhumanly perfected. This focus upon change does not have politically neutral effects. Firstly, the process of evacuation runs directly counter to the Yeatsian imperative that Irish writers "fix" the national landscape upon their memories in the interest of nationalist) coherence and cultural unity. Secondly, Mahon's emphasis upon deconstructing the unity of a single life and Heaney's emphasis upon the potency of silences which "suddenly" stand open and cannot be "listened for" counter the very notion of a stable anticolonial discourse that can serve the needs of the displaced. Luke Gibbons, a scholar of Irish decolonisation, points out that the "construction of a continuous, unaltered tradition, stretching back to remote antiquity can be seen, in fact, as precisely a colonial imposition, an attempt to emulate in an Irish context the Burkean model of the English constitution based on an organic theory of community and the inherited wisdom of the ages." Irish history, on the other hand, is fragmented, porous, and unstable (Gibbons 157). Although Gibbons' phrasing comes close to a dangerous mockery of perfectly legitimate efforts to explore Irish cultural ties, his opposition to the idea of a continuous and unaltered tradition is valuable. The idea that any cultural tradition can be viewed as harmoniously unified around organic ties and unbroken inheritance is, of course, unviable, and Gibbons presents it in a negative light, yet it is important to highlight the purposefully disruptive efforts of writers such as Heaney and Mahon. They go beyond the notions of hybrid graftings and unheard voices to vivify the acute importance of the unreachable as well as the unheard, and to take obvious pleasure in the metaphorisation of an empty "beyond." The branches of the absent tree can endlessly ramify outwards because the space around them is free of sociocultural coordinates, and allows for maximal agency, growth, and self-fulfillment. This Utopian space is beyond the necessity of political choice. Heaney and Mahon undertake an aggressively private task of re-vision when they take on the poetic task of re- imagining how empty spaces might be filled. Spatial meaning is reconstructed according to private, not public, wishes: Like a frontier store-front in an old western It might haven nothing behind it but thin air, Building materials, fruit boxes, scrap iron, Dust-laden shrubs and coils of rusty wire, A cabbage-white fluttering in the sodden Silence of an untended kitchen garden - Nirvana! But the cracked panes reveal a dark Interior echoing with the cries of children. Here in this quiet corner of Co. Cork A family ate, slept, and watched the rain Dance clean and cobalt the exhausted grit So that the mind shrank from the glare of it. Left to itself, the functional will cast A death-bed glow of picturesque abandon. The intact antiquities of the recent past, Dropped from the retail catalogues, return To the materials that gave rise to them And shine with a late sacramental gleam. ("A Garage in Co. Cork" in Mahon, Collected Poems , 130-31; first published in The Hunt by Night , 1982) The physical materials of boxes, iron, and wire are relegated to the realm of "thin air" because of their inutility. This is the quality that Mahon loves. It allows him to rhyme "air" with "wire," to conflate "sodden / Silence" with "garden," "abandon" and "return:" the lack of social utility allows this industrial detritus to return to a "late sacramental" state far from participation in community (whether conceived nationally, socioculturally as a land of "retail catalogues," or even as a familial home). The silent space after the break following "garden" and the interjection "Nirvana!" is filled with the positive, palpable nothingness that allows the poet to imagine both the lives that might have been led and the process of cleansing evacuation: the rain "dance[s] clean" the unassimilable "grit," allowing its "death-bed glow" to refine itself into a sharp "gleam." The perceiving subject is in a powerful position: he is located in his beloved abandoned space, with a wholly imaginative access to the lives that may have been lived there, yet he is not condemned to dwell therein. Despite the indicative verbs, his imaginative act is a subjunctive act of attunement with what might have been, and how it may be fulfilled through the poeťs vision. The state of intendedness toward the scene unifies the subject; he is not destabilised and incapacitated by conditions not of his choosing, but centered by his desire to give voice to the voiceless detritus, and capacitated by the scene's abandoned quality. It is not a political intention at work here - one can have the intent to depoliticise, to revel in matter's "return" to the sacramental from its communitarian function. The question of whether these former inhabitants may have been émigrés or internees is rendered irrelevant by the poet's aestheticizing vision: the rain "cobalt[s]" the "exhausted grit" into new life, deindustrialising and renaturalising it into the blue of sea and sky. CJIS/RCÉI 35:2 27</page><page sequence="8">Heaney's extended metaphor for subjectively reconstructing space relies more heavily on rationality than Mahon's: We marked the pitch: four jackets on four goalposts, That was all. The corners and the squares Were there like longitude and latitude Under the bumpy ground, to be Agreed or disagreed about When the time came. . . . II You also loved lines pegged out in the garden, The spade nicking the first straight edge along The tight white string. Or string stretched perfectly To make the outline of a house foundation, Pale timber battens set at right angles For every corner, each freshly sawn new board Spick and span in the oddly passive grass. III All of these things entered you As if they were both the door and what came through it. They marked the spot, marked time and held it open. ("Markings" in Heaney, Opened Ground , 335-36; first published in Seeing Things , 1991) The lines must be laid out on the ground in order to, eventually, take their place in the mind; they unite the solid "somewhere" of a private patch of earth with the "bright nowhere" of imaginative space. There is a sense of wonder around this union. It is communicated by the strained metaphor of a soccer game representing spatial organisation - not quite catachresis, but certainly an awkward metaphor for a poet renowned for verbal harmonies. The awkwardness may be, however, intentional: the act of "marking" earth relies on a subjective interpretation of space that is always instrumental, never absolutely "real." Once one has faced the originary emptiness beneath inscription, the act of inscribing might as well be metaphorised in terms of sport, or gardening, or house construction: the perfection of the task depends upon its immediate function. The functional is, in turn, sacralised by its aesthetic perfection. Like Mahon, Heaney takes a palpable pleasure in the poetic act of filling an "oddly passive" ground with fresh materials, right angles, and "spick and span" units of measurements, while insisting, "That was all" - there is no absolute, noumenal division of space, only the humanly chosen divisions that hold open the ungovernable mass of empty space and time. Heaney treats the heavy subject of political division as lightly in this poem as Mahon skirts the possibility of human tragedy in "A Garage in Co. Cork." The "corners and squares" marked by cast-off clothing are "to be / Agreed or disagreed about / When the time came," their accuracy depending upon how the outcome of the game is defended or challenged by each team. He neatly avoids heavy historical moralizing by insisting on the pleasure of the act, as reflected both in the poem's imagery and in the assonantal skip of "tight white string" and the curiously quick spondees of "lines pegged out" or "first straight edge." The tone is light; the mood is enchanted. This poem reflects the joy of a scribe with a blank page before him. What kind of agency is gained by these acts? Aesthetic agency is one out of many terms one could use to describe the power gained by re-imagining an evacuated space. "Agency" is often construed in a political manner in postcolonial critique, yet the agency that Heaney and Mahon gain is the power to transcend politicised material circumstances to a condition of visionary creativity. It is sobered by these circumstances but refuses to be bound to them. Although a poem may always bear some historical inscription, it may also ask to be read in a non-materialist way, and it may bring to life a poetic state that is fundamentally immaterial and apolitical. The urge to depoliticise is rarely given full voice in recent literary criticism (i.e., during and after the "postcolonial moment"). Mahon and Heaney are not attempting to reconstruct a subaltern history in the poems herein discussed but to create a voice speaking beyond historicism. They strive for an ultimate openness that must be idealised if it is to counter disabling local conditions. They do not pretend that the self can be entirely abstracted from its context; nor do they conclude that poetry makes nothing happen in the "real world" due to its transcendent idealism. The current discourse of globalisation, after Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's influential Empire , provides little egress for writers who wish to move from a geo-political "somewhere" to a "bright nowhere." The effort to find a space outside the force-field of neo-colonial "flows" and decentralised power currents may be politically impossible, but it is not imaginatively so. There must be space for a methodology of reading that accounts for the urge to depoliticise. The idea of absence can, in these poems, be evacuated of political content, in the interest of positing the existence of a pure blankness that is poetically enabling. When a structuration of space is attempted, it is done in the interest of establishing a creative relation to place that "mark[s] time" and "[holds] it open" at once. Circuits of power are broken in the image of open time and "utterly empty" space. This evacuation creates a new illumination that the intellect cannot fully encompass: we can watch "the rain / Dance clean and cobalt the exhausted grit / So that the mind shrank from the glare of it," and with time, we can invest this brightness with a "sacramental" value that transcends what we consciously look and listen for. 28 KAY Heaney and Mahon</page><page sequence="9">Works Cited: Adorno, Theodor.
