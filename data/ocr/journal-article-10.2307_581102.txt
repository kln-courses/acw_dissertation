<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 INTRODUCTION This year my report deals mainly with the work of the years 1994, covered in the latest Deltion Chronika (vol. 49), and 1999 based on reports which have been sent to me, the Ergon of the Archaeological Society for 1999 and Kritiki Estia 7 (1999). Compilation has not been made easier by the very late appear- ance of the second volume of the Chronika. We have managed to catch up on AEMTH volumes 8-9 and a new number of AAA, XXIII-XXVIII (1990-95) dedicated to the memory of Julia Vokotopoulou. The now annual report meeting of the Archaeological Service had to be postponed from April to June because of the general election in April. As a result it came after the text of this 'A in G' was closed, so that unfortunately no account could be taken of the newly announced discoveries. A summary record appears at the end of the meeting: 'The work of the Ministry of Culture in the Sphere of Cultural Heritage' which I have abbre- viated as Epyov YT7O70 (to distinguish it from the Ergon of the AS). As I wrote last year, with reference to the first volume of this publication, covering 1997, this is a difficult text to han- dle, since it contains long lists of telegraphic references (and when some correspondents wrote to me asking for more infor- mation, I had to tell them that I had quoted the one sentence in full). It is also a text not available in Western Europe: for vol. 2 we have only one copy at the BSA, which has meant that some contributors to this year's 'A in G' have not had access to it, so in this respect the account is not complete this year (Northern Greece and Crete are covered). I again ask for comment, as last year, and assure readers that copies of vols 1-3 are available in the BSA library, under tight security! For the Deltion Chronika, references to the current volume are given by page number if possible, and without the volume number; references to earlier volumes include the volume number. Use of press reports has been restricted, but a file of press cuttings is available in the BSA library. My work on these sources has been greatly facilitated by the contributions of a number of Members and Students of the School resident in Greece: Lesley Beaumont and Archondia Thanos (Northeast Aegean Islands); Jill Carington Smith (pre- historic to Roman northern Greece), Eleni Hatzaki (Crete), Iphigenia Toumavitou (prehistoric to Roman central and south- ern Greece) and David Turner (Byzantine Greece, except Crete). Yana Spence, Anna Stellatou and Anne Blackman helped with translations, Helen Fields with editing and sequencing the text, and Anna Stellatou with typing. I am most grateful to all of them. I have had a number of favourable comments about the increased number of illustrations, and hope for the continued generous support of the Hellenic Society towards the cost of publication, which is much appreciated. For an explanation of the types of field work carried out in Greece and their forms of publication, and the other sources of information on which the compiler of 'A in G' can and must draw, I can do no better than refer the reader again to the mas- terly introduction by Hector Catling to his last contribution (AR 1988-89, 3-8). The economic and touristic development of the country con- tinues to provide a threat to the cultural and natural heritage of Greece. This includes pipeline construction, doubling of the railway track from Athens to Thessalonike, airport construction, major new motorway projects, harbour enlargement and marine construction, gravel-digging in the Alpheios, and a now immi- nent crash construction programme to prepare for the Athens Olympics in 2004. It is not just the private sector that is respon- sible: in Paros the local authority supported a harbour extension even when submerged antiquities were being dredged up, and on Naxos a new road was being smashed through a wild part of the coast, at least twice the width needed, in order to meet EU guidelines and get EU funding (this work has fortunately been stopped). The fate of Navarino bay is still uncertain. The Archaeological Service makes heroic efforts to limit the dam- age and at least ensure pre-disturbance survey and excavation. A good moment was the recovery of 271 objects stolen from Corinth museum. The year 1999 will be remembered as the year of the Athens earthquake (7th September)-a total surprise since the last one in Athens was in 1705-resulting in large loss of life and larg- er numbers of homeless. The damage to ancient sites was limit- ed in comparison: notably Daphne Monastery, a number of churches and the ancient frontier fort at Phyle. The Ministry of Culture was forced to divert a considerable part of the Archaeological Service's excavation budget to deal with the necessary restoration. The only positive benefit was the start of the Greco-Turkish rapprochement. The Parthenon Marbles have remained in the headlines, with the various visits of Greek delegations to London, which included participation in a special seminar at the British Museum; the visit of the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture to Greece in late March 2000; and the appearance before that Committee in London of the Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, in early June. The unification of archaeological sites in Athens is now making progress, the greatest impact on the public being the closure of Odos Dionysiou Areopagitou along the south side of the Acropolis. A major building complex of the 7th Ct AD was found during excavations on the proposed site for the future Acropolis Museum. The cost of illuminating the Acropolis for what most regarded as the start of the millennium was a matter of much comment (see the trenchant remarks by B. Petrakos in the Ergon for 1999). An interesting development was the open- ing of a Cyprus Branch of the Archaeological Society of Athens, which will concentrate on the restoration of Byzantine religious monuments. It has been a rich year for exhibitions, my personal selection of which includes: 'Crete and Egypt' (Herakleion); 'The City beneath the City' (see below under Athens); the Bronze Age exhibition at the National Museum; 'KaoTpcov TTEpirrXous' in Athens; and exhibitions concerned with the excavations on major road developments in Thesprotia and Phthiotis. Many exhibitions on 'Water' were held during the European Cultural Heritage Days of September 1999-in 1997 and 1998 the sub- ject had been 'Harbours'. In 2000 the BSA celebrates 100 years of systematic excavation at Knossos, and the ASCS 100 years of work in eastern Crete. New museums have been opened at Monemvasia, Lavrion, Chios, Drama, Abdera, Kalamata, anc. Messene, Santorini and Megara, and the Benaki Museum in Athens has reopened. On Delos the lions have been moved indoors. Conferences have covered subjects such as ancient ship-building (Pylos); colour in ancient Greece (Thessalonike); burial practices and traditions (Rhodes); museum development (Sparta); the periphery of the Mycenaean world (Lamia); and medieval pottery (7th Congress, Thessalonike). In Athens I particularly enjoyed the lecture series on 'Greek Archaeology without Frontiers' at the National Research Foundation. In the general reshuffle after the election, Mr Pangalos became Minister of Culture, with Mrs Papazoi moving to</page><page sequence="2">4 DAVID BLACKMAN become Deputy Foreign Minister. Mrs Lina Mendoni has remained as Secretary General of the Ministry. Mr Lazaros Kolonas (formerly Ephor in Patras) has become Director General of Antiquities; Mr Evangelos Kakavoyannis has moved from the Attika (2nd) Ephorate to become Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, and Mrs Parlama has returned to her post as Ephor of Athens (Third Ephorate)-we wish them all well. We report with sadness the deaths of notable figures in Greek archaeology: Kallimachos Antonakos, Ulf Jantzen, Demetrios Khaniotis, Maria Mangafa, Nikos Oikonomides, Miltes Paraskevaides, Toni Raubitschek, Karl Schefold and Homer Thompson.

John McK. Camp, II reports on the 1999 (ASCS) season of excavation: 'Most of the work this season was concentrated in the upper levels in the N half of section BZ. The Byz levels first uncov- ered last season were more fully explored this year, with good results. Long stretches of relatively well-preserved street walls were found on both sides of the narrow (2.60m) N-S street which runs through the section, and the plans of the houses behind began to emerge. Parts of three houses were uncov- ered-the two eastern ones joining with rooms excavated in 1991/1992-along with an alleyway running E-W at the N end of the section (Fig. 1). Two R carved gemstones-one depict- ing Athena, the other Fortuna (Fig. 2)-were recovered from the upper levels of the alley. The house walls are of rubble set in earth, incorporating a considerable number of large squared blocks clearly borrowed from some earlier structures. One reused piece was the upper part of a marble herm, inscribed with a invocation to Agathe Tyche. The number of built pithoi or subterranean storage bins in these houses is striking. Several more were added to the number found last season, and multiple examples are now known for many rooms. These can be seen as a regular feature of these houses and they represent impressive storage capacity, far more than usually encountered in a C or HL private house of similar size. Also characteristic is the den- sity of construction: the houses are closely crowded together, even sharing party walls. After two centuries of abandonment, our area became thickly inhabited, the neighborhood growing up in a relatively short time. Welcome evidence for the chronol- ogy of the buildings was encountered in the form of a small</page><page sequence="4">6 DAVID BLACKMAN 1. A-eIiS. Agora, strLee hoard of 21 copper coins in good condition (Fig. 3). They show the bust of Christ on one side and the four-line inscription 'Jesus Christ king of kings' on the reverse. They are part of a class (A) of 'anonymous folles' minted between 970 and 1059 AD, anonymous because they represent a relatively short peri- od when neither the emperor nor his name appears on the coins. This hoard confirms what we have learned from the wells of the adjacent houses to the E, that a major phase of construction and habitation in the area should be dated to the 11th Ct AD. It becomes a question whether the crowded houses, provisions for storage, and the burying of a hoard are all related, and what they 3. Athens agora: coin hoard 2. Roman gemstone: Fortuna may have to tell us about the economic or political situation in Athens at the beginning of the last millennium. In the lower area, section BE, excavations were continued. In the C shop building another pyre was discovered and exca- vated, the seventh from the building thus far, the largest con- centration of these enigmatic deposits known from the Agora. The usual assemblage of wine cup (kantharos), lamps, minia- ture cooking pots (chytras), and small saucers and plates was recovered, 12 pieces in all, dating to the early 3rd Ct BC. Not attested in the literary record, these pyres presumably reflect some nocturnal ritual involving food; as they are generally found only in private houses, commercial buildings, or funerary contexts, such deposits should be regarded as evidence for pri- vate cult. Also uncovered was the upper part of a well (J 2:14-Fig. 4). The unlined shaft, ca 1.05m in diameter, was excavated to a depth of 4m, at which point digging was abandoned until col- lapsing side walls could be shored up. Probes indicate that the well is at least another 2m deep. The shaft of the well was filled with debris and a great deal of fragmentary pottery which seems to date to the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 5th Ct BC. A wide range of bg shapes was recovered: skyphoi, 'Pheidias mugs', salt cel- lars, lekythoi, oinochoai, lamps, lekanides, and one-handlers, as well as amphoras and cooking pots. Only a few examples of figured wares were present, and they do not represent the high point of Greek vasepainting: one bf stemmed cup with a sketchily drawn frieze of standing and seated figures, and three rf lekythoi (Fig. 5, showing: (1) Athena attacking to the right with a spear, (2) a draped woman approaching an altar, and (3) a seated woman looking into a mirror). All this pottery represents a dumped fill, and the peri- od of use was not reached. It remains to be seen, therefore, how this well might relate to the commer- cial building behind which it lies. Burnishing stones found both in the well and in the lowest floors of the building suggest a possible association. Final clearing of Myc tomb K 2:5 was completed (see AR 1998-99, 5), with more scattered bones found on the floor in the N half, and more miniscule beads</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 7 4. Ainens, agora: wenl of the faience necklace recovered from the watersieve. The question of access and a possible dromos at the NW remained unresolved due to the position of the 5th-Ct well. More work was also done in Myc tomb J-K 2:2. Here, in the final moments of the season, five more Myc vases were found, along with sev- eral G pieces (9th Ct BC?) at floor level. At the moment it is not clear whether these later vases represent a deliberate reuse of the grave, or offerings left after an unintentional intrusion, though the latter explanation seems more probable. Well K 1:5, dug in 1997, also dates to the 9th Ct and lies only some 15m to the N, suggesting that the area was probably used for more than just burials in the IA.' 5 . Athens, agora : rf lekythoi 5.

Amalias site Athens city: the Metro. For a helpful plan see ADelt, vol 1 Fig. A (at end of volume). Leoph. Amalias. On the W slope of the low hill of Ag. Athanassios, which was levelled for the construction of the Parliament building at Syntagma square (Fig. 6, one of the most extensive excavation sites in Athens, at 5,500m2), important evidence was unearthed, testifying to the continuous use of the area from the SMyc period to the 19th Ct AD (Othonian period). The evidence for the earliest habitation in the area consists of a SMyc pit grave of the 11th Ct BC. The two topographical fea- tures which determined the use of the area on a more permanent basis were firstly the Eridanos river (over 50m wide, running transversely across the mod. road, and preserving traces of rock-cut circular cuttings on either side, possibly the remains of attempts at erecting a bridge) and secondly the anc. road lead- ing from the Diocharous gate to the Mesogeia area in E Attica. Sections of the so-called 'Pisistratean' aqueduct were also discovered and studied. The first section, of 50m running NW- SE, consisted of cylindrical terracotta pipes, painted with black bands, which had been placed in a deep rock-cut trench. These pipes, wider near the centre and narrower towards the ends, fit- ted into each other, the joints being sealed with lead. They also had cleaning holes, blocked with stones and terracotta lids. Also preserved in the trench were sockets for the insertion of cover slabs, some of which were found in situ. This part of the aque- duct ran diagonally under the anc. road, and it seems that dur- ing the 4th Ct BC, after removal of the pipes, it was being used to channel the rain water into the river bed. The second section, 70m long and with the same orientation, was recorded in the N sector of the excavation, in the square itself. Although it had a similar construction over most of its length, only the rock-cut trench was preserved. During the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC, the area was taken over by bronze-workers, a logical develop- ment given that it lay outside the walls, on a hill, near water sources and in the vicinity of a road for the transportation of raw materials. Seven rock-cut smelting pits were excavated, as well as remains of clay moulds. Within the pits, each of which was used for the production of more than one statue, was found an impressive number of mould fragments, and slag. Parts of 20 rooms around the pits can be safely interpreted as workshop and storage establish- ments. In one of these were discovered carefully- placed slabs of clay, probably the raw material for the making of moulds (Fig. 7). To the S of these establishments, and below the mod. road surfaces, was identified an anc. road, 4.50m wide, running E- W. Parts of the surface of this road were preserved on top of the bedrock and its S retaining wall was substantial, probably for protection from the river. Bronze-working activity ceased at the beginning of the 4th Ct BC, when the pits were filled up. Over the workshop remains, in the N part of the excavation, was erected a peristyle court, remains of the piers of which were recorded on the bedrock, at set intervals. In the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, a new main road towards the Mesogeia area was laid out on the same Ae-·- axis as the old road, and the remains of the Diocharous gate were located at the junction of Odos Voules and Apollonos. The N retaining wall of the new road was strengthened, while the S one was built from scratch, 2.50m S of the earlier one, thus extending the overall width of the road to ca 7m. The</page><page sequence="6">8 DAVID BLACKMAN road was excavated for a length of 35m and a junction was iden- tified at its E end; judging by the 30 preserved surfaces, the road was used continuously until the 2nd Ct AD. Along the N side of the road an extensive cemetery was established, with a total of 192 excavated graves of the usual types (rock-cut, lamax burials, built cist tombs, clay tile-roofed tombs, etc.) including over 30 infant and child burials and three animal burials (two dogs, one horse and dog) one of which was of very careful construction, dating to the 1 st-2nd Cts AD. In the ER period the river was diverted to the S and an extensive stone-built drainage system, excavated for a length of 47m, was constructed within the old river-bed (NE-SW). It had built sides and a tholoid roof, and was filled with pottery, espe- cially lamps, of the late 3rd- early 4th Ct AD. Similar drainage systems have been found elsewhere in Athens (Neos Kosmos, Koukaki, the vicinity of Regilles, Psyre and the Olympieion). After the Herulian invasion (267 AD) the use of the area changed again. The whole area N of the Eridanos river was now occupied by a huge bath complex, built over the cemetery and the anc. road, which had by now gone out of use. Only the S limit of this complex has been discovered: it extended consid- erably to the N, to the E up to the Square of the Unknown Soldier, while to the W it certainly reached Syntagma Square itself, although there the picture is unclear due to later building activities. The bath complex, which covered an area of 8. Leoph. Amalias site: bath complex 5.500m2, was built at the end of the 3rd/start of the 4th Ct AD (core of hypocaust halls and praefurnia). At the end of the 4th Ct AD it was destroyed, possibly as a result of Alaric's invasion (396 AD), and was rebuilt within the 5th Ct AD, when the cis- tern floors were paved with marble slabs. The central core of the complex (Fig. 8), which is now exhibited in the Metro station, included two praefuria, four hypocaust halls (caldaria, tepi- daria) and one paved hall. Around the core were grouped a great number of rooms, used as waiting rooms, dressing rooms, etc., while the water and/or drain pipes were of terracotta. In the same period an aqueduct was built on the S bank of the river, of which seven stone piers and a dense net- work of pipes and wells have been preserved; it probably collected and channelled large quantities of water towards the S, and was possibly related to the works for the diversion of the river. During the 5th-6th Cts AD, over the filled-in river bed, a group of 15 ECh tombs was established, with built sides, tholoid roofs and plastered interiors, con- taining group burials-a common type of tomb in Athens. In the S part of the excavation a section of the Byz town was located (many rooms, 13 storage silos) and the area continued in use during the LByz and Ott periods (large water cisterns, complex water supply system). A section of a long wall, built hap- hazardly with re-used material, might be connected with the fortifications built by Voevoda Hadji Ali Haseki (1778 AD). The history of the use of the area concludes with the discovery of sections of the V:'i" .. . stone-paved Othonian road (Leoph. Amalias).

The earliest phase of occupation in this area is represented by a large trape- zoidal stone building (16.80 x 8.60 x 10.60m), divided into two sections by a transverse wall which was founded on the bedrock. The irregular shape and the open S side of the struc- ture preclude its identification with a specific building, but the pottery suggests that it dates from the LC period. To its N was discovered a rectangular construction (3.72 x 2.70m) at the cen- tre of which a rectangular well was built in the R period. Although there is very little evidence, it is possible that the trapezoidal building was the peribolos of an open-air sanctuary and the rectangular construction a platform or an altar. Buildings with masonry similar to the trapezoidal building have been excavated in the vicinity of the complex with the mosaics, opposite the entrance to the Olympieion, where they were iden- tified as parts of a Hadrianic gymnasium. In the N part of the excavation was a very well preserved bath complex, including two hypocaust halls, two praefumia and nine cisterns. One of the hypocaust halls (tepidarium) was supported on 17 re-used marble funerary columns, while the two praefumia were con- nected to the caldarium by brick-vaulted underground passages; the circulation of hot air was achieved by heating three small cisterns and channelling the heat to the two hypocaust halls. The complex was founded after the Herulian invasion (late 3rd/early 4th Ct AD) and was repaired and extended during the 5th-6th Cts. In the second phase repairs were done and four new cisterns with paved floors were built, one of them subterranean, with a tholoid roof, paved floor, plastered walls and a well for the drawing up of water. On the N wall were preserved traces of carelessly executed paintings with human figures, fish, birds and crosses, possibly evidence of later use as a Ch refuge or place of martyrdom. S of the bath complex, 12m of R road (E-W) was uncovered (width 5.38m) with the remains of four to five surfaces of R-LR date. During the Byz period the area was occupied by large built silos and pithoi: nine pithoi were placed in the floors of the rooms of the bath house, while 29 storage silos were erected in a row. Two LByz kilns represent the last use of the area, before its conversion into the National Gardens during the Othonian period. (ADelt 32-4) The exhibition 'The City beneath the City', of movable finds from the excavations conducted prior to the construction of the Athenian Metro, was inaugurated on February 29, 2000 at the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens (Fig. 10). Prof. N. Stampolidis reports: 'The exhibition will run until December 2001. It was organ- ized by Dr Liana Parlama (Head of the 3rd Ephorate for 10. Exhibition: The City beneath the City Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities) and Prof. Nicholas Stampolidis (Director, Museum of Cycladic Art). The architect Bessie Drougga was in charge of design and lighting. This is a joint venture of the N.P. Goulandris Foundation- Museum of Cycladic Art and the Greek Ministry of Culture, which aims to mark the beginning of the new millennium by presenting to visitors from Greece and abroad a unique exhibi- tion which turns to the past with a view to the future, dealing with excavations undertaken by the Archaeological Service (3rd and 1st Ephorates) over a period of six years on the sites where the Metro stations and ventilation shafts were to be built. The works unearthed remnants of the long history of the city of Athens, revealing a multitude of hitherto unknown topographi- cal details. The exhibition presents this new information, and newly excavated material, following the sequence of the Metro stations, organized according to subject-matter: public and pri- vate life, religion, burial customs. The central theme is topogra- phy, as the excavations reveal for the first time the underground framework of ancient Athens, the city beneath the city, which is simultaneously destroyed by the development under way. The exhibition covers the area where the ancient city lay, in and around the fortification walls, including the cemetery of Kerameikos and the so-called NE cemetery located beneath Syntagma Square. The exhibits outline the entire span of life in Athens from the Myc to the Byz period (17th Ct BC-8th Ct AD) although the main volume of the exhibits belong to the C-HL period. Exhibits: over 500 objects are included, mainly finds from the important cemeteries of anc. Athens where the 3rd Ephorate focused its interest (Kerameikos and E Cemetery) but also from residential areas, public and private buildings, streets and sanc- tuaries. The finds come from the central stations of the Metro network: Acropolis, Syntagma, Akadimia, Evangelismos, Kerameikos, and Agios Ioannis. Six more sites used to con- struct ventilation shafts (where the excavated area was signifi- cantly smaller) added substantial finds. Artefacts made of clay, bronze, marble, glass, ivory, and faience outline the develop- ment of life in Athens from the 17th Ct BC to the 8th Ct AD, from the Myc to the Byz periods, through the G, A, C, HL and R eras. Ancient and moder corers of Athens are on view, where people lived, traded, debated, fought, worshipped, bore their children and buried their dead over the ages. Works of art, statues in marble and bronze, coarse ware, dining sets and sacred vessels are shown alongside entire assemblages, includ- ing the rare tomb of a dog, complete with its glass offerings and dog's collar. History is charted by finds like the large stone slab listing the dead from three of the battles of the Peloponnesian War, mentioned by Thucydides, or the humble offerings from a communal grave in the Kerameikos, presumably related to the horrific plague that struck Athens twice, in 430/29 and 427/6 BC. The trivialities of every-day life are also represented-by lamps, toys, needles or cosmetic spatulas, as well as parts of sewerage pipes from different periods. The exhibits are accom- panied by plans, drawings and charts, illustrating find-spots, other examples and usage in antiquity, so that the artefacts are not exhibited as mere museum pieces but as parts of a wider culture. A detailed, fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhi- bition according to standard Museum practice. The publication The City beneath the City was undertaken by the two Curators of the exhibition, Dr Parlama and Prof. Stampolidis, with entries contributed by the excavators themselves, 32 members of the staff of the 3rd and 1st Ephorates.

Pyxis (Amerikis shaft) 13. Perfume bottles (early Roman grave) 'Early in 1992, when we were still in the planning stage of excavation for the Athens Metropolitan Railway, it was said that the convergence of such a project and the city's antiquities could result either in a catastrophic contest or in a creative alliance. The excavations were a difficult undertaking, and pre- sented an opportunity for the relationship between antiquities and a modem-day project to be tested on a large scale in an urban environment. However, the hard work of the archaeologists, their knowledge and their composure in the face of difficulty, together with the unstinting financing of every required archaeological investigation or task, and faultless technical support, led to a synthesis of opposites. The Ephorates for the Antiquities of Athens and Attiko Metro S.A., together with the contracting company Olympiako Metro, proved that a high qual- I ity of archaeological excavation work can be recon- ciled with the pace demanded by its technical coun- terpart. It proved, too, that scholarly research into life in antiquity can succeed even in the conditions of a con- struction site. Following an initial period of trial explorations, there emerged from the pits dug for the first 20 stations, and the intermediate shafts, a collaboration that rested upon recognition by all parties of both the indispensability of the project and the obligation we all felt towards this city. When the technical design for the Metro was finalized early in the 1990s, it incorporated some suggestions that had been made by archaeological authorities, in particular that digging of any sort should be kept distant from the perimeter of the fortifi- cation walls of ancient Athens, and that the tunnels should be at a depth considerably below archaeological levels. It was clear from the siting of the stations and shafts that archaeological involvement would be inevitable in most instances, and that the 3rd Ephorate of Antiquities of Athens would have to carry out the burdensome archaeological work almost in its entirety, since 17 of the 20 stations and associated shafts lay within its juris- diction and only the outlying Daphne on Line 2 (Sepolia to Daphne) and Katechaki and Ethniki Amyna on Line 3 (Ethniki Amyna to Kerameikos) were in the area of the 2nd Ephorate. For this reason help was sought from the other Athens Ephorates, and the 1st Ephorate of the Acropolis undertook the investigation of the Olympieion station (later renamed the Acropolis station) located on Makryianni municipal land and the adjoining Makryianni and Athanassiou Diakou Streets. There, an extensive and important excavation conducted by the Ephor Petros Kalligas and his colleagues revealed-uniquely among all the Metro excavations continuous occupation from the 3rd millennium BC down to our own day. The 1st Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities undertook the investigation of Monastiraki station, where archaeological work is continuing, because of the unusual difficulties presented by the site, and the Mitropoleos and Agion Asomaton shafts, where it has complet- ed its work. Nonetheless, the obligations placed on the 3rd Ephorate remained heavy, given that, apart from the main sites around the stations and shafts, it had also to contend with a host of preparatory trials and the auxiliary and peripheral trenches dug for pipes and cables being laid by public utilities, as well as the tunnels that were being opened. It was therefore a great achievement on the part of the 3rd Ephorate that, between 1992 and 1997, it managed to release free of any archaeological encumberment the sites for eleven stations and seven shafts, almost all of them the sites of large-scale excavations.

Athena, marble (Syntagma) faultless organization and scholarly direction of this vast under- taking, and the rescue of ancient structures that have either been conserved in situ or removed to other sites. Knowledge acquired from systematic archaeological super- vision of Athens building sites during the previous 35 years was put to use initially in the clearing of stations and shafts likely to contain antiquities. The archaeologists attached to the Ephorate were responsible for work conducted simultaneously at four or five sites in 1993-95 and a group of 22 outstanding young archaeologists worked alongside them, even working night shifts in trenches they were unable to open up in daytime. A total of almost 200 labourers were engaged, most of them at the large Syntagma and Kerameikos stations. The work of the Ephorate conservators, coping with an enormous quantity of material, was (and continues to be) of the greatest importance. The finds testify to the importance of the Metro excavations for the topography both of districts of which we already have con- siderable knowledge, and of others, such as the eastern sector of the ancient city from Syntagma to the Evangelismos Hospital, of which our knowledge was fragmentary. Of particular value was the extensive size of the sites (sta- tions 0.25 to 0.70ha each, and shafts 500-1000m2) which allowed for excavation of large areas of ancient remains, much facilitating our understanding of them. From time to time in the past we had dug limited sites in Syntagma Square, without making much headway in the investigation of topographical problems, whereas now, following excavation of the adjacent avenue for more than 0.70ha, we have a full picture of continu- ous use, borne out by an abundance of data from the 5th Ct BC to our own day. Of particular note are the following: the dis- covery of a stretch of the bed of the Eridanos River, with its drainage conduit, and of the adjacent anc. road to the Mesogeia plain, with cemeteries on each side of it dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD; the unearthing of long sections of the EC Pisistratean aqueduct; extensive networks of conduits, wells and reservoirs of all periods; the remains of workshops (out- standing among them being seven foundry pits of the C era); the LR Balneum erected after the sack of Athens by Herulians in AD 267 and rebuilt in the 5th Ct; the remains of Byz habitations to the S of the river; and last, the reservoirs and conduits con- structed during Ott occupation, Haseke's wall thrown up in 1778, and more recent additions, down to the Othonian stone- paved Amalia Avenue. All these are reference points in the cen- turies-long history of the city. This district, lying to the E of the ancient walls incorporat- ed into the R city when the fortifications were enlarged, is now under study in conjunction with the Herodou Attikou and Zappeion shafts and Evangelismos station. The latter afforded the greatest surprise in these excavations because it was in this area, previously unknown archaeologically, that important information was obtained concerning the thoroughfare leading to the Mesogeia which passes through it (Fig. 15). Two other important digs during the 1990s were the excavations first of the Rigillis Str. building plot, leading to the discovery and iden- tification of the Palaistra of the Gymnasium of the Lyceum and second of the precincts of the Greek Parliament, virtually the continuation of the Amalias Avenue excavation. The area to the S of the acropolis was already fairly well known from numerous excavations of building plots, producing many finds. These testify to its having been inhabited in very early times and used intensively as a burial ground from the LMyc to the end of the G period; also to its inclusion within the city boundaries after the walls were erected, chiefly from the 4th Ct BC onwards, and to its dense population during the R occu- pation and the succeeding ECh era. The successive uses and changes to which it was subjected became clearer after the thor- ough excavation of the Makryianni plot, intended for the Museum of the Acropolis, which revealed impressive remains, particularly from late antiquity and EByz times. Farther S, in the same district but outside the walls, the Petmeza shaft, with 64 graves of various types and burial enclosures, was part of an organized cemetery dating from A to ECh times and it provided us with yet more information about the roadside burial grounds beside the very anc. road to Phaleron which traversed this area. Similarly, the roadside</page><page sequence="10">12 DAVID BLACKMAN concern since the tunnel of Line 3 from Monastiraki could approach it only from below the archaeological site of Kerameikos and at only a shallow depth. The risk to sacred mon- uments--confirmed by trial geophysical tests-persuaded the ~¢!?:lr~i ii~ ',~ :i . . . .. itcivil authorities to take the courageous decision to do away with the station at this point and divert the tunnel away from the site. There is no doubt that the Metro project gave us the oppor- and to obtain important data for scholarly research. It also enabled us to conserve in situ the exceptionally well-preserved section of the Roman Balneum, discovered in the Zappeion shaft at the junction of Amalias and Olgas Avenues (Fig. 17), a site which will also be made accessible to the public. Finally, in a costly undertaking unprecedented in Greek experience, a large section of the Balneum found on Amalias Avenue was removed, including its main rooms, together with important sections of all the other discoveries in this excavation. It will shortly be recon- structed at the University Campus in Zographou, where it will serve as a training site for students of archaeology. Responsibility for decisions concerning the fate of excavat- ed antiquities was a heavy one for us all and was not lessened by our awareness of how important and necessary it was that the great Metro project itself be constructed. In order to vindicate the endeavours we have all made, and in particular to ensure that antiquities are not the victims of progress, the experience gained from the creative conflicts of interest in Athens, and that which continues to be gained from large arterial roadworks being undertaken throughout the country, must lead to the development and embodiment in law of another perception of public works, the archaeological side participating in their plan- ning and the securing of the rights of monuments.' Hadrian's Library. Excavations were conducted to the W and S of the propylon, as well as along the LR fortification walls, into which were incorporated the S wing and the entire peribolos of the monument. A Byz pit grave of a little girl was excavated, against the sub- structure of the first step, on the W side of the propylon, while part of the substructure of the paved R court was revealed to the W of the SW corner of the propylon, extending originally along the whole faqade of the monument, over 14m long. The exposed area of the court, W of the S wing of the facade, is 28m by 1 Om. 15. Evangelismos station site installations and a part of a C cemetery beside anoth- er very anc. road that went to Sunion (following the line of Vouliagmenis Avenue) was found at Agios Ioannis station, also on Line 2, lying in the ancient deme of Alopeke. The E Cemetery, as we call the most dense con- centration of graves stretching from the N side of Syntagma Square to Korai Street between . Panepistimiou and Stadiou Streets, has been investi gated at the Amerikis shaft, where 209 mainly C graves were found, and Akadimia station (now renamed Panepistimio) where there were only 24 (C to LC and R) revealing, if negatively, the northem- most extent of this huge cemetery. Excavation of 0.25ha at Kerameikos station, at the junction of Pireos Street and the Iera Odos, unearthed 1,191 graves of various types dating from " the 7th to the 3rd Ct BC and disclosed invaluable information about the configuration of this district, through which flowed the Eridanos River (Fig. 16).

Zappeion shaft In a test trench through the R fill, where the substructure of the court was not preserved, the NW comer of a room was revealed, probably part of building A, excavated in 1989 and dated to the LHL period (late 2nd/early 1St Ct BC); it was used until the first quarter of the 2nd Ct AD, when it was pulled down to make way for the Library. On the N wall of the room, part of a wall painting was preserved in situ, depicting the lower part of a lamp-holder standing on a red band. During removal of the remains of the Ott oil-press, to the SW of the propylon, a considerable number of architectural members belonging to the R building was discovered. During the excavation along the N face of the LR wall, part of the wall was revealed, 8m long, built with re-used material and obvious- ly trying to imitate the masonry of the library facade. The mate- rial for the orthostats, of grey Hymettus marble, was probably originally taken from R Agora shops, nearby. (ADelt 18-20) Restoration work. Restoration work in the area of Hadrian's Library included the covering of the sub- structure of the court, in front of the S wing of the monument. Various architectural members under- went conservation and the E wall of the N house was restored. In the same area, W of the N house, during the demolition of the mod. interior walls of the MENDE building, was discovered an important part of the N peribolos, known from the drawings of J. Stuart and N. Revett (1764) and preserved to a height of five courses; this was conserved. (ADelt 22-3; Fig. 18) Kerameikos. In the area of the proposed Metro sta- tion the NW part of the anc. cemetery of Kerameikos was exposed (Fig. 19), with a total of 618 graves, many of which dated to the LA-EC period, the majority to the 5th Ct BC, a few to the 4th Ct, and even fewer to the period between the 8th and early .. s 6th Cts BC. Very few graves were preserved from the early 3rd Ct BC. Among the recorded tombs, there were 193 pit graves, 126 pyres, 83 hut-shaped tombs, 54 tile-roofed graves, 15 lamakes, 6 cists, 1 sarcopha- gus, as well as 86 burials in a communal pit. The latter was a circular cutting (diam. 5.30-6m, depth 1.90m) dating from the last third of the 5th Ct BC; the burials in it have been associat- ed with the plague that hit Athens between 430 and 426 BC (Thuc. II 47-54). The recorded funerary offerings were very few, mostly lekythoi in a late bf style, aryballoid lekythoi, skyphoi, jugs, etc., many burials lacking offerings altogether; a great many graves were disturbed by later intrusions due to the lack of burial space, and there has also been extensive looting of the extant burials during mod. times. Within the excavated area was also located a low stone wall, 49m in length, the W boundary of the C cemetery. At a small distance from the peribolos, in the interior of the ceme- tery, was discovered a 4th-Ct BC rock-cut drain (N-SE) running the entire length of the excavation. Outside the cemetery, to the NW of the peribolos, were excavated remains of a pottery workshop (foundations of a kiln, apothetes, etc.) dating from the 5th to the first half of the 4th Ct BC.

Skias embarked on systematic excavation of the remaining foundations of the anc. temple, when he also dis- covered an extensive LR cemetery of the 2nd-3rd Cts AD. At the beginning of the 20th Ct, a large section of the temple area, including the apse of the church, was overbuilt by mod. houses. Finally, in 1965, I. Travlos, after excavating in the area N of the old Odos Ardettou, exposed the retaining wall of the floor of the anc. temple. The present investigations confirmed the position of the anc. temple, and the need to preserve this section of the anc. city for future generations. (ADelt 36-8) Plaka. During rescue excavations on 12 building sites in the area of Plaka, 70 fragments of sculptures and inscriptions were recorded, as well as 70 fragments of architectural members. Two parallel walls 7.20m apart, probably Med, were discovered on Odos Dioskouron, while part of a pithos and a LByz stone wall (E-W) were recorded in the NE sector of the 16th-Ct Ott baths of Abid Efendi, on Odos Kyrrestou, below floor level. A C refuse pit, mostly of the 4th Ct BC, was discovered on Odos Amphiktyonos, on the N slopes of the Pnyx hill, full of pottery sherds. The demolition of a mod. building in Odos Adrianou, in the area between the R Agora and Hadrian's Library, was carried out in order to restore the anc. topography, and to expose not only the buried sections of the two complexes, but also the remains of the anc. road passing between the two. This was 16m in width and at a lower level than the R agora (1-1.50m) which lay ca 6.50-7m higher than the floor of the court in Hadrian's Library. One of the most important projects of this year was the com- pletion of one of the steps for the unification of the archaeolog- ical sites of Hadrian's Library and the R agora. (ADelt 20-2) Theseion. At the junction of Odos Aktaiou and Eptachalkou, in the vicinity of which earlier excavations had already recorded the existence of antiquities (ADelt 1985, 25-7), the remains of a HL pottery workshop were uncovered, including a long wall (NW-SE), and a circular kiln (diam. 2.92m, present height 0.68m). E of the kiln was discovered an irregular rock-cutting, probably used as apothetes. During mod. drainage works in Odos Aktaiou were discov- ered part of a stone wall (NW-SE), in association with a plaster 21. National Museum: Tyrrhenian amphora floor, a stone-built well, the comer of a building extending E, and a G funerary vase with the remains of a child burial. In Odos Dorieon a built construction was excavated, found- ed on the bedrock, with three stone walls, forming two distinct spaces. In the E space a solid layer was identified of blackened charcoal, ashes and bronze slag, up to 0.05m in thickness. Along the narrow N side of the same space, two rock-cut chan- nels at right angles to each other were recorded, leading to a funnel-shaped bothros. To the NE of this structure, an irregular- ly shaped rock-cutting was found, with two steps, a flat floor and vertical sides; after it went out of use it was used as an apo- thetes. Judging by the extant remains, it seems that the area was associated with workshop activities, possibly a bronze-working establishment, of the 4th Ct BC. Further NW, in the direction of Plato's Academy, remains of walls, parts of funerary periboloi, and a fragment of a funerary stele discovered along Odos Krieze, probably belong to the cemetery lying on either side of the anc. road leading from the Eriai Gate to Kolonos. In Odos Kavalas three stone sarcophagoi were excavated, and a single marble funerary stele of the 5th Ct BC. A marble cist grave, in the vicinity of which were found two lekythoi and sherds of the late 5th-early 4th Ct BC, was recorded on Odos Paramythias. In Odos Eukleidou, two stone walls were excavated, forming the comer of a HL building, which was in ER times converted into a pottery workshop, including a circular, pithos-shaped clay structure (diam. 1.15m,</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 15 acquisitions of the museum were the kylix of Douris and the potter Python (Fig. 20), and the Tyrrhenian amphora, recently attributed to the Prometheus painter (570-565 BC), until now in the Hirschmann collection, bought in a Sotheby's auction in Dec. 1993 (Figs. 21-22). (ADelt 1-9) ATTICA Agrileza. One of the main urban centres of the deme of Sounion was apparently located in the area of Agrileza: at the site of Chorafa, E of Mt Michales, remains of a settlement were preserved, built out of white Agrileza marble, as well as remains of a large, probably public, building. In the same area was found the horos inscription of the agora, offered by Leukios to his fellow demesmen (IG II2 1180). (ADelt 67) 22.

In the interior was found a clayey deposit intensely burned, charcoals, burnt river stones and burnt mudbrick; it is possible that the original opening of the kiln was from the SE. Below the HL building was recorded an EC foundation (NE-SW). (ADelt 38-43) National Museum. During the last months of the directorship of O. Alexandre, apart from the routine restoration work and the recording of antiquities in the various departments, a number of scheduled architectural repairs were completed within the building. The collection of R sculpture, the richest of its kind in Greece, was moved to the rooms next to the sculptures of the HL period; 153 representative pieces were selected. Other major innovations included the greatly improved, thematic, re- exhibition of the Myc antiquities in room 4, and the first public exhibition since World War II of the significant Egyptian col- lection of the museum, which covers the entire span of Egyptian civilisation (5000 BC-AD 395). The Myc exhibition has now been arranged thematically (a. finds from Mycenae; b. finds from other Myc centres of the Argolid and the Peloponese; and c. finds from other Myc sites on the mainland, including the islands, in a separate room) with the addition of new visual aids for the better understanding of the archaeological material (a 1:500 model of the acropolis of Mycenae). Among the new Anavyssos-Trypia Koryphe. Information about attempts at illegal excavations resulted in a brief investigation of the cave known as Spelia tou Davele, a cave (depth 8-15m, height 5.50m) within the limits of the anc. deme of Anaphlystos. Across the entrance of the cave was found a solid wall of unworked blocks, in the middle of which there was an opening 1.20m wide. The floor of the cave was covered with a deposit of soft brown earth, and stalagmitic formations were hanging from the roof. By the NE wall, at the back of the cave and close to the floor, rectangular cuttings were recorded; in the same area were two walls, at right angles to each other, built of unworked stones and probably postdating the main period of use of the cave. Over the entire E part of the cave, the disturbed deposit included large quantities of black burnt earth and pottery (bf lekythoi, kylix and krater fragments, parts of terracotta fig- urines and relief plaques). Given that the cult of Pan spread in Attica after the Persian Wars, when many caves were dedicated to him, this particular cave, which was already being used since LG times as a sanctuary of the Nymphs, should be probably identified with the Paneion of Anaphlystos, mentioned by Strabo (IX 398). The bulk of the pottery dates to the first half of the 5th Ct BC. To the E on the same hill was another, larger cave, which was inhabited during the PR period. An anc. road leads to both caves, while another road connected them with inland Laureotike. Along this road, at the site of Kastella, were preserved extensive remains of farms and funerary periboloi. (ADelt 67-8) Brauron. The new investigations in the Brauron area, under the direction of K. Eustratiou, concentrated on the PR acropolis, and involved the location, cleaning, and planning of the old excavations (Ergon 1999, 29-32). The investigations revealed the remains of a MH house with a circular hearth, while the pot- tery from the building suggests contacts with Myc sites of the Peloponnese, and especially with islands of the Saronic gulf, the Cyclades, and the N Aegean. Demoliaki (Krevvatorio). An extensive metalworking com- plex was identified 200m E of the country road from Demoliaki to Synterina, which included a washing area, large cisterns and other facilities, probably related to the mines of the anc. deme of Besa. An isodomic wall was discovered 200m SE of the same country road, enclosing an area 110m by 50m, within which lay smaller structures, two wells and scattered building materials. Near the E side of the peribolos there was the entrance to a mine gallery, with piles of slag, and there were also other mine shafts and galleries in the vicinity.

Eight rescue excavations were reported from the mod. town of Eleusis, including sections of roads, retaining walls, domestic buildings, workshop establishments and cemeteries. (ADelt 43-52, with map = Fig. 23) Two sections of the same anc. road, leading from Eleusis to the N part of the Thriasian plain and Boiotia, were discovered in Odos Kolokotrone (ADelt 1989, 27-31; ADelt 1992, 32-4: AR 1998-99, 13). The anc. road ran N-S in two plots, almost parallel to the mod. road. Its E retaining wall, preserved for 9.10m and 13.50m respectively, had two building phases, the earlier one dating from the C period. The W retaining wall, preserved for a length of 8.30m in the second plot, was probably destroyed by a stream. The road had a width ranging between 4.40-4.70m, and preserved the remains of 4-5 road surfaces. It seems that in its original phase the road was not provided with retaining walls. At the junction of Odos Ero6n Polytechneiou and Nikolaidou, 150m N of the anc. site of Eleusis, the remains were excavated of another anc. road, of the C period, running N-S for a length of 14.50m (Fig. 24). The five consecutive sand and gravel road surfaces investigated dated from the C to the LR periods. The older E retaining wall, post-dating the earlier road surface, was constructed during the HL period and repaired in LR times, while only the foundations were preserved of the W retaining wall. The width of the anc. road was 3.20m. Two wells were contemporary with the earlier road surfaces. In the S and central part of the same plot were located architectural remains of the LPG and G periods: sections of two walls, two cuttings with pottery, large sections of the clay floors of a pri- vate house, three slab-like stone bases of orthostats, and one circular hearth (diam. 0.40m). From the A and C periods, only fragmentary sections of walls are recorded. To the E of the anc. road, four graves (three pits and one tile-roofed grave) dating from the EHL peri- od belong to a cemetery established along the road. During R times the same area, E of the anc. road, was occupied by pottery workshops where the remains of two kilns were found, one of them badly damaged. The best preserved example, almost square in shape (2.60 x 3.20m) had preserved the 4.".... pierced floor of the firing chamber, which stood on a brick pier, coated with successive layers of clay; there were also two openings into the heating cham- ber, which was underground and also square in shape. Finally, part of a LR house with rectangular rooms was built against the E retaining wall, parallel to the anc. road (N-S). The remains of another house of the -.-. same period were discovered in the vicinity, and between the two houses lay a courtyard area, with a stone-paved floor (5 x 3.20m). Both houses date from the 4th Ct AD, although they were still occupied during the 5th Ct (coins). The last use of the area should be placed in the EByz period (pottery, coins, two walls). Excavations exposed sections of two retaining walls erected in connection with flood-prevention works, one on Odos Ero6n Polytechneiou, the other on Odos Iakhou. The first wall, exposed for a length of 13.60m, had a built W face, of irregular trape- zoidal masonry, and was part of an artificial terrace designed to prevent the flooding of Eleusinian Kephissos. The other wall, with a face on the S, was probably built along a stream bed. At the junction of Odos Demetros and Ethnikes Antistaseos was locat- ed the foundation wall of the R aqueduct (NW-SE), also record- ed along Odos Demetros in earlier excavations (e.g. AR 1997- 98, 13; 1998-99, 13). In Odos Papanikolaou, the NW comer of a stone building was excavated, with a destruction layer dating its construction to the 5th Ct and its destruction to the 4th Ct BC. 24. Eleusis, street 1.

S of the aqueduct, at the junction of Odos Demetros and Ethnikes Antistaseos, the corer of a peribolos was discovered, dating from the A period. On Odos Ero6n Polytechneiou, less than 500m from the anc. acropolis, an extensive cemetery was dis- covered, including 56 burials dating from the 2nd Ct BC to the 1St Ct AD (cist graves, tile-roofed or hut-shaped tombs, simple pits, four pot burials). Most of the deceased had a bronze coin in the mouth, while the presence of iron nails suggests that they were buried in wooden coffins. It is worth noting that no lamps were recorded. Finally, N of the retaining wall in Odos Iakhou, 20 burials were recorded, 15 of which were in tile-roofed, hut- shaped tombs, and five were pot burials, dating from the 1St-2nd Cts AD. Elleniko. During three seasons of excavations (1988, 1990, 1994) within the Air Force base at Elleniko, part of a C ceme- tery (5th-4th Ct BC) was discovered, including one cremation burial, four sarcophagi (two unlooted) and four looted cist and pit graves. (ADelt 82-3) Gerakas. Pege. At the junction of Odos Dramas and Ioanninon, in the S half of the plot, a HL farmstead was located: a makeshift triangular area, used for the production of honey (pithoi used as honeycombs). (ADelt 71) Stavros. At the junction of Odos Androutsou and Zalongou, a section of the foundations of a C temple was systematically investigated (prodomos, part of cella, N and E pteron) and iden- tified as the temple of Athena Pallenis, the location of which has been the subject of controversy among experts. The existing remains belong to a large Doric, peripteral, hexastyle temple of the mid-5th Ct, with a two-tiered interior Ionic colonnade. It was a hekatompedon temple (32.25 x 16.32m) with poros founda- tions and a superstructure in marble, only fragments of which are in situ. The architectural remains suggest that it was designed by the 'Theseion architect' also responsible for the Hephaisteion, the Sounion temple, the Ares temple at Acharnae, and the Nemesis temple at Rhamnous. The absence of material from the superstructure suggests that, as with the Ares temple in the Agora of Athens, this was transferred to another location in R times. The temple was probably the centre of a 'koinon', a political/religious federation, as suggested by the extant inscrip- tions referring to the sanctuary of Pallenis (especially one inscription of the mid-4th Ct BC) while fragments of bird-like T-shaped idols of the 8th-7th Ct, in the foundation deposit, sug- gest the existence of an early A cult at the site or in the vicinity. According to Herodotus (1.62.3) it was before the sanctuary of Athena that Peisistratos defeated the Alcmeonids in 541 or 539 BC. (ADelt 71-3) Glyphada. A LC well was located on Odos Aigines, and at the junction of Odos Antheon and Epameinonda was excavated part of a 4th-Ct BC retaining wall for an anc. road (N-S), preserved for a length of 24.60m (1.20-2m wide).

A built LR-EByz tomb was discovered on the country road leading to the Kondita spring, with remains of walls, roof tiles and drain pipes in the vicinity. (ADelt 70-1) Laureotike. At the site of Ag. Georgios Thorikou, the investi- gation was completed of a large building (1.184m2) which, judg- ing by the portable finds and the architecture, probably served as a sanctuary (ADelt 1990, 76-7; AR 1995-96, 6; Fig. 25). Its E wing consisted of a central corridor, which provided access to a number of rooms on either side that were used as bedrooms and dining-rooms, judging by the stone-built benches and the piers serving as the support of a stone slab, as in room A. This wing was attached to the central core of the building, which consist- ed of rooms E and Ea, and of a monumental staircase, excavat- ed in 1990. The entire SW side of the W wing was occupied by hall K (10.50 x 4m) and room N; the floors of both rooms were plastered. Room K was open on the N, towards court Z, from which it was separated by a small balustrade. It also communi- cated with room N, which was provided with a built bench in the SW corer, and a hollow in the floor for drainage purposes. In front of these rooms a rock-cut drain led to the exterior of the building. The rocky floor of the court was uneven, and it is supposed that it was originally covered with wooden planks. The same suggestion has been made for the other four rooms of the main building (H, e, A, M). All the rooms were provided with steps at the doorways leading to the court, while a corridor lined the N and the W sides of the building. The main entrance was probably located at the NW end of the W wing, where some kind of a propylon was recorded. The W part of the building was destroyed by World War II constructions. As regards the deity to which this complex was consecrated, it is known that Demeter was worshipped at Thorikos, in a large 5th-Ct Doric building at the foot of the Velatouri hill, and it is possible that after the abandonment of that building, the wor- ship of Demeter was transferred to this sanctuary, which dates from the late 5th and 4th Cts BC. After extensive investigations, it was finally confirmed that the anc. deme of Amphitrope was located in the area of the</page><page sequence="16">18 DAVID BLACKMAN 26.

Architectural remains of a PR settlement, includ- ing EH and MH pottery and obsidian and flint blades, were investigated on a hill 600m from the coast. At the top of the hill was located a rectangular stone building, with four rooms and traces of white clay floors. Inside the rooms were recorded hol- lows of various sizes, with traces of ashes and remains of seafood. Along the walls, in rooms B and F, small rectangular or semicircular stone constructions were used for the storage of household vessels, while in the SE corer of room F another semicircular construction was probably used as a hearth (remains of ashes, bones, seafood). Inside the building were recorded pottery vessels, including pithoi and pithoid jars (two pots dating from the ECyc I and III periods respectively), stone tools, lead objects and obsidian and flint blades. The settlement, which obviously extended over the entire hill, was occupied continuously from the end of the EH and throughout the MH period, with decisive Cyc influences, while LH occupation has been attested in the surrounding area. (ADelt 69-70) 27. Megara, wall Marathon. Tsepi. A report on the third excavation season at the site of the Cyc cemetery is given by M. Pantelidou in Ergon 1999 (22-8): two tombs were excavated, as was part of a deposit of clay vases. One of the tombs (No. 3) had two periods of con- struction: first it was a small cist-grave, covered with a large slab, while later a side entrance was constructed, for the placing of the corpse. The second tomb (No. 33) with a stone trape- zoidal construction over it, had been partly revealed by S. Marinatos (Fig. 26, from the N); the upper part of the tomb was on the same level as the anc. floor surface. In front of the entrance, which was not blocked, was found a secondary burial. Abandonment of the tomb, despite the fact that it had been pre- pared for a new burial, was probably connected with a broken lintel block. The deposit, the upper layer of which had been removed in 1970, was bisected and excavated down to the bedrock. It contained numerous pottery sherds (EH and ECyc I), a few stones and very little earth, but no bones, which sug- gests that it was probably connected with some kind of ritual and not with tomb clearing. Megara. Of the 14 rescue excavations reported from the mod. town of Megara, the vast majority involved funerary remains, as well as subterranean buildings and a section of the C fortifi- cation wall (ADelt 52-63, with map 53, fig. 11). The latter, exca- vated in Odos D. Bei, was ca 3.60m thick and built of rectan- gular poros blocks (Fig. 27) and behind it was discovered a small part of a square tower, 6.80m wide. Investigations revealed the existence of three subterranean buildings on Odos Soteros, Evrou and Dogane, dated to the 2nd Ct BC, the MHL and the EHL periods respectively. These had stone walls, all preserved to over 1m in height, earth or stone- paved floors, and central square piers supporting the roofs; the third example had been converted into a cistern in a later phase. Also discovered in the same plot on Odos Dogane was the NE comer of a 3rd-2nd Ct BC building, cylindrical terracotta water pipes, and two A sarcophagos child burials. Part of another building with rectangular rooms, of the 3rd-2nd Ct BC, was excavated on Odos Moraite; near the NE comer of its W room was found a circular cistern. Parts of a number of anc. cemeteries were excavated at six different plots. Two sections of the same cemetery were inves- tigated in the Armakades area, to the NW of the mod. town, where a total of 57 burials and parts of three funerary periboloi were excavated, dating from the 7th Ct BC to the MHL period. The vast majority were cist graves or stone sarcophagi (four pithos burials and one cremation). At the junction of Odos Chaniou and Aigeirouson, part of the known cemetery of the area was investigated, extending along the right side of Odos Chaniou: 48 tombs and three funerary periboloi were excavat- ed, dating from the end of the 6th Ct to the 1 st Ct BC; the major- ity belong to the 4th Ct and the HL period. Most of the graves were stone sarcophagi; six of the 12 extant cist tombs were enclosed within a funerary peribolos, open only on the N nar- row side (6.6 x 2.25m), the earliest grave dating from the sec- ond half of the 4th Ct; one of the cists preserved red paint on the walls. During work for the extension of the mod. cemetery, 22 graves were discovered, dating from the 4th to the 2nd Cts BC. With the exception of one tile-roofed grave, all the rest were stone sarcophagi. S of the town, 500m outside the walls, four graves (three sarcophagi, one cist grave) and one funerary peri- bolos were investigated. The latter, which opened to the E, was n-shaped (3.58 x 3.15m) and was built of poros blocks pre- served to the height of three courses (1.20m). It contained no actual graves, only the space for two sarcophagi. Finally, on a</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 19 plot on Odos Chaniou, to the NW of the mod. town, next to another plot with 17 graves (ADelt 1988, 61), 25 more tombs were investigated, ranging in date from the 5th to the 3rd Cts BC; they were all stone sarcophagi. At the NW corer of the plot part of a funerary peribolos was recorded. Megarida. At the Kontita site, 2.5 km NW of the village of Oinoe, are remains of a rectangular Frankish tower (8.5 x 7m) rising to a height of some 5m and entered by a ladder. The struc- ture had at least two phases, the first in the 13th Ct and the later in the post-Byz period, and the monument reflects occupation of the site throughout the LMed and Ott periods; plans have been made to investigate the entire site. (ADelt 95-6) Oropos (Nea Palatia). Excavations on Odos Korytsas revealed part of the known E cemetery of the anc. town, including a sec- tion of a funerary road (E-W), along the S side of which was discovered a HL funeral peribolos and 19 graves of HL and R date, the majority (11) of which were cist tombs; the rest includ- ed four hut-shaped, three tile-roofed graves and one pyre. (ADelt 75-80 &amp; pls 30-35) Nineteen funerary inscriptions from this excavation have since been published by B. Petrakos, Oi ErrTypacqpe Tou (Wpcorrou (Athens 1997). Paiania. Excavations around the postByz church of Agios Athanasios, built on the remains of an EByz basilica, revealed walls possibly belonging to a chamber and side chapel SE of the basilica sanctuary. Moveable finds included EByz coarse pot- tery and two finds dating to the 3rd Ct BC, including the torso of a small female figurine. (ADelt 106) Phyle (Kalisteri). Investigations at the site of Spelies con- firmed the location of substantial architectural remains belong- ing to the anc. deme of Oe/Oie, an apparently extensive rural community, located in the area to the SW of Kalisteri, near the stream of Maure Ora and dating from the HL to the LR period. The two-room rock-cut building, originally excavated by Skias (AE 1919, 36) with a rock-cut cylindrical altar in the W room, was probably a small sanctuary, the centre of the anc. deme. To the S of this sanctuary, part of an ER stone-built installation was excavated, designed for the production of honey, with a circular room enclosed by a rectangle. Finally, 11 walls (E-W) built within the stream bed and forming four lT-shaped structures, were interpreted as communal works, designed to check the flow of the water towards a small contemporary bridge nearby. (ADelt 73-5, figs 4-6 &amp; pl. 29) Porto Rafti. Excavations were undertaken at the ruined church of Agios Elios (actually Agia Kyriake) at the Monastiri site near Drivlia. Previously thought to be Ott in date, excavations show this to be a 12th-13th Ct structure, of the two-column, domed inscribed-cross variety (9.70 x 6.50m with narthex). The exteri- or shape of the main church is almost square, with the sanctu- ary apses inscribed within the thickness of the E wall. This lat- ter detail appears to reflect a type common in Syrian and Armenian churches, and encountered in a few Greek monu- ments. Large orthostats-probably spolia-divide crude cloi- sonn6 masonry and traces of recessed-brick masonry. A small number of burials (two cist graves and later child burials) with- out grave goods were encountered along the exterior face of the S wall. Moveable finds in the fill of the ruined structure includ- ed 4th-5th Ct AD coins and pottery, comparable with the finds from the EByz settlement remains at Drivlia. Little glazed or painted ware from later Byz phases was discovered. The exis- tence of a monastery on the site is difficult to prove because of moder building activity which has already surrounded the structure on three sides. (ADelt 104-6) Pountazeza. The remains of a farm were identified on the hills of Pountazeza, and also a wall/field border and remains of an apsidal building, probably EH in date. At the top of the hill a farm was preserved, with a circular tower (diam. 7m) while on the hills to the W were recorded blades and flakes of obsidian, as well as EH sherds. (ADelt 67) Rhamnous. B. Petrakos reports on the 1999 season in Ergon 1999 (13-21): 'Just inside the E gate of the fort was excavated a rectangular stone building of the 2nd Ct AD: a dining room, with four stone- built couches against the interior walls; the couch at the NW corer was L-shaped. Judging by the absence of building mate- rials such as roof-tiles, doors, etc., among the remaining debris, it seems that the building was abandoned peacefully. On the N side were found two built bases, in front of which were lying two statues: one was the upper part of a statue of Pan (2nd Ct AD), the lower part of which had been discovered in 1998; the other was an almost intact statue of Artemis, holding a torch in her right hand and a phiale in her left (4th Ct BC). Two lamps, associated with the statue bases and dated to the mid- 3rd/early 4th Ct AD, provide the terminus post quem for the continued use of the building. Inside the building, a large part of an inscribed stele, which was incorporated within the NE couch, bore a honorific decree proposed by a citizen of Rhamnous (Aphthonetos), a represen- tative of the worshippers of Serapis, in honour of a general of the coast (Apollodoros) for his donation of a plot of land; this is the first evidence for Serapiasts at Rhamnous. The decree, frag- ments of which were discovered in previous years (PAE 1990, 31-2 no. 15), is dated to the years after 216/5 BC (see now 'O i0tpo5 TOU PapvouvTo5, II 59). Also inside the building was discovered an inscribed base from a dedication of torches, in memory of a victory in the torch race (Xaalnra8rlpopiia) at the Diogeneia and the Ptolemaia of Athens; the dedicant was Xanthippos, general of the coast for the second time. To the W of the theatre was investigated a building, proba- bly a telesterion, the N and E walls of which had been uncov- ered by V. Staes (Fig. 28). The excavation revealed a rectangu- lar hall, the four sides of which were lined with rows of built benches, coated with white plaster. In the centre of the room was found a drum from an oil-press, used as a table, while in the middle of the benches of the E side, was placed a large stone mortar. To the W of this hall lay a small room, entered through a narrow door. The whole complex, used until the beginning of the 4th Ct AD, was approached from the E side, in front of which lay a sloping stone-paved road which separated this building from the one to the E. Inside the building were discov- ered a dedicatory inscription to Kybele, mother of the Gods, worshipped at Rhamnous with her Asia Minor name, Agdistis; part of a stele containing the end of a list of female names, both Athenian and foreign (possibly worshippers); and a small dedi- catory inscription to Isis, something which might suggest that by the end of the 3rd Ct BC the Egyptian gods were housed in the same building. Here were also found two reliefs, similar to two others known from Attica and dedicated to the two Eleusinian goddesses, Demeter and Kore, and many other inscriptions and sculptures of earlier date.'</page><page sequence="18">20 DAVID BLACKMAN 28. Rhamnous Rizoupolis cave. (Perissos). This cave (2500m2) has long been known, having been used as a hiding place by the brigand chief Davelis in the 19th Ct-there were various attempts at tourist development before and after World War II. The cave is referred to in specialist literature following scientific research in the 1960s. Test excavation by the Ephorate of Spelaeology started in 1994, in the face of the threat of damage from drainage systems of overlying houses. The inner cave, approached by a long (50m) rising corridor and narrow entrance, has no sign of human occu- pation later than the early EBA, whereas the outer cave has pro- duced sherds of MH, LR, Byz and recent periods. Gridded surface survey in the outer cave pro- r" duced much pottery (domestic and cult) of the end of the N and start of the EBA, also stone and bone tools and clay weaving implements; a small jug goes back to LNI. Excavation in depth has started, and should add much to our knowledge of the N/EBA transition in Attica, the N phases represented at Rizoupolis, and the relationship with other cave sites in Attica and beyond. Finds so far indicate clearly settled habita- tion in the cave. (ADelt 843-4) At the S end of the central sector were located two pits, prob- ably originally child burials, with a small pile of stones over them. Inside were found broken G pots, including an intact cooking pot, idols, animal bones and seafood. To the S of the central sector, and approximately im higher, a road of the A period was discovered, 3m wide and bordered by retaining walls. To the S of the road lay small buildings, probably shops, which contained bf pottery and lamps. Despite the floods at the end of the 7th Ct BC, which caused the burial of the central sector under layers of mud, it seems that in the next century, and until the beginning of the 5th Ct BC, activities were relocated a small distance to the S. A new flood, which buried the road at this date, caused the abandonment of the area and the relocation of the town, which was then named Oropos, to the area to the E. Investigations to the W of the central sector, in an area where buildings of the A period were found in 1985, revealed the rem- nants of more buildings, which suggests that this was an exten- sively built-up site. The W part of the W sector was occupied by a rectangular monumental building (18 x 60m) due to be exca- vated in the near future. (Ergon 1999, 32-9) Sounion-Ormos Asemake. At the NE edge of the bay were investigated the remains of a metallurgical kiln, part of extensive anc. installations. In the workshop area was discovered part of a litharge (vitrified lead) smelting kiln, a F-shaped construction with substantial stone walls, ca 10m from the coast. The interiors of the walls preserved traces of slag, including bronze and other metals, as well as traces of burning. At the corer of two of the walls was found a rectangular stone-built construction, probably the base of the well-like section of the kiln. At the bottom of this construction, on both sides (S and E), cuttings in the bedrock, of various shapes and sizes, contained remains of lead, slag, and black, dark red and greenish-coloured earth. The deposit covering the smelting area, ca 2m thick, consist- ed of black earth, vitrified stones, remains of slag, rust, and frag- ments of burnt roof tiles and clay utensils. Remains of the smelt- ing process were also identified in the S section of the kiln, where a long, ellipsoidal construction was discovered, open at one end. At the bottom of this construction, on the bedrock, were found Skala Oropou. Investigations in the area of G and A Oropos, under the direction of A. Mazarakes-Ainian, were continued in the central sector (Fig. 29). W of the peribolos was discovered part of another, of ear- lier date, which, in contrast to the later rectangular one which encloses the most important buildings of the central sector, had an irregular shape. The ellip- soidal building BF, constructed during the second half of the 8th Ct BC, had apparently undergone modifications once in the same period, and once at the beginning of the 7th Ct BC. The well to its S was apparently abandoned by the EA period. I n 1 1 .1 \ ii I 4 I·: : - w w \ l~~~~- I;-71l _ _ s~~~~~~ _ '-. 1 i~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~"\ 29.

In the interior, black burnt earth, charcoal and pieces of lead were recorded. To the W of the smelt- ing area was located the level for the bellows. Another stone con- struction of semi-circular shape was discovered against wall 1 of the kiln, and was probably also used for smelting, at a later stage. The pottery associated with the workshop ranges from the late 4th to the 3rd Ct BC. The workshop was contemporary with the neighbouring market for lead objects at Limani Pasa. Metal sam- ples analysed by Prof. G. Papademetriou (Athens Polytechnic) suggest that the workshop processed litharge for the production of lead, a procedure requiring the use of sand; hence its location on the coast. (ADelt 68-9) Spetses. The structural remains at the Zogerias site (identified as a possible basilica in ADelt 42, 112-14) were further investi- gated, with little evidence for the site being ecclesiastical. Instead, the pottery and scanty small finds (including a funerary plaque with supplication for a certain Theodoulos) provide evi- dence for a poor EByz settlement with an (undated) destruction layer caused by fire. (ADelt 107-9) Stefani Thorikou. On the NE slope of Fougaro hill, a circular funerary peribolos (diam. 4.2m) was investigated, enclosing a rock-cut cist grave (robbed). The peribolos was built of curving marble blocks, the shape and size of which suggest that they con- verged at the top, where they supported a massive conical block of marble, part of which was found nearby. One of the curving blocks was inscribed EPMAIO. (ADelt 66-7) ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF Aigina In Leoph. Kapodistriou, mod. road works revealed the chamber of a HL-R subterranean rock-cut tomb (N-S) provided with white plastered walls and including a cist grave along the E wall. At the site of Omorphe Ekklesia were located five tombs, including two pit graves and three subterranean rock-cut tombs, dating from the early 7th to the early 3rd Ct BC. Rescue exca- vations at the site of Phaneromene located eight double-cham- ber tombs, one single-chamber tomb and one subterranean tomb, as well as three subterranean rock-cut graves, all dating from the early 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 83-4) In 1994 research was carried out by the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (M. Mela) in the anc. har- - bour, W of the temple of Apollo, planning structures visible along the shore below and above the surface. (ADelt 854) Kolonna. F. Felten and St. Hiller report on the Austrian Institute excavations in 1999: 'Excavations in 1999 had two aims: to continue supplementary investigations in the areas excavated by G. Welter in the PR inner city, W of the temple of Apollo; and to remove recent dumps in the NE area of Kolonna Hill. Investigation of architectural units ('houses') 16, 18, 19 was therefore continued: work on unit 16 was completed, revealing undisturbed EH and FN strata and pottery. In unit 18 Welter had exca- vated to bedrock, so it was only possible to observe sequences of levels from EH III to FN in narrow peripheral areas; noteworthy is a lime mortar floor seen in profile, which belonged to a clearly extensive EH II house. In unit 19 was found a series of MB lev- els and building remains. Reinvestigation of the 1 Kl 30. Welter excavations should be concluded in 2000 with the study of the deeper levels. Removal of the dump, and related cleaning operations, pro- duced in the N and NE areas a number of important observa- tions which fill out the topography of the early sanctuary. It was possible to follow a fairly long stretch of the A temenos wall on the N side, and its NE comer was cleared, along with later repairs and additions, notably a monumental stairway (Fig. 30). This is the first time that it has been possible to identify an ancient approach to the Acropolis.' Kalaureia Berit Wells (Swedish Institute) reports on the 1999 excavations in the Poseidon Sanctuary: 'In May 1999 investigations were carried out in building D (Fig. 31: balloon photograph by Kostas Xenikakis). Most of our time was devoted to extensive cleaning of the area both of the post-1894 fill (a massive undertaking) and of trees and bushes. As already noted by Wide and Kjellberg (excavation report in Ath.Mitt. 20, 1895) at least two major building phases can be dis- tinguished: the first one is represented by the terrace or temenos wall, built of brown limestone schist, which forms the back wall of the so-called stoa of building D and which continues towards the E into building C (also identified by the early excavators in building F). Pottery could date this phase as early as LG. During the second building phase, distinguishable from the earlier one through its grey, hard limestone, the area of the sanc- tuary was extended towards the S. The old terrace or temenos ureia J 1. lxalau</page><page sequence="20">22 DAVID BLACKMAN wall was incorporated into building D, which housed a cult to an unknown deity (finds of miniature vessels and drinking ves- sels). The sloping ground needed terracing to raise it to the level of the old temenos, which accounts for the massive S support- ing walls of building D. This second phase can be tentatively dated to the latter half of the 4th Ct BC, but in order to secure this or any dating, and in order to define its function, further excavation into the deeper layers of building D is necessary. The post-I894 fill in building D contains restratified archae- ological material and thus probably comes from the area of the sanctuary. The material has not been studied in detail but seems to be mainly HL and R in date. In the eastern part of D, layers were uncovered which pro- duced A and LG material. This material gives a date post quem for the building of the earliest part of D, the so-called stoa. The dearth of Med and mod. material is worth noting. Some fragments of LByz sgrafitto ware have been picked up previ- ously, however. The bronze 10-lepta coin of 1882, found in D, can undoubtedly be associated with the Wide/Kjellberg excava- tions. Apart from these finds only some rusty nails and pieces of modem glass were found. This seems to indicate that after late antiquity the area of the sanctuary was not frequented to any notable degree. The Hydraioi who plundered the sanctuary of much of its building material (reported by Richard Chandler in his Travels in Greece, Dublin 1776) have left no visible trace in the archaeological record and the 20th-Ct farming activities are mostly noticeable today in the building rubble at the site and the ruined structure standing on the westernmost wall of building D.' Kythera The church of Agios Georgios at Palaiopolis yielded an inscrip- tion, of uncertain date, associating the site with a holy well. The E wall of the church is built over the well-known mosaic floor at the site, and finds indicate long religious interest there, from PR times to the present-these include a lead seal with a cruci- form monogram from after the mid-7th Ct AD. (ADelt 94-5) The Kythera Island Project (KIP) undertook its second field season in the summer of 1999, directed by Cyprian Broodbank of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. He writes: 'The KIP is an inter-disciplinary project, centred on inten- sive field survey, whose aim is to explore the insular dynamics of Kythera's cultural and natural history from earliest times until the present. A preliminary report on the first (1998) field season is now published in BSA 94: 191-214. Regional field survey: within the overall survey boundaries determined in 1998, the general strategy continues to focus on the fieldwalking of a series of kilometre-wide N-S transects, spaced a kilometre apart, supplemented with judgement-orient- ed coverage of areas deemed of special interest (Fig. 32). In 1999, three teams walked some 17km2 in ca 2100 tracts (the vast majority of which were located within the transects) sam- pling a sequence of inland to coastal landscapes as well as diverse land forms and geologies. During the first two weeks, work concentrated on a new far western transect (transect 1) which runs along high limestone ridges and plateau land, a geology and topography not sampled in 1998. In the second two weeks, the teams extended the 1998 transects 2 and 3 to the S, in transect 3 covering territory in the vicinity of the ancient polis of Kythera. In addition, transect 3 was widened to its full width of 1 km. In the fifth week, the teams moved E to under- take transect 5, which runs from the high plateau down across the coastal land of Palaiopolis to the site of Kastri. At the S end of this transect, coverage began to expand into the coastal area 32. Kythera Island Project to E and W in the sixth week, initiating a wider coverage of the Palaiopolis catchment. Including fieldwork in 1998, KIP has so far walked ca 3200 tracts over approximately 10% of Kythera. Fieldwalking in 1999 located 53 further sites, making a total of 86 sites detected within the survey area to date, including those found last year and a small number of further designations within the 1998 area; ca 90% of these were hitherto unrecord- ed. Sites were mainly investigated by a specialized team, who succeeded in covering all the 1998 sites and many of those found in 1999. Over 40 sites have been collected, the great majority by gridding on 5 x 5m, 10 x 10m or 20 x 20m squares and sampling the material within these. On less tightly defined or very poorly-preserved sites, a variety of other methods were explored. Gridding proved invaluable not only for ensuring good spatial resolution, but also for detection of previously unrecognized minor components at several sites, examples being the identification of minor Neopalatial components at 1998 sites 3 (mainly EBA) and 25 (mainly C) in both cases thereby modifying the chronological profile presented in our report in ABSA on the 1998 season. The vast majority of all sites continue to be small, and are generally well under lha in size. The 1999 results largely confirm the same period 'spikes' that were detected in 1998, notably a fair spread of EBA settle- ments of hamlet size, very large numbers of Neopalatial farm- steads (ca 30 to date) and dense C occupation (broadly con- strued until full study of the material is completed) from farm- stead- through to village-scale in what must have been the hin- terland of the island's polis, followed by relatively little activi- ty until the last two centuries before the present. One Myc site (site 32) fills a gap in the 1998 data, but its very identification confirms the real rarity of sites of this date on Kythera, all of which (save for Kastri itself) are located well inland. Another gap is partly filled by the discovery of site 60, an artefact-rich</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 23 site on the ridge inland from Kastri, with much diag- nostic fine ware on the surface due to recent plough- ing and bulldozing of terraces. For in addition to abundant Neopalatial and C material, site 60 also has material of the Protopalatial period, which has otherwise been detected nowhere on the island beyond Kastri and the Agios Georgios peak sanctu- ary. Traces of N occupation in the survey area remain very slight, and there is only a modest amount of R and Byz material-although it should be noted that the ancient polls and Kythera's Byz and Venetian centres all lie outside the survey's bor- ders. This picture of dramatic change in settlement landscapes on Kythera must in part reflect fluctua- tions between dispersed and nucleated patterns of settlement, but is also likely to provide information ,. : .: B g ..

The 1999 season culminated in the inves- : tigation of Kastri and its immediate environs. The site was first tract-walked as part of transect 5, 33. Kastri revealing a substantially larger site than has hitherto been realized, with several satellite communities including the above-mentioned site 60 (Fig. 33 shows weighted pottery densities for tracts over Kastri and its hinterland). The total area of Kastri is ca 9-1 Oha, of which a minimum of some 6-7ha con- tain predominantly M material, making the BA site substantial- ly larger than Agia Irini on Kea, or Phylakopi on Melos. Some 520 10 x 1Om squares placed over Kastri were sampled, cover- ing the entire seaward part of the site and moving back up the ridge over Kastraki, but it was not possible in the time available to set out and sample squares across the inland extension of the site newly revealed by the tract-walking. The amount of diag- nostic pottery on the surface is impressive, with notably more fine-wares of both BA and C date than encountered elsewhere, as well as fragments of a clay lamax near to one of the tombs destroyed in the 1960s. Also noted were several large marble elements from the C-to-R harbour settlement built into field- walls, and the presence of exotic rocks, probably introduced as ballast. A recent scar from bulldozing on the Kastraki knoll (near the location of deposit a from the 1963-5 excavations) revealed fresh material, including fragments of an obsidian core and sherds of probable N, and certain EH and EMIII (dot barbotine style) date, as well as much later pieces (Fig. 34). This associa- tion of EH and EM material at Kastraki (albeit in a disturbed con- text) seems to open up the possibility of an overlap in space or time between these two traditions (see further evidence below from the Kastraki pit sections and note that the 1998 season iden- tified small quantities of early Minoanising material, at least some of MMIA date, at several sites with a strongly EH overall signature). A variety of other recording and documentation at Kastri and in its vicinity was undertaken. Laura Preston (UCL) made good progress on an inventory and typology of the numerous tombs of M, C and HL/R date at Kastri (as well as elsewhere in the survey area). Detailed sections have been drawn of a series of large pits exposed in the Kastraki knoll by a road-cutting. The fill of one such pit constituted the 1963-5 excavations' deposit a, of EH date, albeit with probable later N material too. Interestingly, however, the four pit sections whose sherds were recorded in 1999 contain EMIII-MMIA material (and a possible EMII bowl rim) as well as more abundant EH sherds. The lack of stratigraphy in the pits, and the mixture of material, suggest that these pits were closed some time early in the Protopalatial; Neopalatial sherds in some instances overlie them above the level of the fill. As with the bulldozed area of Kastraki described above, these observations may suggest a more com- plex scenario for the relations between the users of EH and EM material at this site than has been apparent to date. Further up the ridge behind Kastri, in the area known as Tholos, substan- tial numbers of Protopalatial vessels, apparently in situ on a floor, were found exposed on the surface of a dirt track. Other work at Kastri included preparations for a new plan of the site and its environs, and kite photography. Other research (study season, ceramic and metallurgical analysis, geoarchaeology, GIS) A start was made by Cyprian Broodbank, Alan Johnston (UCL) and Vangelio Kiriatzi (Fitch Laboratory) on the 1998 pottery, developing and test-running the KIP recording system and applying it to most of the pottery from site 1, the largest site collected in 1998. During the study season, Kiriatzi also sampled a large number of clay sources on the island, and further studied the 1963-5 excavation material from Kastri. Sven van Lokeren (Fitch Laboratory) likewise studied metallurgical slag from the 1998 tracts and pick-ups, and explored hematite sources in the N of the island. A pilot geoarchaeological season was conducted by Charles Frederick and Nancy Krahtopoulou (Sheffield) involving overall recon- naissance to find promising areas for detailed research, and ::. ::.. :: : U 4 0 _ ,,,[ 34.

This may place the origins of cross-channel terracing for water and soil retention on Kythera as early as the 2nd millennium BC. Frederick and Krahtopoulou also visited a large number of the 1998 sites with a view to familiarising themselves with site formation processes on the island and initiating the mapping of site environs from a geoarchaeological perspective that emphasizes contextual integrity. Work continues on the KIP GIS. In the field GIS oper- ated in close conjunction with the database and remains invalu- able for the storage and rapid analysis of incoming data.' The Hellenic Institute of Maritime Archaeology continued underwater investigation in 1994 on the E coast, where seven large pyramidal stone anchors, about 250kg in weight, had been located. Two more (0.80 x 0.60 x 0.40m) were found at depths of 9-19m. (ADelt 856) Methana. Remains of submerged R buildings were found at Megalokhori. (ADelt 853) KORINTHIA Corinth. The report on the ASCS excavations in 1994 (ADelt 168-70) was given in AR 1994-95, 10-11. The excavation of the Loutra site, which had begun in 1991, was completed in 1994. The first phase of occupation, dating from the ER period, was represented by two walls forming a comer, a marble threshold, and remains of a monochrome mosaic. To the second phase belong a substantial wall, two poros piers, supporting a clay tile floor, as well as remains of a polychrome mosaic, a complex probably associated with the neighbouring R bath-house, by the Lechaion road. The last phase belongs to the EByz period (complex of walls, tomb, cir- cular construction). To the S of the archaeological site, at Hatzemoustapha, were revealed fragmentary building remains (walls, floors, drains) of at least two architectural phases, and part of a stone- paved road, running N-S, on the same line as the anc. Lechaion road (1. 7.50m, w. 2.40m). At Kokkinovryse was excavated a rectangular rock-cut HL grave, enclosed within an L-shaped structure, coated with waterproof plaster. The remains of a roughly built R building were recorded at the Sabchaze plot, including part of a floor coated with waterproof plaster, a built drain across the floor, and a clay circular structure, 0.78m in diameter. At Agia Paraskeve were excavated fragmentary building remains of domestic nature, belonging to two phases. The earli- er phase included parts of walls, a section of floor and drains, belonging to a LC building, which was also associated with a rock-cut subterranean irregular space, approached by six steps. After the destruction of the building, the area was reoccupied in Byz times (walls, drains). At the same site were unearthed the remains of two R walls, forming a comer, while next to one of the walls lay a rock-cut grave. At Diavatiki, S of the anc. harbour of Lechaion, investigations revealed a large space defined by three walls, enclosing a floor of marble slabs, laid on trodden earth, was preserved in two comers. The base of the walls was also lined with marble, the rest of the wall surface being coated with waterproof plaster. (ADelt 161-3) Guy Sanders reports on the ASCS excavations at anc. Corinth in 1999: 'Excavations since 1995 in the Panayia Field, SE of the Forum at Corinth, have revealed the remains of a R town house with mosaic and marble floors, a 6th-Ct bath, a long 6th-Ct building, scattered fragments of Byz occupation and the remains of 19th-Ct buildings. In 1999 work continued on all these features except the bath. It is now clear that the R town house covered a considerable area. To date we have uncovered several earthen floors, and pavements covered with the debris of a bumt destruction. The walls, however, were robbed out in the LR and Med periods, while the floors have yielded virtually no material culture by which to date the building. Expansion of the excavated area revealed the full extent (8.8 x 5.6m) of a room with a marble pavement and centrally placed polychrome marble fountain, found and partially uncovered in 1997. In the burnt destruction over the floor were found two mid-4th-Ct coins (both of Constantius II, the later dated 355-61). One wall is partially pre- served and consists of a low poros foundation for a mud-brick superstructure. More of a channel paved with diamond-shaped bricks and sealed with hydraulic cement was cleared, to its full E-W extent of 8m and to a depth of 0.55m. The drain abuts a poros block wall with cement mortar, 0.65m wide. It too had debris from the building's destruction, including substantial fragments of highly decorated Ionic capitals and more fragments of Niederbieber 77 amphoras. One interpretation is that this drain is the remains of a latrine, but unless the identification of the building as an urban villa is incorrect, this does not seem plau- sible. The wall against which the drain abuts may well have been the stylobate which supported a peristyle of Ionic columns. A study of the fresco recovered to date suggests two phases of wall decoration. A Maenad probably belongs to a 2nd-Ct phase while two half-life-sized Nikes probably belong to a 4th- Ct phase. A narrow space surrounded on two sides by robbed- out walls, and on the other two by Med disturbances, appears to be the end of an interior corridor. Here wall painting and burnt debris covered a cache of small-scale sculptures, including a Herakles Farnese, a seated Roma, a seated Asklepios, a stand- ing Asklepios, an Aspasia/Aphrodite, the heads of Artemis and a Satyr and fragments of two as yet unidentified figures. To the N of the drain the use horizons of a well produced quantities of Niederbieber 77 amphoras, round-mouthed pitchers, and table wares dating to the 2nd through mid 4th Cts. Although the extent of the building and the function of the rooms remain unknown, the villa was built in the 2nd Ct, refur- bished in the 4th Ct and was probably destroyed not long after 355/61. The long building: the area to the E of the 6th-Ct structure dug in 1998 was excavated to find its end wall. Part of a N-S street was uncovered, of which only the 1St- and 2nd-Ct phases were preserved (the later phases having been ploughed away in the Med and post-Med period). Six phases of water pipeline were found running alongside the exterior of an ER wall reused as the E wall of the long building. The road surface in the 6th Ct was at least 2m above the building's floor level, confirming that the remains represent a basement level. A room 4.5 x 4m, and part of a second, were excavated; they open onto a broad N-S space. A drain runs from the latter area under the walls of one room into the street. In order to connect the drain to the main drains in the street a deep pit (max. diam. 1.7m) was dug through the ER levels, and a tunnel excavated as far as the water</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 25 mains. It is now clear that the street was graded at a height much greater than the contemporary ER and LR buildings and that for some 400 years the area between the bath and the long building was an open depression. This was infilled only with the demo- lition of the 6th-Ct structures ca 800. In the open area two more LR graves were found. These were burials of a neonate and an infant within Gaza amphoras. To insert the deceased, the mouth of the amphora was broken away and replaced afterwards. Both date to the late 6th or early 7th Ct. l9th-Ct buildings: the coins from a pit excavated in 1998 have been cleaned and read. The latest of these is a para with a date corresponding to the Christian year 1821/22. The pit con- tained imported wine bottles and northern European and Italian ceramics. One of the two military buttons with English identifi- cation marks also has the figure of an American (?) eagle and there is metal brocade from a military uniform. We know that President Mavrocordatos mustered the Philhellenes at Corinth in the Spring of 1822, and we hear of a military parade at the Panayia Church at Easter of that year before the Philhellenes went on active service in May. The pit contents may represent debris from one of the mustered soldiers. Several later pits were excavated. These contain material dating after the War of Independence and before the destructive earthquake of February 1858 after which New Corinth was founded.' Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey. Timothy Gregory and Fritz Hemans (ASCS) report on the first field season in 1999: 'Active archaeological fieldwork (for 18 days) was restrict- ed to selected areas of the Isthmia Basin (a total of 30.13km2). Intensive archaeological survey was carried out in a major tran- sect running from the slopes of Mt Oneion, E of Xylokeriza, to Rachi Boska and then to Perdikaria and the height of the Agios Demetrios Ridge. During this intensive survey archaeological objects, including pottery, were counted but not collected; rather, representative pieces were described, photographed and drawn in situ. In this manner detailed examination of a total of 0.82km2 was achieved in 281 individual discovery units. This represents a coverage of 2.7% of the whole lsthmia Basin. In this intensive phase some 32,085 sherds, 11,765 tiles, 240 lithics and 86 miscellaneous archaeological objects were count- ed and 3,295 of these were described; many of them were also drawn and photographed. Four objects of particular importance (three coins and a chalcedony arrowhead) were collected and turned over to the Ephorate after their location had been care- fully recorded. Within the area of intensive survey some five areas were identified as places of localized cultural activity (LOCAs); these are what many surveys refer to as 'sites', and they include an important PR and C complex at the top of Rachi Boska. Artefact density for all of the discovery units was recorded, along with information about the chronological peri- ods that they represent. The survey was fully diachronic and special attention was taken to record the archaeological evi- dence from the most recent periods. An intensive program of experimentation was conducted to test various methods of sur- vey technique and recording. This program helped us to define our fieldwork in 1999 and will assist in the planning and analy- sis in future seasons. Overall artefact density was quite high, with as many as 2,726 objects counted in a single discovery unit. Mean density, for all the units surveyed, was 0.05 objects per m2. The large number of objects and their spread across the landscape confirm our expectation that we would encounter enormous quantities of archaeological material in the survey area: using standards applied by other, comparable, Mediterranean surveys, practical- ly the whole of the survey area would be considered an archae- ological site! Nonetheless, clear distinctions between areas of high and low density could be observed, and these will be sub- ject to detailed examination in the GIS, taking into considera- tion such factors as recorded visibility and geomorphological characteristics of the various areas. Generally speaking LR material was predominant on the slopes of Mt Oneion, although there were significant numbers of possibly PR obsidian objects there. The relatively flat land N of Mt Oneion revealed significant evidence of activity in the C and HL periods, although there was still some indication of R and LR use. The plateau of Rachi Boska, one of the areas of highest density in the intensive survey, contained significant quantities of PR pottery, from MN to LH, along with large quantities of C and lesser quantities of LR pottery. The finds in the Perdikaria region were once again primarily C and LR in date. Significantly, there were no concentrations of Med or Ott period ceramics in the intensive survey area. Extensive survey was carried out in several areas within the Isthmia Basin, most notably in the area of Kromna, located near the Hexamilia quarries, just S of the road between Hexamilia and Kyras Vrysi. In this area, previously explored by James Wiseman and partially published by him, were found the archi- tectural fragments of several structures, including what are probably monumental tombs. Indeed, this whole area (around Kromna) seems in antiquity to have been an important ceme- tery. It would have been clearly visible from the ancient road, and probably served distinguished Corinthians who wished to be commemorated in such a public place-in a manner that reminds one of the distinguished cemetery of the Athenians at the Kerameikos. Large architectural features were also encoun- tered and recorded elsewhere, including a substantial ashlar wall on the E side of Rachi Boska and a reasonably well-pre- served stretch of Cyclopaean (presumably Myc) wall along the N side of the same hill. The examination of aerial photographs revealed a large linear feature, running roughly NW-SE through the survey area. Ground-based examination of this feature con- firmed its identification and suggested that it was an anc. road, presumably running to the port at Kenchreai from the city of Corinth, and perhaps from the harbor of Lechaion to the W. Important innovations of the project include a fully interdis- ciplinary approach, involving survey archaeology, an experi- mental approach, and involvement of the earth sciences from the very beginning of the undertaking. Especially significant to the project were the complete geomorphological mapping of all areas prior to the archaeological survey, and the functioning of a GIS, based on digitized topographical maps (terrain models) and aerial photographs. All survey units were laid out so as not to cross over geomorphological boundaries, thus preserving the integrity of the archaeological data vis-a-vis their environmen- tal setting, and geomorphologists accompanied the archaeolog- ical teams every day in the field. The survey units were clearly marked on printouts of the aerial photographs before the archaeological survey took place, allowing us to have full spa- tial control at all times, and all information from the survey is stored in digital and paper form in Greece and in the United States. Most archaeological surveys in Greece have been carried out in 'marginal' land, far from centers of population, both ancient and moder. The Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey, by contrast, focuses on the immediate hinterland of Corinth, and as</page><page sequence="24">26 DAVID BLACKMAN such it is the first intensive survey to be carried out adjacent to one of the great cities of the anc. world. The territory of the Eastern Korinthia is also undergoing rapid development, and EKAS seeks to assist the Archaeological Service in its task of defining areas of archaeological importance before they are destroyed. The non-collection procedure of the survey is an effective and innovative low-impact prospecting technique that allows for excellent understanding of the archaeological remains with little damage to the environment or the archaeo- logical record. We expect to continue and refine these success- ful techniques in future seasons, as we expand the coverage to areas not yet studied.' Isthmia. The report on the two ASCS excavations in 1994 (ADelt 166-8) was given in AR 1994-95, 11. Elizabeth R. Gebhard (ASCS) reports on the University of Chicago excava- tions in 1999: 'The year was devoted to study of objects in the Isthmia Museum by colleagues preparing volumes for the final publica- tions in the Isthmia series. Rachi settlement: Virginia Anderson-Stojanovic continued writing her book on the archaeology and history of the early shrine and HL settlement on the Rachi. The study places the objects within their architectural context and explores the set- tlement's role in the life of Poseidon's festival and sanctuary. Arms and armour: Alastar Jackson devoted two months to his study of arms, armour and weapons, with a concentration this year on the extremely fragmented limb armor. Close collabora- tion with conservator Stella Bouzaki resulted in the recovery of a helmet and several other pieces of armour that would other- wise have remained unrecognizable. Roman Inscriptions: Daniel Geagan, with the assistance of James Cako, completed the final season of a three-year project to update for publication his earlier study of inscriptions from the R period. Stones discovered since 1970, including two large victor stelai, were added to the catalogue. Transcriptions were made of lists of names that had been scratched on wall-plaster from the South Building next to the Palaimonion. In the course of cleaning the plaster, Stella Bouzaki detected painted decora- tion on a number of fragments. The stratigraphic information recovered in the 1989 excavations enabled Geagan to define more clearly the context in which the inscriptions had been buried. C and EHL Pottery, ca 550-300 BC: Martha Risser, contin- uing the work of Julie Bentz, progressed in the examination of C and EHL ceramics in the boxes of context sherds. Many new pieces were added to the inventory, including a work of the Round Rump Painter who was active in 4th-Ct Corinth. Palaimonion: Jim Hanges returned after a nine-year absence to the study of deposits and objects in the shrine of the hero Palaimon. Through relating deposits from all trenches of the area, he is preparing a consolidated account of the material excavated in 1956-58. An important topic is the distribution of Palaimonion lamps and other vessels belonging to the cult. Another is identification of the pre-Antonine adyton. Publication of Catherine Morgan's book on the Mycenaean Settlement and Early Iron Age Sanctuary at Isthmia (Isthmia VIII) is expected before the end of this year. We note with deep sadness the death of Professor Anton Raubitschek. For many years a faithful and devoted member of the Isthmia staff, Toni carried out the museum work for his wife Isabelle's volume on the metal objects from the sanctuary (Isthmia VII) and after her death he worked tirelessly to see the book through the press. He will be sorely missed.' Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on the Ohio State University excavations in 1999: 'Investigation this year focused entirely on the study of material from the R bath, which will soon lead to the full pub- lication of the building. Work continued notably on cataloguing the R pottery and window glass; the study of the architecture, decoration and stratigraphy of the building; and planning the construction of a roof to protect the restored figural mosaic in Room VI.' Kenchreai. To the W of the anc. harbour an extensive building of LR date was discovered, probably associated with the port installations (walls, paved floors of clay and marble slabs). Over the ruins of this building was erected another structure, with four rooms. In the same area was also recorded a roofed well, of square shape. (ADelt 163-4) Nemea. The preliminary reports on the ASCS work in 1994 at Nemea and Tsoungiza were omitted from AR 1994-95. They can be found in ADelt 165-6 (Stephen G. Miller and James C. Wright). Stephen G. Miller reports on the 1999 excavations and other work at Nemea by the University of California at Berkeley: 'The summer of 1999 marked the third in the current five- year program of large-scale excavations at Nemea. The work this year was focused in two areas: at the W end of the bath (Nemea River, the ECh cemetery, the white clay layer) and the region NW of the Hero shrine of Opheltes. In the former area, final checking was done on the ECh and Byz levels of the river, with special attention paid to the col- lection of snail samples for isotopic analysis (014 and 016) in the hope of more evidence for periods of drought. This work also cleared the way for the final diversion of the river through a newly-constructed bridge into the Byz waterway which is three times wider and 1.50m deeper than the channel that had been cut in 1884, and which served to drain the valley until our work in 1998. The antiquities of the sanctuary of Zeus (and especially the bath, whose floor was lower than that of the 1884 drainage channel) are therefore much less likely to suffer win- ter flood damages which have characterized recent years. N of the bath, the ECh cemetery discovered last year was fully excavated. Several more graves were discovered with skeletal remains in various stages of preservation. The way is now clear for the final analysis of those remains, and the final presentation of the cemetery. At the W edge of the cemetery, cut through by the 1884 drainage channel and by the 1924 detour of the channel, an extremely heavy debris layer was discovered. It is clear that this layer was part of a landscaping fill dumped in the late 4th Ct BC in order to raise the level of the bath and enable its drainage. The debris itself, however, included dozens of frag- mentary wall blocks and hundreds of fragmentary roof tiles, of the type that have long been identified, on the basis of size, material, surface treatment and (on the tiles) stamps, as from the early temple of Zeus. This material will require patient study and conservation, but much additional information is already forthcoming. This includes the use of cement not only in bed- ding the tiles of the roof, but also in filling parts of sockets in the upper surfaces of wall blocks left empty by attachments, and the clear indications of an extremely intense fire in a limited part of the building. Most of the roof tiles are of normal color and consistency, but a few have been badly burnt, and others have been melted and vitrified. In all this debris, a fragmentary terracotta lion's head water-spout, and a fragment of a single</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 27 35. Nemea, drain of late 4th-Ct bath arris from a Doric column, are the first indications of sculptural decoration and of a colonnade for the building. The debris layer also contained artefacts of other types. The most interesting of these was a lead palmette, some of whose leaves had been cut out. This may be understood as a template of some sort. A test trench immediately N of the bath and beneath the debris layer revealed substantial quantities of 8th-Ct BC pottery. No traces of architecture were found, but the ceramics already attest to much more activity in the G period than has been pre- viously found at Nemea. Also beneath the early temple debris, but further W, more of the layer of white clay discovered in 1997 and 1998 was found. Unfortunately, this clay has been cut through by the ECh and Byz rivers, by the 1884 and 1924 drainage channels, and by the drain of the late 4th-Ct BC bath (Fig. 35). As the rivers and channels converge toward the N, the preserved area of the white clay dwindles, but it still showed two features of note. First, parallel to the bath drain, and less than 2m N of it, was discov- ered a trench cut through the white clay. This was filled with the same landscaping debris that covered the clay, and shows that the trench was open at the time when the clay was covered. Since the cover slabs of the bath drain include many early start- ing line blocks, this trench may well be the robbing trench where those blocks were originally located. Secondly, it was possible to define the E edge of the white clay layer where it ended next to a small but clear river bed. This edge aligns neat- ly with the edge of a white clay layer next to a river bed that was discovered, but not understood, in 1975, some 110-115m N of the robbing trench (starting line?) just mentioned (see Hesperia 45 [1976] 177-8). The possibility that this deliberately laid white clay layer is the track of the A-EC stadium is thereby strengthened. A heavy and well-constructed wall was found to extend the line of the sunken bathing chamber of the bath 7m westward. Constructed in the 5th Ct AD, the purpose of this wall and its architectural definition is not clear. The second area of excavations lies NW of the shrine of Opheltes. Our original goal of finding evidence for the location of the Nemean hippodrome was frustrated, but the extremely large quantity of coins (including a high proportion of silver) continues the numismatic wealth of this area as discovered clos- er to the Hero shrine (see Hesperia 50 [1981] 62; 53 [1984] 176). The wealth of LC and EHL pottery also shows that there was considerable activity here, even if we cannot yet define its nature. It is also interesting that the first piece of armour d~s- covered at Nemea came to light here: the nose and eyebrows of a bronze Corinthian helmet (Fig. 36). The surprise discovery here was a terracotta water channel covered with Cor roof cover tiles, exactly like the conduit that brought water to the bath in the late 4th Ct BC. This flows downward to the W and, although 20m of it have been exposed, its source and its destination are not yet known. The water chan- nel disappears beneath a nicely-built wall of ashlar blocks which runs nearly N-S and is paralleled by an equally well-built wall lying only about 2m to the W. Both walls continue out of the excavated area to N and S, and their function is unknown, but the style of their construction would put them in the EHL period at the latest. The floor level to be associated with these walls has yet to be discovered, but the area between them pro- duced large numbers of fragments of lamps of the 3rd Ct AD (Fig. 37). Although only five have been mended, 32 different handles have been discovered so far. Given that in 26 years of work at Nemea only 240 lamps had been inventoried before 1999, this number is significant. So, too, is their date, for the 3rd Ct AD has been little documented in the areas excavated hereto- 36. Nemea, Corinthian helmet fragment 37. Nemea, lamp</page><page sequence="26">28 DAVID BLACKMAN fore. We look forward to the 2000 season to provide us with more information about a very different Nemea from that we have come to understand. Museum and display. In May, 1999, it was decided that the North Room should be returned to its original condition. As a result, much work was done on the re-establishment of displays and repainting of walls. New elements and discoveries were added with this opportunity, for example, a new model of Nemea in ca AD 500 was placed in the second N window to balance the model of Nemea in ca 300 BC in the first N win- dow, and the model of the EHL stadium was moved to the E window, which looks toward the stadium; displays on the ECh period were expanded, etc. In 1991 a roof was constructed over the ancient bath with a view to conserving the antiquities and better displaying the functions of the building. This year permission was given to undertake the further necessary conservation work, and to set up restored drawings that would allow the visitor to understand the hydraulic facilities and their use. This work is not yet com- plete, but enough has been done to make a major contribution to the site from a didactic standpoint. The reconstruction of two columns on the N side of the tem- ple of Zeus was begun in 1984 but suspended for economic rea- sons. That work has now recommenced and, as of September 20, all 48 of the missing blocks of the krepidoma in the relevant area have been replaced with new stone from near the ancient quarries, and the first drum of one column reset. The work, which involves considerable carving of replacement pieces for missing fragments of ancient blocks, is progressing. The sched- ule-which we hope to meet-calls for the two columns and their epistyle and frieze to be re-erected by the beginning of December, 1999. On July 25 1999, a celebration was held in the sanctuary of Nemean Zeus to announce the recommencement of the temple of Zeus reconstruction, and the Second Modem Nemead on June 3-4, 2000. The celebration was at the joint invitation of the Ministry of Culture, the ASCS, the University of California at Berkeley, the Prefecture of the Korinthia, the Municipality of Nemea, and the Society for the Revival of the Nemean Games. It was attended by the President of the Hellenic Republic and an estimated 1600 guests. The Second Nemead will be, like the first, an attempt to give an opportunity to all who wish to partic- ipate in something like the ancient Games. Clothes changed in the ancient Apodyterion, oath sworn before passing through the entrance tunnel by the dozens of ancient graffiti on its walls, bare toes placed in ancient stone starting blocks, errant athletes flogged by judges robed in black commemorating the death of Opheltes, wild celery for the winners. This revival of the games has struck a chord with the wider public and proven a very effec- tive means of engaging people's interest in ancient Greece.' Stymphalia. Investigations in a badly looted cave, at the site of Tria Goupata, on Mt Mesiano (anc. Oligyrtos) in the Lavka dis- trict of Korinthia, suggest the presence of a chthonic cult, involving a large number of dedications. The latter include pot- tery, ranging in date between the 6th and 4th Cts BC, handmade figurines of the female seated type (6th-5th Cts BC) female fig- urines with a polos of the 5th-4th Cts BC, horse figurines, a model of a circular shield and of a bronze inscribed shield, bronze decorative rosettes, a bronze ring with an incised repre- sentation of a warrior, and animal bones, especially of goats. The archaeological deposit occupies an area of 13 x 25m, with a thickness of 1-1.50m. In the upper W part of this area, N(?) pot- tery sherds and obsidian fragments were collected..(ADelt 161) Hector Williams (Canadian Institute) reports on the 1999 sea- son of excavations at Stymphalos: 'Stymphalos I: SE area of city (houses and streets). High water levels in Lake Stymphalos this year delayed excavations in the flat SE area of anc. Stymphalos where in previous sea- sons we had uncovered a number ofLC, HL and ER houses and streets. Once work was possible, however, we uncovered more of an ER house found in 1997 and more of a large ER deposit (perhaps earthquake destruction material) also first explored in 1997. Exploration in the house uncovered more of the tile floor discovered the previous season but added little to our knowl- edge of the building. Much more significant were the discover- ies in the earthquake deposit that had already in 1997 yielded a number of complete but shattered kitchen- and common-ware pots of the Tiberian period. At least a dozen more vessels- bowls, plates and pitchers-came off the plaster floor of a reused HL building of fine ashlar masonry at the E end of the excavated area. More interesting were a pair of large marble lion or griffin feet that seemed to have been used as supports for a table; they are typical of 1St-Ct BC Neoattic workshops and seem to indicate an establishment of some wealth and luxury. Near them on the floor we also uncovered perhaps the most important discovery of the season: a 79cm long iron sword still in the remains of its sheath (originally leather or wood, of which nothing remained except the iron edging and the bronze straps that linked the two sides). We also found about 20 small iron rings more or less in a row, a number of bronze locks and fit- tings for wooden chests, and several discoid loom weights. This year we also examined two grave-like structures that had been cut into the bedrock at the E end of the acropolis. Their orientation was N-S and they have always been visible and apparently robbed out long ago. Much to our surprise the westernmost produced a complete common ware pitcher and an oil lamp of 5th Ct AD date as well as a quantity of human bones, adding another grave to the growing number of LR burials from Stymphalos. The other grave was completely robbed. Stymphalos II: Sanctuary of Athena. Excavations since 1994 have uncovered a large part of a small sanctuary, appar- ently dedicated to the goddess Athena. It contained a temple (11 x 6m), a large auxiliary building with annexes on its N and W sides (possibly a priest's house/storeroom), an altar built of large rough-cut blocks of local limestone, and a rectangular building of uncertain use at the SE edge of the sanctuary (pos- sibly not part of it). All surviving construction was in the lime- stone of the acropolis, with evidence for mud-brick superstruc- tures and tile roofs. Work this year concentrated on the NW comer of the sanc- tuary where in 1997 we had uncovered three aniconic stelai in a row running N-S (according to Pausanias such stelai are typi- cal of Arcadia). Extending the excavation to the N by several metres we uncovered two further stelai in a line with those dis- covered earlier and indeed a smaller sixth stele a little to the E. We also uncovered an intact infant burial beside the SW comer of the auxiliary building; although orientated N-S it is probably of ECh date, like the multiple burial that we uncovered in the pronaos of the temple in 1997. Besides a small test in the main room of the auxiliary build- ing, we dug extensively along what we thought was the E limit of the sanctuary and in fact found a large terrace wall running N-S; it seems to have marked the E limit of at least the paved terrace on which the altar stood (if not the E limit of the sanc- tuary itself). As in previous years the stratigraphy was limited to a surface level (much disturbed by agricultural activity that only</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 29 ended in the 1960s-the site is accessible only to mules, not tractors) and two or three lower levels. Once again we discov- ered considerable ceramic and numismatic evidence for major activity in the sanctuary at the end of the 4th Ct BC-perhaps to be associated with the capture of the town by Cassander's troops in 311 BC. Otherwise all evidence indicates that the site was plundered and abandoned in the mid 2nd Ct BC, presum- ably at the time of Mummius' destruction of Corinth, with only occasional visitors thereafter. Although we found no further fragments of the three marble statues (A kore and kouros and LC 'temple boy') discovered in the temple in 1995, we did find one substantial fragment of ter- racotta relief sculpture, a half-life-size woman's upper arm and drapery, as well as about 20 smaller terracotta figurines (most fragmentary). We also found more offerings of bronze jew- ellery-earrings, finger rings, bracelets, etc.-to join the nearly 200 pieces found in earlier seasons. The finest piece was a small fragment of gilded silver with a relief of (possibly) Eros and Psyche on it. There were as well the usual large quantities of pottery-fine, common/kitchen wares, and storage vessels-of which the most interesting was a small piece of Cor rf of two hands reaching out. Stymphalos III: the Monastiraki site at the N end of the vil- lage was not dug in 1999. However, the road through Stymphalos is being widened and it is likely that the road builders will encounter ancient remains (possibly graves) when they work in this area because the modem road runs by it. Stymphalos IV: acropolis tower and cemetery. We contin- ued to excavate the large artillery tower at the highest point of the W end of the acropolis; in 1997 we had discovered unex- pected interior walls and a staircase, evidence for destruction and rebuilding at the end of the 4th Ct BC, and a small ECh cemetery of the 5th Ct AD, built in and around the tower on its E side. This year we uncovered several more burials, including an unusual one of a dog laid out carefully on top of an earlier burial in a grave well-constructed of tiles and mortar. On the W side of the tower we were able to isolate still well- preserved courses of mud-brick and mud-brick mortar that rest- ed on top of a stone foundation; in many areas it seems that a layer of large sherds was used as a barrier between mud-brick and stone, perhaps to keep damp out. We also found another piece of the large LA/EC Doric capital discovered in 1997 reused in one of the interior walls of the tower. Stymphalos V: the Western tower. A new area of excavation this year was the large artillery tower in the middle of the W city wall of Stymphalos. Our investigations quickly established that it replaced an earlier simple rectangular tower similar to others still visible along the wall (towers are semicircular on other sections of the city's defences) probably at the end of the 4th Ct BC when there seems to have been a general upgrading of the city's fortifications to take advantage of the powerful new types of torsion artillery that had developed in the second half of the century. A hoard of 14 silver and bronze coins, mostly of the 4th Ct, along with pottery from foundation trenches, tend to support this date. The tower at some point received some material from a shrine or sanctuary dumped into it: we found several perir- rhanterion fragments as well as offerings like fusiform unguen- taria. Time and resources allowed only a limited excavation of the tower and not the immediate area; thus we cannot say any- thing at this point about the origin of the material, but there is no city gate nearby. We also excavated a rectangular tower immediately to the S of the large tower; it had an ashlar face on three sides and a rubble core. There were few finds or indications of date and use. Like the rest of the city wall it would have had a mud-brick superstructure protected from the elements by a tile capping. There are numerous deposits of a mud very rich in clay around the lake and throughout the valley that made extensive mud- brick construction an attractive and relatively inexpensive method of building both house and city walls. It is clear from occasional discovery of pottery and tile wasters that there was a local ceramic industry as well. In and around the tower we also excavated a number of ECh burials, some intact, some disturbed and some (especially those of infants) completely robbed out. Pottery and a terracotta lamp suggest a Sth-Ct date for the cemetery. It seems likely that there were a number of ECh farmsteads in the area, each burying its dead in a separate location. Stymphalos VI: 'SW Gate'. The final area of excavation this season was where the W city wall comes down from the acrop- olis and begins to run along the level of the flat plan. In our ear- lier survey of the city in 1982 we had suggested that an anom- aly in the city wall at this point marked the site of a gate, prob- ably of the overlapping sort of which we have at least four other examples at the city. A large (50 x 10m) shallow trench this sea- son, however, suggests that the answer may not be so simple and that we could be dealing with, for example, a repair to the wall after an earthquake or a siege or even an attempt to insert a postern gate: what is apparent is that a rectangular tower was suppressed and a new wall, 2m thick, was built out several metres from the original city wall. Other: We were able to study all coins from 1999 and earli- er seasons this year: as expected, the great majority were from the Peloponnese, especially from Sikyon, but there were some interesting examples from much further afield. We have two bronze coins of HL Carthage, for example, perhaps brought back as a souvenir by some Stymphalian mercenary in the serv- ice of the Punic armies, and a silvered bronze forgery of an early 1st-Ct BC R republican coin that suggests there may have been activity at the site between the time of Mummius' pre- sumed destruction and the 1st-Ct AD R resettlement. We also did limited survey work on substantial sections of rough walling at the hill of Agia Triada N of the village of Lafka; the date of these walls (which in places still stand near- ly 3m in height and run for over 100m along the E face of the hill) is not at all certain and could even be BA, but the site seems a possible candidate for the earlier location of Stymphalos itself since the city that we are digging was clearly laid out in the mid-4th Ct BC. In preparation for an application for permission to restore the anc. fountain house in the Veintsouri area of anc. Stymphalos, we carried out a survey of the existing remains; it indicated that the main back wall of the fountain is under enormous pressure from behind and is bending outward, perhaps in part as a result of poorly planned restoration work carried out an some earlier period by persons unknown. It should be possible to stabilize the site, to restore and preserve it, and to make it an interesting element of the ancient city. There are few fountains so old still functioning in Greece!'</page><page sequence="28">30 DAVID BLACKMAN ARGOLIS Ano Epidauros. On a hill at the site of Kollote, rescue excava- tions have revealed the existence of a new EH II settlement in the Ano Epidauros valley (pottery, obsidian, marble ECyc fig- urine) probably the xcopiov 'YpviOtov mentioned by Pausanias (II 28, 3-7). (ADelt 159-61) Argos. There were 21 rescue excavations reported from the mod. city of Argos in 1994, the vast majority of which involved sites used over long periods of time, both for burials and for domestic or workshop activities. (ADelt 128-45) At the junction of Odos Gordonos and Kolokotrone, the uppermost layers dated from the Byz period, with an IA funer- ary stone pile below. The stone pile, 2.50 x 3.50m in size, part- ly covered a burial pithos (N-S) facing N, outside the mouth of which were placed two irregular layers of unworked stones in a semicircular arrangement, with a limestone slab on top; the skeleton was in a contracted position. To the S was found a built cist grave (N-S) with a contracted infant burial. A second pithos burial and a well, destroyed by mod. construction work, date from the same period. There were no funeral offerings there- fore, the only chronological indications are provided by the pot- tery found among the stones of the stone pile (G) and by the typology of the tombs. In the Myc period the site was part of the settlement, extending over the E slopes of the Aspis hill. The building material used in the G stone pile was removed from at least one EMyc house, with a trodden earth floor, while a LH IIIA1 bothros/pit, with a great deal of pottery, was also located in the vicinity. During the LMH period the area was also used for burials, defined by a line of unworked stones. Four rectan- gular grave pits of red clay had been dug through the floor of a MH structure, while one more pit grave to their S, with two burials, included no funeral offerings. Below the G stone pile were identified the remains of two other pit graves, in addition to the two destroyed tombs located during the initial discovery of the site, all used during the same (MH) period. The existing remains preclude the presence of a tumulus in the area, while at the same time, it is interesting that the G cemetery was located over the site of a much earlier MH cemetery. At the junction of Odos Perseos and Megalou Alexandrou, rescue work revealed fragmentary walls of HL date, forming at least two rectangular rooms, part of a stone-paved floor of an open court, and a well, associated with another open court. Part of the same site was probably used in the A period, judging by a number of terracotta figurines from a destroyed deposit. Finally, during the Myc period, the area was used for isolated burials (two pits with child burials) and for refuse pits (two shallow pits, LH IIIA2). The dense cemetery investigated to the SE apparently did not extend here. In Odos Chatze were excavated architectural remains of the Byz period, a built R cistern, and remains of the LG period, including parts of two fragmentary walls, three tombs (cist grave, pithos burial, pot burial) and four wells (clay pits) for the extraction of clay. During mod. drainage works in Odos Karatza, remains were located of domestic architecture (HL and Myc), an A clay kiln, and nine tombs, including a G pot burial, a LA cist grave, an A pithos burial, and six HL tombs (one pit grave, two cremations, one clay-covered pit and two tile-roofed graves). In Odos Vasilisses Sophias, LR architectural remains were excavated, a HL infant pot burial (gold leaf) and two G cist graves (N-S), while in Odos Kretes were investigated four rows of tombs of A date, including four pithos burials, three poros 38. Argos, Roman road cist graves, and two tile-roofed pits. At the junction of Odos Herakleous and Diomedous, in the NW part of the mod. town, near the foot of the Prophetes Elias hill, where MH and LH occupation has been identified in the past (habitation and burial sites) and where a cemetery of tumuli has been excavated along Odos Herakleous, a R wall and a hearth were recorded, two par- allel walls of C date, A and HL deposits, and three MH burials (two cist graves, one pit grave). In Odos Tsokre, in the centre of the mod. town, in an area where a great number of graves has been excavated in the past, to the N of the N section of the anc. fortification walls, and E of the road from Nemea and Corinth, part of a C-HL cemetery was investigated, consisting of 23 graves with poor offerings. Only two cist graves belonged to the HL period. The C cemetery included seven poros cist graves, one cist grave with a tile roof, eight pit graves and five pithos burials. The latter and one of the pit graves are the earliest, and belong to the second quarter and middle of the 5th Ct BC. To the second half of the 5th Ct belong the seven poros cists, surrounding the pits and the pithos buri- als. At the junction of Odos Tsokre and Danopoulou were revealed the remains of a HL workshop establishment, includ- ing 15 earth-cut pits/deposits, originally used for the storage and refining of the raw material used in the workshop. In them were found lumps of clay, rust, clay firing supports and frag- ments of bronze objects, as well as charcoal mixed with ashes. To the main workshop site belong remains of walls, two stone</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 31 piers, and a stone-built well. Unexplained is the presence of a room in the SE corer of the site, as well as a section of a trod- den earth floor. In the same plot were also discovered tombs of the G period (two pithos burials, one pot burial, three shaft graves) and the HL period (tile-roofed graves). In the Odos Chatze extension, a poros funeral peribolos of LC/EHL date was investigated, most of which extends N, under the mod. road. Two graves were excavated in its interior, as was a third poros cist grave to the S. A site on Parodos Gounare, an area with important urban remains of the R period, yielded finds dating from the G and R phases. The G period was represented by five tombs (three cist graves, two pits) and one pithos burial. Over these tombs were located HL deposits, as well as part of a stone building and a circular clay kiln, of the same date. A LC-R road, running E-W, with a gravel surface, was also investigated in the middle of the plot. During the R period, two extensive buildings were con- structed on either side of the road, reducing its width. The one on the S was used until the 4th Ct AD. In the same road were investigated the remains of R-LR walls (pottery of the 2nd-3rd Cts AD) including fragments of wall paintings. An ash layer, containing charcoal, HL pottery (3rd-2nd Cts BC) and fragments of a terracotta female figurine wearing a peplos, should proba- bly be associated with the remains of a workshop for the pro- duction of terracotta figurines in the vicinity. A tile-roofed grave was also dated to the HL period. In the same plot was also exca- vated part of an anc. road, 2.50m wide, running E-W, which was used from LC to R times, and two circular clay kilns, dating from the 2nd Ct BC to 1St Ct AD. On Odos Pharoneos eight tombs were excavated, including three poros cist graves and five tile-roofed pits, dating from the C to HL period. In the same area were located seven pits con- taining workshop remains of HL date (4th-3rd Cts BC). On Parodos Danaou excavations revealed a successive occupation of the site from the Byz to the R and HL periods (walls, pot- tery), including a R stone-paved road (20m long, 2.20m wide) running N-S (Fig. 38), provided with a built, underground drain, and preserving the remains of parallel chariot wheel marks on its surface, 1.40m apart. To the W of the paved road, at a higher level, was located a Byz cart road. In the NW part of the plot was discovered part of a remarkable marble funeral stele, dating from the third quarter of the 6th Ct BC, and depict- ing a relief representation of a naked youth in profile, holding a lotus flower with his left hand. Agora. Marcel Pierart reports on work done by the French School in the agora, where repairs were made to buildings dam- aged by the floods of autumn 1998: in the area of the thermae B (areas BG.BH 85.86) where some blocks of the ECh stylobate were dislodged, and at the angle of the hypostyle room and the extension of colonnade P (area AW.AY 71.72) where walls belonging to Med houses had caved in. Clearance of the remains in AX 71-72 revealed an inscrip- tion on one of the blocks of the E wall of the Med house (Inv. E329) which was a decree of the Hymathioi tribe in honour of the agonothetes M. Antonius Achaieus, known to have been active in the reign of Trajan. This inscription belongs to a well- known group of honorific texts of the Early Empire (cf. BCH 109 (1985) 355-6) (Fig. 39). Excavation of marble building M (area AY.BA 91-93) was carried out with a view to publication. The first course survives of a large square socle (side 6.20m) which consists on all four sides of a row of blocks of variable length (from 0.60m to 1.20m) about 0.40m thick and about 1.30m deep. The core was entirely filled with stones bonded with cement. The whole monument 39. Argos, agora, inscription on house wall rested on a cube of stone and mortar 1.20m high (Fig. 40). An area was set aside in which to set out the blocks and fragments, some of them moulded, belonging to this monument. A hasty examination of these led to the conclusion that it was a statue 40.

Argos, agora base surrounded on at least two sides by benches. A similar mon- ument was found at the Dipylon: H.R. Goette, Ath.Mitt. 105 (1990) 269-78. The foundations of this monument cut through a gutter cut in blocks of poros which ran parallel to the race track of the Early Imperial period (cf. BCH 111 [1987] 585-8) a little to the N, and could have acted as the border of an earlier phase of the dromos. Remains of this gutter had previously been found to the W of building D and in the area surrounding drains E. The collapse of the mud-brick wall in square BD 77, with- in baths B, was only part of the damage in the Argos agora, caused by the floods of December 1998. Cleaning and a small excavation were carried out in June 1999, supervised by Michalis Douzenis. The main results of this short season were as follows (Fig. 41): During the cleaning of the area of disintegrated bricks and the large stones from the foundations of the wall, two marble architectural fragments were discovered-part of a 4-5th Ct AD ionic capital, and probably part of a door-frame with rectilinear reliefs. The continuation of hall X and baths B were uncovered in the two small trenches that were opened (A and B). Specifically, below the fill of worn coarse- and cooking-ware, a part of the floor with clay tiles was uncovered (largest dimensions pre- served 60 x 25cm); the floor was supported by the rectangular and circular small piers of the hypocaust (average dimensions: 27 x 28cm, or 25cm diam., and 80cm max. preserved height) 42. Argos, agora, hypocaust (Fig. 42: from E). A thick destruction layer was removed from between the piers, while much charcoal and charred wood remains were found in the NW comer of trench A; it is possible that this point abuts the praefumium, a continuation of the room, which is located below the adjacent plot of land to the W. The destruction layer contained fragments of the clay floor tiles, many fragments of the marble slabs from the walls (schist, white and grey marble), roughly-worked stones from the walls, plaster, and also elements of the superstructure-for example a fragment of the lower jaw of a lion-head from a roof gutter. Below the destruction layer, a layer of ash was discovered, 43. Argos, agora, well </page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 33 44. Argos, Karmoyannis site from the period of use of the building. It covered the tiled floor (ca 60 x 58cm) on which the hypocausts stood. The mouth of a well (85cm diam.) was discovered in the NW comer of trench B (Fig. 43). It was opened when the baths were no longer functioning, though before the total destruction of the area. A block of limestone (96 x 30 x 15cm), possibly part of a doorframe, was located S of the well, with two rectilinear reliefs on its two wider sides and also with plaster repairs. According to the pottery collected, the original use of this particular part of the baths can be dated to the 3-4th Cts AD, whereas its final destruction (possibly by fire) belongs to the 6th Ct AD (African red-painted pottery). Anne Pariente for the French School reports on the 1999 season at the Karmoyannis site at Argos. Work consisted in the removal of most of the baulks on the site, the filling in of old test trenches and the demolition of moder structures to the S of the site, to complete the excavation of an apsidal building part- ly revealed in 1980 and to bring together the S and N parts of the agora (Fig. 44). Removal of the E baulk of AL-AM73 revealed a hearth, and of AL-AM74 some terracotta tiling alongside a drain (Fig. 45) indicating a 4th-5th-Ct workshop connected with a late dwelling unearthed in 1972 and 1988. The E baulk of AN75 and N baulk of A076 revealed a layer of thick fill with pottery of the Early Empire. The trenches were filled in to a more or less homogeneous level, or a level logical for the presentation of the buildings without impeding the projected restoration of the site (Fig. 46). Excavations in the S of the site revealed eight tombs (probably Ott) cut through a gravel floor, forming part of the necropolis that covered the entire agora area (Fig. 47). The apsidal build- ing (Fig. 48) was entirely excavated; it was 10m long (includ- ing the apse) and 4.50m wide, oriented WNW-ESE and open to the E. It had a vestibule 3.50m deep, leading to a room with an apse. It was decorated with a mosaic of blue, yellow, red, black and white tesserae partly preserved (Fig. 49). All that remains is the first course of stones of the S and E wall, together with the threshold of the vestibule. The apse rests on a rectangular socle of stone and mortar which seems to =--l ~ date from the second phase. The room could date from the 4th Ct AD, which would make it part of the restoration of the agora known from other sources. A crust of brown earth covered part of the mosaic repaired in AS75 lj | with elaphropetra. The pottery dates this re- ------ use of the building to the 5th Ct AD, with [K I I destruction probably in the 5th-6thCts. A. Philippa-Touchais and G. Touchais car- --- ried out a study in Argos Museum of the matt- painted pottery from the MH site on the Aspis (about a third of all the ceramic material): 1,234 fragments were recorded, revealing marked differences between the N and SE sectors, already noted in other pottery groups. - -,--- Certain types (e.g. kantharoi and bowls with curvilinear designs) were plentiful in the SE and totally absent in the N. This confirms the ^..... _ .-.|4 theory that the occupation of the two areas was not altogether contemporary and/or it was functionally different, and that the final MH phase of the SE sector is absent in the N. 90 sherds were sent to the Demokritos Centre for analysis in collaboration with the Fitch Laboratory (BSA) which has the basic reference series (Lema/Asine). 45. Karmoyannis site, drain and tiles</page><page sequence="32">34 DAVID BLACKMAN 46. Karmoyannis site, trench Berbati. Mastos. Berit Wells (Swedish Institute) reports on the 1999 investigations: 'The 1999 investigations at the Mastos hill (Fig. 50, from the E) in the W part of the Berbati Valley (Prosimni) had two objec- tives: first, to carry out a surface survey of the entire hill in order to lear how it was utilized in different periods, and sec- ond, to create a computerized 3D map which would visualize human activity in relation to the landscape, and such modem human activity as harrowing and grazing. All artefacts lying on the surface were classified in the field and entered into the com- puter together with information on landscape type and land use. A small sample of material was brought to the museum, where it will be studied in detail in the summer of 2000. The excavations on the S and E slopes of the Mastos in the 1930s and 1950s showed that habitation on the hill goes back to MN times and that there was continued activity until the LH II period. Coins found in 1953 attest activities in the historical peri- od as late as the 12th Ct AD, but the excavators correctly saw Mastos primarily as a PR site. Although this year's investigations corroborate this general picture we now have a more complete grasp of human utilization of the slopes through the period and can further modify the picture for the historical periods. In the Nperiod activity was almost exclusively documented on the S and E slopes, although it should be noted that the top terrace of the hill yielded a number of sherds. Whether these originated there, or were brought there through manuring or similar activities, cannot be ascertained at this point. From the old excavations we know that there was an impor- tant EHsettlement, with preserved architecture in the S, and that this continued towards the E into the SW part of the potter's 47. Karmoyannis site, tomb 48. Karmoyannis site, apsidal building</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 35 49. Mosaic in apsidal building quarter. Our survey now has registered a considerable density of EH material not only on all the terraces in the S but also on the terraces in the E and SE. In the MH period, if we are to judge by the numbers of sherds studied, activity at the Mastos increases. Although we see particularly dense concentrations on some of the terraces in the S and SE, it is obvious that all slopes were utilized. Much of the transitional MH/LH pottery is notoriousiy difficuit to define, and this is especially true of survey material. Therefore some caution should be applied when studying the distribution maps of MH and LH I-II. Even with great caution applied it is quite evident from the map that Late Helladic was a major phase at the Mastos. Now, this of course may come as no surprise considering the produc- tion connected with the LH I-II kiln excavated in the 1930s. However, activity is not restricted to the kiln area but is very much in evidence in the W, a fact that heralds a major extension of habitation or other activities in LH III. Studying every single sherd on the surface at the Mastos is, as everybody understands who has walked the area, very time-consuming. For this reason we did not manage to survey all the fields either in the S or in the E. The carpet of material stretches some 20-30m S of the lowest terrace of the hill and in the E the fields below the road all the way to the stream would yield masses of material, pre- dominately LMyc to judge from walking over the fields. LH III yielded by far the most sherds. Sherd counts can be vastly misleading, as Myc pottery breaks easily into tiny frag- ments during cultivation, or even walking over the surface, while EH and MH pottery is preserved in large fragments on the same surface. However, in the case of the Mastos we can still safely conclude that activity in LH III surpassed that in any other period, as the numbers are overwhelming, a fact which can be observed on the distribution map. In the A to HL and R periods there is scattered evidence of human activity. For the earlier periods most of the artefacts are tiles, and there is evidence that especially Cor tiles were reused in later walls. Thus they could well have been brought from a wider area around the Mastos. There is clearly a LR presence but the nature of it is impossible to discern, as is the case also with the A to HL. The distribution of Med sherds shows an interesting pattern. The main concentrations are on the top terrace of the Mastos and on the rather steep slopes immediately below. We interpret this as activity mainly on the top terrace and that from there material has spilled over on the slopes. On the N side this ter- race still preserves a substantial fortification wall, clearly built in Byz times but utilizing a PR wall as its foundation. Here lay a fort which ties in very nicely with the finds of LByz coins referred to at the beginning of this report.' Byzantine Argolid. Gisele Hadzi-Minaglou (French School) reports on work in 1999: 'This year's fieldwork involved only the recording of 11- 12th Ct monuments. The recording of elements that were locat- ed at the high points of the churches in Chonica, Plataniti and Ligourio was completed; the confirmation of the photogram- metric recordings of the other buildings (Argos and Ayia Moni) was partly done. Finally the crypt of the church of the Koimisi tis Theotokou at Merbaka was recorded.' Dalamanara coast (Argos). N of the mod. coastal road from Nauplion to N. Kios, rescue excavations revealed part of the settlement of anc. Temenion. A stretch of an anc. road, running E-W, parallel to the mod. road, was 3m wide, and was used from the HL to the LR period (5th-6th Cts AD). To the W was located another anc. road, 4.70m wide, running N-S. To the S of the first road was excavated the NW part of a building and the. E part of a second building, dating from the 4th to 6th Cts AD. In the central part of the area were identified the remains of a third building (23.50 x 7.60m) with four rooms and clay slab floors, while below the first road were excavated the founda- tions of a R building, used for purple production, and destroyed by fire. The mod. road clearly runs right across the anc. site. SE of the excavation, the remains of a large anc. stone structure are preserved in the water, probably the breakwater of the harbour of anc. Temenion. (ADelt 150-1) 50. Mastos hill site</page><page sequence="34">36 DAVID BLACKMAN 51. Epidauros, Apollo Maleatas sanctuary Dokos. Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on the 1999 study season: 'Work was carried out in 1999 on the records and materials from fieldwork on Dokos carried out in 1996 and 1997. This included completion of the full catalogue of all the pottery from the two phases of the project. It is clear that we have confirma- tion of the original indications that the settlement and the church below the kastro can be dated to the 7th Ct. It was not possible to complete the photography and drawing of these objects, nor comparison with similar material in the museum of Spetses. Time has been set aside in 2000 to accomplish these tasks, and a final report on the investigation on Dokos will be submitted in that year.' Epidauros. At the site of the Apollo Maleatas sanc- tuary, B. Lambrinoudakes continued the study for the restoration of the retaining wall and the great altar of Apollo, the latter up to euthynteria level. Additional excavations of the PR remains revealed the foundations of two apsidal buildings, dated in the EH III or the beginning of the MH period; these buildings had been erected on the site of earlier, EH II rectangular structures (Fig. 51). The hard deposit between the two sets of buildings suggests a long period of abandonment of the area. It is worth men- tioning that the Myc structures on the site had the same orientation as the apsidal buildings. (Ergon 1999, 56-8) Ermione. The continuation of the 1991 excavations at the Ermione high school site at Agios Andreas revealed a large part of the extensive cemetery of the anc. town, including eight funeral periboloi on either side of a funeral road. The form and arrangement of ^ ,,,,, these periboloi is also attested in a series of organized cemeter- ies in Athens, Arta, Achaea, and Elis. A series of four cist graves of the PG and G periods testify to the earlier use of the area for funerary purposes. Peribolos A included four tombs; peribolos B (the latest use of which dates to the start of the 3rd Ct BC) included three tombs; peribolos F included five tombs and an ossuary, dating from the 3rd Ct BC to the 4th-5th Cts AD; while peribolos A contained 14 tombs, dating from the HL to the end of the R period. All four periboloi to the S of the road were rec- tangular, and were constructed of poros blocks. The two peri- boloi to the N of the anc. road (E and IT), also rectangular, were provided with schist slab foundations, on which the poros superstructure was laid, and were apparently constructed at a later date, after the first use of the graves; the latter consisted of Aeginetan stone lamakes, one in each peribolos, with multiple burials dating from the late 6th to the first quarter of the 5th Ct BC. Among the finds were a bronze Cor type helmet, two bronze phialae, a bronze mirror with a handle and Attic pottery of good quality (Athens workshop 581, circle of the Theseus painter). The last two periboloi (Z and H), to the S of the anc. road, were similar to periboloi A-A, and were used from the second decade of the 5th Ct to the 2nd Ct BC. Among the finds was a bronze mirror of the Karyatid type (Langlotz, Friihgriechische Bildhauerschulen, 1927, 34: Sikyon workshop). Three other mirrors of the same type from Ermione are now exhibited in Munich, at the Louvre and in the NM at Athens. (ADelt 147-8) On the hill of Magoula, 1 km W of the mod. town of Ermione, which was identified as an archaeological site during the surface survey of the ASCS (M.H. Jameson et al., A Greek Countryside (1994) 486-8, site E13), the remains were investi- gated of an apsidal house, of LMH date, with a hearth and part of a storage pithos inside (Fig. 52) as well as part of an EMyc house, destroyed by fire. The entire hill has been declared an archaeological site. In a plot within the mod. town of Ermione, near the religious sector of the anc. town, part of a building complex of the 5th Ct AD was investigated, with rooms arranged around an atrium, and remnants of mosaic floors, decorated with geometric pat- terns.

Hartenberger's MA thesis has now appeared, entitled 'An Analytical Investigation of Craft Specialization in the Chipped Stone Industry of Early and Middle Helladic Lerna' (Boston University, May 1999). She has also completed a final phased list of all of the lithics, and she and Prof. Runnels plan to write a final report on the lithics to appear in Hesperia, to supersede the preliminary report of 1985 in that same journal. They expect to complete this by May 2000, at which point the publication of the lithics will be complete. K.D. Vitelli has returned to her draft text on Lerna I and II pottery (N). Her work has included working out the LN and in particular the interesting FN hearths and burials, and writing the descriptions and discussion of the LN pottery, helped by her work on the Franchthi material. She hopes to complete the reworking of the introductory section and the EN pot discus- sions next year. Carol Zerner has completed sections of her work on Lerna V in draft, covering the first part of the description of the impor- tant area D, from the transitional Lerna IV/V levels through Lera V.3. They incorporate careful descriptions of individual houses with surrounding areas, followed by the detailed cata- logue of the related pottery divided into fabric categories: main- land (gray Minyan, dark burnished, matt painted, lustrous dec- orated, etc.), Aeginetan (dark burnished, matt painted), Minoan, central Greek; after each catalogue comes a brief listing of the associated small objects (with lithics), organic samples, and bones and shells. Martha Heath Wiencke's volume Lerna III, Architecture, Stratigraphy, and Pottery is due to come out soon. Midea. To the W of the village of Agia Triada, at the site of Kerlia/Lahidia, an anc. cylindrical oil-press was located, as well as the foundations of a building, of LR or Byz date, with a clay slab floor, 1.30m W of the oil press. Another oil-press was iden- tified in the vicinity. (ADelt 151) Myloi. At the entrance of the mod. town, on the national road to Tripolis, two cist graves and a pithos burial were excavated, part of an extensive cemetery which included graves from the G, HL, and R periods. (ADelt 145-6) Nauplion. An A burial pithos was located in Odos Mikras Asias, and rescue excavations in Odos Asklepiou confirmed that the whole area was obviously occupied during the Myc period. Extensive investigations of the Venetian fortification system were conducted in the wider area of the Parko Staikopoulou, in cooperation with the Byz Ephorate, with a view to creating an archaeological park including the E part of the walls. In the same area were also identified deposits of R, HL, C, A, and G date, and especially of the Myc period, very important for the history of the town of Nauplion. (ADelt 153- 5 &amp; fig. 7) In the square of the mod. Aria settlement were excavated a built funeral monument and five tombs to its E and SE, includ- ing two pit graves and a tile-roofed tomb, dating to the 5th-6th Cts AD. The Aria monastery 750m to the S was erected in AD 1149; it may previously have been located at the site of the mod. settlement. (ADelt 155-6) Palaia Epidauros. To the W of the mod. village of Palaia Epidauros, on the E slope of the Katarahi hill, at the site of the Myc chamber tomb cemetery, another row of four chamber tombs (N-S) was excavated. Among the finds in tomb 1 were nine pots dating from the LH IIIB period and a steatite seal. From tomb 2, the roof of which had collapsed, were recorded a bronze knife and 32 vessels ofLH II-IIIA date, including a Cyc jug and an amphora. The third tomb was of the same date, while the fourth dated from the LH IIIA-B1 periods. (ADelt 156-8) At the site of Nera, to the W of the mod. village of Palaia Epidauros, were investigated a looted tile-roofed tomb, con- taining three iron nails, probably part of a wooden coffin, a cist grave, and a pit grave. E of the first tomb a N-S retaining wall was discovered, while against it, to the SE, was found a makeshift rectangular stone structure of the 3rd-4th Cts AD, used for cremations (black burnt earth). (ADelt 158-9) Panariti. About 2km E of the village, at Mazi, 1-1.5km S of the Myc acropolis, a Myc chamber tomb was located, 12m NW of another recently excavated chamber tomb. The dromos, 6.75m long and 1.20-1.45m wide, was partly walled on its W side. The chamber, the roof of which had collapsed in the 5th-6th Cts AD, was of an irregular ellipsoidal shape (3.90 x 3.20m). Inside the chamber was discovered a small circular pit with bones, and there was a medium-sized skeleton in the NW area. Among the finds were 21 sard beads and 24 glass paste beads, part of a ter- racotta figurine, and a steatite whorl. The tomb was in use from the LH II to LH IIIB1 periods. (ADelt 151-2) Portitses. To the left of the road from Argos to the town of Akova, at the site of a known cemetery of the C period, a poros cist grave of the 4th Ct BC was excavated. Two HL wells were also investigated.

At the site of Vezyrorahe, to the W of the village, a substantial R retaining wall (N-S) was excavated, probably built to protect the fields from the stream waters in the vicinity. (ADelt 150) Vothiki (Tracheia). On the hill of Kastraki, near the mod. set- tlement of Vothiki, was located a rectangular altar of grey lime- stone dedicated to the hero Klaikophoros in addition to the pre- viously identified temple of Athena (inscription already pub- lished: SEG XV 210). In the vicinity were also recorded two perirrhanteria and the disturbed foundations of an anc. building. (ADelt 164-5) Zonga.

The total lengths of both the S and E walls of the E building were surveyed (Fig. 53). The walling of alternating courses of lime- stone slabs and roughly dressed boulders survives to a height of 0.80m. The E wall differs from the W wall, which rises on a 1.00m-wide levelling strip, and has a slab course which func- tions as a euthynteria or threshold, the whole forming a build- ing of rectangular ground-plan 16.30m long and 7m wide. On the W, an inner dividing wall partitions off an anteroom 5.50m x 2.80m; there is no corresponding partition in the E wall, which is apparently without any openings, so the building was open to the W, with an entrance over the slab course. As already observed in previous years, the building had suf- fered destruction, which was all the greater because of its posi- tion on the steeply sloping mountainside. In places only the lowest foundation course of boulders is preserved, which in the N lies at a depth of 1.20m. In the interior of the building, only the S area is preserved relatively undisturbed. Over the rock extends a levelling layer of green decomposition clay, on which the inner face of the S wall was erected; the clay packing was laid down at the same time as the foundations were built. A fragmentary terracotta relief of a crouching Cor sphinx of the 5th Ct came to light in the clay layer, amongst other finds. A pointer to the date of the building is given by a fluted lekythos, probably datable to the mid-4th Ct. From the layer of roof-tiles, already known from previous years, which covered the ruins of the E building after its destruction, came a fine-quality female terracotta protome with a low polos, probably of the late 6th Ct, and a fragment of a LA perirrhanterion (lustral basin) with cord and tongue decoration. Among the numerous roof-tile fragments of different types, a largely preserved kalypter of Laconian type, with black coating, deserves special mention: its dimensions match the already well-known type of antefix with double volute, of the late 6th/early 5th Ct, of which several fragments were found in the stone packing and over- lying earth layer at the N edge of the temple terrace, which contained other finds (see previous reports). The remains of this roof show that the Artemis tem- ple of ca 300 BC and the so-called E building must have had a predecessor. E of the building runs a channel cut into the exist- ing level and filled with large roof-tiles. The bottom of this channel follows the slope of the upper edge of the preserved foundations, showing that it was installed after the destruction of the building. Surveys. In the area S of the road to Sigouni, W of the sanctuary and the residential area, traces visible in the terrain of a hall and two rectangular buildings were surveyed. The hall is ca 65m long and ca 12.20m wide. A stylobate block at the SE comer shows that itl was open to the E. In the S narrow wall a double row of orthostats has survived. Discoloured patches in the soil indicate interior supports.' Tegea. Eight bronze objects stolen from the museum in 1992 were recovered in 1994. (ADelt 189) LAKONIA Alepochori. First Kouveleike cave. The results of the second season in 1994 (cf. AR 1997-98, 35) suggested extending the N sector (where the pot burial was found) and the E sector; testing the deposit in the NE sector under the fallen mass of rock; and investigation of the 'corridor'. The N sector produced the clear- est stratigraphic sequence, with coarse (and some fine) LN and FN pottery, and rich lithic finds and organic material in all eight levels; in other areas the stratigraphy had been affected by geo- logical events. A key question for future work is the relationship of this cave with the second cave, 50m away. (ADelt 835-7) The second Kouveleike cave was excavated in 1993-94. The levels in the interior of the cave have been disturbed by use until recently as an animal pen, but there was good stratigraphy in the outer trenches, indicating intensive and continuous occupation. Pottery was mainly coarse LN and FN; lithic finds indicated local working; bones were mostly of domestic animals. Again there are problems of geological disturbance. (ADelt 837-9) Amyklai. In the vicinity of the sanctuary of Alexandra- Cassandra, tombs were located, without offerings, and walls of many architectural phases. (ADelt 188) Areopolis. Kalamakia cave. The second season of Greco- French excavation in 1994 (ADelt 849-52) was summarized in AR 1994-95, 14. Collaboration continues between the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology, the Archaeology Department of the University of Athens and the French School, which provided the following short report on the excavation in 1999: 'In 1999 the excavation in Kalamakia cave was continued. The cave contains deposits dating from before 80000BP to 40000BP, which include archaeological remains of MPal.

Geraki, acropolis exposed, containing many broken up and burnt bones, stone tools and three cobblestones (pestles/grinders?). The bone remains, as on the previous surfaces, belong almost exclusively to cervina types and wild goat. The fragmented molar of a young rhinoceros was also found. The stone tools are charac- teristically Mousterian. In the lower level (top of layer III) the excavation extends to squares D5, E5, D6, E6, D7, E7, D8 and E8. Sections belong- ing to more habitation surfaces were excavated (the exact num- ber of the surfaces cannot be defined due to the extreme com- pactness of the sediments). In this layer also, the bone remains belong mainly to cervina types and wild goat. The collection of samples for laboratory analysis was continued (palynological, micromorphological, radiocarbon dating, etc).' Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). Joost Crouwel and Mieke Prent (Netherlands Institute) report on the work of the University of Amsterdam at the acropolis of Geraki in 1999: 'The fifth campaign followed two seasons of intensive sur- vey, one of trial excavations and a study season (see our pre- liminary reports in Pharos 3-6, 1995-1998). The 1999 cam- paign was dedicated to systematic excavations in two areas, both situated in a field in the NW part of the summit of the acropolis, where trial trenches had produced substantial remains of the EH II and HL periods (Fig. 54). The new results may be summarized as follows: In area I there were buildings on either side of a ca. 1.60m wide street (Fig. 55). Work concentrated on the street and a rather poorly constructed HL building on its N side, which appears to have consisted of at least five rooms and was proba- bly domestic in character. Only one room has had its full extent revealed so far, and measures ca. 4.60 x 4.50m; it had two occu- pation surfaces, each associated with several terracotta loom weights, stone tools and (incomplete) pots, including a relief bowl. This and the other rooms appear to have been abandoned at some time during the HL period, there being no traces of a fire which would point to a violent destruction. After that the walls and tiled roofs gradually collapsed. Since the HL building complex and the large number of associated finds demanded our full attention, the underlying earlier remains were only partially explored. While EH II pot- sherds were frequently encountered, no intact architecture was found. The room that was discovered in trial trench 17/11i in 1997, with a large storage vessel and the sealings and other burnt destruction material of EH II date, appeared to be much disturbed and eroded (for the sealings, see now OJA 18, 1999, 357-76). Directly to the W of the storage jar we came upon a 1.20-1.50m high bedrock ledge, which was probably used as a socle for the EH II mud-brick wall, the fallen remains of which had been found in the E half of the trial trench. The bedrock sur- face to the W of the ledge must have been the source of most of the sealings, pottery and burnt seeds discovered in 1997, finds which had been released by the collapse of the mud-brick wall. Portions of a better-built HL building were uncovered in area II. Again this seems to have been abandoned without fire, and to have gradually collapsed over time. In this area investigation of the acropolis wall continued, immediately W of test trench 17/13r, dug in 1997. In the upper layers, remains of no less than six possible retaining walls were encountered, each with their own (eroded) fills containing mostly C-HL material. In the low- est level of the excavation a large stone was found to rest on the gravelly layer covering the natural hillside. Such a position cor- responds stratigraphically to that of the three boulders discov- ered ca 2m in from the existing face of the acropolis wall in the earlier trial trench. The line of boulders, now seen to continue westwards, served as a barrier against which much destruction material of EH II date had accumulated. As for periods of occupation other than EH II and C-HL, we found mostly only scattered sherd material, particularly of MH date, in areas I and II. As before, Myc finds were notably absent.' Gounare. In the course of OTE works at the site of Sinambee, architectural remains were excavated, including two walls forming a comer, part of a stone-paved floor, other fragmentary walls, and a pear-shaped cistern. (ADelt 186) Gytheion. Parts of two R buildings, with mosaic floors and fragments of wall paintings, were excavated in Odos Kapsale and Odos Kastoros, respectively. The mosaic at the former site consisted of groups of circles, surrounded by a band which was decorated with curved triangles. Other fragmentary architectur- al remains of R date were identified at the junction of Odos Polydeukous, Apollonos and Mikras Asias, and in Odos Polyaravou. The discovery of three built graves in Odos Ermou suggests that the limits and the walls of the anc. town should be placed farther to the E. An ER rock-cut tomb was identified at the junction of Odos Agias Triados and Kalkande. (ADelt 186-7) 55. Geraki acropolis, street \ \  ~~g ~ ~ "r,"-Q ·~-.0--- °"^.. !

In the W part of the village football field, two built cist graves of R date were excavated. (ADelt 186) Kouphovouno. William Cavanagh, Christopher Mee and Josette Renard report on the first season of fieldwork, a syner- gasia between the BSA and the 5th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities (Th. Spyropoulos): 'An initial objective was to estimate the chronological span and spatial distribution of the settlement (Fig. 56, from the S). A grid measuring 250 x 250m was laid out, centered on the summit of the tell. A more intensive sampling strategy was used for the centre of the site, and extended sampling for the periph- ery. Thus 592 squares measuring 5 x 5m were sampled inten- sively. Extended sampling recorded 214 units measuring 20 x 5m (i.e. four adjacent squares). From the distribution of the artefacts it would appear that the site covers at least 5ha. Dr Neil Brodie supervised the geophysical survey. A total of 40 20 x 20m squares were tested by magnetometry. The variation in magnetic intensity was greatest in the region of the central mound. Four areas were located, probably of burnt mud-brick. Dr Alison Jones and Dr Peter James oversaw the drilling of nine cores across the main mound and beyond its edge (Fig. 57). The cores revealed archaeological horizons varying in depth from 55 to 401cm. The sediment underlying the cultural hori- zons is predominantly clay, with sand and gravel occurring as beds or lenses. Sediments exposed in the banks of the deeply incised stream N of the site were described and sampled. Volume magnetic susceptibility was measured along N-S and E- W transects and soil was sampled at 5m intervals across the site. From the field observations it appears that Kouphovouno was possibly built on the floor perhaps of a drained lake (or lake margin). If a lake, then it could well have been large, possibly occupying the breadth of the present Evrotas valley. The pottery has not yet been systematically studied, but there are indications of the main periods from MN onwards, including some LN/FN, EH, some MH and LH. Evidence of later activity in the C and more particularly the R period was evident, especially to the W of the site, where large quantities of tile suggest structures. Dr Anna Karabatsoli studied 260 of the chipped stone arte- facts: 63% was obsidian and 37% flint or chert of variable qual- ity and colour. The obsidian objects derive from all phases of debitage. Tools included retouched blades, arrow-heads and 57. Kouphovouno, drilling pieces esquillees. The flint/chert (light grey, dark grey, honey, white, brown) and chocolate-coloured jasper, are represented by numerous flakes, blades, debris and even cores. Tools made of flint include arrow-heads, denticulated blades, blades d bord abattu, scrapers; sickle elements and pieces esquillees; 44 com- plete or fragmentary polished stone axes, 21 stone hammers, 8 quers, 6 pounders, polishers, 4 grinders, 2 sling-stones, a waisted weight, a whetstone and a number of uncertain ground- stone tools were also identified in the field, as well as several terra-cotta figurines and a R coin. Jean-Pierre Renard and Claude Delhayes recorded every phase of the project on video. An educational film is planned which will illustrate archaeological work of this type.' Laconian Mani. Leda Moschou (5th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities, Sparta) continued her topographical investigations of the Eleutherolaconian poleis located in the area of the eparchies of Gytheion and Oitylon-Laconian Inner Mani. The following is a summary report of her study for the 1998-1999 session: 'The marmo rosso antico quarries at Profetes Elias: Messa Demaristika and Lagia regions, E Laconian Mani. The well- known quarries and the surrounding associated area suffered from illicit activities during the past decade; a re-examination of the whole quarries site, as well as a general survey of the adjacent rural settlements and road system were undertaken by L. Moschou and S. Raftopoulou (cf. ADelt, 189-190), while Th. Hatzitheodorou provided a large-scale map using Autocad 2000. A full account of the investigation is in the press (ADelt: Meletai: 'Lithos erythros Tainarios: ta archaia latomeia st6n</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 41 58.

The urban centre of Kaene Polis, the (New) Polis of the Taenarians, was surveyed for the production of a general topographical plan. A preliminary study of the scattered architectural spolia belonging to some of the main religious buildings was also completed; the whole area is declared an archaeological site. Work in progress includes the exploration of the urban perimeter and the topo- graphical definition of the extensive chora-a result of important synoecisms through on-going procedures of various decision- making Roman policies. Kournos-Kionia-Chalopyrgos: Nyfi and Pachianika regions, E Laconian Mani. Further work on a previous survey and architectural study (a past joint publication with architect P.N. Moschos under the titles 'Kionia A' and 'Kionia B') was carried out at the Kionia sanctuary and at the Chalopyrgos twin plateau, located SE and SW of Kionia, for the production of topographical plans. Chalopyrgos is a fortified site containing the remains of numerous buildings (Figs. 58-9); a cemetery occupies the W part of the plateau. The whole region (?Aigila: Paus. IV 17, 1; cf. sinus Aegilodes: Plin. NH IV v. 16) including the deserted mediaeval or 'palaeomaniatiko' settlement at Potamia, has been declared an archaeological site.' Lagia Manes. In the area of Mt Prophetes Elias were investi- gated the anc. Rosso Antico quarries, used from PR times to the ECh period, and even down to the present day. The preserved remains of quarrying activities date from the R period (See also above entry). (ADelt 189-90) Magoula Spartes. Isolated architectural remains, mostly of R date, were discovered in this area, including part of a drain and a mosaic floor, ca 150m SE of the Arapissa baths, as well as frag- mentary sections of floors and drains, suggesting a dense habita- tion pattern in the area of the local road between Magoula and Sparta. Near a local road NW of Magoula was investigated part of a R installation (clay slab floor, destruction layer, architectur- al members) and a section of an anc. road (NE-SW) constructed 59. Chalopyrgos in the usual manner (trodden earth, gravel, broken pottery) and provided with a terracotta water pipe; although the actual remains date from the LHL to the ER periods, the route was already used during the A and C periods (pottery). (ADelt 184) Sparta. A total of 25 rescue excavations were reported from the mod. town of Sparta, the vast majority involving architectural, mostly domestic, remains of the HL and R periods. (ADelt 171- 84 &amp; fig. 1) Substantial domestic remains were excavated in Odos Thermopylon, in the anc. township of Limnes, with the discov- ery of parts of two LHL buildings (five rooms); in the middle of the plot was located a circular rock-cut apothetes, also of LHL date. The portable finds include 15 pyramidal loom weights, and three well-preserved coins (43-31 BC). The earlier use of the area dates to the A period (pottery). Part of another HL house (walls, water pipe) of the 3rd Ct BC, was identified in a plot by the SE slope of the anc. acropolis (Provia plot: Fig. 60) and on the Evangelistria hill (wall, well) which was apparently inhabited during the 3rd-2nd Cts BC. In Odos Chamaretou was located the atrium of a R villa which had a garden, flower beds and possibly a central water fountain, as well as a mosaic floor with the usual geometric motifs, enriched by figured representations such as dolphins and Medusa heads, attributed to a 3rd-Ct AD workshop. The remains of a substantial R villa (atrium with impluvium) to which may also belong the bath-house recorded to the N, were discovered in Odos Lykourgou. Remains of a mosaic floor dec- oration were preserved, arranged in zones, with geometric motifs and representations of sea life. On Odos Kallikratide, on the borders between the mod. town and Magoula, in the anc. township of Pitane, very close to the acropolis of Sparta, part of a building complex was investigat- ed, with three architectural phases, ranging from the 1St Ct BC/1St Ct AD to LR/ECh times. The building yielded 86 coins, the majority of which date from the late 1St Ct BC/early 1St Ct AD, and a small intact marble shield (diam. 14.5cm) also a miniature copy of the Athena Parthenos shield, dating from the middle Imperial period. Near the SE slope of the anc. acropolis (Provia plot) were recorded the remains of a R house (2nd-3rd Cts AD), disturbed by two substantial and long-lasting Byz</page><page sequence="40">42 DAVID BLACKMAN 60. Sparta (Limnes), acropolis buildings (7th_9th Cts AD). The house, which was destroyed by fire, yielded 3rd-Ct AD pottery of very good quality, and frag- ments of wall paintings. Remains of two more R villas were identified in the course of mod. drainage works. One of those buildings was provided with an atrium, lined with stone slabs and decorated with a mosaic floor, attributed to a 3rd-4th Ct AD local workshop. Isolated architectural remains, mostly of late date, such as fragmentary sections of walls, and floors, some decorated with mosaics, were recorded in a number of locations within the mod. town (Odos Theodorakopoulou, Parodos Odou Agidos, junction of Odos Kleombrotou and Vrasidou). Remains of drains and bath installations, mostly of R date, were also quite common. In the course of OTE works in Odos Herakleidon, part of a R bath-house was discovered, probably associated with the bath complex located to the N. Part of another, very well-preserved R bath installation was investigat- ed in Odos Platanista, including the SE corer of a room with a hypocaust. The remains are associated with a complex of pub- lic baths already discovered in the area (ADelt 1965, 1966). In Odos A. Kapetanea were excavated the remains of another R bath installation, probably part of an urban villa. Finally, in Odos Dioskouron, the outline was recorded of a well-preserved rectangular bath-house of R date. It consisted of small rectan- gular or square rooms, and was surrounded by a network of drains. Among the finds were part of a marble club, probably belonging to a Heracles statue, and two terracotta horse fig- urines. The extant coins date the use of the building to the years 284-324 AD. Isolated sections of drains were located in various parts of the mod. town (Odos Mones Pantanasses, Odos Theodorakopoulou, junction of Odos Thermopylon and Leonidou, junction of Odos Herakleidon and Platanista). In the Papatheophilopoulou plot, within the archaeological zone, part of a LHL workshop complex was excavated, con- sisting of plastered walls, forming regular square spaces, which contained a number of large pithoi, discovered in situ. The workshop was apparently using some kind of liquid, which was collected in the pithoi. In the Groumbou plot were investigated the remains of an extensive LR workshop complex, extending into the neighbouring plot. The main structure was a large hall, entered from the S, the roof of which was supported by a cen- tral built pier. To its S was found a small cistern, from which the water, of great importance to the functioning of the workshop, was channelled directly to another cistern inside the hall. Within the latter were recorded parts of a large cylindrical plaster struc- ture against the N wall, while in the E part of the area a con- centrated pile of ash was found, within a stone enclosure. In the middle of the workshop, near the central pier, the lower part of a large pithos was recorded, apparently originally supported on a wooden base. To the N of the workshop were located ditches and drains, channelling water to the W part of the building, as well as a series of structures, a small kiln, and a basin, to the NE. The area continued to be used as a workshop after the destruction of the building (Byz kiln), while earlier deposits tes- tify to the use of the area during the PR, G, C and HL periods (pottery). Remains of anc. roads were identified in a number of plots. On Odos Leonidou part of a R road was excavated, constructed of trodden earth, gravel and broken pottery, with four succes- sive road surfaces. The road was lined on the W by a built drain, while a terracotta water-pipe, running in the same direction, was found inside the latest road surface; four other drains, associat- ed with the other road surfaces, were also recorded. Another anc. road (NE-SW) was located in Odos Kallikratide, which was used continuously from LHL to ECh times (five phases). The anc. road surfaces were here too con- structed of trodden earth, mixed with gravel and broken pottery. In R times the road was crossed by a multitude of terracotta drains, a fact which suggests a highly developed water supply system for the R town. On the second road surface, traces of two wheel marks were identified, which suggests that this was a busy thoroughfare of anc. Sparta. If extended ca 500m to the NE, it stopped at the W edge of the anc. theatre. The funerary remains found include the identification of the extensive R cemetery, in the area of the exit of the mod. town, towards Mystras (isolated tombs, small funerary struc- tures) and a two-storey HL family tomb, with an ossuary in the upper part, on Odos Triakosion. Evrotas Valley. A geoarchaeological survey was undertaken of the Evrotas Valley by R. Pope (University of Sunderland) and K. Wilkinson (King Alfred's College, Winchester) in the second season of a three-year project to reconstruct the deposi- tional history of the valley and to relate depositional events to human activity. The study area corresponds to the fans emanat- ing from Taygetos on the W side and an area on the E valley side between Aphyssou and the Menelaion. The 1999 season demonstrated that the fan systems in the W of the basin contain suitable material for luminescence dating, while providing proxy evidence for later Pleistocene climate change and human agricultural activity. Two main types of deposit exist: fluvial or debris flow gravels, indicative of high energy processes (e.g. intense storms), and fine-grained deposits suggestive of overbank flooding. On the E side of the valley an area was surveyed between Aphyssou and the Menelaion. The Laconia Survey and follow-up projects have identified C and R sites in this locality, and it was apparent from the areas examined by the 1999 survey that many of the sedi- mentary beds contained large numbers of artefacts. The data collected also suggested that the Evrotas has cut downwards through its bed since the R period, leaving sites that were once on the floodplain high and dry.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 43 Trapezonde. A relatively roughly built structure, probably some type of workshop of historical date (pottery) 300m E of the national road from Sparta to Gytheion, consisted of a spa- cious court and a small room within its SW corer, inside which were recorded stones of volcanic rock. (ADelt 187-8) Tsakona. Dr H.W. Catling (BSA) reports on the 1999 study season: 'In 1989, at the end of the Tsakona excavation season, the inventoried finds were deposited in the Sparta museum, pottery and roof-tile being stored in Aphyssou. It will be recalled that the excavation was in the nature of a rescue, and it was recognized that the material would not be studied immediately. During sub- sequent Menelaion study seasons in Aphyssou, it was possible to begin to examine the roof-tile (of which there were great amounts) and the rather poor sets of pottery. The material in the Sparta Museum remained unchecked. Further, the congestion in the apothetes and courtyard area in the Sparta Museum had, until this year, been a positive disincentive to working on this materi- al; but thanks to much reorganization there it has proved possible for us this year to go a long way towards examining the contents of the 30 boxes in which our 1989 material has been stored. At Aphyssou, we have finally completed cleaning, sorting and listing the many discrete sets of roof-tile recovered during the excavation of buildings I and II. While a great deal has been thrown, a representative residue has been retained, and has been boxed in final form. A very large deposit of tile, apparently from the main destruction of building I, the shrine itself, has been strewn, and, where possible, mended. This has revealed some surprising details about the final form of the building we found. Some useful observations have been possible concerning cover tiles and ridge tiles. There is a very marked contrast between the roofing of buildings I and II. In the Museum, we have checked nearly all the inventoried material, with the important exception of the ca 2,500 terra- cotta statuettes, of which we have only had time to examine under half. But what we have seen of this material enables me to refine the rather rough and ready account which I gave pre- viously (BSA 85, 1990, 15-35; Lak. Spoud. 10, 1990, 276-95). It remains true that the huge majority of the terracottas are handmade figures (more or less grotesque in execution) of squatting men clasping a grossly enlarged phallus in one, or both arms. No two are exactly alike, and there is a great variety of style, as though numerous individuals were responsible for making these figures. Many have simian features. A smaller category comprises 'columnar' handmade figures, of uncertain gender, usually with both arms upraised-never phallic. There is a small number of such figures standing in front of a ?basin on a pedestal (these originally reminded me of the Boeotian bread-makers, but I think the comparison was mis- leading). There are more 'bread-makers' than I originally appre- ciated, and at least one standing figure with an animal tucked under his left arm. There are also more female figures than I supposed, and while I originally interpreted these figures as 'in parturition', I now think this was mistaken. A minority of these females have swollen abdomens, and are evidently pregnant, but a majority are portrayed with splayed legs and prominent genitalia. There is a very small number of mould-made figures, nearly all extremely fragmentary, of types similar to some of the late standing draped figures familiar from the Menelaion. There are at least two 'horse-and-rider' figures, of which hundreds were found at the Melenaion. There are several very distinctive mould-made heads (all of different types) some A in style, some later, and all, I suspect, explicable as affixes. I associate directly with the sexually explicit statuettes another standard class of offering-a miniature vase whose rela- tionship with round aryballoi is clear (and the round aryballos, with flat or raised base, seems to have been a standard offering). These miniatures (of which we have very many, complete or fragmentary) have minute receptacles. I am also inclined to attribute to the sanctuary's central purpose a group of small bronze tools which I am calling 'scalpels', which we at first thought were fragmentary fibulae-damaged catchplate and part of bow. They are in fact tiny knives, which when new must have had very sharp edges; of no other class of bronze object did we find so many examples. I see two distinct types of activity at the Tsakona shrine, but because of the state in which we found the site, it is very diffi- cult to decide whether they are contemporary. The first seems to be a standard cult directed to a male deity, with offerings of weapons (spears, arrows) shields (facings, fittings) an athletic dedication (marble halter and a modest amount of pottery- standard-size aryballoi, stemless bg cups). The second was con- cerned with potency and generation, seemingly at a practical rather than abstract level-very large numbers of handmade ter- racotta statuettes of males (all, to a greater or lesser degree car- icatures of men, some with baboon-like features) crouching or squatting on their haunches, clasping their oversize phalloi sometimes in one arm, sometimes in both, sometimes 'saluting' with the free arm. Many are plain, others are bg. There are also several handmade naked females, with spread legs, non-preg- nant. Add to these figures the fine 'aryballoi', and the bronze 'scalpels', and one seems to discern something akin to a fertili- ty clinic. Whatever the role of the shrine, it seems to have come to its end in EHL times, if no earlier. Activity of some kind resumed in the 3rd-4th Ct AD (the date of many mould-made lamp frag- ments in and around an apothete at the E end of the original shrine). I suspect now that at this date the E half of the building was piled up into some semblance of its former self, and that it was 'roofed' with a job-lot of bits and pieces of the old tiles left lying around the site-this would explain the extremely scrappy character of the roof remains in grid square G. 10, which we have examined with some care during this last study. I have in mind to offer a short paper to BSA in which I would give corrections to my original article, and summarize what is new concerning the site in the light of this year's work. It is like- ly to be some time before a full account can be published of all the material, and such addenda et corrigenda could be of use.' ACHAIA Aigeira. Archaeological fieldwork in 1999 carried out under the direction of Georg Ladstatter of the Austrian Institute included continuation of the excavation in the 'Solon' plot NW of the acropolis, and of the survey of the water supply and the start of a geological survey. He reports: 'Excavation in the 'Solon' plot: in the framework of excava- tion of residential areas, an E/W strip of ca 20 x 10m was stud- ied in eight sections, immediately S of the 1998 excavation (AR 1998-99, 36). Eight rooms were found, with floors and walls variously preserved to a height of up to 0.80m. Most revealing was an almost square andron (side ca 6.60m); of its furniture and decoration there survived parts of the surrounding klinai and a central pebble mosaic floor. A rectangular room(4.60 x 2.70m) to the W clearly contained water (depression in NW comer lined</page><page sequence="42">44 DAVID BLACKMAN 61. Aigeira, house, mosaic floor with hydraulic mortar); six further rooms of subordinate func- tion were annexed to W, S and E, but the exact plan of the house remains uncertain. Evaluation of the house is however already possible on the basis of the form and quality of the mosaic (Fig. 61): within a square field (side ca 5m) are two concentric rhomboi producing four triangles, a surrounding band and a central panel. The tri- angles have rich decoration of palmettes and tendrils; the sur- rounding band has a frieze of griffins and panthers; and the cen- tral panel a massive animal. The mosaic has parallels in Sikyon, Corinth and Eretria, indicating a 4th- Ct BC date. Since the stratigraphic sequence is badly disturbed by recent viticulture, the main dating evidence for the completion of the building is the mosaic; so far only slight evidence of earlier and later walling has been found. The 'Solon terrace' thus has a residential area in the 4th Ct, a period previously hardly attested at Aigeira. The house has pretensions, with its fine mosaic and andron with 11 klinai. Its position on a terrace close to the acropolis conforms complete- ly to the model of HL palatial buildings and it may have been the residence of the local potentate. Survey of the water supply: work continued on discovering further conduits and the supply was assessed from the hydroge- ological point of view. A 25m length of canal-type conduit was studied ca 150m S of the theatre; its type of construction and level suggest a link with the LR-Byz system, already attested in various places. We may conclude that the city's water supply was ensured continuously from pre-HL to LR times by long conduits coming a number of kilometres from the S. The first results of the geological survey agree with this: a thin gravel layer, cemented to conglomerate overlying deep layers of marl, is not suitable for direct water supply from springs or wells. The nearest usable water source for the settlement area is a spring up the valley, which was opened up with galleries; from there the conduit systems previously known brought water to the city. Geological survey: this new project plans to study, besides hydrogeology, the subsoil, possible changes in the terrain due to erosion and/or seismic activity in or after antiquity, and raw material sources for local pottery production.' Aigion. The remains of a HL workshop, including sections of walls, part of a mosaic floor, many loom-weights and much pot- tery, were uncovered in Odos Soliote. Three cist graves of HL date were excavated in Odos Platonos and Odos Staphidalonon; one of the two tombs on the latter site, dating from the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC, contained among other things a gold ring ending in lynx heads, and a pyramidal earring decorated with filigree. Finally, _ eight tile-roofed graves of R date were excavated in Odos Pammegiston Taxiarchon and in Odos Soliote. (ADelt 236-7) Museum. The new local museum was inaugu- rated on 6/8/94, in a neo-classical building. In the museum are exhibited finds from the towns of anc. Aigialeia, Aigion, Keryneia, Rypes, Aigeira, Voura, Elike and other small anc. settlements, arranged chronologically. (ADelt 206-7) Ambelos Aigialeias. At the site of Grasidotopia substantial remains were investigated of a fortifica- tion wall, continuing to the SSW and including two square towers. The wall, 4.55m thick, consisted of two built faces, with earth between, a mud-brick superstructure, and a tile roof. It is one of the rare survivals of a mud-brick superstructure on the mainland; 200m seawards was located the quarry, from which the stones for the fortification walls were extracted. (ADelt 238-9) Chalandritsa. A further chamber tomb was identified in the Myc cemetery at the site of Agios Vasileios. (ADelt 234; cf. AR 1998-99, 36-7) Helike. The report on the 1994 season (ADelt 239-40, 251-3) was given in AR 1994-95, 16-17. Kallithea Patron. Four new Myc chamber tombs were investi- gated this year by A. Papadopoulos. They were similar to the ones excavated in the past, i.e. with short down-sloping dromoi, low entrances built with dry stone walls, and medium-sized chambers, rectangular or apsidal, the roofs of which had col- lapsed; only two of the four tombs contained successive burials. The first (XV) contained a total of 13 burials, accompanied by a few vases, spindle-whorls, and necklaces (glass paste, faience, bronze). In the second tomb (XVI) was originally buried a cou- ple, and later nine more individuals, accompanied by eight vases, a spear-head, a knife and a few beads. The third tomb (XVII) the largest of all, contained only two burials, and was probably soon abandoned after the collapse of the roof. All the funerary offerings, belonging to a total of 28 burials, can be dated to the LH IIIB-IIIC period. It seems that the cemetery belonged to a settlement, located to its E. (Ergon 1999, 40-4) Kato Achaia. On Odos Giannopoulou, fragmentary walls with successive construction phases, fragments of large storage pithoi, worked iron fragments and an early circular structure, probably a metal kiln, suggest the presence of an iron workshop in the vicinity. During mod. construction work in Odos Fleming, architectural remains of a HL building were recorded, including walls, thresholds and traces of a white pebble floor. (ADelt 236) Krene. Mod. construction work in the area of Zoitada led to the discovery of three Myc chamber tombs, all part of the known Myc cemetery at the site of Agios Konstantinos (cf. AR 1997- 98, 41). The two larger tombs (NE-SW) had a dromos to the SW of their circular chambers and a tholoid roof. The smaller third tomb lacked a dromos, had a horseshoe-shaped plan, and was found empty. In the centre of the chamber of tomb 1 were</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 45 ., * !K,.:. ~ ,. . * l^ ss. **'*' - &lt; _ KABANC ' 1 `"^£^ ^-----·· ^ .. --fi _;_ , * kN xa , ,'i .'

Paliourgias site recorded two huge, roughly rectangular blocks, set in a row; they were probably found by the Mycenaeans in the bedrock, during construction work for the tomb, and being unable to move them outside, they placed them in a pit, in their present position. In tomb 2, skeletal material and funeral offerings of earlier burials had been placed on a platform 35cm above the floor of the chamber. Both tombs date from the LH IIIA1-IIIC periods (pottery). (ADelt 234-6) Paralia Patron. Remains of a substantial R farm complex, apparently part of a larger group of farms located in the area, were uncovered at the site of Paliourgias (Fig. 62). In the ESE part of the site one cist and seven tile-roofed graves were exca- vated. To the S of these burials were discovered the architectur- al remains of the large rural establishment, including substantial wall foundations, storage pithoi and part of a large square cis- tern to the S, lined with waterproof plaster. At the centre of the surviving complex was found a wine press, consisting of two cisterns/basins, at two different levels. In the ENE part of the building the remains of a pottery kiln were investigated, and also a quantity of raw material (clay). The complex, of the sub- urban villa type, was probably built along the road leading from Patras to anc. Dyme. It seems that rural establishments were originally built along existing roads, while new, smaller roads were subsequently laid out to connect them with each other. Judging by the surviving coins, the site was continuously occu- pied for three centuries (1 t-4th Cts AD). The space between the kiln and the cistern was later used as a cemetery (10 tile-roofed graves). (ADelt 231-2) Patras. Twenty-nine rescue excavations were reported in the mod. town and its surrounding area, involving architectural remains of both domestic/public and funerary character, chiefly of R date. Architectural remains of HL date were uncovered in Odos Charalambe, and at the junction of Odos Gounare and Rouphou, in both cases parts of domestic buildings. Remains of a monumental public building, consisting of a number of substantial walls, an arched entrance and part of a stone paved floor surrounding a podium, probably part of the R agora, were uncovered in Odos Londou, E of the Pantocrator church (Fig. 63). At the junction of Odos Vlachou and Sachtoure, part of a stone-paved R road (N-S) lined with buildings was investigated (Fig. 64). On the paved surface of the road, which was 2.50m wide (5m, including the pavements) traces of wheel marks were preserved, an indication of its frequent use; along its E side ran a drain. It is probably the same road recorded to the N, which continued in use to the end of the 4th Ct AD (coins). Architectural remains to the W of the road belong to a R house, with an atri- um/cister, and three architectural phases (ER-LR). Other such remains lie to the E of the road. Both sides of the road were occu- pied by houses until the Byz period, while habitation in the area goes back to EHL times (pottery). Part of another R house, including a cistern to its N, was recorded in Odos Tsamadou. In Odos Boukaoure, to the E of the E Gate of the Kastro, were excavated the main rooms of a R building, founded on ear- lier HL walls. The resulting plan includes small parts of rooms grouped around a large central rectangular atrium, provided with a mosaic floor (geometric motifs, paralleled from the early </page><page sequence="44">46 DAVID BLACKMAN 64. Patras, Roman road 2nd Ct AD to the Ch period) and a marble-lined cistern to the W. The preserved walls were built in the usual R masonry systems (opus quasi reticulatum, opus testaceum). Three Ch graves tes- tify to the use of the area during the Byz period. At the junction of Odos Londou and Karatza, successive remains of the Byz (three apothetes, a grave and part of a mosa- ic floor), LR (architectural members) and LHL periods (walls, pottery) were excavated, while at the junction of Odos Pantokratoros and Agiou Demetriou were uncovered architec- tural remains of R and LR date, including sections of walls, a marble-lined cistern, and a drain to its W, all parts of the atrium of a R building; the area continued to be used during the Byz period. Isolated remains of R walls, including a small section of a mosaic floor and a drain, were recorded in Odos Aiolou. In Odos Vyronos a monumental complex had already appeared in 1992, directly associated with the large LR bath- house investigated in 1975 to the N (ADelt 1975, 99-100). A hypostyle hall was uncovered (14 x 5.20m) with stone-lined walls, running N-S, which has been identified as the continua- tion of the peristyle court of the bath-house; on the surviving stylobate are preserved the base of one column, and traces of the bases of five more. At the S end of the hall was recorded a monumental entrance, while to its W lies a large semicircular room, floored with irregular pieces of marble slabs. A similar room was excavated in 1980 to the N (ADelt 1980, 179). The entire area was provided with an extensive drainage system, leading to a central drain to the N (ADelt 1982, 142). Sections of R roads were uncovered in Odos Gounare and in Odos A. Ypselandou. In the former was found part of a stone- paved road (2m wide) running E-W, the continuation of which has been located in Plateia Omonoias; a drain ran along its cen- tral axis. To the S of the road were identified fragmentary walls, floors and drains of the LR period. Finally, in Odos Ypselandou a 10.40m section of a stone-paved R road was excavated (NE- SW) 3.85m in width, parts of which have been also located in other areas of the mod. town. Below this road were found the remains of another road, with a gravel surface only 65cm in width, associated with a drain to the W. The successive use of the area to the W of the stone- paved road resulted in the poor preservation of the architectural remains, which included sections of walls, a built cistern coated with waterproof plaster, and a drain associated with it. The discovery of frag- ments of vitrified clay, a number of bone and glass objects, as well as quantities of iron and bronze in the area to the E of the cistern, suggests that it was used as a workshop. The earlier use of the space dates to the 2nd Ct BC. Sections of the N cemetery of R Patras, were i ° located in a number of plots. Four tile-roofed graves were excavated in Odos Poukevil. The corer of a funeral peribolos containing six tile-roofed graves, three cremation pots, one pyre, and traces of anoth- er, were investigated at the junction of Odos Kephallenias and Naumachias Elles. On Odos Thermopylon part of a stone-paved funeral road (N- S) was uncovered, the surface of which preserved traces of wheel marks. At the SE end of the road was found a TT-shaped funeral peribolos, which contin- ued to the S and contained two burials, with a third one E of the road. Another part of the N cemetery was excavated to the W of a gravel road, running N- S. In the area were uncovered part of a funeral peri- bolos and two funeral buildings, against its SW cor- ner and its E edge respectively. In the space between the two buildings were recorded a number of tile-roofed graves of LR date and two pithos burials. To an earlier R phase belongs a number of cist graves; among the finds were 17 bronze coins. The area continued to be used during the Byz period. A section of the S cemetery was uncovered at the junction of Odos E. Venizelou and Ag. Saranda, 2km S of the mod. town. During rescue excavations parts of two funeral periboloi were investigated, with a total of 17 tombs: 11 tile-roofed graves and six built cists. In the S part of the plot was located the S contin- uation of the gravel funerary road, excavated in a neighbouring plot in the past (ADelt 39, 96). To the S of the periboloi were recorded the remains of a HL building, probably a farm, con- sidering the distance of the area from the anc. town. Finally, part of a funeral peribolos belonging to the S cemetery was revealed in Odos Mesolongiou. In the periphery of the mod. town excavations uncovered architectural remains of the R period, including a section of a drain, a pithos and part of a farm in the Exo Agyia area, as well as a section of the R aqueduct of the anc. town, in Odos Gerokomeiou. At Kato Sychaina extensive deposits of the Myc period were excavated for the first time, probably the site of an important new Myc settlement. Until now only C, HL, R and LR remains were recorded in the area. (ADelt 207-27) Patras province. Identification is made of the Paulocastrum, the fortified Frankish site built between 1391 and 1408, now at the site of Pavlokastro-Thea. Ruined walls reach 2.5m, and a small single-aisle chapel exists on the N side. (ADelt 259) Investigation of the area around the settlement of Charadros (formerly Velvitsi) found ruins of an EByz basilica with ruined mosaic floor at the Spilia or Varkos site, and evi- dence for R building, including 6th-Ct AD fine ware. The church of Agios Nikolaos in the village contains R and LR spo- lia. (ADelt 259-60)</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 47 Petroto (Valatouna). In the course of the coopera- B tive project on the topography of anc. Achaea, being carried out by the Ephoraate and the National Research Centre, two recently looted Myc chamber &gt; tombs were identified, at the site of Marathia or Skondreika. To the W of the cemetery were reported traces of an anc. settlement, which was also probably of Myc date, given its proximity to the other Myc cemetery at the N foot of Koukoure hill. This would be the second Myc settlement in the area, after the one on Mygdalia hill to the W. (ADelt 231) 350 Portes. At the site of Kephalovryso rescue excava- tions were conducted in the PR cemetery located the previous year (AR 1998-99, 41). The cemetery lies on a low hill at the S foot of Mt Skollis. On the flat top of the hill were investigated two rows of built cist graves, the first row including rock-cut tombs, two lined with upright slabs and three with built sides; the latter also had an opening on one narrow side, which had been blocked by a wall. One of the 65. Voud4 burials was accompanied by a steatite seal and a gold plaque of the LH IIIA-B period. The three graves with built sides should be probably dated to the MH III period or the transitional period (MH/LH). The second row, at the W edge of the hill, included three graves cut in a soft earth deposit and lined with large upright slabs, while narrow walls fill the gaps left by the slabs; they date to the LH period. Finally, two chamber tombs were investigated in the W slope of the hill, one with a short dromos and a small circular chamber, the other, fur- ther N, also with a circular chamber. The second tomb can be dated to the LH IIIA-C period. (ADelt 230-1) Voudene. Investigations in the extensive Myc chamber tomb cemetery at the site of Amygdalia (cf. AR 1998-99, 41) resulted in the excavation of a total of 11 tombs on the SW part of the slope (Fig. 65) with circular (6) or rectangular (5) chambers, and tholoid or vaulted roofs; in one case (Tomb 34) a small side chamber was cut into the E side of the dromos. The recorded finds included the usual mixture of pottery, clay or stone spin- dle-whorls, stone seals, stone beads, fragments of boar's tusk helmets, and objects in bronze and ivory. (ADelt 227- 30) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA Chalkis. In the summer of 1999, the Greek-Danish archaeolog- ical cooperation project in Aetolian Chalkis carried out its fifth campaign under the direction of Soren Dietz and Lazaros Kolonas. Soren Dietz and Sanne Houby-Nielsen give the fol- lowing report: 'On the SE side of Hagia Triada hill, excavation was com- pleted of trenches 026 and 027 in the area with the so-called 'HL buildings'. Here were excavated the collapsed roofs con- sisting of tiles in the Laconian system, found in situ in 1998, revealing among other things a large number of Aetolian League coins. In a new trench, opened alongside trench T6NA, yet another collapsed roof was found, similar to that just described. A clay structure which partly covered one of the foundation walls of the rooms is preliminarily interpreted as stemming from a phase of secondary use of the HL buildings, in which the fallen tile roofs were crushed and mixed with clay to form a substance useful for making floors and similar sur- faces. The structure rested on a thin PR layer lying directly on ene site the bedrock. In the trenches on the N side of the hill, a road approximate- ly 4m wide was uncovered, between two substantial C ashlar walls, which ran at right angles to finely stuccoed house-walls. The latest of its pavements consists of slabstones dating to the early 5th Ct, beneath which a succession of hard-packed earth- floors with crushed pottery dating from the A period came to light. House-walls excavated N of the road predate the ashlar walls, and lie at right angles to the A road. In three trenches opened on the W slope of the hill, two dis- tinct phases and usages were revealed. In K26, two large cist- graves oriented E-W were uncovered lying parallel to each other 0.5m apart (Fig. 66, from E). Only the lowest courses of the northernmost grave were preserved and it was accordingly empty. The southern grave, however, was well-preserved (inte- rior 1.50 x 0.80m) and built of nicely dressed grey limestone blocks on three sides. One large slabstone forming a kind of entrance made up its E end, and two slabstones formed a roof. The tomb contained three skeletons: one was well-preserved (tentatively identified as that of a young man), lying in the supine position facing E with a coin-imitation on his mouth and his head resting on a tile fragment; a group of tiny bronze sheet rings, perhaps eyelet-frames from shoes, lay scattered near his feet. A large jug, several drinking cups of the Cantharos-type, 66. Chalkis, cist graves</page><page sequence="46">48 DAVID BLACKMAN bowls and a lamp were placed along the S wall of the grave and most probably belong to this burial. Two skeletons from earlier burials had been shoved aside in the NW corner. Amongst this mass of bones, a large number of grave-goods were found, con- sisting of drinking-, eating- and pouring-vases, a lamp, three terracottas, a bronze mirror and a small number of terracotta pearls covered with gold foil. According to the finds, the buri- als belong in the last quarter of the 4th Ct or the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. A hard-packed pebble floor, lined by a foundation wall in drystone technique, ran along the W end of the graves in a roughly N-S direction and is tentatively interpreted as a street lined by a wall, perhaps a peribolos wall. The area W of this wall was excavated to a depth of approximately im. At the level of the lowest course of the wall, a paved area and a series of paral- lel foundation walls placed at regular intervals to each other were found; these are provisionally dated to the 7th Ct BC.' Naupaktos. Substantial remains of a MH settlement were investigated on a hill to the N of the main mod. road to Itea (Bakatsa plot). The architectural remains include a stone struc- ture running N-S, the comer of a building and part of a floor. The remains of another MH settlement were located in Odos Pausaniou, at Kephalovryso, in the NE part of the mod. town, including foundations of walls, part of a stone-paved floor, with an oval construction, probably a tomb, below the floor in its NW corer, and many portable finds (a large quantity of hand- made pottery, stone tools, flint). The settlement probably origi- nally extended as far as the hill, but has now been totally erod- ed. Remains of an important ellipsoidal MH building (pottery) were investigated in Parodos Asklepiou, at the site of Limne, 200m E of the above-mentioned MH settlement on the W slope of Agios Georgios hill. At the junction of Odos Pharmake and Vardakoula, a sub- stantial part of at least one HL house was recorded, while a sec- ond, less well constructed building, extended to the N. The HL house included an open-air court, with a porch on the N side, a mosaic floor and a built well to the W. In the same building were also found sections of two large drains, containing frag- ments of moulds for the production of relief skyphoi. In the area of the W slope of Agios Georgios hill important remains of various periods were investigated, and especially part of the HL cemetery of the anc. town, including a total of 10 tombs (pits, tile-roofed graves, built cist graves). Parts of rec- tangular buildings in the area belong to the C period, while Pre- Myc structures, pottery and stone tools were also located in the vicinity. This was the first time that traces of a PR settlement were identified in the area. In Odos Psarrou excavations revealed fragmentary architec- tural remains of HL, LR and Byz date, while in Odos Nymphon, part of LR/ECh cemetery was uncovered, including a section of a monumental funeral monument, unique at Naupaktos. The brick-built burial chamber was subterranean, with a vaulted roof; the entrance was on the S. Over this chamber lay a ground-floor room, probably used for funerary rituals. The remaining 20 tombs in the cemetery were arranged in two lines and consisted of four different types: simple pits, pits with stone-built sides, tile-roofed and built cist graves. Four of the tombs were originally surrounded by a funerary peribolos. It seems that this part of the town was first used for burials in this period. (ADelt 243-6) Spathare Lepenous. The continuation of the rescue excavation of the foundations of the A temple, at the site of Spathare, 6km W of Stratos, involved uncovering the entire temple founda- tions and fully excavating the interior of the building. The tem- ple, the original phase of which dates back to the A period (HL repairs), consisted of a pronaos, a cella and an opisthodomos. While the base of the temple platform, the toichobate and the lower part of the walls were of local limestone, the superstruc- ture was of mud-brick. The roof was covered with Cor type roof-tiles. (ADelt 242) Stamna. Excavations at the sites of Phouroi and Tragana brought to light isolated sections of a PG and G cemetery, the existence of which was known from earlier investigations in the area. A total of 32 tombs was uncovered, some in rows. They included 9 large pithos burials, 9 cist graves, and 14 pot burials. To the S of one row of pithos burials was a unique stone-built funerary monument, of ellipsoidal shape. Against its E side was found a bench-like structure, while its floor was stone-paved; it contained four burials (three cremations, one inhumation). (ADelt 242-3) Stratos. The systematic excavation of anc. Stratos was contin- ued, with the discovery of the foundations of two Byz houses in the S part of the agora, and the foundations for a square podium and sections of a pebble floor in the N part of the W stoa. In the area of the E parodos of the theatre, the S face of the retaining wall E of the koilon was uncovered, as well as the N face of the rock-cut ramp to the roof of the stage building. (ADelt 242) The continuation of the systematic survey of the Stratos area (the districts of Stratos, Sphena, Lepenous and Ochthia) by the 6th Ephorate, in cooperation with the DAI and the Universities of Freiburg, Miinster and Heidelberg, found traces of settlement, ranging in date from the PR period to the 19th Ct AD. (ADelt 242) Thermon. The excavation of the temple of Apollo, by I. Papapostolou, has been completed, and the current investiga- tions involve the clarification of chronological queries, espe- cially those associated with the relation of megaron B with the so-called elliptical stoa, and with the later use of the area down to the A period. The excavator has concluded that the small Myc settlement in the area was destroyed during the 12th Ct BC, after which the inhabitants levelled the site and erected megaron B (PG/EG); the area along its W side was paved with stones, some of which are preserved. The destruction of megaron B occurred during the G period, and was followed by the burial of part of the W wall. After the levelling of the area, the slabs, which were until now considered to be the bases for an elliptical wooden stoa, were laid down. The suggested activities in the area (sacrifices) resulted in the hardening of the ground, and in the accumulation of a layer of black earth. Within this black layer was construct- ed, during the A period, the W part of the cella of the Apollo temple, below which was revealed a new section of the wall of megaron B. (Ergon 1999, 61-5) Vomvokou. To the N of the village primary school were locat- ed remains of an anc. settlement, probably related to a cemetery identified to the SW, at the sites of Aelorema and Marmara. (ADelt 246-7) Traces (pottery) of a new anc. settlement of C-HL date were identified at the site of Panagia on Vonitsa Bay, while remains of another settlement and cemetery, of HL date, were identified at the sites of Marmara and Stroggylovouni, W of Kambos.

Ancient remains were located in the sea in 1994 by the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (A. Simossi). (ADelt 853) Peratata. About lkm SE of the Med castle of Agios Georgios is the church of the Panagia Eleousa, a large rectangular build- ing (17.30 x 8.85m) with a rectangular sanctuary ca 5.25m wide and projecting 4.60m. Remains of wall-paintings include a much-damaged Annunciation. The church bears traces of Latin influence in its architectural details (narrow, single-lobed win- dows) and should be placed among the 13th-Ct monuments of Frankish Greece. (ADelt 262) Phiskardo. This year the excavation of the R cemetery was continued, with the investigation of funerary peribolos 2 and of the area to the SW of peribolos 1. The former apparently had a stone-paved floor and was used for a long time, until the end of the R period, when its importance waned. In the space to the SW of peribolos 1, five tombs were excavated, including three built cists. The two remaining graves were similar to the vault- ed type of tomb, with two built steps and a small entrance on the SE and SW narrow sides, respectively; outside the S corner of one of the tombs was found a small podium. Both tombs had a stone-paved floor. Another interesting feature of this cemetery was the presence of large domestic-type vases, placed either inside or outside the graves, and probably serving funerary rit- ual purposes. The funerary offerings were on the whole quite rich (lamps, bronze coins, glass and clay vases, beads, gold jewellery). (ADelt 249-50) Poros. Drakaina Cave (SE coast). Rescue by the Ephorate of Spelaeology was carried out in 1992 after reports of illegal excavation. Sealed under later rock fall and archaeologically sterile layers were found levels with pottery of the later 6th/early 5th Ct (and a little later, mainly HL pottery, down to at least the early 2nd Ct BC). The earlier pottery, mainly fine Cor, Attic and local, clearly indicates cult. In the deeper trenches EBI-II and LNII levels were reached (pottery, stone tools and by-products, organic residues): clear evidence of permanent or seasonal set- tlement. In 1994 one area of excavation contained a large refuse pit of the late 4th Ct/early 3rd Ct; the other revealed, under a sterile level, a stratigraphic sequence of FN/LNII, early and late, the upper level containing a small amount of early EB pot- tery, mainly EHII; below was a LNI level. C14 dates from FN/LNII levels were (calibrated) 3781-3693 BC or 3900-3646 BC and 4237-4042 BC or 4326-3990 BC. Observation of all the FN levels shows that they result from complex sedimentary processes involving anthropogenic-cultural and natural factors. The pottery is mostly coarse undecorated ware, with a little fine polished or incised, or plastic, or matt-painted; there was a large amount of by-products of flint-working, few faunal remains, fewer flint tools and even fewer ornaments (stone and bone beads). (ADelt 846-8) Same. The architectural remains of a C-HL building, consisting of three walls (trapezoidal masonry) was investigated at the site of Loutro. Among the finds was a gold jewellery hoard. R archi- tectural remains, including nine bronze coins, were excavated at the Tzanetatou plot. (ADelt 249) The field survey of E Kephallenia by the 6th Ephorate and the Danish Institute concentrated in 1994 on the acropolis of Same. (ADelt 251) Skala. The R villa was roofed and conserved. (ADelt 249) Tzannata Porou. The excavation of the interior of the Myc tholos tomb (see AR 1997-98, 46; AR 1998-99, 44) below the latest built cist at the back of the burial chamber yielded pottery of the LH IIIA-B period. Test trenches at the site of Plairache, to locate habitation traces, revealed more foundations of EH buildings, a fact which strongly suggests the existence of an extensive EH settlement in the area. At the site of Pachni, sim- ilar finds were discovered, as well as C and HL pottery. Tzanata. In the SE part of the island, in the Araklios valley (Byz Herakleion) a group of five Byz single-aisled churches of small dimensions was located. These bear traces of 12th-13th Ct AD wall paintings in poor condition, a rare of example of such painting for this period on the island. (ADelt 262-3) ELEIA Agia Triada. In the vicinity of an already excavated chamber tomb at the site of Spelies, a second one was discovered, with a circular chamber and a tholoid roof. The tomb contained a single contracted burial, and the remains of older burials, swept against the walls. The finds (pottery, an alabastron, a glass paste seal, a bronze pin, etc.) date it in the LH IIIA-B period. (ADelt 194) Augeio. At the site of Ag. Georgios, construction work destroyed a number of anc. tombs, probably already looted. (ADelt 192) Anc. Elis. A cist tomb, with few offerings, of the 4th C BC, was excavated on the NW slope of the hillock, to the N of lake Eremia. At the site of Chiliomodou, in the vicinity of lake Eremia, two tile-roofed graves, of the R period were investigat- ed. (ADelt 193) Kalyvia. A pot burial (hydria) of the 4th Ct BC, was discovered within the mod. settlement. (ADelt 195) Kaukania. The remains of a PR building were revealed at the site of Agrylitses, a hill 7km to the N of Olympia, to the W of the Analepsis church. The building preserves part of a long N- S, dry-stone wall (a) and a transverse wall (b) which divides the space up into two sections, N and S; the rest of the building has been destroyed by fire, judging by the thick layer of ashes and burnt mud-brick on the interior. The floor of the interior was paved with partly worked, slab-like stones. The pottery materi- al, very burnt, dated from the MH II-III period. Among the finds were two chisels, a grinder and obsidian fragments, as well as a marble, naked female idol, with hands below the chest and the lower part missing. On the interior face of wall (a), below the lowest row of stones, was found an ovoid pebble, with on one face an incised Linear B inscription, and on the other a double axe with two other symbols of the same script below, on either side of the vertical line of the axe. (ADelt 191-2) Koskina. Illegal excavations in the vicinity of the four known Myc chamber tombs at the site of Lakkopholia prompted a re- excavation of the area, which revealed a new, unfortunately</page><page sequence="48">50 DAVID BLACKMAN 68.

More chamber tombs have been identified in the area. (ADelt 194-5) Leukochori. Two tile-roofed tombs, of Ch date, were identified in the course of irrigation works. (ADelt 195) Morea Project. The report on the 1994 season (ADelt 203-4) was given in AR 1994-95, 21-2. Frederick A. Cooper and Kostis Keurelis (ASCS) report on the ninth season of the Minnesota Morea Project: 'In 1999 our work was limited to a few exploratory site vis- its: the Kastro of Linistaina is located 1344m above sea level and approximately 3km from the village of Linistaina, com- manding an impressive position. It was visited by Antoine Bon (La More franque, vol. I, p.385; vol. II, pl. 79) who briefly describes the monuments. The Kastro is, comparatively speak- ing, very well preserved and includes a fortification wall with surviving tower foundations and central gate, a fortified keep with cisterns, and extensive remains of approximately 70 hous- es distributed to the S and W of the summit. A small settlement of about 10 houses was discovered on a small hill in close proximity to the modem road between Linistaina and Andritsaina (4km NE of Linistaina, 2km S of Andritsaina). The site of Ai-Isidoro near Zacharo (surveyed in 1995) was located at the point where the Zacharaiiko river flows into the sea. Ai-Isidoro was the location of a well-known 19th-Ct han in which most early travellers lodged for at least one night (Leake, Travels in the Morea, vol. 1, pp. 54-55; Gell, Itinerary of the Morea, pp. 38-39; Bleuet, Expedition Scientifique de Moree, vol. 1, p. 53). We found the possible remains of the 19th-Ct han built into a modem house; further investigation would be nec- essary for us to secure our identification.' Nesi Vardas. The discovery of two fossilized tusks was reported from Nesi Vardas and from the site of Simiza, respectively; they were subsequently taken to the Olympia museum. (ADelt 195) Olympia. Various research programmes of the German Institute continued in 1999 under the overall direction of H. Kyrieleis; K. Hermann is responsible for study of buildings of the Gr period, and made various sondages. He reports: 'A supplementary investigation was carried out in the W rooms of the prytaneion (Fig. 67). In area E, one of the rooms of the first (probably LC) reconstruction (described by D6rpfeld as a 'hearth?'), strong traces of burning and fragments of char- coal were found at a deep level; they extend to the N beyond the limits of the room, into an area surrounded by a pebble founda- tion. Since these walls abutting the original building were clear- ly added later, the construction sequence postulated by St. Miller for 'Period I' must be reversed. We are probably dealing not with the walls of an enclosed space, but with the enclosure of an open court. What is not clear is whether we are dealing with an altar or a work-place; perhaps it replaced a room insert- ed into the earlier 'kitchen range', which to judge by the pottery was probably built before the mid-5th Ct. By the poros fountain NE of the bouleuterion, whose mod- ern fill produced last year surprising finds but no dating pottery, the fountain trench was tested at two places. The upper levels produced R Imperial sherds, lumps of mortar and fragments of glass, while at a lower level remains were found of an A ampho- ra. The installation of the fountain could therefore belong to the major building programme of the 5th Ct, with a repair in the R period. The study (with J. Knauss) of Olympia's flood protection structures continued, with a long (ca 40m) section on the W bank of the Kladeos; in its W part the shore wall in its anc. con- text was found ca 4.80m below the mod. surface. The wall is covered with gravel layers which slope down to the W and con- tain HL pottery. This fill indicates a dyke-like raising of the level of an originally free-standing wall; into the fill were later inserted the foundation walls of a large building of the 3rd or 4th Ct AD. The most important find from the topographical point of view, however, was made in the E part of the excavation: a row of individual foundations, on which two column drums stand in situ (Fig. 68), clearly belonging to a N-S stoa whose course is precisely parallel to the E stoa of the gymnasion. Whether this is connected with the athletes' quarters mentioned by Pausanias (VI</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 51 21, 2) is not yet clear. What is remarkable is that the foundations descend to the S, adjusted to the river's descent. There is no dat- ing for the stoa yet: the foundations could be as early as HL, though the columns clearly belong to a later rearrangement. The study of water-related structures was extended into the Alpheios plain. SE of the stadion a 40m test trench was dug by machine in order to see whether there was here an ancient dyke also serving as a bank for spectators in the hippodrome. The trench, 1.20m wide and up to 2m deep (Fig. 69, from S), found only natural sand and gravel deposits, with no pottery finds to date them; no ancient surface was found. However, even if no direct evidence for a dyke/hippodrome wall was found, its exis- tence in this area cannot be totally excluded. Under the direction of W. Koenigs, A. Hennemeyer and C. Voigts continued to study the substructure of the temple of Zeus and found evidence for the use of the 'Pheidonian' foot of ca 32.6cm as well as the 'Olympian' foot of 32.04cm. U. Sinn continued the study project 'Olympia in the R Imperial Period and Late Antiquity', excavating the southern- most of the three walls of the SW building, which the excava- tors interpret as a meeting house of the athletes' guilds. The S hall measures ca 9 x 9m, with rectangular (6 x 3m) annexes added on the N and S sides. The outer wall of the S niche is lightly curved and has three windows, of which the central one was carefully walled up. The special feature of the S hall is the basins in the two annexes; the date of the their addition is unclear, as is that of the heating installation. Each basin could be heated by its own praefumium. In the walls (1.5m wide) on both sides of the basins niches were set (90cm wide, 20cm deep) probably for bathers to place their clothes. Access to the S hall was only through a door (ca 1.20m wide) from the W hall. Within the athletes' guild house this room, clearly separated from the other two halls, clearly served bodily hygiene; together with the two training rooms (ceroma- ta) on the peristyle, in which the trainers (paidotribai) worked, this separate room within the singular building complex is fur- ther evidence for its attribution to an athletes' guild. Here the doctors and gymnastai performed their duties, looking after the physical welfare of the sportsmen. As in the other two rooms, the flooring was largely destroyed in late antiquity. During the EByz settlement phase of Olympia (mid 5th to early 7th Ct) the room was used for agri- cultural operations or a workshop. Three of the four niches beside the basins were broken through and used as doors or windows; at some point in this period the E window in the S wall was filled with spolia. A. Haseley has undertaken the study of the architecture of the SW building. In the course of his general study of the EByz settlement in the former sanctuary of Zeus, Th. V6lling exca- vated a number of graves in the W part of the peristyle of the SW building. R. Bol continued his study of the Imperial ideal and portrait sculpture.' A brief excavation at the site of Trane Lakka, 500m N of the new museum of Olympia, suggests the existence of PR habita- tion in the area, from the EH II period onwards. (ADelt 191) Phigaleia. During construction work in the mod. settlement of Phigaleia, were revealed the remains of an anc. building, which, judging by the recorded coins and pottery sherds, dates from the LR period (4th-5th Ct AD). At the W edge of the N wall, in the debris, an A marble perirrhanterion in good condition was found. (ADelt 193-4) 69. Alpheios plain, trench Sosti. The partial remains of a large cist-grave were investigat- ed at the site of Dalamareika, and also an apothetes of an anc. pottery workshop in the vicinity of the tomb (much broken pot- tery in a black layer). (ADelt 192-3) Staphidokampos. At the site of the mod. cultural centre of the community, where last year a section of a C cemetery was exca- vated, a partly destroyed funeral pyre was discovered, extend- ing under the mod. road, with a N-S orientation. (ADelt 194) Tragano. A burial pithos, dated in the beginning of the 4th C BC, was located by a country road. (ADelt 195) Zakynthos. A fourth season of underwater excavation was car- ried out in 1994 by C. Delaporta and V. Koniordos (Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities) on the Med-PostByz wreck on the 'Demetris' reef off Zakynthos harbour. (ADelt 855) MESSENIA Iklaina. Surface survey conducted by M. Kosmopoulos in the area where S. Marinatos had located cyclopean buildings (PAE 1954, 308-10) revealed a concentration of pottery sherds in the vicinity of the Marinatos excavations, dating from the EH, MH and especially from the LH IIIA1-B2 periods. In another area was discovered pottery of the LH III period, as well as HL pot- tery and tiles. Small finds, including stone tools, obsidian frag- ments, handles of a stone vase and fragments of clay figurines, suggest that the area was occupied during both Myc and histor- ical times. (Ergon 1999, 59-60) Messene. At the site of anc. Messene, P. Themeles investigated parts of the agora, the theatre, the basilica, the stadium, and a R villa. In a sector of the agora, used for displaying statues of members of the R imperial family, were discovered two more stone blocks from an anc. building, with parts of honorific decrees, one of which, dedicated by the Achaeans, once accom- panied the statue of Hadrian's wife, Sabina. In the theatre were uncovered the lowest sections of the staircases, and a few slabs from the euthynteria of the seats. In the E parodos two statue bases were discovered, one of which, judging by the inscription, represented a young Messenian Pythian victor (TTayKpaTflrs TayKpaTEOs) of the 2nd Ct BC, fashioned by two local sculptors (AapOoxdpr5, Ayias).</page><page sequence="50">52 DAVID BLACKMAN 70. Messene. villa Tombs of the 7th-8th Cts AD, found below the pavement in the S aisle of the basilica, suggest that the building was by this time used as a cemetery for the local settlement, which spread in the area around the theatre, the agora, and the Arsinoe spring. Continued investigations in the stadium suggest that the last modifications to the monument occurred during the 4th Ct AD, after it had already suffered considerable damage. A low wall used for the protection of the audience, especially during animal fights, and incorporating older building material, was con- structed at the lower part of the sphendone, along with a second barrier erected at the second row of seats (holes in situ); on the stone seats were scratched many owner's names. Behind the N stoa of the stadium was found the marble torso of a young satyr, built into a wall, and dated to the 2nd Ct BC. In two rooms of the W stoa of the gymnasium were discov- ered fragments of the funerary statue, and the plinth with the feet of the statue, of a certain Dionysios Aristomenous, a member of an important Messenian family, which had been found in one of these rooms in the past (Ergon 1997, 41, fig. 30). The excavator considers the statue to be a version of the famous Hermes of Andros. The same family was associated with the funerary mon- ument discovered in 1997. Along the W retaining wall were dis- covered 11 infant pot-burials. Next to some of the burials, which are dated in the 2nd or 1st Ct BC, were also found burials of small dogs, probably companions of the young children. In the NW comer of the gymnasium, behind the N stoa, a hero shrine was revealed, which probably belonged to the famous Messenian Aristomenes. Continued investigations also revealed the remains of buildings, a basin with a hole through its base, and an apothetes, within a stone cir- cle. From inside the apothetes were collected minia- ,^' ture vases, offerings to the hero, incense burners, idols and clay tablets decorated with symposium scenes. t~~ ~On the W side of the road which led from the agora and the theatre to the propylon of the gymnasium, was excavated a villa, built during the 3rd or 4th Ct AD, on the site of an older building, remains of which were incorporated into the new construction. The entrance lay on the N side of the building, which was apparently part of a building block of Hippodamian design (Fig. 70). The villa incorporat- ed all the characteristic elements of this type of building: a vestibulum, corridors, impluvium, atri- ; um, tablinum and storeroms, two open areas with wells, a mill and a wine-press. A mosaic floor sur- vived in one of the private rooms, with geometric designs, while the andron was decorated with a scene including two seated gods (Dionysos and Ariadne) as well as the owner of the villa, smaller in size. (Ergon 1999, 45-56) Methone. After survey in 1993 excavation of the sub- merged settlement commenced in 1994 (El. Spondylis, Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities). The settlement covers some 100 stremmata (25 acres); walls survive at foundation level. The remains planned are of MH date (including a child burial in a pithos) overlaid by some wrecks of the historical period. (ADelt 855) Pylos. Restoration work in the castle continued, in preparation for the opening of a Centre for Maritime Archaeological Research, on the seventh bastion, the NE entrance, and the Makrygianni bastion; a build- ing complex within the T settlement inside the castle was inves- tigated with a view to possible use (after restoration) as a con- servation workshop. (ADelt 858) Reports on the 1994 season of the Minnesota Pylos Project (ADelt 196-7) and Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (ADelt 197-8) were given in AR 1994-95, 24-25. Sharon R. Stocker (ASCS) reports on the ninth season of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project: 'Goals of the 1999 season were: to improve the storage con- ditions of artifacts from Blegen's excavations at the Palace of Nestor; to restudy a selection of published and unpublished finds; to conduct a preliminary examination of the human skele- tal material stored in the Hora museum; to plan a program for long-term storage of frescoes; and to prepare for publication Ott cadastral registers for the district of Navarino. Reorganization of the Blegen finds (Sharon R. Stocker). The Hora Apothete Reorganization Project (HARP) operated from June 1-15 and was funded by the University of Cincinnati and a grant from INSTAP. The focus of the 1999 season was the continued reorganization and repacking of Blegen artifacts in apothete 2, primarily pottery from the pantries (rooms 18-20) and from Lagou trenches. This had been stored in cardboard barrels and was now bagged and put into plastic fruit crates, while all information from original labels was transcribed and entered into an electronic data base. Small finds from apothete 1 were consolidated with those already in apothete 2 and repacked into large wooden boxes; lithics were stored separate- ly in plastic bags. Small finds from the Palace, outlying areas of</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 53 the acropolis, and tombs are clearly distinguished. The human skeletal material in apothete 2 was studied and reorganized by Lynne Schepartz. All human remains are now stored in wooden boxes and have been placed in the same part of the storeroom. Finally, Hariclia Brecoulaki examined a selection of the numer- ous fresco fragments stored in apothete 1. Options for long-term storage are now being discussed. Pre-palatial materialfrom the Palace of Nestor (Sharon R. Stocker). During 1997-1999 the process of labelling, catalogu- ing, measuring, Munselling, photographing and illustrating the pre-LH IIIB artifacts recovered by Blegen in his excavations at the Palace of Nestor was begun by Stocker, with particular attention given to finds identified as having a non-local origin. Although all material had been heavily sorted, much informa- tion can still be recovered about pre-palatial activities and areas of habitation. This assemblage is important for the overall pic- ture it can help provide concerning various economic activities conducted at the Palace of Nestor, as well as changes in deco- ration and form of ceramics between the end of the MH period and the beginning of LHIII. A Filemaker database was created that allows individual catalogue entries to be interfaced with photographs and drawings. Palatial smallfinds (Susanne Hofstra). Study focused on the completion of a searchable database in Filemaker Pro which lists all the Blegen excavation small finds from apothetes 1 and 2, the display cases, and the storage areas under cases. The small objects include unpublished figurines, stone tools, stone vase fragments, loom-weights, and spindle whorls. Keyed to this database is information copied from the original Blegen/Rawson labels (including important notations concern- ing trenches and stratigraphy), pages and figures from the Palace of Nestor volumes, references in excavation notebooks, Hora Museum numbers, descriptions, measurements, drawings and photographs. This information has also been checked and cross-referenced with the Hora Museum accession books. Study also focused on several specific categories of objects: metal, ivory, decorative stone, and lithics. In order to quantify more precisely the amount of bronze found in the Palace excavations, pieces of bronze were counted and weighed on a scale accurate to Ig. Silver fragments were counted but they were too small and infrequent to justify weigh- ing. Many of the bronze and silver objects were photographed and drawn, including everything with any trace of decoration. Blegen and Rawson had photographed and briefly described some of these metal objects in the Palace of Nestor publication, but the black and white published photographs rarely showed details clearly. In addition, bronze and other metals from the excavation were often described no more precisely than 'a few bits and scraps' per room. More precise quantification will allow a comparison to be made both on a room-to-room basis within the Palace, and between the Palace and other sites. All the fragments of ivory from the Palace in the Hora Museum were counted, measured and recorded. Many were drawn and photographed, with special attention to decorative motifs, construction and attachment, and possible production areas within the Palace. Preliminary study suggests that there is little evidence for a significant ivory-carving industry in the LH IIIB period; the few pieces that may indicate production in the latest occupation period of the Palace come, surprisingly, not from the NE workshop (where carving of ivory had been hypothesized) but from an upper floor of the Palace above oil magazines 23 and 24. No clear evidence was found for the use of hippopotamus ivory, which has been recognized at Mycenae and Knossos. Objects and fragments of decorative stone (e.g., bits of crys- tal inlay, carelian beads, and vases of Egyptian diorite and tufa) were drawn, photographed, and recorded. Identification of the types of decorative stone used at the palace, and their sources, was a priority. Blegen and Rawson made frequent ref- erence to many pieces of 'crystalline stone' found both in indus- trial areas of the palace (the NE workshop) and other rooms (the megaron). Many of these pieces of stone appear to be ordinary quartz and halite, and the purpose of the large quantity record- ed for the NE workshop-a large pithos was said to be full of 'crystalline stone and many colored earths'- is still unclear. One piece of lapis lazuli (mistakenly labeled 'obsidian') was identified, the first recognized from the Palace main building. In addition, a number of pieces of 'partly worked' poros from room 55 were examined for evidence of a 'stone cutter's work- shop' in this area. Human skeletal remains from the Palace of Nestor (Lynne Schepartz). Analysis of the human skeletal material from the Palace of Nestor and associated chamber and tholos tombs was initiated in June 1999. In the course of his excavations at the Palace of Nestor, Blegen supported subsidiary excavations of chamber tombs and tholos tombs in the area, many of them con- ducted by Lord William Taylour and William P. Donovan. Reports on these excavations were included in Palace of Nestor III. A portion of the sample had been studied by J. Lawrence Angel in 1957, who made some brief notes about the sex and age of the individuals, but the information was never published. The objectives of the 1999 visit were to assess the degree of preservation and state of curation of the skeletons, and to assess whether it is feasible to conduct a more detailed analysis. In the summer of 1999, the entire body of human osteologi- cal material in the Hora apothete was examined in the process of repacking the bones. All bones were given a preliminary cleaning and then repacked in new, specially-designed wooden boxes. A preliminary examination of the skeletal assemblage was conducted with a view to determining sex, age, patholo- gies, means of death, and the suitability of the remains for extraction of genetic materials. Approximately one quarter of the individuals represented have a fairly complete cranium and some associated postcranial bones. For the rest of the sample, at least 30% can possibly be aged and sexed. As the postcranial sample is fairly large, and there appears to be an appreciable degree of variation in size and muscularity, it should be possi- ble to do some sexing using metric criteria. There is also some pathology present, in the form of dental caries and cranial trau- ma, that may show an interesting distribution. The preliminary examination indicates that a detailed study of this sample is certainly warranted. As the burials date from the MH through the LH periods, a time span of some 500 years is represented. It is already clear that this assemblage is one of the largest and best-preserved collections of human remains from the vicinity of any Myc palace. Future study will focus on temporal changes in the population (in terms of health, gender and age distribution, and differential burial treatment) and the relation of this skeletal sample to other contemporaneous popu- lations in the Myc world. Frescoes from the Palace of Nestor (Hariclia Brecoulaki). A small sample of the numerous frescoes was examined during July 1999 to determine their condition. Most can be salvaged by a thorough cleaning, since they do not present serious problems of decohesion and still preserve their mechanical qualities. Due to the original 'real fresco technique' of painting, colours have been applied over thick mortars consisting of at least three lay- ers, and painted surfaces are, for the most part, well-preserved.</page><page sequence="52">54 DAVID BLACKMAN A program of study will be initiated in 2000 and will include the following: visual examination of all frag- ments in order to determine the state of preservation of the entire collection; preliminary restoration treat- ment (removal of dust) in order to examine the fres- coes better and to decide where further restoration treatment is needed; systematic documentation of the entire assemblage (brief description, dimensions, number of plaster layers, applied surface colors, -I morphological characteristics of painted surfaces, 1 and state of conservation); and the digital scanning of the surface of each fresco fragment. In addition, scientific analyses will be performed at the Wiener Laboratory. Palace-style pottery (Maria Antoniou). The results of a second consecutive study season of the i. palace-style and other Minoan-influenced pottery (LHI-IIA) from the Palace of Nestor (Englianos area) will be incorporated into her doctoral thesis. All sherds and vases of the Palace style, or that show M influence, were fully described, measured and recorded in an electronic database. All objects were photographed and drawn, with special emphasis given to their decoration. Sectional drawings were prepared for special shapes and diagnostic parts, e.g rhyton, rims of bell and Kefti cups, spouts, jar necks, etc. The LH I material is well represented by pieces of Kefti cups with characteristic ripple decoration, most of which have already been discussed by Y. 71. Palai( Lolos (The Late Helladic I Pottery of the SW Peloponnesos and its Local Characteristics, SIMA, 1987, no. 50). There are also sherds from LH I cups that are decorated with linked circles filled with rosettes, 'composite' foliate bands, early types of reed and lily patterns, double axes, and variegated stone patterns. All of these motifs are well attest- ed in the local LM IA pottery from Kythera and the LM IA from Crete. A sherd that probably comes from a jug (or ewer) is dec- orated with zones of ripple pattern, in exactly the same way as the ewer from the Koryphasion tholos (National Museum 8004); the latter is dated to LM IA and is considered a M import. Only about ten pieces of LH IIA pottery are decorated with marine motifs: these include irregular rock pattern, parts of octopuses and argonauts with characteristic semi-circles in the tentacles and 'seaweed'; two of them belong to big coarse jars while the others come from smaller vases. The characteristical- ly small number of marine-style sherds in comparison to plant motifs is paralleled in tombs excavated elsewhere in Messenia. Shapes that could be identified with certainty are: jar with mul- tiple vertical handles (FS 15), small jar (FS 24, cf. CM. 636 from Routsi, tomb 2), possible beaked jug, round-mouthed jug or ewer (tholos IV; the vase was restored and given a Hora museum number: 5702), conical rhyton (FS 199), stirrup jar (FS 169), bell cup (FS 221), quite a number of rims from other types of cups (e.g. rounded or semi-globular cup (FS 211), possible small hole-mouthed jar (FS 101: only part of the rim and han- dle), bridge-spouted jug (spout painted inside and out, quite long and narrow). Decoration is of types regular at other main- land sites and consists of: hatched loops, spirals, crosses, blobs, waz, ivy in various formations, double-axes, rosettes, quirks, scale pattern, crocuses, wavy lines, ogival canopy, palms, foli- ate bands of metal type, reeds, lilies (V-shaped), pendants, and tri-curved arches. Some fragments of cups have painted interi- ors and a few sherds have added white paint on a dark back- opole, Roman baths ground. Both techniques are reminiscent of earlier and contem- porary M pottery. Other Studies (Jack Davis). Study of Ott documents pertain- ing to the area examined by PRAP has made considerable progress. A summary of research has been accepted for publi- cation in Hesperia as 'Pylos Regional Archaeology Project, Part III: Sir William Gell's Itinerary in the Pylia and Regional Landscapes in the Morea in the Second Ottoman Period' (J. Bennet, J.L. Davis and F. Zarinebaf). The topic is being treated more fully in a book by the same authors, entitled The Ottoman Reconquest of the Morea in 1715: A Case Study from Western Messenia. Other studies of Pylos in the recent past are being prepared by Wayne Lee (an ethnoarchaeological examination of the village of Maryeli) and Siriol Davies (western Messenia during the Second Venetian Occupation of the Morea).' KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA Kerkyra Almyros-Thinalia. This hill site was apparently occupied from the N to the middle EH period (handmade domestic pottery, pithoi, flint). (ADelt 420) Kassiope. A semicircular mud-brick structure, possibly a bath- tub, which dates from the 3rd-4th Cts AD, was excavated in the Nathanael plot. The walls in the same plot date from the 1 st Ct AD, when the town was at the height of its power. At the Cheirdare plot the foundations of a rectangular building were recorded.

(ADelt 408-9) In 1994 a mass of 6th-4th Ct pottery was found in the water off Mon Repos, probably from later dumping known to have taken place here. (ADelt 853-4) Palaiopole. The systematic excavations in the mod. town were continued for a sixth season, in co-operation with the Louvain la Neuve (Tony Hackens) and Brown Universities (R. Winkens). In the Kokotos plot, in the Anemomylos area, the continuation of the stone pavement of the R agora was investi- gated, and the fragmentary remains of six walls, dating mostly to the R period (1 t-4th Cts AD). One of these walls was proba- bly part of a multifunctional public building (4th Ct AD). The pottery in the surface fill included amphora fragments from the Aegean, the Black Sea, Italy and N Africa. In the Kateche plot, the continuation of the slab pavement of the anc. agora was excavated. Parts of floors were discovered to the S and a frag- mentary wall to the N, while the E part of the area was very dis- turbed. The use of the area extends from the 4th Ct AD to mod. times. Among the portable finds were 42 bronze coins, HL and R pottery, fragments of glass vessels and amphora fragments from the Aegean, Italy and N Africa. In the Kasphike plot, excavation was completed of the R baths, dating from the late 1 St/early 2nd Cts AD (Fig. 71). After use during the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD, they were repaired during the next two centuries, some of the rooms now being used as work- shops (large number of glass vessels and cooking pots). In AD 551 the major earthquakes that hit this part of Greece, accord- ing to Procopius, were probably responsible for the destruction of the complex. To the N the complex was interrupted by a 19th- Ct AD disturbance, while to the E the area was apparently occupied continuously from the 7th to the 1St Cts BC. To the S was identified an anc. road, occasionally also used as a drain, S of which lay other buildings of R date. To the W, the complex is interrupted by a mod. road. The baths have ten rooms, five of which (1, 2, 5, 7, 8) had mosaic floors. In room 1 the mosaic depicted the framed head of Ocean facing the entrance, made of coloured tesserae and sur- rounded by geometric patterns. In room 2 the mosaic floor, badly preserved, lay 15cm lower than that in room 1; to its N was part of a water-supply system. In room 3, three benches were pre- served along the E side, while the floor itself lay 50cm lower than the floor surfaces in the rooms to the E. To the N of room 4, paved with a tile floor, was found a main drain, which apparent- ly received the water from various secondary drains of room 3 and the N part of the complex. The mosaic floor of room 5 was destroyed by the entrance to a later praefurium, with two drains leading to room 6, and was only preserved in the NE corer. In a hole cut for a drain in the floor of the room, the torso of an Aphrodite statue of the Cnidian type was discovered. Room 6 contained the remains of 34 small square piers, part of a hypocaust. These lay below the mosaic floor of room 7, only pre- served in the SE comer, while the walls were faced with bricks. In room 8 the original mosaic floor was replaced by large slabs; in the N part was preserved an ECh marble-lined bath-tub, while along the E and W walls of the room was recorded a bench, also lined with marble. Along the S side of the complex, between the S wall of the bath-house and the N walls of the buildings to the S, ran a road, also used as a drain. In all, 11 rooms were exca- vated to the S of this road/drain, in one of which (room 16), was preserved part of mosaic floor with floral decoration; the other preserved floors consisted of clay slabs. In room 19 among the finds were recorded 36 coins and fragments of figurines. In the Mikalef plot, in the 11th season of excavation, inves- tigations were continued in the area of the apothetes between g 1-c. l 'J S r C £3 ' A o I '4AS^^^^-I^-02 ' ^ :^ Io S · Y\^i4~ ^(r^QQ^a ^^ ^^^^^^y r2 ; r ·: - ~~~~~n-I 72. Masklenitsa, house three walls of the HL building (T18, 12 and 14), and E of kiln 10. In the latter area one more kiln was discovered. Among the most important finds from the apothetes were the terracotta stat- ue of a female figure seated on a lioness, fragments of other ter- racotta statues, moulds for female figurines of the severe style, terracotta figurines of LA date, misfired products of the work- shop, and pottery of the A and C periods. (ADelt 410-20) Kanoni. In the fourth and final season in the area, at the S point of the Kanoni headland, near the Kassopitra monastery, where the Kerkyra kouros had been found in 1992, were cleaned the rectangular spaces formed by the double walls of an important building, only the SE corer of which was uncovered. A small drain was recorded 1.60m W of the building. Among the finds was a monolithic limestone column, found at the entrance of the building, which comprised the lower part of a baetyl, the symbol of Apollo's worship in Kerkyra; it was orig- inally set on a rectangular block, discovered next to the Kouros. (ADelt 421) Thesprotia Karteri. At the site of Karteri, E of the Parga Mts, and 5km NW of Margariti, 40 tombs of Ch date were excavated, 34 of which were cists and four were tile-roofed. (ADelt 429) Masklenitsa. A house at the foot of Masklenitsa hill, 685m from the fortified settlement, was investigated: it was entered from the W, and consisted of eight rooms (Fig. 72). One of the rooms (IX) was probably an open court, while the main room (III) preserved the remains of a central hearth and fragments of domestic pottery. Room IV had a stone-paved floor, only parts of which are preserved, while room I had the remains of a mosaic floor, in opus spicatum (herringbone); in the middle was depicted an anthemion within a medallion, an overall arrange- ment which suggests that the room was probably used for sym- posia (triclinium). It is probable that rooms V to the S and VI to the N were used for storage or as cooking areas (pottery). The finds from the building date it to the HL and early Imperial peri- ods (terminus post quem: silver coin of the Thessalian Koinon, 196-146 BC). Later, from the first half of the 2nd Ct AD to the first half of the 3rd Ct AD, the building was modified and re- used (addition of three clay bath-tubs). It seems that the house was constructed after the battle of Pydna; after the Roman con- quest, many wealthy Romans settled the W coast of Greece and pursued farming and animal husbandry. A specific villa owned by Pomponius Atticus, at Malathrea in Chaonia (cf. his corre-</page><page sequence="54">56 DAVID BLACKMAN spondence with Cicero) has apparently many similarities to this building, as regards the plan, the date and the portable finds. (ADelt 427-9) Paramythia. In the Daphnoula and Chrysauge villages, two HL cist graves were excavated: the former had burials of the first half of the 3rd Ct and the 2nd Ct BC, and the latter a child's burial of the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. A 19th-Ct AD building was investigated at Elikodromio, the site of the helicopter air- port of Paramythia. Philiates. Two Ch cist graves were excavated in the Agios Georgios churchyard at Phaneromene. (ADelt 426-7) Souli district. At the site of Aulotopos was uncovered a rectan- gular building, used from the 4th to 2nd Cts BC (Fig. 73). In room I of the building, which consisted of four distinct spaces, were the remains of a trapezoidal brick hearth. In the thick burnt layer of the hearth were discovered a flute, bronze sheets and nails, and to the S of the hearth, fragments of a pithos with car- bonized wheat grains. Room II was probably used for storage, judging by the multitude of pithoi found inside. Almost in the middle of room III were discovered remains of a semicircular stone-built hearth, with fragments of pithoi and Macedonian type amphoras on either side. The same arrangement was encountered in room IV, where among the finds were four female busts, a silver Athenian coin, and a bronze handle with ram's heads. To the N of the room were found the remains of another semicircular stone hearth. Of the 20 recorded coins, five belong to the 4th Ct BC, 8 to the HL period and the rest to the R and Byz periods. The wider area was occupied until the 4th Ct AD. (ADelt 424-6) BOIOTIA Akraiphia and the Ptoion. Resumption of work by the French School in 1994 (ADelt 291-3) was reported in AR 1994-95, 27-8. Akraiphnion. At the site of Grava, there was continued inves- tigation of a section of the extensive cemeteries of anc. Akraiphia, which have so far yielded over 2000 tombs of all types and many valuable finds, ranging in date between the EG and the EHL periods. In 1994 12 tombs (6th-3rd Cts BC) were excavated, in addition to the 70 tombs discovered last year. (AR 1998-99, 54-5) In the same area, with permission from the Central Archaeological Council, a major project was launched, involv- ing the investigation of the cemeteries and other lake installa- tions of anc. Akraiphia. Extensive rescue excavations revealed not only new parts of the cemeteries of the anc. town, but also sections of the flood-prevention dams (dykes), as well as the remains of an opus spicatum floor belonging to a LR farm. In the mod. village of Akraiphnion, identified with the anc. town of Akraiphia, which lay on the road to the Apollo sanctu- ary at Ptoon, part of an extensive but poor cemetery was uncov- ered at the foot of the anc. acropolis, dating from the 3rd Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. A total of 35 tombs were excavated, including 27 tile-roofed graves, 3 pot burials, 3 cist tombs, and 2 pit graves; the majority of the tile-roofed graves (18) contained adult burials in an extended position, while the cist graves, divided into two parts, included multiple burials. One of the lat- ter (T31) had a rectangular rock-cut niche on its S side. 73. Aulotopos site In another plot to the E, also at the foot of the anc. acropo- lis, 9 tombs were recorded, comprising 3 cists and 6 tile-roofed graves, with mostly adult burials and one example used as an ossuary (T3). They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 278-81) Aliartos. Near the exit of the mod. town towards Livadeia, along the old national road from Athens to Lamia, which prob- ably coincided with the anc. road and near which lay the acrop- olis and the lower city of anc. Haliartos, part of an important anc. cemetery was uncovered, including the greater part of a monumental funeral peribolos, of C date. By the anc. road other funeral periboloi have been recorded, with burials dated to the HL period, but not later than 171 BC, when the town was destroyed by the R praetor C. Lucretius, because the Haliartians had joined the cause of Perseus against the Romans. The new peribolos was probably square in shape, with a rectangular base for a funeral monument in the SE comer, and seven other tombs (a cist grave, a pyre, a pit grave and 4 tile-roofed graves). The pyre, dated to the 5th Ct BC, was defined by nine stones, placed ellipsoidally. Finally, two new trenches to the N of the peribo- los revealed seven more tile-roofed or hut-shaped graves and a shaft grave covered by a stone pile; all date to the HL period, as do the majority of the graves recorded in the cemetery. (ADelt 281-3) The small ruined single-aisled, apsed church of Agia Kyriake was investigated. Burials were found with coins of the Fr period. Of interest was a dish and fragment of the broad rim of a Byz censer, of a type used for funerary rites. (ADelt 122-3) Antikyra. The fine mosaic of the EByz basilica on the island was finally restored to the nave after a long process of restora- tion and consolidation. (ADelt 103) Investigation of the archaeological remains on this site from 1991 to 1994 uncovered: EByz structures and drainage systems, including a modest 6th-Ct AD bath-house, HL and R burials, and paltry moveable finds of the 3rd to 6th Cts AD (Ath. Zilianaios plot); five rooms of an ECh house containing coarse ware sherds and five coins of Maurice (582-601) (G. Zilianaios plot); and a large complex of rooms and atrium, the remains of a villa perhaps (D. Kontogiannis plot). (ADelt 109-13)</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 57 74. Plataiai site Chaeroneia. On the banks of the man-made stream running through Chaironeia, six tile-roofed and cist graves were discov- ered, in two rows, to the NE of the main road. They date from the 6th to the 3rd Cts BC. (ADelt 288) Helikon. At the site of the Prophetes Elias chapel, on the peak of the E range of Mt Helikon (1530m), the site of the anc. Hippokrene spring (Kryo Pegadi) was identified: an anc. rec- tangular, partly rock-cut building, with a destruction layer of the A period, including some pottery bearing graffiti (IAPON TOI AI), probably referring to the worship of Zeus. (ADelt 283-4) Cave of the Leivethrides Nymphs. Scientific excavation in 1994 by the Ephorate of Spelaeology revealed the terrible effects of illicit excavation, already evident in earlier investiga- tion. The stratigraphy is terribly disturbed, producing N, C and HL pottery completely jumbled. Nevertheless, the finds of pot- tery and figurines confirm that the cave was a cult site, and specifically of the Leivethrides Nymphs mentioned by Pausanias and Strabo (graffiti on the bf and rf pottery, notably kylikes and skyphoi; female figurines, group of Silenos and Nymphs). (ADelt 844-5) Libadeia. Excavations were undertaken at the NE tower of the fortification walls and the triangular platform at the E edge of the N wall. Spolia from pre-Byz times were used widely, at a location where Pausanias identifies remains. One block bore an anc. inscription. (ADelt 123-5) Livadostra. In the W part of the valley, near the anc. fortifica- tions, the remains of two large Med buildings were excavated, parallel to each other, and probably used for domestic purposes, perhaps as inns, or as storerooms, judging by their proximity to the anc. and Med harbour. The deeper levels included pottery and small finds of R date. (ADelt 287-8) Mavromati. Investigation showed that the present three-aisled, cross-vaulted church of the Metamorphosis was originally a two-column cruciform church of the 11th-12th Ct AD (9.15 x 7.70m, excluding the apse, which is 1.10m wide). (ADelt 92-3) Plataiai. A. Konecny reports on the 1999 campaign: 'This year excavations were started in a joint venture between the Ephorate of Boiotia and the Austrian Institute at Athens. Digging took place at the W gate of the huge enceinte of Plataiai, the location and rough layout of which had been identified in the course of last year's geophysical survey. Several trenches brought to light the walls of two substantial towers flanking a wide thoroughfare. During a second phase of building activities the gap between the bastions was narrowed by a massive wall, leaving an entrance ca 2.50m wide. To the rear of this structure massive walls orig- inating from both towers were obviously intended to form a rectangular courtyard (Fig. 74). Towards the town some remains of a house were unearthed. The road fill in front of its walls con- - tained huge amounts of ceramic, at first sight belonging to the first decades of the 4th Ct BC. The circumstances of its deposition, however, strongly ' indicate that the material was deposited there not long after its production. This would, then, give a terminus post quem for the construction of the road at an uncertain date, well after the first quarter of the century. As road and gateway belong to the same layout of town planning and share many stylistic features, it seems justifiable to apply this to the town entrance and with it the whole huge circuit of Plataiai as well. Of course, better understanding depends on thorough study of the ceramic mate- rial retrieved. Geophysical survey, conducted by the Fitch Laboratory (BSA), took place inside the built-up area of the town. Its results helped to substantiate the hitherto rather hypothetical grid of orthogonal roads and blocks established last campaign. Activities at Plataiai will be continued.' Tachi (anc. Potniai). During construction work for a new mod. settlement in the area there were unearthed an important section of a LG cemetery, isolated Myc graves, and installations relat- ed to the transport and use of the water from the local springs. During 1994 30 more rock-cut tombs were excavated, dating from the Myc, LG and A periods. The excavated part of the LG cemetery included a row of 17 pithos or pot burials, four shaft graves, a row of ten pit graves (of LH IIIA1 date), and an ani- mal (dog) burial near tomb 30. The grave goods in the LG cemetery varied, according to the social position, gender and age of the deceased. Among the finds were bronze objects, like bracelets and rings, fibulae, beads of semi-precious stones and glass paste, and a rectangular bone seal, with symmetrically placed representations of chariots with charioteers. It should be pointed out at this stage, that the existence of a Myc and an IA cemetery in this area clearly pre-supposes the existence of the respective settlements in the area. Among the graves was discovered a rock-cut drain (height 1.20m), excavated for a length of 40m, channelling the water from the Dirke springs to the N (i.e. to the Kadmeia). It was pro- vided with two air-shafts, facilitating the periodic checking and/or cleaning of the drain. 10m NE of the drain a well was recorded, which contained over 70 vases of the LG and EA peri- ods. (ADelt 269-71) Tanagra. Rescue excavations at the foot of the acropolis hill, ca 500m from the anc. fortifications, uncovered substantial remains of funerary periboloi, including a large number of graves (tile-roofed, cist graves, cremations), the majority loot- ed. The pottery dates from the C to LHL periods. (ADelt 286) Near the road joining the modem town with Oinophyta, there exist remains of a single-aisled Byz church of St Polycarp</page><page sequence="56">58 DAVID BLACKMAN 75. Tanagra, St Polycarp (8.35 x 5.80m, excluding the apse). A ruin for many decades, the structure is dated to the 13th Ct AD by its masonry (the apse is built in a late cloisonne technique, disepsilon bands around the window openings, etc.). Parts of the templon screen and sty- lobate were uncovered, enabling a modest reconstruction on paper. Wall-painting fragments date from a second, post-Byz phase of repair and rebuilding. (ADelt 91-2) (Fig. 75) Thebes. The most significant archaeological project this year was the completion of the investigations below the mod. road surface of Odos Pelopidos, a 200m2 area between Odos Dologlou and Zeggine, exactly opposite the archaeological site of the 'armoury' (Fig. 76). The excavations were conducted in six different trenches. The finds in trench I, started in 1993, included the first two fragments of page-shaped Linear B tablets (Av 100, 101: see AR 1998-99, 57 &amp; Fig. 66) and ten more fragments discovered in 1994. In the continua- tion of trench II, one more fragment of a page- shaped tablet was found. The entire area was appar- ently covered by a hard and thick Myc floor of orange clay, river pebbles and sherds. The burnt con- tents of the layer included (apart from pottery) car- bonized figs, animal bones, obsidian and flint frag- ments, steatite spindle-whorls, five figurines, frag- ments of wall paintings and broken ivory pieces, a talismanic seal, glass paste ornaments, 22 folded lead sheets and 21 bronze sheets. Trench III, E of trench II, in the direction of the 'armoury', yielded earlier Myc pottery (pre-LH IIIB), as well as MH pottery. In deeper levels the EH habitation horizon was identified, especially dense, in the E part of the Kadmeia. To the N of the single recorded EH wall was found the first MH grave, which cut through the earlier levels. Trench IV, although very disturbed by post-Byz oAor n, constructions, was especially rich in small finds of Myc date, including 31 fragments of Linear B tablets, probably part of a destroyed and then scat- tered archive. In trench V, a disturbed destruction level formed after the destruction of the LH IIIB archive and incorporating the resulting debris, was located just below the post-Byz levels. From a section of floor were collected quantities of carbonized cereals and figs, kept in large domestic vessels. In deeper, MH levels two graves were found, part of the extensive 76. Theb&lt; MH intra-mural cemetery of E Kadmeia. Among the finds from this trench were 24 fragments of tablets, Myc figurines, lead sheets, a bone pin and a stylus, under the LH IIIC floor and fragments of wall paintings. Finally, in trench VI, along the W side of the mod. road, Myc levels were investigated, and fragments of walls and floors. LH IIIC levels were recorded above a IIIC1 floor, below which, in the N part of the trench, was located a deposit with LH IIIB pot- tery. Below this deposit was recorded pottery of the LH IIIA and MH periods only. In the SE part of the trench, in the corer between two walls, a pile of Linear B tablets was discovered, which had fallen upside down, on a carbonized wooden shelf (lm x 40cm) and in the immediate area. The pile included 160 fragments of tablets, mostly page-shaped, while a further 49 fragments were collected from the deposit to the N. Other small finds include obsidian and flint blades, figurines, bone, stone and bronze objects, and 29 lead sheets. Of the 200 tablets discovered below the mod. road surface in Odos Pelopidou in 1994, two examples are presented in detail, as representative of the lot. The first tablet (Gp 109) recorded a large quantity of wine (VIN: 2601ts) which was sent out to an area, probably a sanctuary, since the receiver is AtFia, the female version of Zeus. The portion of the goddess is to be paid (qe-te-jo) by the palace. The second text (Av 104 &amp; 191) referred to the sending out of dozens of men (VIR: 46), ('pour- ers of corn': si-to-ko), to different areas of Boiotia, a text which provides invaluable information on the geography and ritual aspects of the Myc centre. 'Armoury'. This year's operations, aimed at unifying the trenches of all the excavations since 1963/4, resulted in the es, site</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 59 uncovering of 12 fragmentary walls of various periods, mostly Myc; the location of two new cist graves, dated to the EMyc period; and the discovery of two almost intact Linear B tablets. The surviving walls formed two basic systems: a W one, com- prising two rooms, and the E one, consisting of room 3. The pot- tery was all LH IIIB. The two tablets were found in a thin layer of ash, S of a wall in the W system. The first tablet (Lf 139) was leaf-shaped and referred to 13 woven pieces of cloth (TELA), specially decorated, in association with a name (to-po-ne). The second (Ft 140) was page-shaped and recorded large quantities of cereals and edible olives, in various areas of Myc Thebes. In Odos Epameinonda the remains were excavated of a rec- tangular room with a pink plaster floor, part of a larger building, probably a bath-house, considering the discovery in the deposit of a terracotta drain and of three circular mud-bricks from the supports of a hypocaust. Two of the walls were partly built over a small MH apsidal structure, with a band of white clayey floor, along the interior of the walls. A burnt MH destruction layer and sections of walls were also located, in the E part of one trench, below which was recorded an EH occupation level (remains of two successive semi-circular hearths), also destroyed by fire. In the E part of the plot, in a central position, a long rectangular room of C date was excavated. (ADelt 271-8) During the installation of the natural gas pipeline across Boiotia a number of rescue excavations were conducted, with a number of important discoveries: in the Solenari area, identi- fied with anc. Tilphousion, parts of a settlement, two Byz tile- roofed graves, and a cemetery of the EG period were investi- gated. In the area N of the Kabeirion valley, 8km W of the mod. town of Thebes, part of a cemetery of the LA and C periods was investigated, including a total of 50 tombs (17 tile-roofed graves, cremations, shaft graves, pot burials and a clay larnax burial). The distance of the cemetery from the anc. town of Thebes, suggests that it probably belonged to another flourish- ing town in the vicinity. In the same area two farms were part- ly uncovered, in one of which were recorded remains of an opus spicatum floor, with a built press in the middle. Both farms used building material from the cemetery nearby, especially LA and C inscribed funeral stelae (eight transferred to the Thebes Museum). (ADelt 284-6) Continuing excavations of Byz Thebes are reported. (ADelt 113-22) These include: badly damaged remains of a MByz church (?) of undefined type, along with reused and disturbed tile-covered, pit, and chamber burials. Only one burial was accompanied by a coin (anonymous follis of 969-1081). An impressive barrel-vaulted chamber tomb (2.20 x 1.23m outer dimensions) was located, with four burials, carefully interred at different times. The tomb was approached by two steps and blocked off with a large partly-worked stone. The interior was well-preserved, despite the bones having rotted because of the damp. The plastered walls on three sides were each decorated with one large stepped cross, with the cross-arms terminating in a T shape. The cross and stratigraphical indications provide a 9th -10th Ct AD date. No finds were made, with the exception of fine strands from a fabric woven with gold thread. This is the first painted Ch tomb found in Thebes. The coin finds from the site indicate settlement from EByz to Ott periods. Small finds include ECh lamps, a key, buckles, pipes, etc. from various periods (28 Pelopidou St). Other finds included walls of a Byz building and pottery remains (storage, cooking and serving vessels), some of which resemble dated 9th-10th Ct AD ware from Aegina and Corinth. Of special interest was a lidded brazier with yellow slip (Fig. 77, left). Much of the pottery was of white clay with finely fash- ioned walls and embossed decoration. The brazier was stamped within and without with the figure of an eagle. Such ware has been found in the Sarachane excavations, and dates to ca 925- 1035. Three unpainted clay lamps are of a transitional variety of the 9th Ct AD (flat base, undecorated convex cover, raised lip, no spout, and two holes: in the centre for the oil, and at the side for the wick). Coins of Theophilos (829-842) and Leo VI (882- 912) were encountered, leading the excavators to date the build- ing to the 9th Ct AD. A 10th-Ct AD destruction level may have been caused by Bulgarian or Hungarian invaders, known from the documentary sources. Area r was abandoned at this time, but other parts of the complex continued in use. A two-handled pitcher is identified with a MByz type found in Athens and Constantinople. A bronze measuring rod from a pair of scales resembles that found on the 7th-Ct AD Yassi Ada shipwreck. Other metal objects were encountered (junction of Vryzaki and Dirkis Sts, a small distance away from the church of Agios Gregorios Theologos, dated by an inscription to 872). Finds of the 9th-10th Cts AD were made at other sites (junction of Drakou and Kadmou Sts; Biniari St) Excavations for the sewage network proved fruitful, encoun- tering, amongst other things, a iron seal-holder, a rock crystal seal with a Latin apotropaic inscription, and an ornate rock crystal handle for an eating (?) implement. Coins and seals found during the excavations are recorded in ADelt 126-7, including a lead seal of 'Elias, imperial spatharios and chartoularios of Hellas'. EUBOEA Ano Oreoi. The corer of a large stone building and of a peri- bolos were uncovered at the Kondou plot. (ADelt 297-8) Chalkis. Eleven rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. town of Chalkis. At the junction of Odos Arethouses and Amarynthion, remains of rectangular HL buildings were dis- covered, with poorer architectural remains of R date over them (1St Ct BC). Parts of two water pipes, probably of HL date, were located at the junction of Odos Gazepe and Chatzopoulou, and at the junction of Odos Amarynthion and Achaiou. The remain- ing finds in the mod. town consisted of 19 burials, including 7 tile-roofed graves, 5 of R date, the others HL; 6 cists, of which 3 were R, the rest probably HL, 1 HL chamber tomb, 1 stone sarcophagus, 1 hut-shaped tomb, a PG shaft grave and 2 R apo- thetes.

In the plot opposite the archaeological museum, the site of a future archaeological park incorporating significant sections of the urban fabric of the anc. town, the remains of HL walls were uncovered, also a rectangular space in the middle of the plot, and part of a pebble floor to the E (coins of the 3rd Ct BC). In another plot opposite the museum a single-room rec- tangular building of HL date was excavated, with important finds, including nine bronze coins, lead loom weights, and bf pottery of the 4th Ct BC. Tile-roofed graves dating from the 4th Ct BC were recorded N of the museum, on the E bank of the river. (ADelt 296-7) Stephan Schmid reports on the activities of the Swiss School in 1999: 'In 1999, besides the study and conservation of previously excavated material, three main field activities were carried out in and around Eretria. Excavations continued for the fourth con- secutive season at point E/600 NW in the neighbourhood of the house with the mosaics; a second season was carried out in the southern area of the temple of Apollo Daphnephoros in the city's central area, and a first season of a survey project cover- ing the wider area of Eretria, i.e. its chora, was undertaken. i~L Excavations at E/600 NW (cf. AR 1996-97, 55f; 1997-98, 61ff.; 1998-9, 59ff.). In 1999 the area S of the ancient E-W main road, that crosses the city at this point, continued to be explored. The general his- tory of the area was already known from the results of the previous campaigns. A first general building * j activity can be dated to the HL period, most proba- bly post-261 BC, i.e. after the Chremonidean War, when a residential quarter was built. Consecutive building phases followed until a violent destruction in the early 1St BC that most probably can be related to the Roman conquest of 86 BC, towards the end of the 1St Mithridatic War. After a period of abandon- ment, in the early Imperial years new installations were built in the area, at least partially related to crafts such as tanning. During the 1999 campaign the foundations of the HL walls were reached in most trenches, and with the finds from these areas it was confirmed that these building activities did not start before the second quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. This means that this spot was apparently unoccupied in the LC and EHL periods, while in its immediate neighbourhood stood the wealthy house with the mosaics, pointing to a not very dense settlement of some parts of the ancient city during these times. This is an interesting piece of information regarding the ancient management of space, all the more because it seems that during the following HL period, when building activities in the area under explo- ration started on a bigger scale, the house with the mosaics was abandoned after a violent destruction, probably related to the Chremonidean War (267-261 BC). Therefore, it would seem that the city walls enclosed also considerable amounts of free space during most periods. At point CD/1-2 (Fig. 78 M 45) part of an apsidal building was found below the level of the HL walls (Fig. 79). The pot- tery belonging to this construction clearly points to a date in the G period, the same being true for the architectural shape of the building, although from the excavated part it is not clear whether it was an oval or an apsidal construction. Together with another wall of the same period excavated previously (M 15 on Fig. 78) in this area, it becomes all the more clear that the G set- tlement of Eretria reached this far north and was therefore of considerable extent. The question, however, then is whether all the G structures known so far from Eretria belong to a single community or whether we are dealing with an installation of several nuclei, maybe reflecting family structures that only later on became a 'political' and administrative unity. The 1999 season further provided considerable new infor- mation about the R occupation of this part of the anc. city. At F/1 (St 48 on Fig. 78) a deposit of several meters depth was found, dug in the natural soil without any supplementary man- made structures, containing big quantities of broken pottery and other objects, such as the terracotta head wearing a high polos (Fig. 80) probably belonging to a Tyche or the personification of a city. Across the street, facing the crossing between the major E- W axis and an important street connecting the harbour of Eretria with the temple of Apollo and the gymnasion, a solidly-con- structed building was discovered (Figs. 78, 81-2). In a first phase, dated to the HL period, a rectangular building measur- ing 7.92 x 5.01m was built. Especially interesting is the fact that the building was wider than deep and that it had huge founda- tions (Fig. 82, foreground). For the time being the function of this building remains unknown. During the early Imperial years</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 61 81, 82. Eretria, rectangular building 80. Eretria, terracotta head its rear wall was destroyed and the building was extended towards the N, re-using the well-worked stones of another, not yet identified building of apparently considerable dimensions. The new structure measures 7.92 x 13.72m, containing a front room and a back room (Figs. 78, 81-2). In the latter, on its rear side, a huge bathron was installed, slightly off-centre from the axis of the building and joined on one side by a further, curved base and a third, rectangular one (Fig. 82). These bases appar- ently once carried statues and indeed, several hundred frag- ments of statues made from Pentelic marble (Figs. 83-4) were found in front of them, i.e. in the centre of the room. So far frag- ments belonging to six different statues have been identified. Three of them were over-life-size, two seem to be of about nat- ural dimensions and one statue either showed a child or was an under-life-size representation. A seventh statue, again with clearly over-life-size dimensions, stood on the base just in front of the building (ST 52 on Fig. 78). At least four of the seven statues were shown wearing a cuirass. The best preserved of them (Fig. 84) shows in its centre a small male figure, emerg- ing from and holding a plant. Despite the fact that the general iconographic theme is rather well known, this representation seems to be unique as decoration for a cuirassed statue and may eventually point to a specific aspect of the person represented. The size of the statues as well as some iconographic details make it very likely that they depicted members of the imperial family and therefore the building may be called the local tem- ple for the imperial cult. We are, of course, not dealing here with a typical temple of the Italian type, as found at Corinth and other R colonies in Greece, but its general shape recalls such buildings. Further, the position of the building, apparently at the crossing of two major streets of the city, would fit very well into the corpus of the known temples of the imperial cult. For the time being a precise chronology for the building and the statues is difficult to establish. In general terms one could place them in the 1st or early 2nd Ct AD, but there may very well have been different phases of sculptural decoration of the building, as may be indicated by the subsequently placed bases. Excavations in the sanctuary of Apollo Daphnephoros (AR 1998-99, 61): in 1999, exactly a hundred years after the first sci- entific excavations at this spot, the area S of the temple of Apollo underwent further excavation (Fig. 85). Here, part of a new apsidal building (M 6 on Fig. 85) as well as two pits (Fo 36, 44 on Fig. 85) were discovered. The apsidal building and one of the pits (Fo 44) seem to be contemporary with the so- called Daphnephorion (no. 1 on Fig. 85) and belong to the LG period. This is confirmed by many fragments of drinking cups from the pit as well as fragments of big krateres. Besides these vessels, the pit contained important quantities of animal bones, pointing either to the celebration of symposia or to offerings. Therefore, the question of whether we are dealing with cultic or with profane installations, often posed for the 'Daphnephorion', can also be posed for the new structures, and the detailed analy- sis of pottery and bones may help to find an answer. In a second phase, a rather rectangular structure (M 4 on Fig. 85) was built over the former apsidal one. Despite its bad preservation, the installation of several hearths between M 4</page><page sequence="60">62 DAVID BLACKMAN ..............3...... 1.9km2 (A. Sampson, AnthrAChron 3, 1988, 166-8).

From the hill was recorded pottery of the EH, MH and Myc periods, although PG and G pottery has been also noted. The site is associated with the town of Dion. (ADelt 297) Manika. EH architectural remains were uncovered in two dif- ferent plots in the mod. town: the corner of a room and a wall in Odos Kyklaminon, and a trapezoidal workshop area, as well 84. Eretriae, marble statue fragment 84. Eretria , maarble statue fragment rltowithF4\ and M 5 on Fig. 85 points to a frequent use. In a last phase, all these structures were covered by sandy material, apparently attesting fluvial activities in the area, maybe related to seasonal flooding of a nearby river. Field survey: the need of a field survey of the wider area around Eretria becomes more urgent every year, as building F activities are greatly increasing. Further, research focusing on the ancient city of Eretria also leads to questions about the rela- s.4 tion between the city and its chora. Therefore, in 1999 a first o s.7 season of field survey, covering approximately 6km2, was car- ried out. The survey used the extensive method, collecting only a restricted amount of pottery, mainly in relation with the chronology of structures discovered. The use of a GIS base led Fo.44 to a digitalized map of the area covered by the survey, forming the base for further activities that are planned within the next few years. Three categories of sites and structures formed the main part of the discoveries so far. First, there are traces of set- tlements, probably related to agricultural activities in most cases. Second, further information about the ancient road con- nections was gathered, and third, further traces of the well _ _. known necropoleis of anc. Eretria were registered. Special attention was given to three sites.

At Viglatouri an apsidal building of the MG period (750 BC) was discovered and excavated at a site, proba- bly to be identified with anc. Kyme. A series of G apsidal build- ings were discovered in the area, founded on Myc and MH lev- els. At the site of Palaiokastri, W of Viglatouri, parts of R for- tifications and houses were excavated. (ADelt 298) Phylla. J.J. Coulton (Oxford University) reports on the second season of trial excavation which took place at the Vrachos fort, Phylla, in central Euboea, in September 1999, with co-operation between the 11th Ephorate at Chalkis (A. Karapaschalidou) and the BSA: 'Trenches were opened in three areas and a flotation unit was operated. In building 3 excavation of the W half of room 17 completed the picture obtained in 1996. The floor was clearly established, but there were no helpful built-in features (Fig. 86, looking W). The pottery from on and above the floor was simi- lar to that found in the E half of the room, with remains of numerous drinking vessels (late 6th -early 5th Ct) and at least one amphora. Two rounded pebbles might be intended as sling shot. The low level of stones fallen from the W wall beneath the collapsed mud-brick suggests that the wall fell in one piece. Although the floor was not well-trodden, the amount of pottery shows that the room was used. So the small number of tile frag- ments (in comparison to those in rooms 2 and 4) must mean that they were more intensively collected for re-use elsewhere. Examination of building 4 suggested that the floor would be best preserved in the NW quarter, and this was excavated (Fig. 87) together with a narrow extension through the S doorway. The floor was clearly recognizable, but yielded few finds, and there was no central hearth or other revealing feature. The pot- tery from the floor is similar in date and shapes to that from building 3. A curved fragment of lead, roughly oval in section (1. 10.1, w. 1.0, th. 0.5 cm) and perhaps part of a plain ring ca 10cm in diameter, is of uncertain purpose (Fig. 88); and there were two roughly oval pebbles slightly larger than those in room 17. These finds do not support Papavasiliou's suggestion (AE 1903, 133) that this was officers' quarters, nor other sug- gested functions (storeroom, look-out post, cook-house). Excavation below the floor in the NW and SE comers of the trench, and in the S extension, showed that the walls were built on bedrock or previous firm earth surfaces, without a founda- tion trench; the floor was then levelled by bringing in fill and cutting down rock projections. One flattened outcrop may have supported a roofpost, for the building is ca 9 x 8m internally. The floor had been lost in the S extension, and there were no earlier floors, but pottery from the lowest stratum was all early: PG or G. A third trench was opened late in the season against the S fortification wall at a point W of the later cross wall, although due to shortage of time it could not be completely excavated. Beneath a more or less stone-free surface layer, a fill of earth and stones was found, packed against large unworked stones, perhaps fallen from the wall, as well as against rock outcrops. Since the easiest line of approach to the hill top runs here, this fill may represent a road packing, laid, perhaps, when the wall was already dilapidated. This would be most intelligible in the LA period, when the construction of the cross wall made this part of the original circuit no longer necessary. The only signif- icant sherd, apparently PG, suggests an earlier date, but a single sherd is weak evidence, and the construction date of the origi- nal circuit remains unknown. Six soil samples from buildings 3 and 4 were taken down the hill for wet sieving. It is hoped that study of the vegetable remains (by A. Sarpaki) and the bone and shell (by S. Wall Crowther) will tell us more about the diet and environment of the Phylla garrison.' Vasiliko. A rectangular stone-built cist tomb was recorded at the site of Souvala. (ADelt 296) Skyros.

Part of a large rectangular LR building, consisting of two communicating rooms, one of which was used as storage space, was investigated in Odos Kottorou. Among the finds was an aeolic capital of the 3rd-4th Cts AD. (ADelt 318-19) Delphi. At the site of Agia Varvara, SW of the mod. town, where archaeological remains have been recorded in the past, the remains of an A peribolos were excavated, similar to those attested in the Apollo and Athena Pronaia sanctuaries at Delphi (polygonal masonry). In the destruction level of the first phase of the peribolos were discovered two echinoi of Doric capitals, of the form current ca 600 BC, and fragments of a basalt altar eschara. The later use of the area is associated with the remains of a LR farm and a built cistern. (ADelt 319-20) Theatre. At the request of the Ephorate at Delphi and the anastylosis service of the Archaeological Service, J-F. Bommelaer, with architect M.B. Sagnier and a team from the French School, visited the site to report on the conservation and partial reconstruction of the theatre. They concentrated for the moment on the koilon: they found the drawings made in 1965- 1966 and made necessary additions (elevations of certain walls and full measurements of levels to assess the extent of defor- mations of the monument). They also compiled a computer index of each of the seating blocks (location, description, pho- tographs and short summary): 108 altogether, to which a few others might later be added. The report, with a file of pictures and catalogue of blocks, analyses the state of the monument, discusses the problems of reconstruction and makes suggestions as to the final result to be achieved and the means of achieving it, whilst respecting the original monument, the rules of architecture and the principles of the Charter of Venice. Museum. Within the framework of the preparations for the volume Bronzes Orientaux et orientalisants, Claude Rolley (French School), carried out in 1999 a week's study of the seals and scarabs (plus one unpublished artefact) in the Delphi Museum. This is a small but interesting collection, which deserves particular study. Kirra. Parts of the W and N sections of the fortifications of C Kirra were investigated in Odos Plate and in the N part of the mod. town. At the former site the walls, after a straight stretch 7m long, formed a rectangular projection 2m wide, and then continued to the SW; the thickness of the wall at this point was 1.20m. The N section of the fortifications was revealed for a length of 14.30m, including the remains of a square tower. Along its S side a destruction level was identified. In Odos Panagias the architectural remains of four distinct phases were uncovered, only the last of which was represented by architec- tural remains: part of a building and an undisturbed deposit with MH pottery. In the rest of the plot the LH and MH layers were disturbed by building activities of the C period. The existing evidence indicates that this area marked the N edge of the C town. (ADelt 317-18) Medeon. Two architectural students, R. Roux and L. Delfour, supervised by architect B. Sagnier (French School) carried out cleaning and recording work on the tholos tomb of Medeon. The aim was to fill the gaps left in the recording after the exca- vation by Olivier Pelon in 1966 (BCH 91 (1967) 853-70). During the cleaning work it was discovered that two cut blocks from the last preserved course had fallen into the chamber since 1966, but their initial position could be restored without difficulty. It was also possible to pick out the Myc floor level which appeared in the walls of the lateral chamber and on the wall opposite the entrance to the main chamber. This was exact- ly horizontal and seems to have suddenly appeared as the result of a differential reaction to air and light in the course of time by the stone which had hitherto been buried. In addition to the plan of the tomb and a cross-section of the dromos made in 1966, the team was able to draw a ground plan, a section on the line of the dromos and a section crossing the lateral chamber, as well as a complete record of the latter. They distinguished the tomb itself from the rectangular enclosure added to it in HL times, which is shown on the original plan without any explanatory note. Finally they drew the elevations stone by stone to give an idea of the original workmanship. This study will appear in Volume II of the series: S. Miiller Celka, Les tombes Myceniennes de Medeon de Phokide: architecture et mobilier. NORTHWEST GREECE Actium. The results of the second season of the Actium Project, a collaboration between the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities and the ASCS, are given in ADelt 856, 864-6. This report by W.M. Murray (ASCS) was given in AR 1994-95, 32. Agios Menas: Boila rock shelter. A second excavation season was carried out in 1994. Of the C14 dates produced for samples of the first season, the sample regarded as most reliable gives a date of 13,810±130 BP for the lower archaeological horizon (II). It is clear that Boila only partly overlaps the sequence at nearby Kleidi (16,500-13,000 BP). A new trench along the outer edge of the shelter produced a new horizon (N) with more tools and fewer organic remains; it will need further study. The Med grave discovered in 1993 was excavated (one extended female burial, 25-30 years old). Apart from this intrusion the Pal sequence was preserved undisturbed in the trench. Trenches against the back wall of the shelter pro- duced few finds, but rich organic remains in the upper levels, and quantities of animal bones in the lower levels, including not only goat but also deer. (ADelt 832-5) Arta (anc. Ambracia) (AR 1998-99, 63-4). A further 10 build- ing plots were investigated in 1994, bringing the total number to 206. Most provided further evidence for the anc. city's hous- ing and road and drainage systems. Houses often remained in use, with minor repairs and alterations, for several centuries. Two houses in plot 200 on Agias Paraskeves St were founded in the A period, reused in C times and not abandoned until the end of the 4th Ct BC. Hoards of miniature vases were found in both these houses. Stratigraphy was disturbed by seven postByz pits and six postByz graves. A house in plot 196 on Agiou Vasileiou St, occupied from the C to the ER periods, was notable for a row of rectangular pillar foundations built of small stones, prob- ably indicating an open-sided area with a tiled roof; animal bones and shells were found on the floor here. This house also had a deposit of 4th-Ct BC miniature vases, and was much dis- turbed by a large number of Byz. pits. Antiquities were recorded in 22 places during the construc- tion of Arta's new drainage system. Many of the remains could be associated with discoveries made in adjacent rescue excava- tions and helped to fill out the picture of not only HL Ambracia</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 65 but also Byz and postByz Arta. An unusual find was an anc. stone-built well beneath the mod. fish market in Karaiskaki St. The continuations of the two walls enclosing the S section of the peribolos of the well-known church of the Virgin Paregoretria were found only 0.30m below the modem surface. City walls. A 6.80m length of a fortification wall already known from neighbouring plots was found in plot 199 in the 3rd alley offArachthou St. Only one face was uncovered, preserved to a maximum height of 1.90m, and built of blocks 1.30-1.70m in width. Associated pottery and finds suggest that it was con- structed during the 5th Ct BC, which makes it difficult to place in the general topography of the anc. city. Its building style also differs from that of the main circuit. Part of the latter was uncovered on Mostraion St, during excavation of the new drainage system. SW cemetery. A section of road was excavated between plots 166 and 195, both of which had contained parts of an anc. avenue flanked by funerary periboloi. The connecting section of the anc. road was found beneath the mod. one, covered by a thick level of silt from the Arachthos. Fragments of tombstones and 31 bronze coins were discovered in the road fill. Five of the coins were from the local mint (238-168 BC) and one was from Nikopolis (Augustan period). Pottery from the mixed fill dated from the 5th Ct BC to R period. E cemetery. In plot 204 in the Koutsomyta locality, two pithos burials were located and partly destroyed during the exca- vation of foundation pits. Both pithoi had exceeded a metre in length. One was plain, the other had bands of plastic rope deco- ration. The plain one contained fragments of a strigil, and parts of another were found near the decorated pithos. (ADelt 370-82) In 1998, 12 further plots were excavated. The majority yield- ed further remains of anc. Ambracia's city plan and cemeteries. Two revealed sections of the fortifications, in the N and S of the city. That in the N was notable for having both a 4th-Ct BC and an earlier phase. That in the S, where a 35m length was uncov- ered, was 5.50-7.70m wide, and built of large limestone blocks. (Epyov Y'TTTO 1998, 103) Dodone. Continued investigations at the site, by Chr. Soule, A. Vlachopoulou and K. Gravane, in the S part of the prytaneion, revealed a number of rooms and a corridor leading to the N. To the W was located a mass of mud-bricks from the walls which were destroyed in 167 BC, and in one of the rooms, part of the tile roof; some of the tiles from it were inscribed (AioS Ndou). In the easternmost room of the wing and in the corridor was dis- covered an ECh layer. Excavations in the stoa, E of the prytaneion, revealed five more columns of the internal colonnade and, with gaps, the steps of the facade. (Ergon 1999, 67-8) Doliana (34km NW of Ioannina). During the construction of the new road from Ioannina to Kakavia remains of a possible R water conduit were uncovered in the Prophetes Elias locality, near the springs of the Kalamas river, where a LN encampment was excavated and R remains are known. (Epyov YT77TO 1998, 104) Ioannina. Two marble statue heads of unknown provenance were handed over to the Ephorate by police officer M. Katsaounos, after being seized as stolen antiquities. One repre- sents a woman, the other Herakles; both date to the 4th-Ct BC.

This imposing, long, narrow hill to the SE of the Lake of Ioannina is known for Upper Pal and EN-LN habitation in two caves on its slopes, and LBA-EIA remains on the plain immediately below it, while its summit is encircled by fortifications of polygonal masonry, noted by Leake. Dakaris identified the site as anc. Tekmon and held some ruins within the walls to be those of public buildings and a temple. In 1994 a rescue excavation took place within the SW of the enceinte, previous to the planning of all the visible sum- mit remains. Two structures, A and B, possibly the N and S wings of the same building complex, were cleared, and building A was excavated to below foundation level, where a stratum with local PR sherds was encountered. The building, which used the interior of the fortification as its W wall, had five chambers. It was founded towards the end of the 3rd Ct BC and contained two destruction levels. The earlier yielded HL domes- tic pottery and other finds, roof tiles and coins which indicated that it had been occupied throughout the HL period. The later stratum produced LR domestic pottery and many pithos sherds, suggesting that the building had then been used for storage; many fallen stone slates may have been the roofing material of this stage.</page><page sequence="64">66 DAVID BLACKMAN 90. Kastritsa, fibulae Notable finds included two fine fibulae, one bronze and one silver, with incised decoration (Fig. 90), and a bronze plaque, originally covered in silver, bearing an engraved scene of three standing forms. Two, with a cross between their heads, may have represented co-emperors, while the third, possibly winged, may have been an archangel. In the upper fill of one chamber 237 bronze coins dating to the 4th-6th Cts were discovered. A number were of the Vandal period; amongst them were a few Ostrogoth examples of the time of Baduila (544-549 AD). The latest identifiable coin was one of Maurice from the Thessalonike mint, 582-3 AD. This provided a terminus post quem for the abandonment of the building. A further 86 LR/EByz coins were recovered from the other rooms. Only the upper stratum was excavated in building B. This corresponded to the LR stratum in building A, and again there was evidence that the complex was used for storage at this period. (ADelt 363-7) Kokkinopelo, Preveza. A Lower Pal stone hand axe was found at this known Pal site. (Epyov YT1TO0 1998, 104) Konitsa. Ch. Karakoglou and D. Kafetzes of this town present- ed a further collection of surface finds from the general area to the Ephorate (AR 1997-98, 69). These included the base of a 1 st/2nd Ct blown glass vessel from Aetopetra; EIA pithos sherds, a PCor bg sherd, plain HL sherds and part of a 3rd/2nd Ct BC lagynos from Heliorache; decorated LH IIIC and EIA pithos sherds from Kallithea; a NW Greek matt-painted amphora han- dle and C sherds from Kleidonia; flint tools, handmade sherds and a conical loom-weight fragment from Lakkos, Kastania; R sherds including part of an Arretine ware plate (lst/2nd Ct) from Palaiogoritsa; and HL sherds and an iron spearhead from Ziavisko in the Ao6s gorge. (ADelt 391-2) 91. Liatovouni, warrior burial Liatovouni. An important new cemetery has been excavat- ed on Liatovouni Hill, which rises from the Konitsa Plain at the confluence of the Ao6s and Voodomates rivers. The cemetery, which has affinities with Vitsa, had 101 tombs ranging from the 13th/12th to the 5th/early 4th Cts BC. Of these, 96 were rectan- gular, ovoid or irregular pit graves, forms which continued throughout the life of the cemetery; the other five tombs were three tile graves, a pithos burial and an incomplete cist grave. Some of the pit graves were framed with pebbles or had stones along one of their longer sides. Most were covered by stone heaps, and were in groups, but no sign of tumuli was found. Inhumation was the sole rite, and single burial the rule, though earlier graves were sometimes reused in later periods. The dead were laid extended, directly on the earth, except in one case where the body was placed upon, and covered by, some perish- able material, possibly branches. The earliest grave, a 13th/12th Ct warrior burial (Fig. 91), contained two bronze swords (Fig. 92), two bronze spear-heads 92. Liatovouni, bronze sword</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 67 93. Liatovouni, kantharos (one lanceolate), eight omphalia, and numerous bronze buttons or tutuli which had probably decorated a leather breast-plate. Other chance finds of this period (probably from destroyed tombs) included another bronze sword of 13th- Ct type and part of a bronze vessel with a bucranium handle. 94 Liatovouni, Thirty graves of the 10th-8th Cts BC pro- duced much local matt-painted pottery including beaked jugs, kantharoi (Fig. 93), amphoras, oinochoai, askoid jugs and dou- ble vessels. Spectacle fibulae were predominant amongst the jewellery. Spear-heads, bronze in the earlier graves and iron in the later, and curved and straight iron knives were also found. Only 10 burials were of 7th-6th Ct date, possibly indicating a decline in population at this period. The dead were accompanied by imported Cor vases, local painted wheelmade pottery, and spear-heads, curved knives and two swords, all of iron. The 39 C tombs were furnished chiefly with Attic pots, notably a bf lekythos with representations of Athena in a chari- ot, Apollo with his lyre and Hermes. Amongst the jewellery was a silver pin ending in a lion's head. Glass vessels included some fine examples of the Phoenician type. Iron spear-heads and knives were again present. Bronze vessels were notable finds in the cemetery. There was a bowl of the 9th/8th Ct BC, but most were of 6th-5th Ct Cor workmanship. Amongst them were an olpe, a spherical oinochoiske, an aryballos, a trefoil-necked oinochoe and a beaked jug with a protome of a female wearing a polos deco- rating its handle (Fig. 94). Many other finds, notably pins, fibulae and fragments of metal vessels, probably from destroyed burials, were gathered from the area round the graves. The hill also has a settlement in which a 1994 test revealed pebble house foundations; and later fortifications were noted by Hammond. The chance find of a stone shaft-hole axe head, possibly N, may indicate earlier occupation of the area. (ADelt 367-70) Leukas (AR 1998-99, 64-5). In 1994 the area of the anc. city was the subject of a surface survey. Visible remains were pho- tographed and entered on a large-scale topographical plan, preparatory to the establishment of a protected zone. The anc. city was situated on three hills to the W and a plain bounded by the sea on the E. The W trace of the fortification wall, follow- ing the irregular natural line of the hill summits and slopes, was well-preserved, and two square towers were located. A part of the E trace was identified running parallel to and at a little dis- beal tance from the coast; it was pierced at intervals by gates leading to the anc. harbour. The N and S parts of the circumvallation had only occa- sional scant remains and their exact course could not be followed. Within the walls, many building remains and terrace walls were located on the summit of the cen- tral hill. The bedrock had been extensively quarried, and formed into the bordering walls of anc. roads and flights of steps leading up the slopes. On the plain the city had been organized according to the Hippodamian system, but this had had to be abandoned on the hill slopes, where the topography did not lend itself to a rectangular plan. (ADelt 392-3) Three building plots excavated in the wider area of the anc. city in 1998 yielded a large part of a R country house, part of the N trace of koed jug asalb the city wall and some LA-C graves. (Epyov YTTTTO 1998, 104) N cemetery (Tsechlimbou locality) (AR 1998-99, 65). In the building plot of M. Morphese were found a section of the anc. funerary road, part of a probable peribolos, and 36 tombs: 8 stone sarcophagi, 20 cist graves, 5 tile graves and 3 pit graves. The burials, which dated from early 5th-early 2nd Cts BC, were usually single, but there were instances of reuse, two to four times being not uncommon. A cist which contained bones of nine people was apparently being utilized as an informal char- nel house. Two of the tile graves were set on top of sarcophagus covers. Another, a child burial, contained 11 4th-ct BC bronze coins in a small bowl; the coins, from the mints of Leukas, Corinth and Thesprotian Elea, all had representations of Pegasos on the obverse. Other finds from the cemetery includ- ed pots, mostly local but also some fine imports, lamps, coins, a set of eight dolls, a gold oak leaf, strigils and a possible money-box of bronze. A small cist constructed from four re- used tombstones contained late 3rd/2nd-Ct BC cremations instead of the customary inhumations. Two bg pyxides decorat- ed in the West Slope style, each with three moulded feet repre- senting sphinxes (Fig. 95), were used as ash-urns; they were accompanied by one spherical and three fusiform unguentaria, an oinochoe, an alabastron and another pyxis. Two of the tomb- stones used for this cist and four others found in the excavations had flat tops with a band and concave-convex moulding, below which was engraved a single name. (ADelt 388-90) S cemetery (Spasmene Vryse locality) (AR 1997-98, 70; 1998-99, 65-6). During the digging of a ditch along the E boundary of the previously-investigated Vlachou plot, six more stone slab cist tombs of the usual type with cut and fitted cor- ners were encountered. Like other tombs in this area, they were earthquake-damaged. Finds, dating to the mid-4th-early 3rd Cts. BC, included oinochoai, unguentaria, a wreath with thin gold leaves, a gold danake, and a silver Cor obol with a winged Pegasos. Also found in the ditch was a tombstome of the same type as those from the N cemetery, above. (ADelt 390-1) In 1998 the new museum halls in the recreation centre of mod. Leukas were fitted out, and exhibits selected for them. It was expected to open in mid-1999. (Epyov Y7TT70 1998, 105)</page><page sequence="66">68 DAVID BLACKMAN 95. Leukas, pyxis Kavallo. Boliatso cave. In 1994 the Ephorate of Spelaeology carried out a short test excavation of the cave reported to the Service in 1992: a small cave (50m2) with two chambers linked by a short corridor. Illicit excavation had seri- ously disturbed the stratigraphy. Pottery ranged from LNII (with flint tools, worked locally) to LA to LHL pottery of dedi- catory character (with figurines)-clearly the cave was dedicat- ed to the Nymphs. The pottery and figurines were local or Cor imports; the figurines resemble finds from the shrine of Ayia Kyriake Nydriou, and the Asvotrypa cave in Phryni, a suburb of Levkas town. Work will continue in the hope that lower levels will be less disturbed. (ADelt 841-3) Michalitsi (ca 3km NE of Nikopolis). Two tile graves were uncovered during roadworks in the Koukos locality, in which other similar graves have previously been found. One was com- pletely empty; the other had no bones, but contained a small clay basin within which was a 4th-Ct BC skyphos. (ADelt 387) Nikopolis. Konstantinos Zachos reports on the progress of the Cleopatra multi-disciplinary research programme (AR 1998-99, 67-8). The surface survey covered a total of 483 agricultural holdings in the areas outside the R fortifications. For each hold- ing a record was made of the geomorphology, geographical position, state of cultivation, installations such as wells, pump- ing systems, greenhouses, sheds, availability of public utilities (water-supply, electricity, telephone and roads), fences and dwellings, as well as visible antiquities and movable finds. From the survey much new information was gained on the course of the anc. aqueduct, previously visible near the villages ofArchangelos and Kanali; it was found to have branched to the E, probably to supply the gymnasium and perhaps the stadium and the northern baths. New discoveries were also made concerning the W, SW and S cemeteries lining the roads that led from the respective city gates to the city's harbours, and about the courses of these roads. To the W of the city's W gate, and near the shore of the Ionian sea, a building complex of monumental character, possi- bly a public foundation, had walls in opus mixtum and semi-cir- cular niches set in the long walls of one of its buildings. Geophysical testing took place over extensive areas of ten holdings both within and without the fortifications. Several dif- ferent methods were used according to the nature of the terrain. Results were obtained in all cases, and it was often possible to distinguish whether the recorded anomalies represented tombs or buildings, and to estimate their state of preservation. Computerized records were completed for 550 agricultural holdings, containing previously-recorded information and bibli- ography, the results from the surface survey, and those from geophysical prospection where appropriate; 150 records of indi- vidual monuments and 400 of finds were also finalized. (ADelt 395-400) In 1998 work on the monument of Augustus and the villa of Antoninus continued (AR 1998-99, 67) with some excavation taking place at each. Amongst finds at the former was a clay relief of the she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus. Land adja- cent to the villa was expropriated to allow its complete excava- tion. Cleaning of the stadium exposed the track, the vaulted double entrance and sections of walling. (Epyov Y1TO70 1998, 104-5) Perigiali, Platystoma (Leukas). Professor M. Philippa- Apostolou discovered previously unknown building remains in thick shrub on the E slopes of Mt Skaros, about 500m NW of Perigiali village. A 16m-long wall in good polygonal masonry had a return to the W at either end, forming a TT-shaped struc- ture. Another, shorter length of wall in the same style found at a little distance, may have been connected; pithos sherds and roof tiles were collected from its vicinity. The building(s) seemed to be isolated: the closest known antiquities are tile graves discovered ca 700m to the N during the construction of a camping ground, and Dorpfeld noted polygonal masonry some distance away on the S slopes of Mt Skaros, at the NE edge of the Nidri Plain.

(Epyov YJ17O 1998, 103-4) Smyrtoula (ca. 3km NE of Nikopolis). Part of an anc. clay con- duit was discovered a little to the SW of Augustus' monument on Michalitsi Hill.

Work concentrated on three chambers in the W of the villa's main wing. In room 7 another fine, though incomplete, mosaic floor was uncovered. It consisted of 4-5 decorated rectangular borders which enclosed a square panel containing a central cir- cle surrounded by semi- and quarter-circles. The semi-circles each had a central stylized plant motif, while the remainder of the design consisted of abstract curvilinear or geometric pat- terns. White tessarae were used for the background, and black or dark green for the borders and major themes, augmented by violet, yellow and rose.

Tsoukalia site decorated by a band of plaster moulding. Moveable finds were similar to those of the previous year; one of two coins recovered was struck by the Nikopolis mint in the reign of Caracalla. (ADelt 282-5) The Ephorate received six spherical spindle-whorls and part of a bronze vessel from Th. Floudas, and five bronze coins and a small lead sheet from I. Botsaris, all found in the vicinity of the villa. (ADelt 392) SSW of the villa, on the slopes of the neighbouring hill of Vigla or Mavrovouni, standing ruins thought to be those of R baths were cleared and top-soil excavated sufficiently to allow planning. The central building was a regular octagon, with each side 3.20m long, diam. 7.80m. Six of the sides contained door- ways 1.20m wide, all but one of which still had jambs of grey limestone (Fig. 96). The best-preserved, in the NE wall, also retained a brick-built blind relieving arch above its lintel. A wider opening in the E wall led to a rectangular chamber. Another in the W wall gave onto a chamber placed slightly off- centre, which had an apsidal ground plan and a further opening to the W. Stubs of walls outside the S and SW walls of the octa- gon indicated further chambers. Most of the walls were faced with opus testaceum; the lower part of the rectangular E cham- ber's walls were of opus quasi-reticulatum, while the upper part was of opus testaceum, and the roof had been vaulted. Remains indicate that the octagonal chamber was domed. Fragmentary buildings with walls of unworked stones set in plaster lay con- tiguous to the N side of the octagon. Moveable finds from top- soil included glazed Byz and postByz sherds, ribbed R sherds, marble wall facing, numerous animal bones and a round brick, probably from a hypocaust. (ADelt 386-7) A. Demoulias gave the Ephorate a collection of HL sherds found in fields NE of Vigla or Mavrovouni hill. (ADelt 392) The 1994 results of the Greek-American Southern Epirus Survey, reported by J.

Continuation of the surface survey of the Almyros plain, in co-operation with the Dutch Institute, resulted in the location of a large number of sites, including two PR settle- ments near Xerias (LN, MBA) and 14 sites of R-LR, Byz and Med date. Remains of a HL fortification system were identified at the site of Kastro, while an EN-MN settlement was located on a low hillock to its N. (ADelt 326-7) Alonnisos. (For maritime sites see N.

Its aims were to investigate the site which D. Theocharis had noted as a source of tools, Mikro Kokkinokastro (MPal according to Theocharis), and to look for other Pal sites in SE/SW Alonnisos, notably Glypha. A short trial excavation produced lithic material, but also later material (HL and PR pottery); it will need to be continued to see if the Pal remains are a primary or secondary deposit. (ADelt 839-41) Tsoukalia. Effie F. Athanassopoulos (ASCS) reports on the results of the first field season of the project 'Amphora produc- tion, agriculture and trade: the Alonnisos Archaeological project': 'In this research project our goal is to address the broader archaeological and historical issues to which the analysis of amphoras can contribute. We suggest that the amphora work- shop at Tsoukalia was part of an organized estate and a major element within the agricultural system of Ikos (anc. Alonnisos). This project is taking place in a region of Greece where very lit- tle archaeological research has been undertaken thus far, so it will generate new important information related to agricultural production, manufacturing technologies and the organization of trade. The goals of the first season were to assess the significance of the surface material, to carry out a geophysical survey in order to locate surviving buried structures and to develop a plan for the coming seasons. Our results in some detail: One of our main goals was to survey and map the site of Tsoukalia and document the visible archaeological remains (Fig. 97). We were able to accomplish that task to a satisfacto- ry degree, using a total station connected to a data collector. We took measurements for a large number of points that represent scatters of surface pottery, visible features, modem structures, roads, drainage areas, etc. We downloaded these data into a lap- top and produced a detailed map in AutoCAD while we were still in the field, so we were able to correct errors and improve the accuracy of the map by producing it 'on site'. This base map will be added to and improved in coming field seasons. We include a partial view of the map in this report (Fig. 98). A second goal was to record and map the dense surface scat- ter of ceramics associated with the operation of the amphora pro- duction facility. The site was divided into eight different sectors</page><page sequence="68">70 DAVID BLACKMAN 98. Tsoukalia site representing somewhat distinct scatters of artefacts and also fol- lowing topographical or other barriers (e.g. road, drainage). Some of the dense concentrations of artefacts are located in the lower portion of the hillside, close to the seaside. In sector I there is dense ceramic material which is eroding out of the hill- side. To a large extent this area has been disturbed by souvenir- seekers who have dug several holes in the clearings between the dense vegetation. The more recent holes have produced very large pieces of discarded amphoras. In general, these scatters have been repeatedly picked by visitors and contain few well- preserved handles, bases and other featured sherds. Still, we believe that the systematic documentation of these scatters can provide very useful information. The most dense part of the surface scatter in sector I repre- sents an area of 12 x 12m (Fig. 99). This was divided into a grid of 3 x 3m squares, a total of 16. The ceramics in each square were sorted, counted and weighed. We also took measurements of rim diameter, approximate handle size and the range of vari- ation in the fabric. Some squares in sector I produced a very large amount of material, for example square 5 had over 5,000 ceramic pieces. The same procedures were followed in sector III, where an area of 6 x 6m was studied. The concentration in sector III resulted from hole-digging by visitors-it is quite fresh and has produced very large fragments of broken amphoras. We were not able to extend the systematic surface recording to sector II due to time constraints. Sector II contains a very large pottery dump (Fig. 100), a portion of which has been significantly disturbed (see below). This area will be stud- ied in our next field season. On the basis of the information we are collecting we will be able to document the forms present at the site, along with a sta- tistical breakdown of their relative frequency. It is clear that amphoras represent the overwhelming majority of discarded vessels. There is a small number of open vessels (lekanai?) that could have been used in the production process (e.g. to hold water) and were probably also manufactured at Tsoukalia. There is a minuscule amount of fine pottery represented by two small bg sherds, probably from skyphoi. In addition, the weight figures will provide an estimate of the number of discarded amphoras represented in these piles. In order to accomplish that we will try to obtain weight data from similar types of amphoras that have survived intact (e.g. Peristera shipwreck). Overall, we expect that this information will help us develop a better under- standing of aspects related to the size, volume and duration of the operation of the amphora workshop and will provide the basis for future comparative studies. We expect that through this systematic documentation we will be able to establish the nature of the patterning N ' observed in surface materials. ____ The surface survey will also address the pattem- ing and modifications that have affected the distribu- tion of archaeological materials. This is particularly the case in sector II, a dense ceramic concentration we call the large pottery dump (Fig. 100). This large pottery dump has been repeatedly disturbed in the last decade. There is a variety of cultural transforma- tion processes responsible for this drastic modifica- tion of surface materials at Tsoukalia. In the first place most of the archaeological material became exposed because Tsoukalia has been an area where, in the past, the locals would dig to obtain sand for building purposes. Then the sherds themselves were systematically removed from the site and re-used for building the interior of the domes of the ovens in the local houses, a practice which to a limited degree continues today-a local tavema owner was very proud to show me the new oven he had built using sherds from Tsoukalia. The locals were quick to recognize the heat-retaining properties of the sherds and made extensive use of them in the past. Today most of the material that is removed from the site is taken by tourists and other visitors as souvenirs. Also several local hotels and businesses display bottoms of amphoras or complete handles as decoration. They are valued because they are local products of 99. Tsoukalia, sector I 100. Tsoukalia, sector II</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 71 Alonnisos and as such are displayed with pride. It is interesting, though, that most local people consider them to be recent in date rather than ancient. The folklore of the site is that all this material was produced in the earlier part of this century, by 'Barba-Lykourgos', the owner of a brick operation at Tsoukalia that is discussed below. It seems that this myth has protected the site from more invasive hole digging and further destruction. We also learned that one of the local landowners used a bull- dozer in order to dig a well in the middle of the large pottery dump some 4-5 years ago. He said that he dug to a depth of 4- 5m but was disappointed because he kept finding broken ceramics and eventually gave up. This has been useful informa- tion in order to understand the changes in the appearance of the pottery dump in the last decade. Having in mind all these activities and also the attention that the presence of archaeologists has brought to Tsoukalia, we decided to collect a portion of the surface material to protect it from disappearing. So, at the end of the season the diagnostic material from the areas we studied was collected: it includes handles, rims and bases (a total of 25 boxes). These were stored in space provided by the Mayor of Alonnisos. The remaining surface ceramics were left in place. A limited number of finds was transported to the Museum of Volos by Ms Intzesiloglou. These were diagnostic sherds that need to be drawn and pho- tographed, and among them were four stamped amphora han- dles with the inscription IKION (Fig. 101): the first examples of stamped handles we have from Tsoukalia. Another task for this season was to clear dense vegetation from portions of the site, necessary for the areas that we select- ed for investigation with geophysical techniques. We were then able to make observations about a later period of use of the site, most probably a brief period in the 1920s when a small brick factory was operating there. This was known to us from oral information from several older inhabitants. However, we had not been able to confirm such activities up to now because most of the dense surface material is related to the amphora produc- tion workshop rather than the brick factory. In any case, accord- ing to these accounts the facility was producing bricks and roof tiles, but it was in operation for a brief period of time. It seems that the products were not of high quality and the brick facility ceased its operation after only a few years. After clearing the dense bushes we found several pieces of bricks and a few roof tiles. Some of the bricks were stamped with the initials of the owner of the brick operation. We collect- ed several and plan to use them in comparative studies of the fabric and the clay sources that may be identified in the vicini- ty of Tsoukalia in coming seasons. After we found proof of the existence of the brick factory we carried out more interviews inquiring about the location of specific facilities, including a lime kiln, sheep-pen and other structures linked to the pastoral use of the area in the recent past. Another goal was to initiate the study of the geology of the area and select ceramic samples for petrographic and chemical analysis. Ian Whitbread of the Fitch Laboratory (BSA) spent three days on the island, collecting some samples that could provide information on potential sources of clay in the vicinity of the site. He also selected 30 samples from the surface ceram- ics at Tsoukalia that will be analysed in the Fitch Laboratory. The geophysical investigations were carried out by Apostolos Sarris and his team, using a variety of methods and equipment (fluxgate gradiometer, caesium gradiometer, electro- magnetics) to produce a map of the subsurface in order to locate possible remnants of the installations of the amphora workshop. The preliminary results are very encouraging. There is a structure 101. Tsoukalia, amphora handles of significant proportions (20 x 5m) at an approximate depth of 1m. It has produced a very strong signal and Dr Sarris suggests that this could be a kiln structure. Additional geophysical survey with other instruments (e.g. ground penetrating radar) could pro- vide further information and a three dimensional profile of the structure. At the moment it is unclear if that structure is indeed part of the amphora workshop. Only excavation can determine the precise character and function of the building. So far we cannot identify with certainty the location of the kiln(s) of the workshop. It could be the structure identified by Dr Sarris' team but there is also the possibility that we have sev- eral kilns at the site, judging from the volume of the discarded material. First of all, we believe that a kiln must have been located near the large pottery dump, and a likely place is a vis- ible circular depression next to the sheep pen where our inform- ants have said that the kiln of the brick factory was located (marked as a 'possible kiln' on Fig. 98, sector IV). The surface indications are consistent with such a use: in the immediate vicinity there is baked clay and fragments of tile and brick embedded in it. It is also interesting to note that according to the oral accounts, the brick factory re-used the old facilities. If indeed the amphora workshop kiln was located there and was re-used by the brick-making operation, its original configura- tion has probably been substantially modified. The area is heav- ily disturbed, and thus the magnetometry will probably not be able to provide useful data.</page><page sequence="70">72 DAVID BLACKMAN 102. Lianokokkala, Doric temple A preliminary study was undertaken by Dr Evangelos Kabouroglou, a geomorphologist, of the Ephorate of Spelaeology. He is interested in reconstructing coastline changes in Alonnisos in the past, including the C period when the amphora workshop was in operation. He found evidence for multiple layers of preserved beach rock in the area near Tsoukalia and noted that the dense scatter of broken amphoras continues in the small bay and covers a sizeable area that is now underwater. Dr Kabouroglou is certain that the sea-level has risen since classical times and that there has been considerable seismic activity in the area. At this point it is not clear how localized or island-wide were the changes in the coastline. The Mayor has already succeeded in fencing the '' site. We have agreed that the final goal should be to organize Tsoukalia as an archaeological site open to the public and to organize electronic exhibits that would provide reconstruction of the activities of the | amphora workshop.'

A section of the W fortification walls of the anc. settlement, including a small part of a square tower, were exca- vated in the Papavasileiou plot. The thickness of the wall, of which only the two outer stone faces survive, was 3.07m. Of the tower, only the toichobate was preserved. Along the inner side of the walls was identified the line of an anc. road, 2.70m wide, other sections of which have been discovered on the inside of the fortifications at various points. The line of the walls at this point marks the W limit of the anc. settlement. (ADelt 331) Kastraki Almyrou. On the hill of Kastraki, S of the mod. town ofAlmyros, remains of an EH III settlement were uncovered on the N side, and a small C fortification peribolos at the top. One of the most characteristic architectural remains of the settlement was an apsidal building, entered from the S and using the her- ring-bone masonry typical of this phase in central/S Greece (Pefkakia, Orchomenos, Lera, Tiryns) and in the NE Aegean area (Therme, Troy). To the next habitation phase belongs a rec- tangular room (4 x 4.70m) with a trodden earth floor, stone tools and domestic pottery of the MH period; this building was destroyed by fire. The LBA levels consist of poor-quality archi- tectural remains and pottery. The last phase at the site was rep- resented by the C fort, and dates to the 4th-3rd Cts BC. Moschato. At the site of Lianokokkala, 2km W of the mod. vil- lage of Metropole, built over the anc. town of the same name, were investigated the remains of a temple dedicated to Apollo (inscription). The temple, built in the mid-6th Ct, was apparently destroyed by fire in the 2nd Ct BC. It was a Doric peripteral tem- ple (hekatompedon, 5 x 11 columns) with an interior colonnade (five surviving bases of columns/piers in the cella) (Fig. 102, from the E). The foundations, the pteron (lower drums of 12 columns) and the lower parts of the walls were built of local stone, while the superstructure was of mud-brick and wood (roof) covered with Cor type roof-tiles. The surviving architec- tural remains suggest that the original columns of the pteron were wooden, and were gradually replaced in stone. The base for the cult statue lay in the middle of the cella, while at the level of the fourth column from the E was found a mud-brick wall, defining an adyton area to the W.

Various measures were taken for the protection of the shipwreck. A trench that had been begun in 1993 received continued attention, and 80 additional amphoras were removed, as well as ceramic ware. The excavation ended shortly before reaching the bottom of the trench.' Psathoura Island. Amphoras from a shipwreck of the 4th Ct BC were found in 1994 at a depth of 10-15m, 500m SE of the lighthouse. (ADelt 864) Phthiotic Thebes. Close to the E side of the anc. fortification walls, and 250m SE of the anc. theatre, discovered in 1992, part of a R building was uncovered (coins and pottery of the 2nd-3rd Cts AD) consisting of parts of six different rooms, built over a 4th-Ct BC house. The interior of the walls of the R building was coated with white plaster, while the roof was covered with Laconian type roof-tiles. Judging by the deposits in rooms 3-6, which included small bronze objects and a great number of amorphous bronze sheets, iron nails, small iron rods, etc., it seems that the building was being used as a small workshop for the production of bronze objects. Stratigraphical investigations on the anc. acropolis, which occupies the E part of the walled section of the anc. town, resulted in the confirmation of the existence of a LN settlement on the top of the hill, despite the lack of architectural remains. Characteristic was the absence of incised and crusted ware, which comprised almost 50% of the material from earlier exca- vations on the site (A. Arvanitopoulos, 1907-08). In the same disturbed layer were recorded EBA sherds, showing the contin- ued inhabitation of the area. The next traces of occupation date from the EA period. The first shrine, dedicated to Athena Polias, was represented by a small apothetes, with dedications com- prising mostly bronze jewellery, clay figurines and a helmeted terracotta protome of Athena. The second shrine on the site, dated to the mid-5th Ct BC, was again not represented by any architectural remains (one inscription). The present temple, dat- ing from the 4th Ct BC and making use of old building materi- al, was still functioning in the R period. During ECh and Byz times activity on the site was intense. During the 5th Ct AD, the town shrank, as a result of the establishment of the Ch town of Phthiotic Thebes at the site of the anc. harbour of Pyrasos. (ADelt 321-4) Pyrgos Kieriou. Part of an anc. road was located in the Theodorou plot. (ADelt 328) Surface Survey: At Porte, at the site of Paliokastro, on a hill on the W slopes of Itamos, an anc. fortified settlement was identi- fied, and survey in the area around Palamas, yielded archaeo- logical material dating from the LN, EH, MH and Myc periods. Settlements of N date were identified in the area of Orphana, while at the site of Petromagoula, in the area of Metamorphose, an EN-LN settlement was located. (ADelt 333-4) PHTHIOTIS Achinos. At the NE edge of the cemetery of anc. Echinos, two cist tombs of ECh date (5th-7th Ct AD) were excavated, and at the Metsos plot two tombs of HL date (cist, pit grave) were investigated. In the same area a group of MH vases was col- lected. (ADelt 313) Glypha. At the site of Phanos, during the second season of exca- vation of tumulus B, the remains of an EMyc cist tomb (three contracted burials) and of two other destroyed cists were uncov- ered in the SE part of the tumulus, from its first period of use. Five LR pit graves were also recorded in the area. (ADelt 309) Halai. The 1994 study season (ADelt 313-15) was reported in AR 1994-95, 38. John E. Coleman (ASCS) reports on the 1999 study season: 'The summer of 1999 was largely taken up with Neolithic Halai. Study continued on the architectural and stratigraphical record in area F, and on pottery and lithics found in N levels. During cleaning and conservation operations in area F, we also constructed a stone retaining wall to support the LR church. We also carried out a brief conservation operation in LR levels in area A.' Lamia. Public works in the area of Taratsa, at Agia Paraskeve, 2km NNE of the mod. town of Lamia, resulted in the partial destruction of an anc. cemetery, which was subsequently exca- vated systematically. In all, 110 tombs were investigated, including 60 shallow slab-lined pits, 21 tile-roofed graves, and 18 simple pit burials of the Byz period, as well as 11 cist graves with contracted burials dating from the LMyc and the PG peri- ods. In the same area were excavated the remains of LMyc building, with a destruction layer and two consecutive stone- paved floors. All five rescue excavations conducted in the mod. town of Lamia uncovered only funerary remains of the HL period. In Odos Papakyriaze four cist graves were excavated, part of the SE cemetery of the anc. town, while at the junction of Odos Skoupha and Prometheos, four more tombs were recorded, including three cists and one tile-roofed grave. At the junction of Odos Skopelou and Parodos Tsaltake two chamber tombs were investigated, of rectangular or irregular shape, part of the</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 75 N cemetery of anc. Lamia; one of them had three rock-cut couches, and a rectangular cutting in the middle; the entrance was blocked by a poros slab. One more cist grave was record- ed, in Odos Kretes. (ADelt 301-9) Loutra Ypates. On the left side of the road to Ladikous build- ings of LR date were investigated (SW comer of rectangular room, with part of a floor). (ADelt 311) Malesina. Excavations were undertaken around the church of Agios Georgios (Panagia Melinitzis). Known from earlier investigations, this MByz church was the katholikon of a monastery, remains of which were uncovered. Opus sectile and sculptured fragments were uncovered. (ADelt 360-1) Pelasgia. A cist tomb was excavated at the site of Anemikou. (ADelt 311-13) Stylis. At the junction of Odos Karkale and Zese Divriote, 11 tombs were excavated, including 4 cists, 3 pit graves, 3 tile- roofed tombs, and 1 pot burial, while in the Karanika plot the remains of 10 walls were uncovered, forming at least six rooms and dating from the end of the 4th Ct BC; in the same area three cist tombs were also recorded. (ADelt 309-11) NORTHERN THESSALY Aigane (5km S of Platamona). The ditch for the natural gas pipeline cut through the remains of an anc. fortified city situat- ed on the N and W sides of the Karale height. The rescue exca- vation preceding the work located a few HL architectural remains, pottery (mostly plain domestic), a worn coin, metal objects, loom-weights and a large number of shells. (ADelt 337) Amouri, Elassona. An unusual funerary memorial, now in Larissa Museum, consisted of part of a pyramidal base with two circular sockets in its upper surface for the insertion of a statue. On its chief face was the funerary inscription: Tlap6[piovoS] 6 K[aXouJPEvo] Ka't AlKatoS TTapap6vou Ka' / EuKpaTia EuKp6douS EuKpaTTqV TCV EaurVT)V / uiov EK TCOV iSicv, qrpotaapEvou / TOU ALiqou, and below it was engraved a decree of manumission: TapIeuovTos TfS Tro6EcoS EEuTpoTrou TOU O(aAa3ltoiou / riTrrapXouvToS 'Hyriqav8pou TOU 'ApiaTcovoS / 1rq(vob) 'Apppiou E' 'ETriyovos 6 aTrrAEuO- Epco8EIS / rTT6 TTapa6ovou TOO K(aAouvpEvou) AIKaiOu TOO TTapa6ovou / [EVIKfi E8C.OKEV Ta yEIUo6EVa TV f / [rr6]AEI 85(nvpta) KB&lt;22,5). (ADelt 341) Atrax. Objects from this site acquired by Larisa Museum in 1994 included part of a white marble statue of a young woman, a fragmentary decree inscription, two votive altars, seven votive stelai, nine funerary stelai and a stone osteotheke. These had a date range of 5th-1st Cts BC, the majority belonging to the 3rd Ct. (ADelt 339-41) A team from the Institut Ferand Courby carried out a sea- son of epigraphic documentation on behalf of the French School in collaboration with A. Tziafalias, Ephor of PR and C Antiquities at Larissa, with a view to the publication of the cor- pus of inscriptions of Atrax. The inscriptions recorded in the inventory of the Larissa Museum for 1988-1999 were examined and recorded. These were about 1000, and were known only through the reports in the ADelt and the publications of A. Tziafalias over these years. Some unpublished inscriptions were also examined, and some inscriptions which had been deposited in the museum store- rooms at an earlier date. Dilofo (25km S of Larisa). During work on the natural gas pipeline, building remains and LHIII-PG sherds were found beneath a level of alluvial silt from the neighbouring Platanorema stream. The Dilofo area is already known for a N magoula and C remains on the Livadaki height. (ADelt 338) Grevena. A brief report on the work of the Grevena Project in 1994 appears inADelt 341; this was covered inAR 1994-95, 39. Itea (Vale of Tempe). During work in connection with the nat- ural gas pipeline, a cist grave containing three skeletons and a cooking pot was found NE of the village. Its walls were built of pieces of local schist and broken roof tiles, its covers were schist slabs and another upright slab blocked the entrance at the S end. (ADelt 337-8) Kalambaka. An EIA cist grave was uncovered on the E out- skirts of the town during water supply and drainage works. (Epyov YnTTTO 1998, 113) Theopetra cave. N. Kyparissi-Apostolika reports on the eighth season of excavation in 1994, which concentrated on four areas: (1) excavation in trench A8 was continued and com- pleted, yielding MPal flint tools and a mass of bones of large animals which should provide good dating for this (north) side of the cave, which lacks the carbon remains found in the centre of the cave (which, conversely, does not have bones). (2) Excavation in trench Z7 was continued and completed, produc- ing similar burnt traces and stone tools; coring in the level beneath produced no archaeological finds. (3) A new trench III was opened to the SE to follow the Mes deposit found elsewhere between the N and Pal deposits. Fallen N deposits and a pit had disturbed the level below, but areas of clay and burning found at the sides of the trench prove Mes occupation beyond doubt. (4) In trench Z6 the Mes deposit was found in the north of the trench, dipping southwards under the N deposit. (ADelt 831-2) Kastri, Agia (23km E of Larisa). An EH III or MH I cist tomb was damaged by the mechanical excavator during the digging of a drainage canal immediately S of this village. The tomb had been of grey stone slabs, and the skeleton lay directly on earth, probably in a contracted position. There was a kantharoid pot near its head and a bronze blade by its left shoulder. The grave belongs to the cemetery of the PR settlement of Kastri, which is on the S outskirts of the village, immediately W of the road to Amygdale; this area was settled from LN to LByz. (ADelt 338-9) Kastri, Tyrnavos (anc. Phalanna). A gabled funerary stele of white marble acquired from this site bore a relief of a standing male figure wearing a chiton and a Thessalian petasos. He grasped an upright spear in his left hand, and an unidentifiable object, possibly another spear held diagonally, in his right. (ADelt 341) Krannon. Part of a grey marble funerary stele with an incom- plete inscription from this site was acquired by Larissa Museum. (ADelt 341) Kremastos, Knide (14km NE of Grevena). G. Toufexis gives the results of trials at this N site. Three small and two larger tests were excavated. In the largest, test A, a late EN burnt</page><page sequence="74">76 DAVID BLACKMAN destruction level was found immediately under topsoil. The fierce conflagration had preserved remains of wattle and daub, wall plaster, and also impressions of planks laid side by side. The other tests (one of which produced a pit cut in the bedrock, possibly for storage) showed that the destruction was wide- spread; the site is estimated to have been about 2.5 acres in extent. Sherd material suggests that the area may have been briefly reoccupied at the beginning of LN; there were also a few Byz(?) sherds. The late EN pottery of the destruction has affini- ties both with the few known contemporary W Macedonian sites and with some in the Balkans. Other finds included chipped stone tools of local quartz and chert, a few figurines, whorls in the form of pierced sherd discs, a clay spool and many clay sling bullets. (AEMTH 8, 17-26) Larisa. Work on the reconstitution of the anc. theatre here con- tinued (AR 1998-99, 76). Permits were obtained for the demoli- tion of ten properties and a section of Papanastasiou St. During the demolition, 400 seats from the anc. theatre, which had been reused as building material, were recovered. The theatre seating was restored after a special study, fragile areas of the structure were roofed over, and arrangements were made for pumping away excess rain water. Finally, the ruins were recorded by aer- ial photography and tachymetric planning. Twenty HL graves, part of the S cemetery of anc. Larisa, were uncovered in a plot on the comer of Sefere and Byzantiou Sts. Two R tombs were found on Pourari St, in the Charavge locality (Epyov YJ1770 1998, 112). Three graves, one a cist and two containing clay lamakes, all empty, were discovered during the excavation of foundations opposite the administra- tion block in the 1St Army Camp. These graves also belong to the S cemetery of anc. Larisa (ADelt 338). A funerary stele with a herm engraved on its lower part and a fragmentary inscription of the 4th Ct BC were acquired by Larisa museum. (ADelt 341) Nome of Larisa. A cache of 93 gold and 45 copper coins was confiscated by the police and handed over to the Numismatic Museum for identification. The coins appear to have originated in the area around the village of Melivoia. Coins of the Komnenian dynasty were found, along with cop- per denominations from other periods (not determined). The hoard was apparently found near the site of a ruined Byz monastery identified with that of St John the Theologian. The area was known in Byz times for the wealthy Monastery of the Cells that once operated there. The excavated monastic monu- ments of Kokkino Nero and Belikas belong to the same com- munity. (ADelt 355-6) Mandra (AR 1998-99, 76). In the Prophetes Elias locality the excavation of the LN settlement discovered during the widen- ing of the National Highway was completed. (Epyov YT7TJO 1998, 112) Mouria (8km SSW of Trikala). Agricultural work here turned up a stone slab cist tomb, robbed in antiquity. (ADelt 339) Myrofyllo (42 km SW of Trikala). A rescue excavation in the Diasello locality before the diversion of the Achelo6s River brought to light remains of a HL settlement. (Epyov YTTTTO 1998, 113) Petroporos (anc. Pelinnaion) (15km E of Trikala). A damaged clay larnax with limestone cover slabs was discovered during the excavation of a telephone cable trench on the E outskirts of the village. The skeleton lay extended, with a bronze coin of Pelinnaion (306-197 BC) near its skull. The coin had a head of the nymph Manto on the obverse, and on the reverse a spear- bearing horseman wearing a petasos and chlamys. (ADelt 339) Pharsala. Remains of HL/LHL buildings were uncovered in five building plots; several were beside anc. roads. At Kanada 37, one of two parallel buildings contained a large number of clay figurines. A small marble altar, of a type often dedicated to Apollo in local shrines, was a chance find on the adjacent stone- paved road. More clay figurines were associated with the build- ing at Larises 36, together with much local HL pottery. A num- ber of storage pithoi were excavated in the basement of what had probably been a large, two-storied HL house in the plot on the corner of Ermou and Themistokleous Sts. Many more HL remains were turned up over a wide area of the town during the excavation of trenches for drains and elec- tric cables. A 6.30m length of the W faqade of the city wall was uncovered at Thetidos 33, as was part of an anc. road leading to the gate and tower previously discovered in the adjacent plot. Sherds of all periods from N to MByz were in the mixed fill of a plot on Agia Paraskeve Hill. (ADelt 335-7) Stavros (12km WNW of Pharsala). Three A tombs were exca- vated (Epyov YT7T7O 1998, 112). Sykourio. A LByz settlement was located at the foot of Mt Kissabos, SE of the settlement on the Maritsa river. Pit burials, pottery (plain and glazed) and scant structural remains indicate settlement during a period in which inhabitation is otherwise unattested in the area. An earlier cemetery was identified along- side the settlement. No identification of the site is yet possible. (ADelt 359) Vatolakkos (10km NNE of Grevena). In the Dexamene locali- ty, tests excavated in preparation for irrigation works showed use of the area from PR to HL. (Epyov YT7TO7 1998, 113) Zarkos (32km E of Trikala). In the Petromagoula locality an excavation necessitated by the widening of the national high- way between Larisa and Trikala was completed. A large Myc building with ten rooms, four apsidal buildings, part of a ceme- tery, and a pottery kiln of the MH period were excavated. (Epyov YTTTIO 1998, 112-13) CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessalonike Agora (AR 1996-97, 64; 1997-98, 75; 1998-99, 77). Excavation of the agora continued throughout the year in 1994 and reports are published by G. Velenis and P. Adam-Veleni in AEMTH 8, 159-68 and by the latter in ADelt 433, 465-6. Much work took place on pre- and post-agora pits in the central plateia. Excavation of the row of shops S of the cryptoporticus and the section of the paved road to the S of them (the 'commercial road') was completed. The shops were connected to the crypto- porticus by later-created openings. In 1993 tests in the orches- tra floor of the odeion in the E wing confirmed the existence of an earlier bouleuterion, which would have held about 200 peo- ple and was probably roofed, and had an orchestra floor of opus spicatum. In order to establish its complete plan, in 1994 slabs were removed from the odeion floor, and some of these proved to be inscribed with invitations to contests of single combat, organized by prominent citizens in honour of the emperors. The</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 77 109. Thessalonike, Octagon inscriptions date to 250-260 AD, and thus provide a firm termi- nus post quem for the construction of the odeion floor. In 1994 restoration work on the site included re-erecting the marble entrance from the commercial paved road to the crypto- porticus and further reconstruction of the cryptoporticus itself; the foundation course of the S stoa had new blocks inserted where needed, and much of the odeion, including seating, was restored. The main object of the agora project was to return the site to the citizens of Thessalonike for public use and entertain- ment, and to this end the cryptoporticus was opened on 17th October, 1996 and the odeion on 27th June 1997, when Thessalonike was Cultural Capital of Europe. Both have since been used for exhibitions and performances. Several studies commemorating the late Ephor of Central Macedonia, Julia Vokotopoulou, relate to the agora. G. Velenis gives a well-illustrated account of its planning and architecture: the agora was rectangular, with proportions of 1:2; it occupied the length of an ancient stadium and its area corresponded to three and a half insulae of the ancient city, together with the width of the streets between them. It was very similar in plan to the smaller agora at Philippi, being TT-shaped, with the long N side of the central plateia open to a road below the present Olympou St, and double Corinthian colonnades round the E, S and W sides. Details of the buildings on the E and S sides have been given in AR 1996-97, 64. The agora had several phases, of which the chief was completed in the early decades of the Severans; the overall plan must have been conceived earlier, possibly in the Antonine period. The agora ceased to function in the reign of Theodosius. (AAA 23-28, 129-42) P. Adam-Veleni publishes an ornate marble table support found at the S end of the E wing of the agora, in a level of the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct. The support has the form of a young Dionysos leaning on a satyr against a background of two tree trunks; the piece may be from an Attic workshop. (AAA 23-28, 155-62) P.A. Georgaki discusses a selection of 'West Slope' pottery from the agora area. Over 2,000 sherds have been recovered, the majority from pits beneath the central plateia. (AAA 23-28, 211-22) K. Boli publishes a study on the site's HL wheel- made lamps. The earliest are of Attic types, probably imports, but the majority are from local workshops. (AAA 23-28, 235-54) Arch of Galerius. In 1994 major work was done on the preservation, study, planning, cleaning and restoration of this monument. (ADelt 466-7) Palace of Galerius (AR 1996-97, 65; 1998-99, _ 77-8). In 1994 the enormous task of cleaning and restoring the palace complex continued, the chief objects being the basilica, the nymphaion and the antechamber of the Octagon. The surfaces of the N and W corridors of the palace were restored, and the architectural planning and study of the monuments completed. (ADelt 466) Tests in 1994 on the Octagon's foundations showed that it had two building stages. It was origi- nally designed as a regular octagonal building on a circular foundation (Fig. 109) with an entrance to its elliptical antechamber in the SW, and seven niches of equal size in the interior. Possibly before the building was finished, the plan was altered. The niche opposite the entrance was enlarged by being cut into from the interior. This so weakened the wall containing this niche that it had to be re-faced on the exterior with an additonal wall, which projected beyond the original circular foundation and was supported on fill with larg- er stone blocks under the comers. A symbolic cross between palm branches set in bricks on the inner wall of the enlarged apse suggests that the alteration was to convert the former reception chamber into a chapel. (Ph. Athanasiou, K. Georgiadi, M. Miza, M. Sarantidou, M. Chatseras in AEMTH 8, 169-77) M. Karaberi and E. Christodoulidou give the results of work in 1995. The stylobate of a propylon was found on the S side of the large elliptical antechamber to the Octagon, linking it to the palace's lost S peristyle court, now under appartment blocks. Two green granite columns still lay under the nearest mod. building. HL-R remains continued to be found in tests under the palace's N corridor, its atrium and the Octagon. They lay under a heavy destruction level, caused by an earthquake in the 2nd Ct (cf. Plateia Dioiketeriou) and an extensive fire in the mid-3rd Ct. The most notable find was a LHL metallurgy workshop under the N corridor. (AEMTH 9, 219-31) Two articles in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou are con- cered with this site. The results of M. Karaberi's study of the Octagon (AAA 23-28, 116-128) were covered in AR 1998-99, 77-8. E. Christodoulidou publishes LHL and R lamps from lev- els underlying the N corridor of the palace. The lamps date from the 2nd Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. The absence of 3rd Ct lamps is accounted for by the destructions mentioned above. (AAA 23- 28, 255-62) Plateia Dioiketeriou (Plateia Kyprion Agoniston). A. Tasia, Z. Lola, A. Bachlas, A. Stangos and 0. Peltekes describe the progressive recovery of a very large ER building during 1994- 1995 (see AR 1997-98, 75). This was founded in the 1st Ct BC, at least partly on top of a large HL building, and suffered a vio- lent destruction, possibly caused by an earthquake, in the first half of the 2nd Ct (see Palace of Galerius). Most of its destruc- tion level was preserved undisturbed under a lm deep level of later fill. Its large central court (12m N-S x 24m E-W) was paved with hexagonal bricks, most of which were in situ. The court was surrounded by colonnades on the S, W and N sides, and probably also the E side, which lies under Venizelou St. The N wing of the building is still covered by Byz remains and the</page><page sequence="76">78 DAVID BLACKMAN E wing by the mod. buildings E of Venizelou St; much of the S and W wings has been uncovered, however, and these had an inner series of rooms opening onto the colonnades and court- yard, and in the case of the W wing, an external series of rooms opening onto a paved N-S road, 6m wide. A corridor ran from the central court to this road, dividing the W wing into a N and a S section. The building is likely to have had an upper storey, and fragments of a fresco of high standard, depicting horses, found in the S stoa, are another indication of its importance. It may have been the administrative centre of Thessalonike in the R period. (AEMTH 8, 179-87; 9, 203-9) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, the same archaeologists publish a selection of HL pottery found associat- ed with earlier building remains below the site's major ER building. The categories of pottery presented are mould-made 'Megarian' and 'Homeric' bowls (the latter including a sherd showing Achilles in a chariot) and both imported and local 'West Slope' wares. (AAA 23-28, 199-210) Two of the outer rooms in the W wing of the large ER build- ing contained a number of pithoi and other storage jars, which were burnt in the 2nd-Ct destruction. Their contents was studied by M. Mangafa and the results are given in a very interesting article, sadly published posthumously. The jars had contained three species of wheat, two of barley, rye, oats, and millet; also broad beans and what were probably peas, and various weeds commonly found amongst cultivated crops. More unusual were sesame seeds in great quantity, and the shells of pine nuts; entertaining comment is given on the use of these and the broad beans in antiquity. Also sporadically present in the store were figs, olives and grapes. (AEMTH 9, 209-14) Building plots. At Gr. Palama 8, just W of the Palace of Galerius, in a plot only 50m2 in extent, E. Lambrothanasi- Korantzi excavated R and ECh building remains. In the R build- ing a wall foundation divided portions of two rooms, both with mosaic floors. The W room's floor was in black and white with geometric and curvilinear designs. The E room's beautifully- coloured mosaic had had a central panel with a Dionysiac scene, of which a dancing Maenad with a tambour remained; it was surrounded by a border of panels decorated with birds and fish. (AEMTH 9, 233-8) Near the centre of a plot at Ag. Demetriou 60 (off the NW corer of Plateia Dioiketeriou) was found a stone-built cistern, 3.15 x 3.70m and 4.50m deep. Sherds from its interior were 3rd- Ct. Within the top of it was the remaining base of an oval ECh construction, and 0.50m NE of it was part of a larger, shallow- er ECh cistern, lined with hydraulic cement and floored with large flat rectangular bricks, some with monograms. In the W of the plot was part of a 2nd-Ct building. (ADelt 438-40) Building remains of the 3rd-4th Ct were uncovered in Armenopoulou 14 (near the Rotonda). (ADelt 346-7) In a plot in Kapetan Patrike St, ca 100m NE of the Palace of Galerius, two walls and two drains, all on the same NE-SW orien- tation, were located. A well with an internal diameter of 75cm and hand-holds every 50-70cm was built adjacent to one of the walls. Sherds dated all these remains to the mid-2nd Ct. (ADelt 437-8) LR-Byz-Thessalonike. (Extensive coverage of archaeolog- ical investigations in the city is given in ADelt 486-530. Only selected, significant finds are presented here.) Evidence of the pre-existing Byz fortifications came to light in the Yedi Koule (Eptapyrgion) fortress, more specifically at the tower guarding the entrance. Tower PI (to the NE) was also investigated. Given that it represents an intact tower relatively free from other struc- tures, this may provide much useful evidence for dating the other structures. A blocked-up barrel-vaulted stairway was dis- covered, which originally served to link the floors of the tower. Reports are also filed for excavations in towers 10, 3 and 5. (ADelt 486-9) Remains of the atrium of a large LR building were uncov- ered on 43 Moreas St, including an extension of the mosaic pre- viously found N of the Byz church of the Taxiarchs. The high- quality mosaics represent foliate and geometric motifs sur- rounding what would originally have been facing groups of ani- mals (deer, peacock, seabirds). Much damaged by consequent building, these remains constitute one of the few pieces of evi- dence for structures of the LR/EByz period in this part of the city. A tentative identification and date for the structure would have it the aisle or nave of a 6th-Ct AD basilica. (ADelt 490-1) Excavations in Plateia Dioiketeriou uncovered, amongst many other ECh buildings, a bath house with mosaic floors, which fell into disuse only to be replaced by another bath house on top of it (date unspecified). The latter phase is partly pre- served to a height of 3.80m. Further investigations were also made of the LByz cemetery on the same site. Remains of a small funerary chapel were uncovered. An ECh barrel-vaulted tomb was discovered therein, inside which were found a coin of Justinian I and five bronze coins of Manuel II (1391-1425) and the cemetery itself was located on the remains of an earlier MByz settlement; 64 % of coins found amongst the burials were of the 13th-15th Cts AD. The LByz burials were almost all in wooden coffins, and grave goods included crosses, bracelets, earrings, buttons, etc. Only in one instance was a coin found inside the mouth of one of the deceased. The burials were con- centrated around the chapel, which seems to have had a special significance. One burial involved a woman interred between two thin layers of limestone, possibly because of an infectious disease (plague?). (ADelt 491-5) Part of a paved LR road (cardo) running N-S was located at the junction of Karaole and 54 Demetriou St. The road (ca 4m wide) lies partly under many layers of habitation from EByz to Ott. It seems to have been in use as late as the Ott period, and once defined a R insula NW of the Roman forum. The area included remains of LByz buildings and burials. (ADelt 495-7) Excavations on Agias Sophias 75 encountered HL and LR buildings, used by the 5th Ct AD as workshops. Abandonment at that date was followed by a new large public building (?) with inhabitation continuing until the LByz period, when the area is again filled and deserted. (ADelt 497-500) A LR house with bathing facilities was located on 90 Kassandra St., built on HL remains. A second inhabitation was found a short distance away. Both structures were used and repaired until ca 600, when they were destroyed. The site was used for burials from the 9th to the 15th Cts AD. (ADelt 503) Excavations at 8 Doxatou St, Ambelokipoi, revealed (along with many other sites in the report) a number of burials of all types. These included two separate burial enclosures, one of which (enclosure 4) gave up 274 LR copper coins of the 4th and 5th Cts AD The same enclosure included an elaborate barrel- vaulted burial chamber with white and green marble revetments covering the lower zone, capped by an attached meander orna- mental frieze. Marble plaques were also used for the floor of the chamber, drilled to facilitate decomposition of the remains. This cemetery was levelled and covered by the end of the 4th Ct AD. Painted tombs with foliate and animal motifs are also recorded on 16 Rengoukou St. (ADelt 507-10) Excavations in the uncovered area of the Chortiati stoa (Gennadiou and Menelaou Sts) uncovered five phases from R to Mod. A R house of the 4th Ct AD with painted walls (mar- bling) was destroyed by fire in the 5th-6th Cts AD, and replaced</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 79 110. Thessalonike, Olymbiados St, mosaic floor by a luxurious villa in the 6th Ct AD. Marble revetments adorned the walls and geometric mosaics covered the floors. A second part of this phase (7th Ct AD?) involved the paving of the floor with ceramic tiles and the filling of the atrium floor. An earthquake in the 9th Ct AD ended this phase. After the ruins had been extensively looted for building material, the site was handed over to the Monastery of the Prodromos, remains of which were excavated in the 1930s. A funerary chapel was built, and the area was used for burials of all types (including a bar- rel-vaulted structure approached by two steps); 13th-Ct AD cups were found in some of these burials. In 1391, and again in 1430, the church was converted to a mosque (Siileyman Tzami). (ADelt 510-11) Excavations 10m S of the Acheiropoietos basilica discov- ered six phases of remains, including one of a small bath-house that may have served the clergy of the church, given that it was built shortly after the basilica, on top of R remains. The bath- house was abandoned and re-used as a workshop in the early MByz period. Structural remains attest occupation until modern times. Finds included architectural members and 170 coins of all periods. (ADelt 511-14) On 6-8 Agapinou St, tombs of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD were found under part of the foundations built in the 4th Ct AD for the city's hippodrome. Remains of the hippodrome uncovered included part of a sturdy wall of alternating brick and block courses (1 5m long x 1.30m extant width x 2.50m extant height). This is asso- ciated with a brick-lined opening (4.85m wide) that would have served as the entrance to the monument from the Via Egnatia. Also found were remains of four low marble and rubble walls that would have defined the starting points of the chariot races. (ADelt 514-5) Remains of a 4th-Ct AD metal workshop (?) have been reported at 2 Iasonidou St, including a furnace and two drainage channels made with bricks bearing the X stamp of the Tetrarchic period. A 5th-6th Ct AD public building and a private dwelling succeeded the workshop. These were impressive buildings with marble and mosaic (geometric motifs) floors; remains of rooms surrounding an atrium survive. A humble house was erected in the ruins of this complex in the 'dark age' period (7th-9th Cts AD). The Byz period finds include mostly wells, cisterns and drainage installation, all pointing to the area's use as a workshop. (ADelt 515-7) Part of the gate-house of a Byz monastery (remains of which are reported in ADelt 47, 438) came to light at 33 Athenas St, along with LByz drainage conduits. (ADelt 517-18) More of the fine 5th-Ct AD mosaic floor uncov- ered on Olymbiados St (no. 74) came to light (Fig. 110). As yet, exclusively geometric patterns have been found. Byz walls of various phases were found above the floor. (ADelt 519-20) Information is provided on the excavations near the church of Agia Sophia (7 Parasakaki St). Five phases were identified. The earliest R phase levelled the area to build a large villa urbana with bathhouse. Fragments of non-figural wall-paintings were found, along with a marble portable altar with the depiction of a lion, and a figurine of a seated human male (2nd Ct AD). Destroyed by earthquake, the villa was replaced in the 5th Ct AD with buildings that proba- bly were associated with the new episcopal palace of the city. Traces of opus sectile, and painted and mar- ble revetment decoration were found. Paltry remains of MByz and later phases were also found. (ADelt 521-3) In the E cemetery, 39 tombs from the 3rd to the 6th Ct AD were investigated. Tomb 9 was covered by two parts of a column that had been cut in half lengthwise, and part of a drilled closure panel. (ADelt 523) Excavations in the W cemetery (7 Demosthenous St) uncovered six monumental barrel-vaulted tombs and two cist burials. Tomb II includes scenes from the Old and New Testaments and represents the finest painted tomb found to date in Thessalonike (it is now on display in the new Museum of Byzantine Culture). (ADelt 523-6) Seven more 4th-Ct AD painted barrel-vaulted tombs were uncovered in excavation work for the Tellogleion Foundation buildings of the University. These bore mostly foliate and ani- mal decoration, and appear to have been painted by the same workshop or hand. (ADelt 529-30) Finds of burials and two ossuaries on a LR site (Kitrous and Melenikou Sts, E of the Rotonda) suggest a LByz monastery in the vicinity. (ADelt 526) LR tombs and burials numbering over 200 were found in excavations N of the Evangelismos cemetery. Most are non- Christian, and much material was discovered with the dead, including pottery, jewellery, and figurines, one of which is a rock crystal representation of the fish tillapia nilotica, once wor- shipped as a Mother-Goddess in Egypt. The site was transformed by a large public building in the 5th Ct AD. (ADelt 526-9) Outside the Walls E cemetery. In a plot on the corner of Melenikou and Chatzeandreou Sts, behind the Central Hospital, 110 graves of the late 1 St-early 3rd Cts were excavated. They were divided into two groups by a path, and were on E-W or N-S orientations, with the heads of inhumations to the E or the N. Many of the graves contained cremations, which had often been burnt in situ. Graves were of many types: large brick and/or stone-built cists, cists with tile covers, simple tile graves, clay-lined pits, simple burials (some of which had been laid out on wooden biers) and three pot-burials, one of which contained a child's cremation. An interesting feature of the cemetery was that many of the graves had altars built above them, and some of these had pipes set in them for libations to the dead (Figs. 111-12). These</page><page sequence="78">80 DAVID BLACKMAN 111, 112. East cemetery, altars A -' .. bQMOI Q5 1D LArpo were found over various types of grave and over both inhuma- tions and cremations. Although most of the graves were undis- turbed, only about half had grave goods. These included unguentaria and other small clay vessels, lamps, glass vessels, an unusual marble-spouted mortar with a youth's head in relief on its under side, a few figurines, chiefly of Aphrodite and Eros, and a wheeled toy horse and rider (Fig. 113). The most unusu- al finds were a magnifying glass 0.42m in diameter and 0.015m thick, and a life-sized tragic clay mask (Fig. 114). Two inscrip- tions were also found reused in graves. (ADelt 433-6) Suburbs Ano toumba: the table. (AR 1996-97, 65-66; 1997-98, 75-76; 1998-99, 78) K. Soueref continued his investigation of the building plots in this area, which in 1994-95 were on the out- skirts of the settlement on the table and in its cemetery. At Kalavryton 20 and Abderon, the foundations of a build- ing had been laid out in the 5th Ct BC, but it was apparently never completed. Sherd material from the plot was 8th-4th Cts BC. Additional work at Kalavryton 19 located a number of semi-beehive-shaped storage pits and silos cut into the clay in an open space outside the anc. buildings in the plot and beside a retaining wall near the foot of the toumba. They would have acted as natural cool-stores. They were in use in the 7th-6th Cts BC, but were abandoned during the latter century, when a 2m wide road was probably made between the houses on the table and the foot of the toumba. Small rectangular, semi-circular and ellipsoidal structures of unworked stones found at Isidorou 33 and 25 may have had some agricultural function. They were outside the boundary of the set- tlement proper. Scanty sherd material was A-C and mostly local. Further work was done at Lotou 11-13. In a room identified as a kitchen, part of a small stone-built oven and hearth, some clay constructions, a quer and other objects connected with food preparation, and storage vessels for both dry goods and liquids were found. In the andron was a 4th-Ct BC kantharos, mended with clamps, with a hole in its lower part, perhaps for libations. The dating of the building to which these rooms belonged was problematical-imported Attic wares showed that it was not deserted until early in the 4th Ct BC, but local wares went back to the 6th Ct BC. Below this building phase, a cooking pot and two pithoi with stone lids, all relatively intact, were discovered. In the plot's lowest level, EIA sherds and building material were encountered. The cemetery lay to the SSE of the table. In Evagoras 24, 17 pit graves were excavated. In Agias Marinas 12-14, ten graves were discovered, including six pit graves, and one cist; the remainder were destroyed. In Sphacterias 7 there were two pit graves and the remains of two others. The cemetery was in use in the 8th-4th Cts BC. The predominant pit graves were usu- ally covered by schist slabs and occasionally outlined with a ring of stones. One was marked by a stone heap on top of it, and one had a heap of stones within the grave, under the covers. Most burials were accompanied by one or two pots, or, rarely, three. Some had a lozenge-shaped gold mouth-piece and other gold jewellery, and bronze and iron daggers. The sloping ceme- tery area had suffered considerably from water erosion. (AEMTH 8, 189-96; 9, 267-76; ADelt 440-3) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, K. Soueref presents possible evidence for cult practices in the pre- Cassandreian settlement here. (AAA 23-28, 31-46) Karabournaki (AR 1988-89, 70). On this headland, now within the SE suburbs of Thessalonike, is the site which may be anc. Therme. It consists of a settlement mound, with a table to -</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 81 113. East cemetery, figurines 114. East cemetery, mask its N and a cemetery to its E. Over the last century it has been used for Turkish fortifications, a World War I allied army camp, and the former Kodra Greek Army barracks. Part of it has fall- en into the sea and a major road has impinged on it. Its ceme- tery was excavated by the allied forces (principally the French) in 1916-17 and its settlement by Professor Rhomaios and his students from Thessalonike University in 1930. In 1994 new excavations began with the object of displaying the area's antiq- uities in a park, which was also to contain the new Prehistoric Archaeological Museum of Thessalonike and the Open Theatre of the Deme of Kalamaria. At the invitation of Dr J. Vokotopoulou, then Ephor of the 16th Ephorate, the University of Thessalonike, represented by Prof. M. Tiverios, E. Manakidou and D. Tsiafaki, resumed the excavation of the set- tlement, while the Ephorate, represented by E. Pandermali and E. Trakosopoulou, investigated the table, the cemetery and other areas. The University team opened six 4 x 4m trenches on the set- tlement mound in 1994 and a further 20 in 1995. None was excavated to a depth surpassing 1m, as the object was to exam- ine one settlement period over a wide area. Walls, some form- ing rectangular rooms, and paved floors were uncovered. Storage areas with pithoi and amphoras, many in situ, indicate that this was an area of dwellings. This latest surviving phase of the settlement was LA, dat- ing to ca 500 BC, and there were some indications of earlier A phases. Pottery, both local and imported (Cor, Attic, E Greek), was abundant. Most was A (7th-6th Cts BC), but some G and EC sherds were also present. (The mound's C and EHL phases had probably been removed by army levelling operations). Finds included an Attic bf lekythos, the zoomorphic band on the belly sherds of a MCor amphora, two sherds from the bases of Attic bf kylikes with the incised letters BI, and a number of sherds with commercial graffiti; a notable example was an amphora neck with a rare Carian inscription. Almost all the trench- es were disturbed by very varied remnants of the past century's military occupations, including the skeletons of at least 17 horses-before and during World War II the Greek Army had had a cavalry unit stationed at the barracks. (AEMTH 8, 197-202; 9, 277-282) In 1994-95 the Ephorate team investigated the table. Tests at its S end indicated that though the table had been inhabited, with IA, LA and EC sherds being present, previous earth-mov- ing activities had ensured that little coherent stratigraphy remained. On its N end, 36 4 x 4m trenches were excavated on the proposed site of the Open Theatre mentioned above. No building remains were found, also probably because of previous levelling. At a depth of 1.50m an EIA deposit extending over a wide area and several pits of the same date were discovered. There were no other archaeological remains in this area. In 1994 the same archaeologists also worked in the ceme- tery. The World War I excavations were located and 28 addi- tional graves of the 6th-5th Cts BC were found, 19 being pit graves and the rest stone lamakes or cists; there was also one tile grave. Inhumation was the sole rite and the cemetery was used for both adults and children, the latter accounting for about a quarter of the total. Despite the fact that only two graves remained intact, many retained impressive finds: weapons, jew- ellery and pottery, mostly from Attica (Fig. 115), Corinth and E Greece, including Samos, but also from local workshops. Coins were conspicuously absent. In 1995 the Ephorate team tested an area E of the settlement mound where the storerooms and workshops of the new Prehistoric Museum were to be located. Most of the area's sur- face and antiquities had again been lost to previous earth-level- 115. Karaboumaki, cemetery, Attic krater</page><page sequence="80">82 DAVID BLACKMAN ling, but in one part 97 closely-packed pits and a rectangular sunken chamber were discovered cut into the bedrock. They were filled with stones, broken bricks, workshop debris, bones, shells, loom-weights, spindle-whorls, nails, a pin, a tool, a scarab, and quantities of EIA and A pottery. All the rubbish had apparently been deposited at the same time. Six more tombs were unexpectedly discovered in this area, some of them clearly cut into the pits; three of them, however, contained finds of the 6th-Ct BC and were thus contemporary with, if not earlier than the later pit material, a situation at pres- ent inexplicable. The earliest was a pit grave of ca mid-6th Ct BC, which contained a gold bead and a MCor aryballos. Two late 6th-Ct BC tombs, a poros sarcophagus and a cist grave, lay side by side. Both were warrior burials and each had weapons, a krater in which was placed an Attic CHC skyphos, and a Cor exaleiptro. The sarcophagus burial had in addition a gold mouth-piece and other jewellery, and grape pips and cereal remains in the cup. A pit grave of the early 5th-Ct BC contained a rich, probably female burial with a pair of silver pins, a pair of bronze pin-heads, an arched bronze fibula and Cor and Attic vases. The other graves were those of children without grave goods. (AEMTH 8, 203-15; 9, 283-92; ADelt 444-5) Lembet (Polichni) (AR 1996-97, 66; 1998-99, 78). A build- ing plot ca 30m from the present boundary of Lembet Toumba provided a welcome opportunity for exploring its surroundings. At a depth of 4.5m, an undisturbed stratum with scanty, proba- bly EBA sherds was reached and the water table prevented fur- ther excavation. Above this was a strong LBA wall built of large stones, which was parallel with the foot of the toumba and may have been to protect it from the waters of the stream E of the mound. The wall itself, however, was covered by a thick stra- tum of gravel and sand, almost certainly deposited by the stream, and this apparently continued with short breaks until the LR period. A well 2m in diameter and exceeding 4.50m in depth was found in the SE comer of the plot. It was filled with LR material. (ADelt 443-4) Stavroupoli (AR 1997-96, 76; 1998-99, 78). Part of the N settlement here was excavated in 1994 in a plot on Koundouriote Square. A house wall, represented by a row of five post-holes, was found. Within the house a small area of well-baked floor may have been a hearth area; the rest of the floor surface had been removed by ploughing, and usually only the sub-structure remained. In the centre of the house, two post- holes set in a large, shallow pit may have been for roof supports. A cobbled area lay S of the house, but it is not certain whether they were associated. E of the house and cobbles were a num- ber of pits of uncertain use. The finds in them, chiefly sherds, bones and shells, in no way differed from the contents of the deposits outside them. The Stavropouli N settlement may be contemporary with that of Thermi B. (ADelt 444) Nome of Thessalonike. Agios Athanasios (20km WNW of Thessalonike). (AR 1996- 97, 66-67; 1997-98, 77). M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti has published three further reports on the remarkable series of Macedonian and other tombs here (AEMTH 8,231-40; 9, 301-10; ADelt 453- 5) Much of this was previously covered in the report in AEMTH 10. Further detail is given on the facade of the Macedonian tomb in the large tumulus E of the town. Opposed griffins with gold wings adorned the pediment. Below these were blue triglyphs and plain white metopes, followed by the famous nar- row frieze with the remarkable symposium scene. Two young men wrapped in long cloaks, perhaps brothers-in-arms of the dead man, are depicted beside the entrance to the monument. In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti gives a full account of the unrobbed warrior burial found in the E slope of the large tumulus. The tomb was a cist of plastered mud-brick, with a built-in stand for the bier against the S wall. The covers had collapsed, knocking the body and many of the finds to the floor beside the stand. The finds included four spearheads and two pairs of bronze spurs, three strigils, a silver kylix-kantharos, and a most unusual bg spheri- cal unguentarium, with incised pentagons on the body, and a handle formed by the looped body of a snake, the head of which was in the vessel's trefoil mouth. On top of the vessel's body was the relief head of a youth, and inside it a clay ball to limit the flow of the contents. There were also two ordinary unguen- taria and a small bg skyphos of the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. (AAA 23-28, 71-80) Aineia (21km SW of Thessalonike, near Nea Michaniona). E.-B. Tsigarida and A. Bilouka give the results of a rescue exca- vation on the proposed site of a sewage treatment plant in the cemetery area of anc. Aineia. The plot is NW of the toumba (Toumba Tabia or Koum-Kal) with the related anc. settlement, and near the published 5th- and 4th-Ct funerary tumuli. The plot yielded 20 tombs, mostly dating to the second half of the 4th Ct BC. Cists and poros sarcophagi, oriented N-S, contained both male and female burials, with plain, bg and a little rf pottery, iron weapons, and bronze, silver and gold jewellery. There were also cremations which had been carried out in situ in clay-lined pit graves. The most notable discovery was an earlier sarcoph- agus with a rich female burial. The deceased was accompanied by a number of silver and bronze bracelets and very fine bronze beads and pendants, and by three small bf lekythoi dating to 500-480 BC. Brief trials in the anc. settlement uncovered walls of unworked stones, but no floors were reached. Sherds dated A-EHL, suggesting that Aineia was one of the towns whose inhabitants were co-opted to found Thessalonike. (AEMTH 8, 217-22; ADelt 451) Anchialos (18km WNW of Thessalonike) (AR 1996-97, 67; 1997-98, 78, under Nea Anchialos). The 1994-95 seasons at the double table of Anchialos were confined to the lower (N) table in an area where a section of a well-preserved G mud-brick wall had come to light in 1993. Prof. M. Tiberios and his colleagues K. Kathariou, K. Lachanidou and, in 1995, M. Oettli, report the discovery of this and other mud-brick walls on a SE-NW and SW-NE orientation, almost certainly belonging to the one build- ing, which was at least 15m in length. Two doorways and some smaller, perhaps internal, walls were also found. The floors lay under a heavy burnt destruction level, which preserved local IA and wheelmade painted pottery, and much imported decorated G pottery, some probably Attic and much Euboean, which dates the destruction to the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC. A conical struc- ture of ashes near the building may be an altar. A 1994 trench contained the floor of another building with walls indicated by post-holes. Here also a heavy burnt destruc- tion covered G pots, local and imported, many of which lay bro- ken in situ. This building also contained a clay installation, per- haps a grill. The quantity and quality of the Euboean wares found reinforce the argument for the existence of a Euboean emporium at Anchialos at this period. (AEMTH 8, 223-9; 9, 293-300) Work reported this year includes extensive finds of burials (cist, chamber, pit etc.) On Maltezou St, remains of an impor- tant LR public building were uncovered near the Martyr's basil- ica, including five rooms and a stoa. A fine maeander relief jamb or epistyle was found in re-use as a threshold. Other minor finds of walls etc. are reported. (ADelt 356-9)</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 83 Arethousa (10km N of Rendina). P. Adam-Veleni describes the chance discovery and excavation of an ECh basilica on a wooded hill in the Paleambela locality. The cutting of a new forestry road, followed by heavy rains, revealed part of a mosa- ic floor, which brief tests showed to be extensive. An almost immediate attack by antiquities thieves necessitated a full-scale excavation. The basilica had a narthex with additional chambers on its N and S sides-the latter was the main entrance chamber both to the narthex and to an unfloored narrow hall which ran the length of the S side of the basilica. In this were found a built and plastered tomb with two compartments which had once had a vaulted roof, and a tile grave. A 6th-Ct bronze fibula in the built tomb was the only find apart from bones. The rich mosaics, except where damaged by the road, were well-preserved, and recall those of Philippi and particularly Amphipolis. The entrance chamber floor had a rectangular cen- tral panel with two deer on either side of a grape vine springing from an amphora. The narthex had a central circular panel with two peacocks on either side of a fountain, set in a rectangular panel of linked crosses. The arms of the crosses were decorated with birds and fish, and the squares between the crosses with rhombs. The central panel of the room to the N of the narthex had a design of linked circles. All three mosaics were framed by ornate double borders. Within the basilica proper, where a plaster bench ran along the N wall, and scraps of frescoes were found, the edges of the main part of the chamber floor were paved with rectangular marble slabs, which were also used to form a slightly off-centre cross, thus dividing the area into four rectangular panels of unequal size. In each of these was a rhomb and within the rhomb a circle with a central motif. Except for the central motifs, these mosaics used large tesserae of white marble (often reused) and blackish-green schist. The presbytery, on a slightly raised level, had a floor of the same materials with two patterns: white rectangles framed by green schist and panels with a geometric design of squares in rhombs in alternating green and white, the latter design nearer the apse. The scant remains of the barrier in front of the presbytery included pieces of open-work panels and two small pillars. Fragments of sculptured acanthus, and parts of a marble table and basin had fallen in front of the barrier. Within the apse was a synthronon consisting of two low, very wide steps. Outside the W wall of the narthex had been a row of pithoi, and there may have been a stoa there to shelter them. Two coin hoards, of Anastasios, and Zeno and Markelios respectively, suggest the basilica's period of use was the mid-5th to the early 6th Cts. Surface remains in the vicinity indicate that the basilica was not isolated, but belonged to a small walled set- tlement which may have been founded as early as the HL peri- od. The excavation is to continue in collaboration with the 9th Byz Ephorate. (Discovery, initial tests and theft: ADelt 453; main report: AEMTH 9, 351-65). Derveni. During road-widening works on the Thessalonike- Kavala highway, four R tombs were badly damaged. Two were surrounded by unworked stones and covered with tiles, and two were pits covered with flat stones. All were oriented E-W. Few bones remained, and the only finds were a bulbous unguentari- um and some bone beads in tomb I. (ADelt 445-6) Kouphalia (5km E of Pella). After deep ploughing had turned up worked stones and much pottery on Kouphalia Toumba A (Tabas Toumba), excavations were undertaken to determine the extent of the antiquities. The site is 750m N of Nea Chalkidona and today is 25km from the sea, but in antiquity it was on the coast, and has been identified with the town of Ichnae at which Xerxes' ships called (Hdt VII 123, 3). It consists of two tables divided by a neck 65m wide. A 12 x 6m test on the neck, WNW of table A, uncovered a rubbish pit 9m in diameter bounded by a wall of unworked stones, which was excavated to a depth of 2.65m. It was in use from at least the IA up to and including the A period. A 12 x 3m test on table A itself located part of the set- tlement, notably walls of unworked stone belonging to a large building, and part of a stone-paved street and drain. Sherds of the A period and Attic pottery of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC were found. A deeper sounding established the presence of ear- lier building phases. (ADelt 455) Mesemeri (24km S of Thessalonike). Tombs belonging to the cemetery of the anc. settlement on the hill of Agios Konstantinos, to the N of the present village, were found in two building plots. Two pit graves and a cist tomb were in the Stavrides plot; two of these were robbed, while the third had a child's skeleton with an iron ring. Four pit graves and four cists on a N-S orientation were discovered in the Papadopoulos plot, and contained both adult and child burials. A cist grave con- tained a skeleton, probably male, with the skull to the N, with an iron sickle-shaped knife, bronze tweezers and part of an iron pin. A female burial in another cist with the skull to the S, had a pair of silver earrings, a pair of bronze fibulae on her shoul- ders and a coin of Philip II. A child burial in a pit grave was accompanied by a 4th-Ct BC lekythos and a bronze ring with a bird on the bezel. (ADelt 452) Mesemeriane Toumba (near Trilophos, ca 18km S of Thessalonike) (AR 1996-97, 67; 1997-98, 78). D. Grammenos gives the results of the second excavation period here. Test I on top of the hill was carried down to 3m below surface, and five building phases were recognized. Three of them were IA, with two apsidal buildings and one other, possibly a parallelogram. The fourth stage had a stone-built LBA wall, and the fifth, with part of a clay-walled building and a hearth, was EBA. Test II, the first of a planned series of step-trenches down the side of the mound, designed to present a complete picture of its stratigra- phy, had part of another EBA floor with a hearth, both of which had been renewed three times. (ADelt 452-3) Nea Anchilaos-see Anchialos. Nea Philadelphia (ca 18km NNW of Thessalonike). V. Misailidou-Despotidou describes 1995 rescue excavations which took place in the vicinity of the known BA toumba on the banks of the Gallikos river previous to an alteration to the Thessalonike-Alexandroupolis railway line. NW of the toumba an extensive IA settlement was discovered, with building remains, imported and local G pottery and local IA handmade pottery. S of the table with the settlement of the historical peri- od, its A-C cemetery was brought to light and 92 burials were excavated. Three (all male) were in poros sarcophagi. Stone slab cist graves, probably with IA antecedents, were popular in the 5th Ct BC and continued into the 4th Ct BC, though in the latter period pit graves without covers but often ringed with unworked stones were preferred. Men and women were buried facing in opposite directions. In A burials particularly, men were buried with a helmet, sword and spearheads, and women with their jewellery. Gold lozenges (one 20cm in length) covered the mouths of the dead, and gold or gilded silver ornaments were attached to clothes and shrouds. The Charonian coin was evi- dent in many of the 4th-Ct BC burials. Coins were of Cassander, Alexander, Philip, Perdikkas III, Amyntas III and Aeropos. Later a R settlement was established S of the cemetery, partly covering it. A 1St-Ct BC building consisted of rooms round a central court. It had signs of later alterations and a smaller</page><page sequence="82">84 DAVID BLACKMAN 116. Peristera, tombstone three-room building encroached on its SW edge. Both buildings remained in use until the 4th Ct. (AEMTH 9, 311-20) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, V. Misailidou-Despotidou publishes tomb 81, which contained an Attic bg skyphos, a Cor exaleiptro and two bg lekythoi (one with a reserved band of maeanders, the other plain), which are dated to the mid-5th Ct BC. Also in the tomb were two very small sil- ver coins of types known from collections but not previously from excavations. One has a spear-head on the obverse, the other a horse's head, and both have quartered incuse squares on the reverse. The tomb's pottery provides a terminus ante quem for them, but both show signs of wear and may be somewhat earli- er. Arguments are given indicating that they are probably early issues of Alexander I of Macedonia. (AAA 23-28, 63-70) Peristera (18km SE of Thessalonike). A tombstone which had for many years formed part of the external staircase of the house of D. Syropoulos of this village was removed to Thessalonike Museum (Fig. 116). The inscription below the pediment reads: -OMI CI OTHPQI [OC] / KAI API ZI QNOC. The stele probably dates to ca 100 BC. (ADelt 465) Stephanina (12km NNW of Rendina, 2km N of Arethousa). After deep ploughing had turned up marble architectural frag- ments in the field of I. Mavroudes, a two-day preliminary inves- tigation indicated the likelihood of an important 2nd-3rd Ct building complex. A large marble perirrhanterion was collected, while a marble column, a pillar and a column base were left where found pending future excavation. (ADelt 453) Thermi. (AR 1996-97, 68; 1997-98, 78; 1998-99, 78-79). 1994 was the eighth continuous year of excavation of the ceme- tery at Thermi, and five more plots were investigated. That at the comer of Lambrake and Makedonias yielded 213 graves, most of them robbed. They dated from the 8th-4th Cts BC with the 5th Ct BC predominating, and comprised 7 sarcophagi, 73 cist graves, 109 pit graves, 5 brick-lined tombs, 5 pot burials and 14 inumed cremations. The custom of outlining graves with a frame of unworked stones was again very prevalent; men were buried with their heads to the W or N and women the opposite, and the burials were generally similar to those described in pre- vious reports. Unusual features were an anthropomorphic stele of a warrior, probably EIA, used as a cover slab, and two horse burials in shallow pits covered by stone heaps. In one case, the animal's feet were tied together, probably to facilitate carrying the carcase to the grave, which destroyed the comer of an earli- er tomb (Fig. 117). In the other case the dead beast had a spear- head wedged in its ribs. In a building plot on Makedonias, 43 tombs were uncovered: 32 pit graves, 7 cists, 1 tile grave, 1 pot burial and 2 inured cre- mations. As well as graves of the customary dates, there were 5 LByz burials (all E-W) in shallow irregular pits. The dead lay extended, their hands crossed on their breasts, their heads and upper chests covered by a Laconian tile. Grave goods included bronze jewellery, glass beads and glazed pottery (Fig. 118). In this plot also there was a bovine burial which was within the archaeological strata, but otherwise undatable. Two C cist graves were found in a building plot on Venizelou St, and nine, perhaps in a family plot, were in a building site between Sokratous and Antypa Sts: 7 pits, 1 cist and 1 pithos burial, all of the 4th Ct BC. A site on Iasonidou St. produced 23 graves, but in one area only-the rest of the plot was clear of antiquities-suggesting that the border of the cemetery had been reached here. Only three of the tombs were cists, all 6th-Ct BC; the rest were pit graves of the 6th-4th Cts BC. There were several instances of imported, usually Attic, vases being found together with local pots (Fig. 119). (ADelt 446-51) Two studies on finds from this extensive cemetery are in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou. E. Skarlatidou publishes a very fine new Attic column krater by the Lydos Painter, which was used as an ash urn. One side has a scene from the hunt for the Calydonian boar, the other two more opposed boars. On the flat top of each handle is painted a bearded head, and beneath each handle an eagle with outspread wings. It is dated to ca 560 BC. (AAA 23-28, 175-98 and frontispiece). D. Ignatiadou discusses six core-formed glass vessels from the cemetery: 2 ampho- riskoi, 2 oinochai and 2 alabastra. They are dated from the mid- 6th to the 3rd Cts BC and are the only pre-R glass vessels so far found. (AAA 23-28, 223-34)</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 85 117.

Sav+vopoulou in an arti- cle in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou. On its front are incised two opposed lions. The helmet, handed over to Kilkis Museum by K. Chrysoulides, came from the vicinity of an outstanding, rock-capped hill known as Kalampak, Kastro, Kal, or Lazaritsa, where a C-HL settlement was severely damaged by furrows dug for unauthorized tree planting; its cemetery contained carefully- constructed stone slab cists, mostly robbed. (AAA 23-28, 163- 174) Evropos (ca 10 km S of Axioupolis). (AR 1996-97, 68; 1997-98, 78; 1998-99, 80). T. Savvopoulou reports on the resumption of this project in 1995. Following the indications of the 1992 geophysical survey, six LR bar- rel-vaulted underground tombs were uncov- l ered in as many trenches, plus 22 pit and tile graves. Of the vaulted tombs, three were sin- [^E i~ :I . gle-chambered, two double, while the sixth " E : ...was monumental and had an entrance, ante- chamber and chamber. They were family tombs, and an unrobbed single chamber held 13 burials, while a double tomb had three skeletons in one chamber and four in the B other. There were some grave goods includ- ing beads, coins, pots, lamps, fragments of , glass vessels and one glass amphora, 42 cm high, which had survived intact. The tomb group dates to the 4th-6th Cts and provides a fine example of LR-ECh tomb architecture. It will be opened to the public. Trenches in the anc. city located a 24m stretch of rubble masonry belonging to a building. Finds here included domestic pottery, lumps of iron and nails. More impressive articles were a terracotta T':1 head of Dionysos and some bunches of grapes. Fourteen tile graves of the 2nd Ct AD were unex- pectedly found on terraces at the E end of the city. Amongst them was a child's burial with two clay rat- tles depicting goat-footed Pan, a small skyphos, two bronze coins of Pella and Thessalonike and a charm- ing terracotta toy a wheeled horse and carriage ,-:^ .. with a bearded driver. Excavation in the Hadzitheodorou field revealed a brick-built cist with stone slab covers, surmounted by a stone heap in which a clay libation pipe was set. In 1992 an early 3rd-Ct BC cist tomb had been found in the Okaoglou field. 1995 tests in the same vicini- ty brought to light a wrecked Macedonian tomb with secondary burials, and a small unrobbed cist con- taining the remains of a cremation, which included decorations from the burnt bier, two iron strigils, a spear-head, lead handles from a kantharos and a pail, and a wreath of gold laurel leaves and flowers. The cremation was dated by a silver drachma of Alexander from the Abydos mint of 328-323 BC. The Macedonian tomb, the cremation and the 1992 cist may belong to a family group, originally covered by a tumulus. (AEMTH 9, 395-404) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, M. Valla gives a detailed account of the LR kiln mentioned in AR 1996-97, 68. Only the rectangular firing chamber (2.35 x 2.40m) and the praefumium survived. These were made of clay and bricks, reinforced by pieces of tile. On either side of the chamber were ranged four small walls or buttresses at right angles to a central corridor, which would have supported the floor of the combustion cham- ber. The only finds were the two apotropaic figurines in the praefumium. (AAA 23-28, 109-15) Kambanes (12km SSE of Kilkis). Four tombs were discov- ered near the church of Agios Georgios on the height of Gedi Koul, during improvements to the church yard. The tombs were in cuttings in the bedrock, and were oriented E-W. The bones were disturbed and there were no grave goods. A few R and Byz</page><page sequence="84">86 DAVID BLACKMAN 120. Palatiano, lead model of a table surface sherds were found, and the church is said to have been built on the foundations of an older building. (ADelt 463) Palaio Gynaikokastro (13km SW of Kilkis) (AR 1996-97, 68; 1997-98, 78). T. Savvopoulou reports that the 1994 excava- tion season here uncovered a further 96 EIA ash urns and 21 later burials, some in cists. Pottery included jugs, amphoras, four-handled pithoi, kantharoid skyphoi, etc. Women were accompanied by bronze jewellery, men by iron weapons. The S border of the cremation cemetery was located, and only its SE extent remains to be determined. (ADelt 462-3) Palatiano (16km NNE of Kilkis) (AR 1996-97, 68-9; 1997- 98, 78-9). In 1994 a scrub fire facilitated the exploration of the summit of the site's N hill, on the E slope of which the R heroon and other buildings so far excavated are situated. A. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolychroni reports that an area of the summit, 96m in length, was enclosed by a polygonal wall which followed the land's contours. It had a monumental entrance, 6- 8m wide, on the E side, at right angles to the main line of the circuit. Outside this entrance was a block of six chambers, two larger ones nearer the gate and four smaller ones behind them. Amongst finds here were iron objects and a lead model of a table (Fig. 120). Within the enclosure, the summit was divided into three unequal areas by partially-located E-W cross walls. In the cen- tral section there were some building remains, of which only one small room was excavated, and an internal 'tower' was attached to the W part of the circuit. The enclosure wall was only 0.60m in width, built of unworked stones and earth, so it cannot be regarded as a fortification, and must have had some other purpose. Its preserved height is unknown, as only surface clearance took place. Material collected on the summit was of the 1st-2nd Cts. In 1995 work continued on the hero6n and other buildings ranged along the W side of a very substantial N-S road, 2.50- 2.80m in width. It has been uncovered over a length of 62m, and because it runs across a steep slope, has substantial retain- ing walls. A test showed the wall on the E (downhill) side to be 3-3.5m in height. In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, A. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolychroni gives a history of earlier excavations at the site as well as a summary of the results of the present project, which began in 1993. It seems unusually rich in small finds of many different types and mate- rials, mostly HL-2nd Ct. Coins range from Alexander the Great to Constantius II, Constans and Constantine II. (AEMTH 8,263- 7; 9, 405-9; ADelt 463-4; AAA 23-28, 89-108) Polykastro/Pontoherakleia: Karathodoreika locality. (AR 1998-99, 80-1) With the support of the deme of Polykastro, for- mal excavation began at this site in 1994. T. Savvopoulou reports that 23 tombs were excavated, 11 of them stone slab cists and 12 others which were surrounded by a ring of stones and covered by stone heaps, which contained objects which were apparently offerings to the dead. The most numerous sherds were from A pots with painted reddish bands round the belly, neck and handles; also present were sherds of grey clay and some C bg. Bronze jewellery, including spiral bracelets, arched fibulae, beads and pendants, was found in female graves, and iron weapons such as swords, knives and spear-heads in male ones. The Karathodoreika cemetery, which was in use from the 7th to the 4th Cts BC, is only 3km W of the Chauchitsa cemetery, of which it is the chronological and cultural succes- sor. (AEMTH 8, 253-61; ADelt 462) Nome of Chalkidike. Ierissos (anc. Akanthos). Three more seaside building plots, Nos. 134, 137 and 159, yielded 122, 280 and 234 graves respec- tively. The LA-R graves were of the same types (pit graves, tile graves, pot burials, etc.) as in previous seasons (AR 1996-97, 69; 1997-98, 79; 1998-99, 81) and with similar finds. Unusual burials were those of a fisherman in plot 134 who had all his fishing gear in a small wooden casket, and that of a horse in plot 137 with its probable rider beside it. (ADelt 460-1) Kalyves Polygyrou (ca 4km ESE of anc. Olynthos). During the excavation of house foundations two burials were discov- ered, one above the other. The lower burial was in a pit grave covered with unworked stone slabs, and contained a skeleton and a coin of Justinian (527-565 AD). On the cover slabs was another skeleton covered by tiles, without grave goods. The burials were ca 350m NW of anc. Mekyberna. (ADelt 459) Nea Roda (5m SE of Ierissos) (AR 1996-97, 69-70; 1997- 98, 79). In 1994, the late Dr J. Vokotopoulou and E.-B. Tsigarida continued their work on the foundations of a large building SE of the small LA oikos temple which had been ren- ovated and reused in the HL period. The larger building proved to be another temple, 17.80 x 10.20m, again on an E-W orien- tation with entrance from the E. It had a pronaos and a cella and was built in the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. It was unusual in hav- ing three entrances: a monumental one in the E, to both pronaos and cella, and two more in the S and W walls of the cella. A pile of stones mixed with traces of fire and shells, and two stone blocks lying parallel, possibly supports for an offering table, were within the cella, as were benches, perhaps for displaying statues or offerings, built near its E wall on either side of the main entrance. Finds included metal objects, bg sherds, a paint- ed portable clay altar, many bronze coins of Ouranopolis, and a number of ceremonial octahedral clay vessels with spout and small strap handle; these had also been found in the HL use of the oikos. A marble statue head discovered in the building in 1993 had 13 holes in the band binding the hair, probably for the insertion of metal rays, indicating the head may be that of the deity Helios. (AEMTH 8, 289-94; ADelt 461) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, E.-B. Tsigarida summarizes the work so far on this sanctuary site, which has a third, partly- excavated building to the S of the larger HL temple. The small LA temple was probably connected with the Andriot colony of Sane. The deity to whom it was originally dedicated remains unknown, but indirect evidence suggests that the whole HL sanctuary was probably connected with the foundation of Ouranopolis by Alexarchos, the brother of Cassander, in 315 BC, and may have been dedicated to Zeus and Helios. (AAA 23- 28, 47-56) Nea Roda (Xerxes' Canal). Dr Richard Jones (BSA) reports on the 1999 season: 'A short programme of coring was carried out at the two ends of the Canal in December 1999 with several aims in mind: supplementing the information gained from previous bore-hole drillings; clarifying the nature and/or course of the Canal at its</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 87 two ends; and interpreting further the seismic data obtained in 1996 by V. Karastathis. From previous bore-hole drilling and seismic survey we have successfully traced the Canal in the central sector of the isthmus. In December 1999 we wanted to explore further the situation at the S end (Tripiti): was there, for instance, any evi- dence for a diolkos, as one ancient writer has indicated was the case? Three bore holes were drilled close to the shore to a depth of up to 13.5m. Examination of the cores indicated no support for this hypothesis: we are satisfied now that the Canal ran right across the isthmus, as indicated by Herodotus-a very impor- tant result. However, the situation at the N end (close to Nea Roda) is more complex, in part because of the changes that have taken place in the environment of this marshy area over the last few millennia. The coring data seemed to inform us more about those environmental changes than about the Canal itself. We are still very confident that the Canal indeed joined the sea at Nea Roda, but its exact course over the last 500m remains uncertain. We now await the results of pollen analysis of cores taken in 1998.' Anc. Olynthos (AR 1996-97, 70; 1998-99, 82). Under the general supervision of the late Dr J. Vokotopoulou and the immediate charge of S. Protopsalti, a programme of cleaning, excavation and restoration continued, and in 1994 parts of roads V, VI and VII and avenue B were investigated. The destruction level was encountered, and interesting details about road sur- facing materials (many different types of which could be used in the same stretch of road) and drainage were gathered. The outstanding find was in road V, in front of house AV4: a stone inscription concerning the sale of the house by Aristoboulos the son of Euthanes to Polyxenos, witnessed by Demarchos son of Phanoleos, Pheidippos son of Pheidon and Nikandros son of Epichares. The eponymous priest was Antidotos son of Polykles, a name known from other similar inscriptions. The sale took place in the month of Lenaion. A similar inscription was found outside house AVI8 on road VI, but it was so ill-pre- served that all that could be made out was the name of the priest, Euriantides, and the month, Pantheon. (AEMTH 8, 295- 304; ADelt 458-9; 466) Palaioporta (ca 6km SW of Polygyros). N. Zervos of Polygyros handed in an iron spear-head, a pick-head, another iron tool and a lead object, possibly a pot rivet, from this known site. (ADelt 464) Poseidi (AR 1996-97, 70-1; 1997-98, 80). The fifth season at this sanctuary to Poseidon, in 1994, proved to be Julia Vokotopoulou's last. Her report, published posthumously, records the continuing investigation of several areas of the site, notably the stratigraphy of the apsidal PG building ZT. It was ascertained that the sacrificial area at its entrance was used from LH IIIC to HL, with a possible hiatus in the 9th Ct BC, perhaps caused by a natural disaster. The building itself rests on layers of sacrificial remains from the end of LH IIIC. Inside the build- ing, a quarter of the altar of ashes which rose above the original sacrificial pit was excavated. It was 1.50m high and covered the same periods as those in the stratigraphic trench. A stone-paved area surrounding the apsidal building was found to be strewn with sherds of PG amphoras and kraters. (AEMTH 8, 269-74; see also S. Moschonesiote in ADelt 458) Potidaia. D. Kousoulakou gives an account of rescue exca- vations here in 1994. Work on the Pechlivanides plot (AR 1996- 97, 71) was completed. A new area excavated in the N part of the plot revealed a system of R pipes, and below this, part of the HL complex discovered in previous years. The plot contained a 121. Stageira, acropolis microcosm of the area's history, with A, C-HL and ER settle- ment remains and LR burials. The A stratum, though it only had remains of small buildings, was important as the first evidence of the Cor colony's foundation. It was rich in pottery, mostly of the 6th Ct BC, including LCor, Attic bf, Ionian or Ionian type, Rhodian and the local pre-Persian style. A rare silver coin of Potidaia with Poseidon, mounted, on the obverse and an incuse square with a cross on the reverse was also found. In the Grigoriou plot, a building of the R period was discov- ered. The site had been used slightly earlier as a workshop. A pottery kiln was found containing LHL sherds. A cist grave built of re-used building materials came to light at Akrotiri, S of Potidaia; it had remains of 13 skeletons, three coins of Constantine, bronze and silver earrings and sherds of ribbed pottery. Another was excavated at Yerani, the site of an ECh cemetery discovered previously. It contained two skele- tons, one with a bronze ring, and two small jugs. (AEMTH 8, 305-15; ADelt 455-8) In an article in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, C. Sismanidis publishes ten C grave stelai from Potidaia. The majority are those of cleruchs (Athenians and others) who were settled at Potidaia when the previous inhabitants were forced to leave after being beseiged by the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War (430/29 BC). Another may be connected with the second cleruchy at Potidaia (362/1 BC), while two are probably from the city of Cassandreia, which succeeded Potidaia in 316 BC. (AAA 23-28, 263-76). Anc. Stageira (AR 1996-97, 71; 1997-98, 80; 1998-99, 83). K. Sismanidis gives the results of two extended seasons here in 1994-95. Excavation of the triangular acropolis on the S hill was completed (Fig. 121). Its E wall, like the W wall, proved to have internal buttresses at 3m intervals; it also had two tower- like platforms, one internal and one external. Four pithoi stood in angles formed by buttresses with the main acropolis wall, and fallen tiles in the area of the buttresses suggested that they had been roofed over. In the S trace of the EC fortification wall which spans the S hill from sea to sea, a 40m length of its inte- rior face proved to be preserved to a height of 4m. The W trace of the same wall was excavated for a length of 180m (almost to the saddle between the two hills) and was also well-preserved except for a section which had been cut by the dirt road which encircles the S hill, and another, ca 50m long, which had fallen down the cliff. The E trace, which preserved another staircase to the battlements, could only be followed as far as the dirt road already mentioned. Below the road, near the cliff face, only</page><page sequence="86">88 DAVID BLACKMAN rather poor house remains were uncovered, suggesting that part of the cliff had fallen into the sea here, taking the wall with it. A 10m length of it was traced again, however, on the cliff edge of the NE point of the N hill. Here it was particularly well-built of large rectangular blocks. To the landward side of it were impressive LA building remains. On the E slopes of the N hill, two houses were found on either side of a narrow street. Five rooms in the W house were explored, the most interesting being a large square chamber with a square marble hearth in its exact centre. Slightly further W, part of a possible workshop area, including a probable wine-press, was discovered. In the area of the A sanctuary and the round Thesmophorion on the N hill, a circular rock-hewn cistern was cleared, next to which the foundations of a large, long rectangular A building began to appear. The LC fortifica- tion wall on the N hill was followed to the W for another 20m. In the saddle between the N and S hills, SE of the C stoa of the agora, a well-preserved E-W road was traced for 30m. It was 2.80-3.00m wide and very carefully paved with flat stones of irregular shapes and sizes. On its N side were two well-built structures. Only the facade of that to the E was exposed, but that to the W had two main chambers, in which were three huge pithoi and a clay basin 1.20m in diameter, all of which were mended with lead clamps. Also found were two lead weights, three female figurines and, in a small area 2 x 2m, ca 150 coins, mostly of Philip II and Alexander. The building is provisional- ly interpreted as one of the agora shops. Finds, dating A-EHL, included Attic and Cor bf, rf and bg sherds, stamped amphora handles, many pithos sherds with relief, stamped or incised decorative bands, numerous frag- ments of clay perirrhanteria and a few of stone, stamped tiles (stamps included a naked runner and an anchor), a clay tile with an A relief of a Gorgon, clay figurines, lead sling-bullets (about half bearing names: Kleoboulou, Philippou, Potalou) and hun- dreds of coins, including two very rare silver ones of Stageira with a half boar on the obverse and an incuse square on the reverse. Work began on preparing the site for the public, with restora- tion of the two main towers of the EC fortifications and the cre- ation of paths. (AEMTH 8, 275-87; 9, 383-93; ADelt 459-60) Vrastama (9km E of Polygyros). Two previously-unknown sites were shown to a representative of the Archaeological Service by N. Zervos of Polygyros, who handed in finds from each. The first site, in the Agios Ioannis locality, 12km E of Vrastama, from which came three loom-weights and a coin, probably of Cassander, had a wall, scattered roof tiles and plain pottery. The second was in the Marlia locality near the chapel of Agia Kyriake, which had part of an anc. architectural mem- ber built into it; signs of a settlement, again including roof tiles and plain pottery, were thickly scattered in the vicinity. (ADelt 464-5) Torone. The second season of underwater investigation in 1994 (ADelt 855-6) was covered in AR 1994-95, 43. Nome of Pieria. Dion (AR 1996-97, 72; 1997-98, 82; 1998-99, 83). Prof. D. Pandermalis publishes another unusual musical instrument from this site, a nabla, which is depicted in the relief decoration of a grave stele found under deep fill beside the road to the for- tification's W gate. The stele was a memorial from her husband to a woman who was throughout her life dedicated to the Muses and the instrument is identified in its Latin inscription. The nabla (anc. Greek: nabla, nablas, naulos, naulon, naula; Latin: nabilium, nablium; Hebrew: nebel) was previously known from literary references, but its exact form was uncertain. The relief shows an instrument somewhat resembling a harp: a frame formed by two small columns supporting a cross-bar, to which eight strings are attached. Six of them run down to a chord-box with a hinged lid, but the two outer strings hang parallel to the columns, each having a small rectangular object near its lower end, and ending in a pointed tab. Behind the right-hand string is an object which may be a tuning key. In 1994-95 work took place in many other areas of the site, and only some of the highlights can be mentioned. The torso of a small statue of Dionysos was found during exploration of the monumental fortification wall. In the sector where the water organ was discovered, 21 storage amphoras, tools from a metal- working establishment and a small statue of Asklepios came to light. In the hall of a 2nd-Ct house in the Zosa sector on the S edge of the city, the marble slabs of a table and three table legs were recovered. One of the latter represented Dionysos repos- ing, another Leda and the swan, while the third was a hybrid form with the head and feet of a lion. Another built altar and a marble statue base with the inscription BEPENIKH KOPPA- rO[Y] IEPHTEYZA[EA...] were uncovered in the sanctuary of Demeter. A major goal of the 1995 season, the recovery of the stadium, was achieved. Despite the fact that houses lay near and on its embankment, with very careful excavation it was possible to define the stadium's boundaries and the course of the race-track, and low earthen steps were identified in the embankment. (AEMTH 8, 131-36; 9, 167-72) Leibethra. E. Poulaki-Pandermali describes a project to establish an archaeological and nature park on a SE spur of Mt Olympos, an area associated with myths of Orpheus and the Muses. The first stage of the work was the investigation of a fortified acropolis which proved to have been abandoned in the late 2nd/early 1st Ct BC after a natural disaster. A variety of finds included many coins dating from LA to LHL, and in particular a hoard of 16 silver HL tetradrachms beneath the roots of a holly-oak (AAA 23-28, 56-62). The hoard, fully illustrated, is published by Chr. Gatzolis. It consisted of one coin of Perseus, 14 New Style of Athens and one of Macedonia under Roman rule, and sheds new light on various aspects of numismatic evi- dence in Macedonia in the 2nd Ct BC (AAA 23-28, 298-312). Both articles were in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou. Louloudies Kitrous. Work on the main railway line from Athens to Thessalonike investigated a LR/EByz cemetery and, 150m S, remains of a fortification complex with four towers, enclosed by walls some 1.30m wide (no extent of the fortifica- tions is given). Found with them, however, were important remains of a large basilica (35.50 x 19m) with ancillary build- ings on either side of the narthex, three antae at the apse, typi- cal cross-shaped enkainion, raised stylobates and column-capi- tals of the time of Justinian; also, the remains of a large public building (42 x 24m) with 5th-Ct AD mosaic floor. The building was built on top of an earlier structure and was organized around a spacious apsidal triclinium. Eight large barrel-vaulted tombs were also located, three of which had painted decoration (red foliate decoration flanked by partridges framing an extract from the Book of Psalms). The entire complex is similar to episcopal palaces in Illyricum and Asia Minor, and should be identified with such a complex. A date may be provided in the third quarter of the 5th Ct AD, associated with the transfer to here of the episcopal see of Pydna in 480, handed over to Theodoric's Ostrogoths in return for their keeping away from Thessalonike. (ADelt 531) Makrygialos. Agiasma. Four more reports by M. Bessios and M. Pappa on this remarkable two-phase LN site have</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 89 appeared (AEMTH 8, 137-146; 9, 173-8; ADelt 461-2; and in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou in AAA 23-28, 13-30). A description of the site was given in AR 1996-97, 73. Not suffi- ciently emphasized there is the fact that this was a settlement of the flat, extended type, known in the Balkans, but only recently recognized in Macedonia. Makrygialos is the first such site to be extensively excavated, allowing reliable study of the organi- zation of such settlements. The great area which they occupy is not due to large populations but rather to the way space was used within the community. Additional details are that the ear- lier, early LN, phase I is characterized by black burnished pot- tery which corresponds to the Larisa phase in Thessaly, and the later, late LN, phase II by painted pottery of the classic Dimeni type; the ditches which bounded the phase I settlement had their outward side protected by stone walls; and an apsidal megaron, a major innovation at so early a date, belongs to a late sub-phase of phase II. Finds are remarkable for numbers and variety. Amongst them may be singled out 65 copper objects found in phase II, and 250 figurines, which are of known clay types in both phases, joined by schematic marble ones in phase II only. Platamon. Investigations took place on the walls and tow- ers. The point where the inside face of the walls of the acropo- lis meets with that of the settlement bears traces of a MByz phase, 5.50m below the battlements and 1.50m high from pres- ent ground level. A trial trench to the NE of the small chapel of Agia Paraskeve did not find as yet evidence for an earlier Byz structure. Another trial trench on the S side of the wall, W of the gate, provided reasonably reliable Byz stratigraphy. The church in the NW area of the enclosure was investigat- ed: this was initially single-aisled, with a narthex added in the 10th-1 lth Ct AD; later it was expanded by the addition of an aisle on each side, to give a typical LByz church type in N Greece (14th Ct AD). The N aisle was demolished at a later date, and in a fourth phase, a further trapezoidal narthex was added and a chapel created to the S. A destruction level was found in front of the sanctuary area. A cemetery of three layers of hum- ble burials E of the chapel is associated with the LByz phase. The area around the chapel appears to have been considered a holy place in Byz times, and still is so today. (ADelt 531-4) Anc. Pydna. N cemetery. M. Besios and A. Krachtopoulou report on the excavation of 338 burials in Makrygialos agricul- tural holding No. 480, which is directly N of the anc. city wall. The site was first used as a cemetery in the LBA, when con- tracted burials in small pits, which may once have been covered by a tumulus, were the rule. Its function changed in the EIA, when a trench some 40m long may have marked a settlement boundary. In the A period the site again became a cemetery, and with the exception of a break in the first half of the 4th Ct BC, when the town was deserted, remained in use until the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. In the A-HL period the most common type of grave was the pit grave with a wooden coffin or a wooden cover resting on a ledge; also found were jar burials of infants; many tile graves, a few stone sarcophagi; some cremation burials in shallow pits; and in one case cremated bones inurned in a 6th-Ct BC hydria. Few graves were intact-many were disturbed by the digging of subsequent tombs, and looting began in antiquity-but some spectacular burials were preserved. Among them was a LBA grave, which had the bronze ornaments of a diadem (once mounted on leather) on the skull, stone beads near the neck, two bronze omphalia at the waist, where they must have fastened a belt, and bronze rings on the fingers. Three Myc clay alabastra accompanied the burial. An A grave also had remains of a diadem, of bronze links and small glass beads, a bronze fibula, many amber beads, a few pendants of Macedonian type, and bronze bracelets and fin- ger rings. Four bronze attachments in the form of crosses in the waist area were probably from a girdle. Three clay vases and a bronze phiale were unfortunately crushed. The 5th Ct BC, par- ticularly its first half, was the period of the cemetery's greatest use, and despite looting and other damage a large number of clay vases survived. The majority were Attic, followed by Cor, while local wares were in the minority. Many were bf lekythoi, while kylikes, skyphoi and oinochoai were also popular. Bronze phialai, glass vessels and a large number of figurines from chil- dren's graves were also present. Two horse burials probably took place after the cemetery had gone out of use.

Lykiardopoulou-Petrou gives a well-illustrated account of the establishment and equipment of the conservation laboratory in the new museum, and discusses the various methods used to treat the site's rich variety of finds. (AEMTH 9, 59-70) Anarrache (8km ESE of Ptolemaida). In a study in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, E. Kefalidou publishes a coin hoard which M. Lioures found in his garden and presented to the Kozani Archaeological Collection in 1986. The hoard consisted of 81 bronze coins in an unpainted clay aryter. They are issues of Philip II and Alexander the Great, and the hoard was probably buried before the end of the 4th Ct BC. All the coins are illus- trated. Other antiquities have been found in the area, and a sug- gestion is made that the Eordaian city of Kranna, known epi- graphically, may possibly have been in the vicinity. (AAA 23- 28, 277-97) Angelochori (12km NE of Naoussa). E. Stefani conducted a rescue excavation at the toumba 1.5km NNE of this village after it had suffered considerable damage from illegal levelling for cultivation and attacks by antiquities thieves. All material from the test was LBA, with matt-painted pottery predominant. Other finds included loom-weights, bone and stone tools and a bronze pin with a single spiral head. No building remains were discov- ered, but stratigraphy suggested the presence of a built-up plat- form of earthen fill like those known at other PR Macedonian sites. (AEMTH 8, 125-30; ADelt 547) Apidea, Tsotili (ca. 40km W of Kozani) (AR 1997-98, 84-5). In 1994 work continued on the HL settlement in the Boufari area. The external and internal walls of a group of three houses belonging to a single architectural plan were uncovered. The E and W walls of the complex extended to the S to form a large courtyard in front of the doorways of the buildings. These walls had buttresses at intervals. The finds from the building complex are provisionally dated to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC, while the complex itself may also represent the 4th Ct BC. On the west slopes of the site, terrace walls and strata of the LBA/EIA were found, albeit much disturbed by the later buildings. (ADelt 548-9) Archontiko (4.5km NW of anc.

In 1994 and 1995, work concentrat- ed on the E side of the toumba summit and upper slope, and two</page><page sequence="88">90 DAVID BLACKMAN successive BA phases were distinguished. The earlier, found mainly on the slope, had buildings with walls of thickly-set posts packed with clay; many of the post-holes had remains of burnt wood. Floors were also of packed clay. A small domed oven and a number of other clay structures were probably con- cerned with food preparation and storage. Seeds continued to be found in quantity, amongst which S. Valamoti identified einko- rn wheat, barley, acorns and vetch. A heavy destruction level had preserved quantities of sherds and a number of whole pots. The majority were cooking or stor- age vessels-some of the latter had cord-impressed decoration. Smaller vessels included amphoriskoi with high handles, spher- ical single-handled pots, bowls and a small fire-pot or brazier. Amongst the small finds were mill-stones, spindle whorls, loom-weights, and a few bone and stone tools. The intramural burial of a child in a large jar, near a hearth, was the second to be discovered. A number of C14 datings place this phase between 2,300 and 1,900 BC. Similarly-dated buildings with post-holes were found on the S slope of the Toumba in a previ- ous season, indicating that the settlement at this stage covered a large area. In the succeeding phase, found only on the summit, buildings had narrow stone socles, and formless heaps of small- er stones may possibly have fallen from their superstructure. The area was eroded, and often patches of clay flooring, hearths and other clay structures were all that remained. Pottery includ- ed much coarse plain monochrome, striated ware, black-and- brown burnished wares, incised wares and a small number of painted sherds. Several whole pots with incised decoration were recovered. The well-executed designs included groups of straight lines, triangles, zig-zags, spirals and a type of rosette; traces of white filling were preserved. Similar pottery was found by Heurtley at Axiochori (Vardaroftsa) Kilindir (Kalindria) and Saratse (Perivolaki) in strata he designated MBA. Small finds included spindle-whorls and stone and bone tools; amongst the few metal objects were an axe-head and a needle; and a single schematic anthromorphic clay figurine was recovered. (AEMTH 8, 83-90; 9, 137-42). Table (AR 1996-97, 74-5). A. and P. Chrysostomou contin- ued their excavation here in 1994. The upper, C/LHL phase is represented by a few sections of walls and a number of small objects. Significant architecture appeared in the lower, IA/A phase. Although no individual house plans can yet be identified, two parallel stone-built N-S walls which extended over several tests, had Im-wide doorways directly opposite each other. Associated clay floors were found, plus small storage structures and pits cut down into the bedrock. Sherds from between the two parallel walls were particularly fragmentary, suggesting it may not have been an indoor area. In other areas of the same phase, however, large fragments of decorated IA pottery of good quality were discovered. They included sherds from a hand-made amphora with horizontally-set shoulder handles, decorated with horizontal registers of painted motifs including compass-drawn concentric circles (comparable with the well- known one found by Petsas at Vergina) and a base sherd from a skyphos, inscribed with a name and trademark. Another discov- ery was a stone-built structure similar in shape to a pottery kiln, but with no evidence of its having been used as such. (AEMTH 8, 72-82; ADelt 539-40) Aspre Pole, Perdikka (5km N of Ptolemaida). In 1995 E. Kephalidou and K. Moschakis undertook a rescue excavation, funded by the electricity authority AEH, within the boundary of the area to be used for lignite mining. They discovered the NW quarter of a very large courtyard with rooms ranged round it two to three deep. The walls, much reduced by deep ploughing, had a socle of unworked stones from an adjacent stream bed. In one instance the superstructure was of baked brick, but no mor- tar was present. The only floor found was of clay, and one room had had some purple wall-plaster. The roof had been of tiles, and for water supply and drainage, round clay pipes (some in situ) had been employed. Much pottery of the 1st Ct AD was recovered. Amongst other finds were a lamp with a Nike on its disk, and small bronze statues representing Heracles and Hermes. The complex was rather large to have been a private dwelling. The excavation was to continue the following year. (AEMTH 9, 38-43, 46) Boubousti - see Platania. Edessa: upper city/acropolis (AR 1997-98, 85). A building plot on Argyriou Kytanou St, just within the anc. city wall, con- tained no building remains, but its stratigraphy reflected much of the area's history. A thick, uncontaminated IA level which contained both local matt-painted and G sherds, was succeeded by a HL destruction. Above that was material from the Byz fortress of Vodena, the Ch quarter of Varoshi of the Ott period, and the burnt destruction level of the 1945 occupation. A plot on the corer of Archiereos Meletiou and Archiereos Panteleimonas Sts was in a similar area and had HL-World War II remains. A plot on Pelles St had seven graves, probably Ott, cut into the bedrock, and a plot on Kioutacheias St contained 9 graves cut in the bedrock and a tile grave, which were part of a known ECh cemetery. (ADelt 540-2) Lower city: north cemetery (AR 1996-97, 75). In 1994, excavation continued in Kartsoles' field, bringing the total number of tombs there to 83. The tombs were of the same types as in previous years: an underground rock-cut vaulted chamber tomb, rectangular pits cut in the bedrock, and tile graves which contained either inhumations or R cremations. In the ante- chamber of the chamber tomb, tomb 50, 3 ECh burials had been deposited; it also contained displaced earlier burials. Despite a securely blocked doorway, the chamber proper was filled with R debris which had fallen through a hole in the ceiling. A few finds connected with the tomb's original HL use were preserved in sediment. Among them was an interesting group consisting of a gold necklace with a negro's head at either end, gold ear- rings with lynx heads, a gold bracelet composed of 14 beads, a silver pin and a bg unguentarium. Four female terracotta fig- urines were also recovered. In the N part of the Boubaras field, 78 graves were excavated. Most were pits cut in the bedrock, with a few tile graves and another rock-cut chamber tomb. They were of R-ECh date and finds included pottery and jewellery of the period. Amongst the latter ECh bronze or gilded fibulae were predominant; these are indicative of people with a public position, particularly officers or dignitaries. (ADelt 542-3) Haliakmon barrage sites: Polemistra, Aiane. A. Chondrogianne-Metoke reports on a new BA site on the left bank of the Haliakmon at the SW (upriver) limit of the Polyphyto Dam. The site, much eroded by the waters of the dam, is situated on two long, low plateaus, divided by a ravine. The left plateau, viewed from the river valley, had remains of a settlement of the late EBA period, which showed no sign of destruction in the limited excavated area, but was apparently abandoned (perhaps because of flooding) before it was used for MBA graves. Two child burials in pithoi were within the settle- ment fill, and another pithos burial and a pit grave with a cover slab were on the plateau's disturbed slopes. MBA pots showing</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 91 strong affinities with Thessaly, which were previously found in the immediate area, were probably displaced grave goods. On the right plateau a test revealed two successive buildings. The earlier had been built of stones and clay, and had been destroyed by fire. Beneath the destruction debris were a few pots similar to some from MBA Argissa; from these a radiocar- bon date of 1968-1765 BC was obtained. A second building, partly founded on the first, preserved herringbone masonry made of small flat stones on a foundation of two courses of large unworked stones, the whole bonded with earth. Debris suggested that the superstructure had probably been of unbaked mud-brick. The shallow deposit within the building contained very few finds. A third, still later, probably circular construction of stone, possibly part of a peribolos, passed over the MBA building. The waters had destroyed any associated stratigraphy, but sherds found in the area were LBA. Another similar section of curved stone-built walling was located but not excavated. (AEMTH 8, 27-36; ADelt 550) Kitrine Limne (Sarigol) (AR 1996-97,76; 1998-99, 88). In 1994 three tests were opened on the summit of the Megalo Nesi Galanes toumba, 80m S of the previously-excavated area. The topsoil, disturbed by deep ploughing, contained material from all three phases so far known on the site: LN, FN and EBA. Below this, FN remains were found, comprising fallen building material, isolated parts of floors, post-holes, and numerous pits. These last probably accounted for some LN sherds amongst the FN pottery. As the excavation progressed to lower levels, the quantity of LN pottery increased. Other finds included stone tools of flint, obsidian and quartz, bone needles, spatulas and awls, tools of deer horn, and jewellery of shell (mainly spondy- lus), bone, clay and flint. Botanical remains consisted of einko- rn and dicoccum wheat, barley, oats, lentils, peas, grapes, cor- nel-berries, elderberries, blackberries, lentisk or mastich berries and a kind of plum. The wheat was almost certainly cultivated, but the other species could have been gathered from wild plants. In 1995, in view of the proximity of lignite mining, a rescue excavation funded by the electricity authority AEH took place on a low mound S of the village of Kleitos, on the N edge of the former marsh of Sarigol. Much of the site had been disturbed by deep ploughing. A number of tests on the summit and on the periphery were excavated to stereo. The finds date to LN and FN and are similar to contemporary material from Megalo Nesi Galanes, above. There are indications that the site continued into the EBA, and it was reoccupied in the HL and R periods. During rescue excavations in advance of the new Via Egnatia, part of an late EBA cemetery was discovered in the Xeropigado locality, at the SE end of the Sarig6l basin, lkm NW of the vil- lage of Koilada. The 33 graves so far excavated were of vary- ing types: pit graves covered by cairns or fragments of large storage jars; pit graves within a frame of unworked stones; child burials in jars; and three cremations, one inured, and another in the same grave as an apparently contemporary inhumation. The dead were usually buried in a contracted position, and accompanied by one or two pots, usually small kantharoi or sin- gle-handled cups. BA cemeteries are rare in Northern Greece, and this is a welcome addition. The excavation was to continue. (Ch. Ziota, ADelt 550-1; AEMTH 9, 47-58) Konstantia (10km ENE of Aridaia). A. Chrysostomou reports on the first excavation season at a new IA cemetery in the Xerika locality, consisting of about 40 tumuli bordering a ravine. The tumuli were 8-14m in diameter; two elongated ones measured 20 x 8m and 17 x llm respectively. The tumuli were made of unworked stones from the river bed. Each covered one tomb, which was always entered from the E via a dromos. This and the chamber were usually lined with rough orthostats (cf. Neromyloi-Prodromos, below). At the chamber entrance, two larger orthostats served as door jambs, and perhaps also as grave markers, and in one instance another large flat stone was used as a threshold. The chamber entrance was blocked by a further stone slab. Floors were sometimes strewn with small stones, and one intact tumulus indicates that the tombs were roofed with false corbelling, which was probably removed for each succes- sive burial. There was some development in chamber plans, ear- lier ones being oval and later ones more rectangular. The intact tumulus 2 contained a jumbled mass of bones, including at least 10 skulls, and many grave goods. Pottery included hand-made kantharoi with high-swung handles surmounted by a knob, and jars with vertical handles and fluted decoration. Amongst other finds were clay spindle-whorls, small iron knives, whetstones, beads of bronze, glass and stone, many hair-coils, bracelets, a circular pendant, large and small spectacle fibulae, several kinds of arched fibulae, and double pins. No imported pottery and no weapons were found. (AEMTH 9, 155-66) Kypsele (ca 15km NE of Vergina) (AR 1996-97, 76; 1997-98, 86; 1998-99, 87). In 1994 new tests were opened to the N and W of the walls discovered in 1993 in the N part of the site, and a coherent house plan, 18 x 18.50m, with seven internal rooms, emerged. One room had a central hearth or oven, while in another much fallen red and white plaster was found. Finds included domestic pottery, iron nails and various other metal finds, plentiful animal bones, parts of pithoi in situ, and numer- ous figurine fragments. The house had had two phases, dated by finds and coins to the 4th and 3rd Cts BC. The first two rooms of another building, dating to the 3rd-2nd Cts BC, were found on the W side of the plateau. (ADelt 547-8) Lefkadia. Further work took place on the wall found in the Chatzenotas field in the Tsifliki locality (AR 1998-99, 87) also known by the name of Acropolis. The wall was built along the brow of a naturally-defended height, which is surrounded by two branches of the Arapitsa river. Almost certainly a fortifica- tion, it was 1.60m in width, and had inner and outer faces of large rectangular limestone blocks and a central fill of clay and smaller stones; this was presumably the foundation for a brick superstructure. Much of the inner face was only represented by bedrock cuttings. The wall ran E-W and was traced for 61m. A test 126m W of the W end of the main excavation, however, revealed another 6m length on the same line. No exact date can be given for the wall's construction; the very few finds near it (sherds, coins) were of HL date. There was one notable discov- ery, however, a small oval clay sealing from a papyrus. On the back were impressions of the papyrus fabric and the thread which had tied it. On the front was a seal impression reading: HPAKAEAI / rPAMMATO / OYAAKOI. (AEMTH 9, 79-94; ADelt 545-7) Anc. Mieza. In AEMTH 9, 79-94, V. Allamani and A. Koukouvou discuss the relationship of the known monuments to the topography of the anc. city, and report on excavation results in 1994-95. Much of this was covered in AR 1996-97, 76 -7, based on a booklet by V. Allamani which appeared in 1995. The following information is additional. 'Stoa'. The foundations of two parallel E-W walls, 7m apart and over 100m long, had been provisionally identified as a stoa, but new evidence makes it more probable that they bordered a</page><page sequence="90">92 DAVID BLACKMAN road and had buildings on either side. Foundations adjacent to the W end of the N wall are now shown to have a ground plan similar to a temple, with a narrow ante-chamber and a long main chamber (its W end remains unexcavated). Entrance was from the E; and 6m from the entrance was an apothetes filled with stones, tiles and pottery spanning more than a century; col- umn fragments were found nearby. Another 30m length of wall on the same line was found, 80m E of the known E end of the N wall, but it had a 10m long return to the S at its E end. A series of tests produced no evidence for its connection with the long N wall, and it seems more likely to be a separate building. Theatre. Further tests were undertaken in all areas. The drainage of the orchestra may have been through a natural hole (or holes) in the bedrock. Outside the theatre the SW corer of a large building was discovered, its foundation probably con- temporary with that of the theatre, some time after 100 BC. Neromyloi-Prodromos (12km NE of Aridaia). After illegal mechanical excavation on Goritsa Hill in 1993, followed by inroads by antiquities thieves in 1994, A. Chrysostomou and E. Stefani undertook rescue excavations. On the SE summit, near Neromyloi, the thieves had uncovered a rectangular room of R construction. A pit connected with it contained inter alia a 3rd- Ct AD Attic lamp from the workshop of TlIPEIOOY, a type also found at Isthmia. W of the room were the remains of a HL building with abundant pottery, and in one area, tools, loom- weights and spools. On the NW summit, near Prodromos, an IA cemetery with about 40 tumuli received preliminary investiga- tion. The tumuli were built of large unworked stones, were 15- 20m in diameter and 1-1.5m in height, and seemed to be in groups. One which had been opened by robbers contained an unusual elliptical grave outlined by unworked orthostats, with an opening marked by two taller slabs acting as door jambs; this gave onto a short dromos (cf. Konstantia, above). (AEMTH 8, 83-102; ADelt 543-4) Anc. Pella: agora (AR 1996-97, 77). I. Akamatis continued exca- vations in the agora on behalf of the University of Thessalonike in 1994 -1995. In the public archives at the SW comer of the agora, removal of baulks reinforced the evidence for its destruc- tion by a savage conflagration, confined to its NE sector. The fill of the road to the S of the S stoa was tested to the stereo; three stages were found. The latest surface had late 2nd/ early 1st-Ct BC material upon it; 1.60-1.70m below this was the 3rd-Ct BC surface. The test also showed that the agora building on this side was on a foundation of compacted clayey earth, pro- visionally dated to the later 4th Ct BC. Further tests showed that the road fills were largely composed of rubbish from workshops, amongst which was a seal from a papyrus. A drop in the water table enabled the lower fills of eight wells belonging to the shops/workshops in the E stoa to be fur- ther investigated in 1994; the water level again proved higher than the bottom of the wells. The material recovered ranged from the late 4th to the early 1st Cts BC, and included quantities of bg and plain domestic pottery in a great variety of forms; there were also many amphora sherds, the majority from Thasos. Broken figurines, nails, lead objects, parts of weapons, marble objects, clay fragments from a metal foundry, slag, car- bonized matter, raw clay, lumps of bronze, faience, pumice, mill-stones, small masses of coloured pigments, objects of metal and bone, clay loomweights, small lumps of glass and bones and shells were also found in various combinations, according to the nature of the relevant workshop. Numerous bronze coins ensured the close dating of the deposits. A ninth well, slightly investigated in 1987, was excavated in 1995. In the central plateia of the agora the removal of accumulated soil was begun; this grew deeper towards the N, where there were foundations of bases, monuments and fragments of inscriptions. Most of the W stoa has been eroded, often to below founda- tion level, by deep ploughing, but tests in 1995 unexpectedly uncovered part of a destruction level of the early 1st Ct BC. Sealed beneath fallen mud brick and roof tiles were pots of many varieties, including unusual forms and much terra sigilla- ta. Amongst hundreds of lamps found were a number of the Ephesian type and others with makers' names on their bases. Many broken Macedonian amphoras were uncovered, often retaining evidence of their contents, such as oil. In a corer of one establishment were many other amphoras with pointed bases. Many of them were stamped, allowing the study of the output of various workshops in the years of the eponymous archons. They dated to the late 2nd-early 1st Cts BC. Most of them were from Knidos, others from Rhodes, Kos, and N Africa. Many came from S Italy; a number of these belonged to the Lamboglia 2 group (known as oil amphoras), while others belonged to the Brindisi group. All these amphoras contained not the wine or oil for which their places of origin were famous, but wheat (Tricoccum aestivum bulgarae). Another surprising find was a number of narrow lead tubes, a by-product of silver refining, which had a commercial value, as they could be used to produce lead objects after being heated. Lead objects of sev- eral kinds were found in the area. Coins included both new Athenian tetradrachms and Roman denarii of the issues of Mn. Aemilius Lepidus of 114 or 113 BC and L. Thorius Balbus of 105 BC. (AEMTH 8, 45-52; 9, 95-104) Canal area (SW of the museum) (AR 1997-98, 87). M. Lilibaki-Akamati continued work on the denuded remains of the building complex in the city insula SE of the sanctuary of the local healing god, Darron, and presents arguments for its identification as a hestiatorion, or banqueting area of the type often associated with sacred places and religious festivals. It had a large rectangular open space for assemblies, round which were dining rooms with slightly raised plaster platforms for 8-9 couches round the walls, and central mosaic floors; most of these were unpattered, of grey and white tesserae, but one had a complex floral design on its floor and a female centaur on its threshold (AR 1984-85, 44; 1985-86, 62, Figs 85-86). Cisterns, pipes, conduits and a well attest that the complex was well sup- plied with water, but no evidence for cooking has yet been found. The building was erected in the early 3rd Ct BC, but pot- tery from the area goes back to the early 4th Ct BC, indicating that this sector may have been the core of the first phase of Pella as a capital city. (AEMTH 9, 105-116) Ceramic workshop area (AR 1996-97, 77). Excavation was extended to the S, uncovering a plastered cistern, used as a pot- ters' dump. S of the cistern was a pavement with a stone drain equipped with a settling-tank on its N side. (ADelt 535-6) Roman colony. Pavlos Chrysostomou gives the provisional results of tests undertaken in 1995. These were 190m NW of the so-called 'baths of Alexander' at the centre of this new R foun- dation, which was E of the present village of Nea Pella. A sec- tion of its W fortification wall and parts of two towers were found and the enceinte's W gate was possibly identified. Within the defence wall was a series of chambers and passages running parallel to it. Destruction material of the 4th-5th Cts was encoun- tered. In another area, a room and other walls, again with a destruction level, may represent the final phase of the ECh town. Above these ruins was built a small single-cell mortuary chapel surrounded by graves of the LByz period. A valuable</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 93 account is given of all the information about the new settlement obtainable from earlier excavations and other finds, and literary and historical sources; this covers the period from its founda- tion by Octavian in 30 BC to the early Ott period. (AEMTH 9, 117-136) Tumuli with Macedonian tombs. Pavlos Chrysostomou reports that repeated attacks on these funerary mounds in 1994- 95 by gangs of determined and well-equipped antiquities thieves necessitated their urgent excavation by the Archaeological Service. Though all proved to have been robbed in antiquity, often more than once, much of value still remained. Macedonian tomb r, covered by the fifth tumulus in the E cemetery of Pella, to the S of the main road, proved to be an underground building approached by a sloping dromos cut into the bedrock. It was built of local limestone and had an Ionic facade coated in fine white plaster resembling marble. The walls of the ante-chamber and chamber had also been plastered; much was destroyed, but fragments on the upper chamber walls had been painted with feminine toilet articles (a mirror, a small chest, ribbons) and some of the remaining grave goods also indicated that the tomb had originally been built for an impor- tant lady of Pella, though it had been reopened for later burials of family members. The architecture and finds suggest a date at the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. The large Macedonian tomb A, found beneath the E ceme- tery's fourth tumulus, had been invaded by several gangs in antiquity, who left graffiti in both Greek and Latin. The tomb was approached by a long, steep rock-cut dromos with a central flight of 19 steps. It was of local limestone and had a Doric facade with four engaged half-columns, again plastered to imi- tate marble, with architectural details picked out in blue, dark red, yellow and black. The remains of the double-leafed doors of both the chamber and the ante-chamber were on the ante- chamber floor. The upper part of the left-hand ante-chamber stone door was decorated with a roundel of a gorgon's head in coloured plaster, while the upper left panel of the marble cham- ber door had a fine sculptured head of Medusa. The ante-cham- ber floor was of cut bedrock, plastered with white clay; the chamber floor was paved with rectangular limestone slabs. The walls of both chambers were plastered and painted with archi- tectural designs. It is suggested that this tomb was another work of the architect responsible for the Giannitsa (AR 1996-97, 76) and Agios Athanasios (AR 1997-98, 77) tombs, and it is dated to the end of the 4th Ct BC. Macedonian tomb E, beneath tumulus B of Rachona (4.5km N of Pella), had a plainer Doric facade, its entablature and ped- iment being supported only by a pilaster at either end. It was covered with a medium-grade plaster. Marble akroteria in the form of palmettes were an unusual detail. The single chamber was square in plan, and had architectural designs and bands of plant decoration painted on its plastered walls. Iron nails from which ribbons, crowns and garlands were once suspended were in situ. The floor was of cut bedrock covered with white clay. The tomb had contained three burials, one in an above-ground cist of stone slabs, and two laid out on wooden biers placed on stone bases. Notable amongst the displaced finds was a gold ear-ring ending in a negro head carved from a dark red gem- stone, a known type from a Macedonian workshop of the third quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. The finds and architecture suggest that the tomb should be dated after the mid-3rd Ct BC. Macedonian tomb 2T was beneath the dominant tumulus of the W cemetery, 400m W of the anc. city and 125m N of the main road. Its long dromos, not quite at right angles to the tomb, had walls lined with masonry and had been roofed. This proba- bly accounted for the tomb's plain facade, which had no archi- tectural decoration, only a plaster coat. Within the tomb, the chamber and ante-chamber had plain white-plastered walls in which were iron nails for funerary decorations. The floors were also of thick plaster. The chamber contained three sarcophagi, in which two adult males and a woman had been buried. Robbers had broken open the sarcophagi and scattered the bones and minor grave goods, which included much pottery and a few overlooked gold objects. The sarcophagi were made from reused limestone and marble slabs, which had come from two large funerary monuments. The first had been a flat-topped Ionic naiskos with rectangular door jambs: the left jamb pre- served the outline of a spear-bearing male, while the right jamb had a relief sculpture of a youth clad in a tunic and cloak, with a petasos on his head and felt shoes. The second monument had had an architectural framework, and a relief of a horseman overcoming two enemies. These sculptures, along with another found earlier at Pella, are in the tradition of Lysippos, whose work was favoured by Alexander the Great and his successors. On the basis of its architecture and finds, the tomb is dated to the second quarter of the 3rd Ct BC, while the re-used funerary monuments resemble Attic examples of the late 4th Ct BC. Tumuli with cist and pit graves. Tumulus 3 in the E ceme- tery covered a large, deep, rectangular pit grave cut in the bedrock. It had a number of steps on its E side and three on its N side to facilitate lowering the wooden bier of the original bur- ial, which scattered bone showed to have been that of a female. The tomb was later reopened to admit the cremated remains of two children, which were placed in niches cut into the longer sides of the grave. The cremation in the N niche had apparent- ly been placed in a small wooden lamax covered with planks; grave goods included a heavy silver ring, gilded clay beads, a bg vase and a pair of small gold ear-rings. Above the cremated bones in the S niche were three female protomes (probably rep- resenting Aphrodite of the Dead or Pasikrata), a small alabas- tron and a lekythos, all of which had apparently been burnt on the pyre. The original burial probably took place in the time of Philip II, and the two cremations in the third quarter of the 4th century. A further cremation in a plain ash urn with a bg plate as a cover was inserted into the S side of the grave in the early 2nd Ct BC. The bones had been wrapped in a gold-embroided cloth. Grave goods included two plain clay unguentaria, a bronze bowl and a pair of gold ear-rings in the form of doves. Tumulus 6, 4km E of anc. Pella and the easternmost, had a large, early 3rd-Ct BC cist tomb on its W edge which was exca- vated in 1986. In 1994 another large cist was found beneath the mound's centre. Its walls consisted of three courses of large stone blocks lining a cutting in the bedrock, and it was covered by six further massive blocks which had cracked under the weight of earth above. The bedrock floor had cuttings for the legs of the wooden bier. Tunnels through the bedrock showed that the grave had been robbed three times. Broken fragments of grave goods date the burial to the end of the 4th Ct. BC. The Ambelia tumulus (1.10km NE of mod. Pella), largely ploughed away, had covered three cist graves of the late 4th- early 3rd Cts BC. They were similar in construction to the grave of tumulus 6, above. All had been robbed in antiquity, but tomb II retained much of interest, including vases, a female protome preserving traces of colour, iron nails and a key, gold and gild- ed clay beads, gilded bronze myrtle leaves from a banqueting wreath, sheet gold, and gold threads from embroidered cloth. Bronze fittings, a silver nail and ivory plaques decorated with plant, animal and human forms probably came from a chest or couch. There were also decorations from a chryselephantine</page><page sequence="92">94 DAVID BLACKMAN couch (glass eyes, glass plaques and palmettes, bone bands and other bone fragments including a human head, hands and feet from its frieze). (AEMTH 8, 53-72; 9, 143-54; ADelt 536-9) East cemetery. In an article in memory of Julia Vokoto- poulou, M. Lilibaki-Akamati publishes two rock-cut vaulted chamber tombs found in building sites in the NE part of the mod. village in 1993-94. They are similar in construction and grave goods (clay unguentaria and other HL pottery, lamps, coins, strigils, a fibula) to previously-published Pella chamber tombs, and date to the 2nd half of the 3rd and 1St half of the 2nd Cts BC. They are the most northerly tombs so far discovered in the E cemetery, and confirm that the cemetery extended directly out- side the E boundaries of the anc. city, with clusters of tombs cov- ering a distance of about 2km on a N-S axis. (AAA 23-28, 81-8) Another similar tomb in the E cemetery was discovered dur- ing the excavation of foundations in the plot of E. Tzakares. Part of its ceiling was destroyed. The few finds included a plate, part of a pitcher and an iron strigil and fibula. (ADelt 536) Petres (W shore of Lake Petro, 4km N ofAmindaio) (AR 1996- 97, 78; 1997-98, 88). P. Adam-Veleni reports on the 1995 sea- son, which concentrated on the fountain district of this HL city, and summarizes the results from that quarter since 1987, when a projecting corer led to the discovery of a fountain house. Since then, three large insulae separated by three N-S roads have been excavated. The main thoroughfare was the E road, 3m wide, the width and gentler slope of which would have been suitable for wheeled vehicles. Beneath it ran a clay pipe bring- ing water down to the fountain. The other two roads were nar- rower and steeper. In the E insula, to the E of the main road, seven rooms were found, five of which probably belonged to the same complex. In its very large central area six pithoi were set near the entrance from the road, and farther E another eight very large pithoi, arranged in closely-packed rows, had so far been discovered. A small room just to the S of the entrance con- tained another pithos and a large lump of resin, which suggests that wine was stored in some of the pithoi. Elsewhere in the same complex were various installations, including a number of built-in mill-stones. This complex is con- sidered to be a public store rather than part of a private resi- dence. Some of the rooms in the central insula had installations similar to those in the E insula, and in one of these a hoard of 29 2nd-Ct BC bronze coins from the mints of Pella, Thessalonike and Amphipolis was found. A building in the W insula had a large rectangular chamber with a central hearth, 2.70m square, bordered by large stones set on end and filled with succesive ash layers containing bones, tile fragments and various organic materials. At the entrance of the adjacent long narrow chamber to its E was a fallen stele inscribed AABPEIA IEPCN All BWMOZ, identifying it as a shrine to Zeus. The priest Dabreias is already known from another inscription as the priest of Zeus Eleutherios and of Rome, and also from his funerary stele. The other building in the same insula is very sim- ilar in plan, and may be a second shrine to another deity. The public store in the E insula may well be connected with the wor- ship of Zeus, as may the central insula. Higher up the slope were luxurious residences. (AEMTH 9, 15-23) Philotas (8km SSE of Amindaio). A fragment of an honorific decree of white marble, found during the demolition of an old house in the village and presented to Florina museum by A. Tortokas, is publised by E. Kephalidou and K. Moschakis. It is in Greek and dates to the end of the 1st or first half of the 2nd Cts, and concerns a certain T. Flavius Philippos, high priest of the Macedonian League. It also mentions the Council of Eordaia or the Eordaians. During the construction of a new road, a new archaeological site was discovered 2.5km W of Philotas. The ensuing rescue excavation uncovered dwellings, workshops and periboloi dating from the late 2nd-early 1St Cts BC to the 3rd Ct AD, when the settlement was abandoned. The area was later used as a Ch cemetery. (AEMTH 9, 43-6) Platania (Boubousti) (ca. 12km SE of Argos Orestiko). In 1994, in the Anana locality, four new trenches were opened on the site of Heurtley's 1927 excavations, with the object of defin- ing the extent of the settlement and in the hope of finding undis- turbed stratigraphy. The E limits of the site were reached, and pottery of the categories described by Heurtley was found, but unfortunately the stratigraphy of the new trenches was dis- turbed. The excavation is to continue. (ADelt 549-50) Pyrgoi, Eordaia (37km N of Kozani). G. Karamitrou- Mendessidi excavated an unusual and early Macedonian tomb in this remote locality in 1995. It had had no mound, but was built in a cutting in a hillside; there were also signs of a built dromos. The tomb had been robbed in antiquity, and most of the vault was missing. It had a single chamber, with internal meas- urements of 2.83 x 2.55-2.58m, and was built of poros and limestone blocks. Its plain facade had been covered with off- white plaster, as had the interior; the latter had a dark grey band 0.13m wide running round all four walls 0.72m above the floor. The entrance had been closed by a double-leafed door, the right- hand leaf of which, pushed towards the interior of the tomb, remained in place. Within the chamber, to the left of the entrance, a displaced burial had survived, consisting of scat- tered bones, a bronze coin of Philip II, fragments from a gilded wreath, a small clay bowl, two iron strigils and a rf pelike of the Kerch type, with the bust of an Amazon and a griffin on one side and two himation-clad men on the other. The pelike is dated to 330-320 BC. (AEMTH 9, 25-38) Vergina. Remains of an ECh basilica, structure and baptistery (? circular building with traces of hydraulic cement on the floor and marble revetments on the walls) were located 200 m SW of the recently excavated basilica at the Tsimourla site. Built tombs were also located in the immediate vicinity. (ADelt 584) Sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods (AR 1996-97, 78-9; 997-98, 88). In AEMTH 8, 103-7, S. Drougou reports on the 1994 excavation season, when a portico belonging to the first HL phase was discovered in the SE of the building complex, parts of strong walls in the NW, and in the NE a room contain- ing a rich collection of figurines representing the various deities. This was covered in AR 1997-98, 88, based on the report in AEMTH 10. Shrine of Eukleia (AR 1996-97, 79; 1997-98, 88). In 1994 Ch. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli concentrated on the excavation and study of the roads near the shrine. The presence of a rather irreg- ular 2.70m-wide road bordered by parallel stone walls running approx. E-W across the N of the known shrine buildings was confirmed. In the W, steps probably led down from it to the lower level of the large peristyle building. In the E it joined a larger N- S road at right angles. This road would have led to the palace and the theatre; it was approx. 3.5m wide, and bounded by straight walls of unworked stones. A clay pipe ran along its E border. A heavy destruction level on the road, briefly tested, dated to the mid-2nd Ct BC; below it were remains of the early 4th Ct BC. To the N of the irregular E-W road, four square stone pillar bases suggested the presence of another building. (AEMTH 8, 109-17)</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 95 122. Anc. Amphipolis, gold ear-rings Acropolis (AR 1996-97, 79; 1997-98, 88). P. Faklaris reports on the 1994 excavations in AEMTH 8, 119-24. The W tower was investigated and part of the staircase leading to it located. Walls of dwellings were uncovered in other tests and in one post-holes with loom-weights nearby may mark the position of a loom 1.35m wide. Notable among a great variety of finds were three fragments of moulds for mould-made bowls, one of which, with a design of dancing women, matched a sherd recov- ered earlier elsewhere on the site; net sinkers and a large fish- hook, the first evidence for fishing found on the acropolis, pre- sumably for use in the Haliakmon; and an amphora handle stamped with the obverse of a coin of Perseus (179-168 BC), suggesting that the royal house may have had a hand in the Macedonian wine trade. Other finds included iron arrowheads, keys, a lock, a hinge, beads, gem-stones, glass vessel fragments and 85 coins of the 4th-2nd Cts BC. Amongst botanical remains were 2 grape pips, some chick-peas, 2 olive pits and a poppy- head, the latter probably for medicinal purposes. Veroia. In a plot on the comer of Metropoleos and Perikleous Sts part of a R road was found running parallel with today's Metropoleos St. Other parts of this R road have been identified in other plots. During excavations for drainage along Kentrikes St, a small section of another R road was found. (ADelt 544-5) Excavations at plot O.T. 211 (5 Edesses St, E of the central R road) revealed important LR and EByz remains. The area is though to have been the site of anc. and ECh Veroia, and much material has come to light in the vicinity over the years. Remains of a 4th-Ct AD structure were recognised as belonging to an ECh tetraconch baptistery, dated provisionally by coins to the second half of the 4th Ct AD. The centre of the structure is typically articulated as an octagon, defined by alternating con- cave and convex marble (?) balustrade panels. A destruction by fires is calculated to have occurred no later than the second half of the 5th Ct AD. Evidence of a church in the vicinity exists in the remains of an imposing hall with 4th-Ct AD mosaic floor discovered SW of the baptistery's antechamber. After its destruction, a large rectangular apsidal building was erected over the baptistery. The later building appears to be associated with a 5th-Ct AD basilica found nearby in earlier investigations. Abandonment is identified by use of the site as a cemetery no earlier than the first decades of the 7th Ct AD. (ADelt 579-82) Remains of two ECh basilicas were located near the village of Sphikia on the slopes of the Pieria range. One was 70 m dis- tant from the post-Byz church of Agios Demetrios (itself built on the site of an ECh basilica) and the other some 500 m. The latter church preserves the base of the original altar. Pottery dates these to the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th Ct AD. (ADelt 582-4) EASTERN MACEDONIA Amphipolis. Excavations in the courtyard of the new museum at Amphipolis (AR 1997-98, 89) continued and were completed in 1994. A gate, the sixth to be located in the enceinte, was found in the E fortification wall; it was 3m wide and had a walled external gate-court, 9 x 3m. The interior was flanked by strong door-jambs 1.50m in length. About the middle of the gate there were spur-walls on either side, and stone blocks with pivot-holes. The gate floor was of beaten earth, as was the road that ran through it into the town. There was a 6m gap between the interior of the wall and the nearest buildings, possibly a road. This first phase of the wall and gate dates to the end of the 5th/beginning of the 4th Cts BC. In a later phase, probably dat- ing to the 3rd Ct BC, the gate apparently went out of use and was blocked by a rough wall of unworked stones. Buildings encroached on the space immediately within the wall, narrow- ing it considerably. One of these was a house with a central courtyard. (ADelt 601) A report under the heading Nea Kerdyllia in ADelt 599-600 concerns the 1994 rescue excavation in the NW cemetery of anc. Amphipolis. This was covered in AR 1996-97, 81, based on an article in AEMTH 7. (Fig. 122 shows the gold ear-rings from a rich pit-cremation mentioned there, and Fig. 123 the reverse side of the Kertch hydria used as the ash um for another cre- mation; it is now on display in Amphipolis museum.) In the wider cemetery area of Amphipolis, which extends W of the Strymon, in the Kastrolakka locality of Nea Kerdyllia, a small tomb of 'Macedonian' type was located during changes to the district's irrigation network. Only the four lowest courses of masonry were preserved, the uppermost of which, on the long sides, began the curve of the vault. The external dimensions of the tomb were 3 x 1.90m, and it was entered from the E by a sloping dromos, through an off-centre doorway 1.40m high and 0.67m wide. A clay structure in the middle of the narrow W wall may have divided the chamber into two compartments; in the N one was a very poorly preserved skeleton. Finds in the disturbed interior suggest the tomb may once have contained a male and a female burial, the man represented by a plain aryter, an iron strigil and an iron ring and the woman by two unguentaria, two gold rings, two gold beads and a gold coin. There were also some possible remains of a bier or coffin. The tomb is dated to the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 606-7) Conservation work continued at the gymnasion. (Ergon 1999, 93) Anc.

Dikili Tash, mud-brick experiments 123. Anc. Amphipolis, Kertch hydria results were covered in AR 1996-97, 81; 1997-98, 89, but addi- tional points of interest follow. In the N Sector on the acropolis, a HL building which incor- porated A walls had an exceptionally large room (10 x 6m) with two large stone-built circular hearths at its E end, while the whole interior was divided into three equal parts by two short spur-walls attached to the S wall. Its purpose is unknown, but such a chamber would hardly have belonged to an ordinary dwelling. 10m NE of this, a well which was excavated to a depth of 7m contained exclusively HL pottery, indicating that habitation was resumed, at least on this part of the site, after the seizure of the city by Philip II in 357 BC, which was not the case in the S sector. The oldest pottery recovered in the N sec- tor consisted of E Greek/Ionian imports, chiefly bird bowls, and the so-called Thraco-Macedonian local pottery, dating to at least the last quarter of the 7th Ct BC. In the Harbour Sector, excavation was carried below the 6th- Ct BC remains in three trenches. Bedrock was not reached, but at 4m below the surface in successive strata of burning, sand and other deposits, local and imported sherds of the second half of the 7th Ct BC were found. Cave of the sources of the R Angites (Maara). Test excava- tion of the cave by the Ephorate of Spelaeology was completed, revealing an important bed of fossilized animal bones (mam- mals, mainly herbivore), tools of hard volcanic rock, pyritic 125. Dikili Tash, cooking experiments limestone and mainly quartz. Excavation outside the cave, on the left bank of the Angites, produced traces of a temporary camp-site; the pottery has parallels in the settlements of Sitagroi and Parademe. (ADelt 843) Drama. In 1994 renovations were begun on the building ceded by the demos of Drama to the Archaeological Service for use as a museum, and preparation of the new exhibition was in progress. It was to cover the cultural history of the area from the PR period to the liberation of the district in 1913. (ADelt 596) In a study in memory of Julia Vokotopoulou, E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou publishes a marble bust of Dionysos with a chequered history. It was seized by customs in 1925 dur- ing an attempt to export it from Thessalonike, and for many years was on display in the museum there. The would-be thief said it had turned up accidentally during cultivation of his vine- yard near the refugee settlement of Nea Stenimachos, to the SE of Drama, an area not otherwise known for antiquities, but appropriately rich in vines. The bust, now transferred to the new Archaeological Museum of Drama, is of a bearded god, proba- bly created in the early Antonine period. The traditions it fol- lowed and its affinities with other works are discussed. (AAA 23-28, 143-50) Dikili Tash. R Treuil (French School) reports on the 1999 study season: 'L.

We continued the data processing and graphic documenta- tion, but not the exploitation of the plans nor the detailed strati- graphic study, work that cannot be resumed until the digitalisa- tion of the excavation photos has progressed. We continued the establishment of a dating series, with a view to reducing, by sta- tistical means, the inevitable margins of error. In this way the site has given us, thus far, for the N period, 31 dates in all, which allows us to locate, with a high degree of probability-because the convergence of the two methods used (C14 and TL) is excellent in this case-the levels of about 5000 BC studied by the French team. The TL programme undertaken by CRIAA of Bordeaux, in which physicists and archaeologists collaborated closely, was brought to its conclusion. The samples of bones exported the previous year having revealed a sufficient content of collagen, we now envisage undertaking a new, more precise dating series by C14. The possibility of measuring rema- nent magnetism will also be examined. The study of the cut lithic material made a veritable leap for- ward this year. The description and characterization of the 1300 pieces involved are now completed and nearly half of the 200 tools have been drawn. We foresee finishing this task next sea- son. The identification of the raw materials has been the object of a preliminary study, so that we could put source research into our next campaign. As regards polished tools, only a limited number of descriptions, tests and identifications of the raw materials has been carried out. Several terracotta tools ('pin- taderas') have finally been studied. Besides the BCH article on the bucranium, architectural study has mainly consisted, this year, of a series of experiments based, of course, on observations made in the excavation: the construction of hearths, experiments on the polishing of poles, the construction of walls according to several variations of tech- niques in mud-brick (Fig. 124); the fabrication of rope from bark; and experiments in the use of vegetable detergents. Research into this area carries on this autumn with the con- struction of a roof. The experiments into cooking (Fig. 125) gave us details on the functioning and ageing of domestic ovens. The measuring of temperatures which is still needed is planned for the next campaign, as well as the mills with veg- etable impressions. A dozen pots have been reconstructed from sherds found last year in sector VE. We continued searching for new joins in the remaining zones of same sector: the sparse results produced by this work provide important topographical and stratigraphic evidence, which remains to be interpreted. The next campaign must therefore include the systematic checking of the main observations already made on sector V. The petrographic study already undertaken will be extended to the neighbouring site of Sitagroi and a research programme into food caramels and fatty acids is in gestation. A programme of chemical and petrograph- ic analyses of the black-on-red pottery, characteristic of the final phase of the LN, was submitted to the French School and accepted. The last results of analyses on the identification of the raw material of a series of beads was provided by the CRIAA of Bordeaux: they show that the material could vary, from marble to shell to bone, in the same necklace, and that in fact the essen- tial criterion was its appearance, not its nature. The fragments of stone vases, all the jewellery and several figurines and minia- ture models were drawn. The study of animal and vegetable remains is nearly com- plete with the exception of shellfish. The results already obtained in most fields (geomorphology, chronology, stratigraphy, architecture, tools, pottery, jewellery, flora and fauna) bring much nearer a publication of the results of the 1986-1995 excavations. At the same time they open the way to new research which could develop in parallel and even- tually form part of a new cycle of fieldwork.' Anc. Gazoros (ca 20km ESE of Serres). This anc. settlement is located on Agios Athanasios hill, about 3km W of Nea Zichne. Its cemetery is ca 800m farther W, between the villages of Agios Christophoros and mod. Gazoros. Part of the cemetery excavated in 1982 yielded mainly 4th-Ct BC tombs. K. Paschos, the owner of Agios Christophoros agricultural holding No. 1832, some distance SE of this, struck tombs when deep ploughing, and informed the Archaeological Service. B. Poulios reports on the ensuing rescue excavation in rain and snow in the bitter midwinter of 1994-95, when 20 tombs were discovered, dating from the early 5th to mid-4th Cts BC. All contained inhumations and there was no evidence of cre- mation. Eleven were stone-built cists, three were simple burials laid out on the earth and covered with stone slabs, and six were pot burials in jars of various types, which were set upright. All the tombs save one were unrobbed, but the simple burials and the pot burials, which had contained infants or children, had no grave goods, as was also the case with one child in a cist (infant mortality was high, comprising 62% of the total). The nine other cists contained ten burials, eight adults and three more children-in one case an adult cist had been re-used for a child's burial. Grave goods in these were rich and imported, a symptom of how far inland Greek trade had penetrated amongst Thracian tribes at this comparatively early period. Amongst them were a granulated gold pendant (Fig. 126); ear-rings of gold, and of combined silver and bronze; a bronze ring with Pan on the bezel (Fig. 127) and other signet rings of bronze and silver; bronze fibulae and bracelets; coins; and imported pottery, including bf, rf and Attic bg lekythoi, and a Cor exaleiptro (Fig. 128).

In 1994 work continued in the SE of the interior of this possibly religious building founded in the late 4th-early 3rd Cts BC. At 126.

Gazoros, Corinthian exaleiptro rescue excavation here in 1994 uncovered two LR tombs, one an undisturbed tile grave, the other destroyed. Neither had grave goods. In a lower stratum remains of an EIA settlement were found. (ADelt 597-8) Orphani, anc. Phagres. Further details of the C cremation cemetery (AR 1997-98, 90) are reported. The dead were cre- mated on the spot, either in rectangular pits (Fig. 130) or else on the ground surface, in which case the remains were heaped up and surrounded by stones. The rich grave goods included pottery, notably rf kraters, unfortunately badly fire-damaged, figurines (Fig. 131), weapons and gold and silver jewellery. A continuation of local tradition was represented by a large cook- ing-pot type of vessel with raised handles, which was present in almost every pyre, and some of the jewellery, which was still of IA type. (ADelt 587) Promachonas-Topolnica. The background to this joint Greek- Bulgarian PR project was given in AR 1997-98, 91-2, and the 1993 season on the Greek side of the border described in AR 1996-97, 83. In 1994, two additional trenches were opened immediately N of the original four, and for the first time on either side of the border, floors of the latest (Chalcolithic) phase 130. Orphani, cremation pit I were found; usually they were ploughed away. In one of the 1993 trenches, continued in 1994, a typical phase II wall was discovered, which had been of posts filled in with wattle and daub; other remains of floors with hearths probably also belonged to this phase. The earliest (phase III) horizon was reached, but its excavation was not completed. A destruction level with pots in it promised well for the ensuing season. Two tests were also made on the W hill, which proved that both MN and LN habitation had extended there. (Fig. 132 shows a paint- ed pot fragment from phase III, and Fig. 133 figurines from phases II-III.) (ADelt 610-12) In 1995 three new trenches were opened next to those of the previous season, with the object of examining the upper (phase I) stratum over a wider area. No architectural remains were found, but at about 0.30m below the surface in all three trench- es, there were groups of stones, pottery and other objects lying at all different angles in unusually hard clay. In some cases the upper surface of phase I was marked by sherds of large vessels lying flat. Excavation was continued to stereo in two of the pre- vious year's trenches; in each case there were pits cut into it. Pottery and finds were similar to those of pre- vious seasons. A programme of geophysical testing was carried out by a Bulgarian team. The results were verified by excavation in two places, and found to be an accurate indication of building remains, which could be very useful on a site where settlement was 129.

Valla in AEMTH 9, 435-40) In 1994 P. Giouni, Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki and P. Ploumis submitted some of the site's N pottery to technical tests. Ten sherds were selected for petrographic analysis by 134. Terpne, basilica thin-sectioning and microscopic examination. Those chosen were three with brown-on-red decoration (a variant of the Akropotamou type), one with 'bitumen' decoration, two incised, one with graphite decoration, one black-topped sherd and two undecorated fragments. The unexpected result showed that all had been made from the same raw material. At comparable N sites, similar tests have usually indicated a minimum of two dif- ferent sources, while six or seven was the norm. Testing the 'bitu- men'-decorated pottery by refiring at three different temperatures proved that the 'bitumen' was applied after firing and must have been some type of organic material. (AEMTH 8, 343-8) Terpne (2km NW of Nigrita). Palaikastro Hill, 17.5 stremma- ta in extent, in the locality of Agios Mandelios, was completely fenced in 1994 as a protection against antiquities thieves, and its more vulnerable remains were roofed. In 1981 one of its many owners illegally levelled a very large area, destroying antiqui- ties. In 1985 a test was excavated in the centre of the hill to assess the extent of the damage (AR 1992-93, 61) and R walls, intact pithoi, millstones, hearths and a water system were dis- covered. This test was extended in 1993 when the site became available for systematic excavation after the resolution of com- plex land-ownership problems, and further discoveries were part of a paved courtyard and a R double wine press. The latter con- sisted of two water-proofed tanks for treading the grapes with large pithoi, still intact, set below them to collect the must. In this area successive occupation levels went back to the 4th Ct BC. A remarkable discovery was made in the illegally-levelled area towards the edge of the hill. The complete plan of a mon- umental building, ca 600m2 in extent, lay beneath a destruction level (Fig. 134). It was a civil basilica of the late 2nd-early 3rd Cts, a type rare in Gr lands but common in R forums, where it acted as a legal and commercial centre. The building can be linked to an inscription in Serres Archaeological Museum, which records that the polis, with a subscription from a certain Julia from the legacy of her husband Philip, erected the basilica under the supervision of P. Aelius Clarinus Alexandros. Connected with one comer of the basilica was a major R bath building. This had had double colonnades, of which the bases remained, while monolithic columns in two sizes and Ionian and Corinthian capitals were strewn about. It had had marble floors and fragments of marble cladding and frescoes had fallen from the walls. The city wall was traced for over 150m. From this area came a fine 2nd-Ct male portrait head (Fig. 135) and an inscription concerned with the market control of gold, the source of the</page><page sequence="98">100 DAVID BLACKMAN 136. Thasos, carved pillar 135. Terpne, portrait head city's wealth, collected in a neighbouring stream. Areas of heaped-up river pebbles such as result from panning for alluvial gold are still to be seen along stretches of the river bank, and even today IGME has a gold production unit in the district. Finds from the site generally included abundant pottery of the 6th Ct BC-4th Ct AD, and coins from the 4th-1st Cts BC and the 2nd-4th Cts AD. A settlement of such importance, which sur- vived for so long a period despite many destructions, is likely to be mentioned in anc. sources on Bisaltia, and it may be anc. Berge, known to be near Nigrita. (ADelt 607-10) Thasos. Announcement was made of the completion of the Archaeological Map of Thasos by the 12th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities and the French School. The aim of map and site surveys was to trace the inhabitation of the island from ECh to LByz times. New sites were identified from the EByz and LByz period, many of the latter associated with Athonite documents dealing with monastic estates in the region. ECh basilicas were located in the island's interior, indicating that LR settlement was not confined to the coast. (ADelt 637) Anc. city. Further information is given regarding the Tsoupras plot, 25m E of the Arch of Caracalla, where part of a large LC/HL building was discovered (AR 1996-97, 84). This proved to be built on the S side of the main road which ran from the cemetery and the gate of Zeus and Hera in the W, to the anc. agora. Part of the road's surface, paved with marble slabs 1.50 x 0.80m, was discovered in the N of the plot. Here, before the entrance to the building, was a small square pillar, in situ, with a relief of Pan, holding a goat by the horns in his right hand and a club(?) in his left (Fig. 136). Also found was part of a Doric cornice, suggesting that the entrance to the building had a mon- umental propylon with two columns. There was some LR and ECh rebuilding in the entrance area. Finds from the plot includ- ed marble sculpture fragments, very fine A sherds both from Thasos and imported from Rhodes, Chios, Athens, etc., an almost complete LC rf column krater, 'Megarian' bowl frag- ments, bg sherds and domestic pottery. Parts of bronze vessels, three bronze rings (including one with two Nikes on the bezel), a bronze fibula, three iron keys and 350 coins were also found. Of the latter, 140 were Thasian (4th- st Cts BC), 15 from other cities (Byzantium, Ainos, Amphipolis, Chalcis) and 13 were Byz (to the reign of the emperor Anastasios). (ADelt 587-9) Excavation continued in the Divanakes plot (AR 1997-98, 93), confirming the late 2nd/early 1 t-Ct BC date of the house and road previously discovered. Elsewhere in the plot, a LR paved area and a well were dated by a coin of Caracalla. The remains in this site connect with those in adjacent plots in the Silenus Gate area, and like these it is to be expropriated. (ADelt 589) Odeion. In an persuasive new study of this monument, J.-Y. Marc discusses its architecture, including the possibility of an upper tier of seats, its purpose and its date. He gives reasons for supporting its identification as an odeion, rather than a bouleu- terion, which has been suggested, and prefers a construction date at the end of the Antonine or beginning of the Severan peri- od to the received Hadrianic date. (AEMTH 8, 327-333) Theatre. The series of tests prior to the restoration of the anc. theatre continued in 1994. Tests above the cavea uncovered a rectangular bastion in the city wall (here adjacent to the the- atre). It had no stone-built staircase, but a wooden construction may have existed. Tests carried to bedrock at this point showed that it had been cut to receive the foundations of the city wall at the end of the 6th Ct BC or the beginning of the following cen- tury. In one small area a level of black earth containing pottery of the late 7th-late 6th Cts BC overlay the bedrock. Associated structures were a well-built stone drain and a series of three post-holes in a line. One of the latter had been cut by the foun- dation trench for the city wall, thus providing a terminus ante quem for the latter's construction. The wall may have been finally destroyed during the invasion of the Vandals in 467-8, if not earlier. An ECh cemetery was established immediately out- side the theatre cavea, and its cist tombs incorporated both mar- ble blocks, probably from the city wall, and anc. building remains including seats from the theatre. Other tests took place in both parodoi, in the proskenion and the skene. These were briefly covered in AR 1997-98, 93, based on the report in AEMTH 10. Remains preceding the theatre were discovered in</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 101 138. Thasos, rampart, exterior two places: in the NE parodos, small walls built directly on bedrock (which rises high here) were associated with early Thasian pottery of the type known from the study of P. Bernard in BCH 88 (1964) 77-146 and at the back of the skene were found similar walls of small stones, built on bedrock, and a modest number of sherds closely resembling EA Thasian pot- tery. (ADelt 589-94) A number of preparatory studies, many using the latest equipment, were also undertaken in preparation for the restora- tion of the theatre. Work was begun on the skene building, the back wall of which, standing up to 8m high in places, required special solutions.(ADelt 596) Artemision. Cl. Pretre carried out a study season on the small votive finds from the excavations of the Artemision since the 1960s. These were recorded, described, measured and, in the case of the most important pieces, photographed. A com- parative study was carried out in Oxford and an article is now in preparation and will be submitted to the EFA in 2000. Y. Grandjean and Fr. Salviat (French School) report on work on the rampart in 1999: 'In collaboration with H. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki, we conduct- ed an excavation on the site of the former Chryssaphis house. The main objective was to establish the position of the diate- ichisma, which in the Greek period separated the town from the closed port. It was possible to unearth the preserved crest of the rampart over some 15m (Fig. 137), an appreciable topographi- cal success since until now we did not know the exact position and orientation of the rampart to the S of the closed port. In addition, several trenches dug to either side of the wall revealed the two faces, exterior and interior, down to the foundation; the technique used on the two faces is very different: heavy, mas- sive courses on the exterior (Fig. 138) contrasting with lighter, finer courses on the interior (Fig. 139). The rampart was built at the beginning of the 6th Ct BC; at the end of the 4th Ct BC buildings were constructed against the interior face. In the Med era the N wall of the Genoese fortress followed the anc. layout, using as its foundation the courses still in place at that time. A further result of this excavation concerns the change in sea level since antiquity. It is certain that in the ECh era the sea was 137. Thasos, rampart</page><page sequence="100">102 DAVID BLACKMAN 142. 140-42. Thasos, rampart 141. 50cm or so lower than at present, i.e. it then reached the ancient rampart. At the beginning of the 5th Ct BC the external face of the rampart, whose foot is at -0.80m, was constructed on the sand, at the edge of the sea, at a place where the waves could reach it at high tides; sea level must then have been at a bench mark of about -1.20/-1.50m, taking into consideration the vari- ation in sea level in the course of one year (in September 1999 the sea level underwent fairly major variations of the order of about 50cm).' SE approaches to the theatre. The French School under Didier Viviers carried out excavations on features earlier than the C rampart: a massive block of masonry, a wall and a drain. He extended the area excavated to the W to identify the nature of son agex these A features (Figs. 140-1). 'The massive block of masonry (2.90m wide), perpendicular to the C rampart, returned in the direc- tion of the acropolis. It had three faces and its foun- dation consisted of unbonded blocks on which the C curtain wall partially rested. There was an identical foundation to the W, beyond a gap which must be interpreted as a gate cut into what must have been the A rampart of Thasos and should be dated to the sec- ond half of the 6th Ct BC. The gate was probably &lt; destroyed when Darius I passed in 491 BC. dageXXI The wall foundation (lm wide) in front of the A rampart to the N and also perpendicular to the C rampart, was entirely unearthed. Its height was still 143. Thas partially intact at the time of the construction of the C rampart since the blocks in the SW comer of the interior of the C cur- tain had surfaces designed to bond with the A wall at a right angle to it. This wall was also proved to be later than the mas- sive A block since an embankment covering a hearth partially destroyed during the construction of the outer wall (Fig. 142) contained a Thasian silver coin representing Silenus on his knees (without the Nymphs) dating to the end of the 6th Ct BC. This gives a terminus post quem for the construction of the outer wall probably in the 1St decade of the 5th Ct BC (cf. the account in Hdt VI 46). The path of the drain was traced upwards to the W and was probably contemporary with the construction of the A gate. The excavation also revealed the continuation of the analemma wall of the theatre. At the top of the koilon the foundation of a basin (2m x 3m, lined with waterproof cement) was found; it is thought to be associated with a later rural use of the area. Extension of the excavation increased our knowledge of the ECh necropolis, which covered the site. As with burials found previously the skeletons were in poor condition and without grave goods.' NE edge of the agora. The French School team led by F. Blonde, A. Muller and D. Mulliez carried out in 1999 excava- tions at specific points in the vicinity of the Passage of the Theoroi in order to clarify questions arising out of the cam- paigns of 1979-94. They report: ,Z;41 34 35 36 37 38, 3 sos, NE edge of the agora, site 140.</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 103 144. Thasos, trench XXVI 146. Thasos, agora, trench XXVI 145. Thasos, agora, trench XXVI 'The campaigns of 1992-1994 in the Passage of the Theoroi and its immediate vicinity enabled us to reconstruct a succes- sion of phases preceding the passage itself: (a) to the earliest (first half of 6th Ct?) belongs the corer of an important terrace; (b) in the later phases a significant wall (M4) was built, whose successive arrangements were: the opening up of a passage whose position and orientation remained the same up to the end of antiquity, and, against the outside of the wall, the construc- tion of a glacis covered with slabs of gneiss (called in future 'paved slope'); (c) then in the second half of the 6th Ct the rapid rise of the level of the soil covered a large part of the glacis and was accompanied by different arrangements against each of the walls of the Passage (M9 on W side, M15 then M13 on E side); (d) finally, in the first quarter of the 5th Ct, the rectangular and round wells were built as well as the Passage of the Theoroi. Supplementary sondages (1999) (Fig. 143): trench XXVI, placed against the N end of wall AB of the Passage of the Theoroi, revealed a wedge-shaped marble slab A, with a large pivot-hole (Fig. 144) in a bayonet-shaped recess of wall M9 (Fig. 145) at the same level as a similar slab, B, found in 1994 in wall 13 and thought to be a reused block. It can now be seen that these slabs belonged to a monumental double gate 3.20m wide. Another slab, C, with an identical pivot-hole was found under the slab A, (Fig. 146) and belonged with wall 9 and its 'bayonet' to an earlier gateway, built after the removal of a yet earlier wall M17, on the same alignment as wall M14. Wall M10, which lies up against wall M9, stops at the level of the recess (i.e. outside the gate). In its lowest foundation course, a fourth slab with pivot-hole was found, and might well be the pair of the earlier slab (C) reused in this later wall. Trench XXVII showed the continuity between the rounded end of the 'paved slope' and the curve of wall M 14, achieved by the skilled arrangement of the courses of the wall (Fig. 147). Trench XXVIII, placed in the S angle formed by the late stair- way and wall CD of the Passage, revealed that beneath wall M13 a symmetrical arrangement existed on the S as well as on the N side of the Passage. Wall 16, in the same stratigraphical position as wall 14, began to curve in the same way (Fig. 148), showing that the earlier gateway opened outwards like a funnel. The extension of trench XXIV was designed to produce a sec- tion between walls F and G. This section produced a complex stratigraphy and evidence of metallurgical activity in the 6th Ct.</page><page sequence="102">104 DAVID BLACKMAN 147. Thasos, agora, trench XXVII 148. Thasos, agora, trench XXVIII 149. Thasos, agora, trench XXIX It revealed that wall 9 in its earliest phase was contemporary with wall CD of the Passage. Trench XXIX, opened at the E end of the NE stoa of the agora, between the mnema of Glaukos and the 'paved slope', confirmed, as previously thought, that the mnema was not in its original position, but had been reconstructed here in the last quarter of the 6th Ct at the earliest. In the upper levels of the trench complete skeletons of three animals (one bovid and two sheep) were found, and a few fragments of pig. Two of these were cut at a lumbar level, the bones of each half remaining joined (Fig. 149). The fill that covered these bones contained ceramic material of the 4th Ct. As a result of this campaign it was concluded that wall M4 (reinforced by the 'paved slope') and wall F were two segments of the first city wall of Thasos whose dating during the first half of the 6th Ct cannot yet be precisely fixed. The architectural remains under the Passage of the Theoroi are those of a gateway in this city wall which must have been raised several times as the result of natural or artificial make-up. Geomorphological analyses undertaken by G. Sintis corroborate these findings. After the construction of the new city rampart at the end of the 6th Ct or beginning of the 5th Ct, this gateway was inside the city wall perimeter and became a passage through from the 'old city' to the 'new city' where the classical agora was situated. The Passage of the Theoroi was thus the final monumental form of an early gate. In addition to the excavations, the French School carried out restoration work. It completed the modem wall built in the 'Square of the Theoroi' at the level of the peribolos wall of the Artemision in 1994 by plastering it and banking it up the terrace thus created with marble chips. This now marks out the higher level of this terrace from the lower level related to the round well and the rectangular building. Repairs were carried out in the Street of the Theatre.' Thasos Island. Fari. F. Blonde, J.-Y. Perrault and K. Peristeri (French School) completed in 1999 the study of the material, the architecture and the stratigraphy of the pottery workshop. They are now editing the text which they hope to submit in the winter of 2000. Limenaria. An account of this PR site, first settled towards the end of MN, which appears in ADelt 594-5, was covered in AR 1996-97, 85-6, based on the report in AEMTH 7. One of the long retaining walls which held up banks of red clay to provide level building surfaces appears in Fig. 150, typical pottery in Figs. 151-2, and the unusual zoomorphic pendant from the site is seen in Fig. 153. Treis Gremoi. S. Papadopoulos and M. Sgourou report on an unusual excavation in the mountains ca 5km SW of the island's capital, Limena. It is persuasively interpreted as a sum- mer shieling connected with herding activities, first used in the 4th-3rd Cts BC, with some indications of continuation or later re-occupation. The central feature is a hut, built of unworked limestones (the local bedrock) in a workmanlike dry-stone technique. Many slates of gneiss and tile fragments within it represent its fallen roof. It is oriented N-S, has an internal width of 3m and</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 105 a preserved length of 3.50m, having had its S end destroyed by a forestry road. It may have had a second room to the S, but this is uncertain. Three rough steps on its W side lead down to an extensive courtyard paved with unworked stone, and contained on its W side by a N-S boundary wall. To the E of the hut is the base of a circular, stone-built oven, with walls of unworked limestone and a floor of gneiss slates, which would probably have had a domed roof. Fragments of anc. clay baking pans were found near it. E of the oven, running NW-SE, is another dry-stone wall, possibly an internal division or another part of the compound's boundary. The paved courtyard was apparently used for food preparation, as quantities of sherds from cooking pots, shallow casseroles (chytrai, lopades), mortars and braziers attest. Also found here were a great number of fragments from basins and amphorae, as well as some table wares such as kan- tharoi, ladles (kyathia) and oinochoai, but virtually all the pot- tery was plain. Within the hut were found two Thasian coins with the head of Herakles on the obverse and his weapons on the reverse, a type in circulation 360-315 BC. Two stamped amphora handles belong to the early and the later 3rd Ct BC. Most sherds here were from unpainted domestic pottery which was not closely datable, but some were of 4th-Ct BC types. Also recovered were LR and ECh sherds, while the latest find was a bronze coin of the family of Constantine the Great. Unusual objects within the hut were an octagonal bronze signet ring on which was engraved a goddess with a spear in her left hand and a hor of plenty (?) in her right, and a small lead phial of a type usually found in HL contexts, used to contain pharmaceutical sub- stances. The name Dionysos engraved on it may have been that of the dispenser, as a guarantee of the contents' purity. A bicon- ical clay spindle-whorl found E of the oven may be an indica- tion that the herdsman's wife and family accompanied him to his summer quarters. Animal bones from the site were not numerous, but were predominantly sheep/goat. (AEMTH 9, 423-33) Two Byz or Post-Byz chapels investigated at Koinyra were found to include much ECh spolia, probably from a basilica in the vicinity, although the existence of such a monument has yet to be proved.

Room D of the excavations appears to have been inhabited in the MByz period, on the basis of a coin find (Follis Type A, 976-1030/5) in the foundation hole of the N wall. (ADelt 630-2) Rescue excavations at Limenas were undertaken in the Vellios plot within the fortification walls. Parts of an ECh basil- ica and an earlier LR bath-house were found, the latter under a destruction layer left by fire. However, both buildings appear to have operated concurrently at least for a short period. The S wall of the basilica meets the N wall of the bath-house. Inhabitation from 3rd to the 6th Cts AD is attested (coins, pot- tery, glass, etc.). The nave of the basilica measures 4.70 x 3.60m. A small MByz chapel was later built between the stylo- bate of the ruined basilica, one of the very few monuments from this period to have been located by archaeologists on the island. (ADelt 628-30) THRACE Abdera. In 1993 the new museum building here was complet- ed; in 1994 shelves were set up in the largest store room, and the drawing office, photographic archive and archaeologists' office were furnished. Finds were transferred from the muse- ums of Kavala and Komotini, the store at Xanthi and the Archaeological Collection of Abdera. (ADelt 615) Cemeteries. During the 1993-95 redistribution of agricul- tural holdings of the village of Velone, covering the NE part of the 6th-3rd Ct BC tumulus cemetery of anc. Abdera, new roads were cut and old boundary banks ploughed away. As a result 29 previously-unknown tombs were located, of which 17 were intact and the rest robbed or destroyed previously. D. Kallintzi publishes an account of three of the most interesting tombs: (1) In the Xerovryse (Kourou Tsesme) locality, a pit grave containing a cremation burial was discovered. The pit, which had been covered with stone slabs, contained the bones of a woman of 28-35 years, cremated in the second half of the 4th Ct BC. She had been laid on a wooden bier, of which the decora- tive bone insets survived. The cremation layer also yielded bronze, clay and bone fragments of a gilded wreath, a pair of gold earrings ending in lions' heads, a gold necklace, a gold ring still on a finger bone, a bronze mirror, a bone pin, an Ionic clay kylix, a small clay amphora and a gold coin of Philip II. (2) In the same locality a massive oval pithos (internal dimensions 1.95 x 1.85m; thickness of walls 4.5cm), laid on its side, contained the skeleton of a male 38-45 years old. Also within it, on the same level as the skeleton, were a bg skyphos, a kanastron, a small bowl, two squat lekythoi, a bronze strigil, and an iron stud. Below the skull in the area of the jaw was a silver obol of Abdera dating to the end of the 6th-beginning of the 5th Cts BC. Higher in the earth which filled the pithos were sherds of a bg kantharos and another bg skyphos, part of a plate rim, sherds of a plain vessel, and the base of a pot with a hole for libations. These were probably remains of a funerary cere- mony which took place just outside the pithos, and were pushed into its mouth afterwards. The burial took place in the 4th Ct BC, and the silver obol must have been an heirloom. (3) In the Palaiochora locality, a cist grave of dressed stone slabs, lined with white plaster painted with coloured bands, contained the burial of a woman of 48-50 years. Grave goods included a folding bronze mirror, three bronze links, a lead pyxis with a lid, a long iron rod, two clay beads, an iron knife, a clay ampulla, a clay lebes, a gold ring with a precious stone on the left hand, golden earrings ending in Erotes, and six small winged figurines, wearing himatia and with their hair dressed in the 'melon' style, ending in a top-knot. They had a pierced attachment for suspension on the back. Outside the tomb, near its NE corer, a group of smashed 4th-Ct BC plates was pre- sumably a funerary offering. The burial itself is dated to ca 300 BC. The bones in the three tombs were identified by A. Angelarakes. (AEMTH 9, 447-61) Three other tombs required rescue excavation in 1994. A cist of dressed stone slabs in E. Raxiones' field in the Xerovryse (Kourou Tsesme) locality, contained a poorly-preserved skele- ton and an iron strigil. Another similar cist in I. Voyatzis' field at Paliambelos (Eski Bag) had sherds from plain pottery and lead fittings from a wooden chest in its disturbed fill, and a plain kylix just outside it. The base of a previously-destroyed stone sarcophagos in E. Deliakes' field at Lophos ton Koritsion (Kizlar Tepe) was attacked again by antiquities thieves who mistook it for the cover of another tomb. N peribolos. In the NE comer of K. Karkatzanes' field ploughing uncovered an unbroken pointed-base amphora, and the rescue excavation which followed located three more, part of a group set upside down in parallel rows, which continued beyond the excavation's limits. A few plain sherds and a bronze arrow head were the only other finds. (ADelt 615-7) Investigations of the extant Byz walls of the peribolos indi- cated that these were built mostly directly on top of the anc. walls. Traces of towers were identified. A lead seal was found near the 'episcopal' church. It bears a depiction of the Virgin on one side and on the other the inscription: AoVKatvav Eiprivriv eEOTOKE TTapOEVE OKETlOIS. An intact pair of LByz scissors was also recovered. (ADelt 633-5) Possible traces of an EByz and MByz settlement / fishing village were located at the Ai-Nikolas site near the Mandra set- tlement, on the inland lake Vistonia. The adjoining area, a region known as Lafra or Lafrouda, was owned by the Vatopedi monastery on Mt Athos until 1923. (ADelt 637-8) Chr. Samiou and N. Lianos (Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities) continued their underwater investigation of the anc. harbours in 1994, finding an E/W breakwater ca 170m long in the mod. fishing harbour; two semicircular towers, apparently of an earlier phase; and two oblique legs of Byz date. (ADelt 855) Alexandroupolis. During the excavation of a large ditch for a new drainage system, R tombs were found in Dikasteriou and Eirenes Streets, which are parallel to the present shore and the 2nd and 3rd streets back from it. In Dikasteriou St were two tile graves, covering a child and an adult, without grave goods. In Eirenes St was a brick-built cist tomb with a tiled floor and a flat stone cover (partly destroyed). The lower part of an adult skeleton was still present, plus an undamaged R clay unguen- tarium, a broken one of glass, and a few sherds from another poorly-preserved small clay pot. The tombs form part of the organized R cemetery, situated in the shore zone of anc. Sane. (ADelt 619-20) NW of Alexandroupolis, and W of Army barracks 536, in the field of P. Tsorbatzides and Ch. Karaphillides, the plough laid bare a LR cist tomb covered with three limestone slabs. The tomb was built of unworked stones and very hard mortar, plastered on the interior. It contained an undisturbed but badly-preserved skeleton with a large intact clay oinochoe by its feet. (ADelt 620) Ambelakia (12km WSW of Orestiada). Continual mechanical cultivation in the field of S. Gavrikoudes, and determined attempts by the owner to level a tumulus in it, made the exca-</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 107 vation of the latter imperative. D. Triandafyllos A. reports that the tumulus, which was 2km NW of the village, had a diameter of ca 50m and a maximum height of 5.47m. In its S and W parts, usually at ground level, but sometimes in the lower tumulus fill, there were no fewer than 23 areas of sacrifice and offerings to the dead, with a few intact pots and sherds from many others dating to the R Imperial period, plus remains of pyres and animal bones. One such i area retained the imprint of a wooden stretcher, which had been used to carry half a pithos and many l i sherds from plates, plus ash, charcoal and animal bones to the spot. In some areas bg and rf sherds and fragments of amphoras dating to the 4th Ct BC were found; these must have been connected with a previ- ous tumulus, destroyed to make way for the later c one. A skeleton found buried in a contracted posi- tion, without grave goods, probably represented an even earlier (BA?) grave. The chief burial place of the tumulus was a ih trough-shaped pit, 2.33 x 1.87m at the top, with slop- 154. Amb ing slides with a step or ledge somewhat below the rim of the pit (Fig. 154). The cremation had taken place else- where, but its remains-bone fragments, charcoal and ash, and pieces of burnt walnuts, apparently a local custom-were placed together with some grave goods in the bottom of the pit. They were then covered with earth to the level of the internal ledge. At this higher level there were remains of more burning, funeral offerings and animal bones, and also the impressions left by a rectangular wooden stretcher with cross-struts, plus the iron nails from it. The walls of the pit above the ledge were carefully lined with red clayey earth. The objects accompanying the dead man were fragments of glass vessels, iron blades, remains of footwear, a bronze oinochoe with a sculptured Silenus head with inset silver eyes at the base of its handle, another trefoil-lipped oinochoe with an iron handle, two clay jars, and lastly the iron framework of a folding stool (Fig. 155). The latter is a find unique in Greece, though such furniture is known from Bulgarian tumuli. The outer ends of the upper hor- izontal struts are decorated with bronze lions' heads, while the pivots which join the crossing of the legs have bronze heads of Medusa. After this had been laid in place, the rest of the pit was filled to the rim with dark brown earth and the construction of the tumulus began. The tumulus is not closely datable, but was probably raised in the late 1St-early 2nd Ct AD. A preliminary examination of the cremated bones by A. Angelarakes suggest- ed they were those of a man 35-45 years old. (AEMTH 8, 349- 354; ADelt 620-1) Makre (llkm W of Alexandroupolis, on the coast) (AR 1996- 97, 89; 1997-98, 97, 1998-99, 95). Until 1995, the N results in sector B had all been obtained from the summit of the mound. In that year three adjoining trenches were laid out on the NE edge of the toumba. Below recent and IA disturbances, impres- sive N remains were again found. Well-preserved successive floors belonging to buildings with walls of thickly-set posts, had hearths, pits and other installations. A characteristic exam- ple was a circular construction represented by post-holes, with- in a large rectangular building with walls that were also demar- cated by post-holes. In a shallow hollow beside a floor was found a fragment of a child's skull, the fourth N burial to be found at the site. A number of expert studies on many aspects of the site continued. An experiment in the production of N pot- tery, including the collection and working of the clay, the con- )elaKia, pit grave 155. Ambelakia, folding stool struction of the kiln, the making and decoration of the pots (using N tools) and their firing, was of particular interest. (N. Evstratiou, D. Ourem-Kotsos and D. Kallintze in AEMTH 9, 463-71) Maroneia (AR 1996-97, 89; 1997-98, 98; 1998-99, 95). In the Kambana locality some cleaning and restoration took place in 1994, in the anc. theatre. A small test was opened in the area of the E parodos, where one of marble seats from the proedria had previously been found. Three seats of local limestone and another seat of local coarse-grained white marble from the proedria were recovered. The limestone seats, which probably came from the ninth row, bore engraved R letters and joining</page><page sequence="106">108 DAVID BLACKMAN marks. The marble seat was in two pieces which were joined by an iron clamp at the back. During cleaning and repairs to the modem drain S of the E parodos, part of a stone-built wall run- ning NW-SE was found. At its N end was a later simple burial of an adult, lying E-W. ECh graves without grave goods had previously been discovered S of the skene and the E parodos. In the field of V. Stogiannidou in the same locality, a small test was made where ploughing had turned up a rectangular lime- stone block. Three LR tombs without grave goods were found. One was a cist grave made of re-used blocks set on end, and the other two were tile graves. The wider area here, within the C city wall but outside the E leg of the Byz fortifications, was used as a cemetery during the LR and ECh periods. (ADelt 618-9) Ch. Karadema gives the results of a test in 1995, 450m SW of the theatre, in an area notable for abundant surface sherds, and in the approximate centre of the anc. city. The shallow nature of the deposit, the sloping land and constant ploughing made building remains unlikely, but one LHL wall was found. It ran NW-SE, which agrees with the orientation of the site's other excavated buildings. The area yielded much HL pottery. Amongst plain domestic wares, amphoras were predominant and more than 500 stamped amphora handles were found, the majority from Thasos, but also from Abdera, Ainos, Akanthos, Knidos, Kos, Oisyme, Ouranopolis, Paros, Rhodes and Samothrace. Also present were sherds ofbg pots (chiefly 'West Slope' kantharoi, bowls, plates, etc.) and lamps of local and Attic origin, dated to the last quarter of the 4th and the 3rd Cts BC. Sherds from an unusual light-ground krater had roughly- drawn figures of satyrs and maenads. Roof-tiles, terracotta fig- urines and 200 bronze coins, dating from the last quarter of the 4th till the end of the 3rd Ct BC were also found. The area was later used as an EByz cemetery, and a three-aisled basilica was founded on the stratum of HL pottery. A very well-preserved inscription, attesting the worship of Isis and Serapis at Maroneia and probably dating to the 1st Ct BC, was turned up during ploughing in the Parathyra locality. (AEMTH 9, 487-8) Mesembria-anc.Zone. An overview of the results from this site was given in AR 1997-98, 98, based on the report in AEMTH 10. P. Tsatsopoulou gives the results of excavations in two areas in 1995. A test in the area adjacent to the buildings with rows of amphoras set upside-down (see AR 1996-97, 89-90) was disap- pointing, as the area had been destroyed, probably by Bulgarian fortification works in World War I, and was virtually devoid of buildings; a high concentration of 6th-4th Ct BC sherds was however noted. Further S were better-preserved areas, probably once roofed, containing pottery and other evidence for daily life. Excavation in the W of the city followed the line of a road with- in and parallel to the fortification wall. Buildings in the 7-9m strip between the road and the wall were examined, and a com- plete house could be identified beside a small tower or bastion. The further (E) side of the road was joined at right angles by two other roads, thus forming the W edge of three city blocks, not fully excavated. These produced only modest quantities of pot- tery, mainly plain domestic, with occasional bg, rf and Thracian sherds, mostly of the 4th Ct BC, but ca 100 coins (chiefly of Zone, Maroneia, Philip and Alexander) and examples of metal- work: spear-heads, bronze arrows, parts of a bronze sieve, bronze earrings and fibulae, and bronze spatulas. An important find, dis- covered down a well, was part of a small marble base of the 4th Ct BC dedicated to Aphrodite. (AEMTH 9, 441-6) 156. Plotinopolis, head of Janus Patage (8km WSW of Orestiada). D. Triandafyllos reports on the rescue excavation of a tumulus which was being rapidly ploughed away. It was in the field of G. Alexakoudes, 3km NW of the village. The lowest part of the tumulus was still visible and had a diameter of ca 25m, and a remaining height of 1.21m. Five rectangular blocks from a tomb were scattered about the field, and a recent illegal trench had located the tomb itself, which had, however, already been robbed in antiquity. It was a built cist with a base of rectangular slabs on which had been raised walls of rectangular blocks, once three courses high, which leaned slightly inward; it had been surrounded by a stone heap. One end of the tomb was approached by a curious, rough- ly-built curved dromos which may have been connected with funerary ceremonies. Most of the bones from the tomb had been thrown into it, and were identified by A. Angelarakes as those of a man 45-60 years old. In the tomb proper there remained only a few unpainted sherds and fragments of an iron object. On the basis of its form and building style, the tomb was probably erected in the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC. (AEMTH 8, 353-4, 357; ADelt 621) Papikion Oros. Excavations continued at the Byz monastery complex after a year's break. The buildings associated with the refectory and kitchen (cistern, oven, kneading block) were investigated. Part of the original refectory was found, much changed over time. This was a two-storey structure, with the bottom storey used for storage. Evidence indicates that the structure was expanded at one stage to accommodate a rise in the number of monks. Absence of finds from the refectory area, together with absence of elements of the superstructure in the</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 109 destruction level, suggests gradual abandonment prior to final destruction. Roofing material was removed prior to this stage. Pottery included almost all types of 13th- and 14th-Ct AD plain and glazed wares. The significant number of coins found at the mouth of the oven were mostly minted by the Kingdom of Thessalonike (13th Ct AD), suggesting that the oven at least was in operation during that period. Work continues on the remain- ing structures (cells, peribolos wall, etc.). (ADelt 635-7) Plotinopolis (immediately SE of Didymoteichon). The R mosa- ic with the Labours of Herakles was taken up, restored and reset in place. Outside the limits of the mosaic, 13 1 x im pits were dug to take pillars which would support a protective roof. In one of the pits was found a sculptured lion's foot, and in another a well-preserved head of Janus (Fig. 156). (ADelt 621) Regio (9km NE of Didymoteichon). D. Triandafyllos and D. Terzopoulou describe the rescue excavation of three tumuli near this village. Tumulus A, in A. Kolitsides' field, was about 700m from the village. It had a diameter of 20m and was 2.85m high. The tomb within it was rectangular, with walls consisting of two courses of thick dressed stone slabs, and a floor of the same. It had internal dimensions of 2.30 x 1.32m and was oriented E-W. The entrance of the tomb was at the narrow E end. It had a stone doorjamb on either side, carefully cut so that the door narrowed towards the top. The entrance had been closed by a wide stone slab, which had a projecting section which fitted exactly between the inward-slanting door jambs. This closing slab, and another which had chocked it in place, were found lying just outside the entrance. Also lying broken here was a large dressed stone with a triangular top. This had probably been set on top of the door jambs like a pediment. The roof had been of long, nar- row slabs-parts of two were found still in place. The tomb floor had been set in a shallow cutting in the stereo. Its walls were supported by a heap of stones and earth which rose to the level of the cover slabs. This stone heap had been left open at the E end, to form a small ante-chamber or dromos. The tomb had been robbed in antiquity, and the few remaining scraps of bone were undiagnostic. The only find was a group of six bronze arched fibulae discovered near it. Tumulus r was only a short distance from tumulus A, about 500m from the village, on public land on the S side of the road from Regio to Asemeni. It had a diameter of 33m and a height of 2.5m. A built tomb lay in the tumulus' SE quarter, near its edge. In construction it was very similar to that of the tomb in tumulus A. It was oriented SW-NE, with the entrance to the NE, marked by the same sloping door jambs. It was entered via a dromos 2.70m long, oriented SE-NW so that it joined the tomb at right-angles. Its NW part, which could apparently have been closed off, formed a kind of ante-chamber. The walls of both the tomb proper and the dromos/ante-chamber were supported by a stone heap up to cover-slab level. This tomb had also been repeatedly robbed. Bone fragments found both inside and outside it were identified by A. Angelarakes as those of an adult male or males. A fragment of bronze sheet bearing two opposed goats' heads which may have decorated the lower handle junction of a bronze vessel, eight bone buttons and various iron and bronze stalks were retrieved. Under a floor slab were scraps of gilded bronze leaves from a wreath. Elsewhere in the tumulus, four areas of offerings to the dead were identified-finds in them dated to the second and third quarters of the 4th Ct BC. A strange stone structure was uncov- ered beneath the centre of the tumulus. It consisted of four con- centric circles formed of single lines of unworked stones. The external circle was 9.5m in diameter and the internal one, 5m. No tomb was found within it. The circles had been covered by a grey soil different from the rest of the tumulus fill, 1.20m high, which was full of handmade PR pottery. It was presum- ably an earlier tumulus incorporated into the later one. In the W part of the main tumulus, high in its fill of red earth, was a skeleton of a horse with part of its iron bit still in its jaws. It is not certain that it was associated with the burial in the built tomb of the tumulus. Tumulus B, 1.5km from the village, and near the railway line, had been partly ploughed away by two land-owners, but may once have had a diameter of ca 35m and a height of ca 3m. It covered the remains of a R cremation burial which had taken place elsewhere. The ash and charcoal from the cremation had been spread out on the ground to cover a rectangular area 2.20 x 0.90m, in a level 4-6cm deep, on an E-W orientation. The cre- mated bone fragments had been carefully gathered into a cen- trally-placed heap which also contained several bits of gold sheet, perhaps from clothing, a bronze sheet fragment, a gold ring with a cornelian bezel engraved with a bearded, garlanded head of Dionysos, and a silver coin of Augustus from an issue of 2-11 AD. A preliminary study of the bones by A. Angelarakes suggested that they were those of a 30-35 year old male. On top of the ash and charcoal were placed the unburnt equipment of the deceased, an iron sword with a bone handle, two spear- heads, a small iron knife, two iron spurs and a small glass unguentarium. Also found were pieces of a polychrome glass vessel which had been cremated, and two red-glazed bowls. More grave goods were at the N end of the ash-covered area: two amphoras, two bronze vessels of cooking-pot type, a bronze frying pan with a handle ending in a ram's head, and a bronze oinochoe with a lion's head at the top of its handle and a lion's paw at its base. Iron fittings at the four corers of the area may have belonged to a bier or funeral car. After all these finds had been covered with a light layer of earth, a wooden tray 63 x 48cm, with a rim 2cm deep, was set down on the N side of the cremation. It contained red-glazed plates and bowls (one containing a few bones from a small ani- mal), a bone spoon, and two intact hemispherical glass cups, apparently used in a final funerary ceremony. A small area of burnt offering was found to the N of the main cremation, and 10m to its S at a higher level were broken amphora fragments. About 15m W of the cremation was the skeleton of a horse, plus a few bones and teeth from a smaller animal. Given the spurs and weapons, it would seem that the dead man was both a war- rior and a horseman. The surface level of the tumulus contained much IA and his- torical pottery, and its central core had more EIA pottery, pithos sherds, animal bones and clay with impressions of wattle and daub, while beneath the cremation and the W part of the tumu- lus were circular pits and a stratum of LBA-EIA debris.

Karadema reports on archaeological activities in 1995. A trial excavation took place within the anc. city of Samothrace on a small flat terrace a short distance SE of the medieval Gattilusi tower. Over 4000 architectural fragments were recov- ered from the test and surrounding area. They came from at least two buildings, one Doric and one Ionic. In one part of the</page><page sequence="108">110 DAVID BLACKMAN 157. Kato Karyotes, column necking test a stratum 0.40m thick was encountered, which contained burnt earth, burnt bones of small animals and a number of sherds from kantharoi and amphoras of sub-Geometric G2-3 ware like those from the early sacrificial area in the sanctuary of the Great Gods. At one end of the test, part of the foundation course of a large building was found. A new survey of the city's circuit walls included the Gattilusi fortifications of 1431-3, particularly the SE tower, in which many earlier architectural fragemts were incorporated. In the sanctuary of the Great Gods, a programme was under- taken which was designed to make both the sanctuary as a whole and the individual buildings in it more readily intelligi- ble to the visiting public. (AEMTH 9, 488-496) Kato Karyotes. One of the unusual neckings with palmette decoration which formed the lower element of the Ionic column capitals in the Propylon of the Hall of Choral Dancers (Temenos) in the sanctuary of the Great Gods (Fig. 157) was found in a chapel dedicated to Christ in the Rache locality. It was brought to the attention of the Archaeological Service by I. Maltezos, of Samothrace, and was moved to the Archaeological Museum. (ADelt 625) James R. McCredie (ASCS) reports on the 1999 study and conservation season: 'East hill: marble blocks from the dedication of Philip and Alexander were relocated, renumbered, drawn, photographed and studied in preparation for the final publication of the build- ing by Professor Wescoat. Context pottery from various parts of the Eastern Hill was examined, catalogued and prepared for publication. Hall of Choral Dancers (former temenos): the remnant of the floor of the E room was conserved and supported. Marble blocks from the excavations of 1949-1951 were re-identified and labelled. Various blocks were remeasured and a detailed faqade elevation was worked out and drawn. A reconstruction of the S wall of the building was prepared. Reconstructions of the tile distribution were worked out and tested against the extant geison-sima blocks. Museum: pottery on exhibit and glass on exhibit, which had been restored with obsolete techniques, was disassembled and restord according to present standards. Architectural restora- tions whose appearance had deteriorated were repainted. Metal objects in the museum and in storage were surveyed, those requiring treatment were treated, and all were protected.' NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS Chios Chios town. Rescue excavation on the Margariti-Tremi plot on Odos Kountourioti revealed part of the LHL cemetery of the city. Of the six graves excavated, one was lined with stone slabs while the rest were monolithic sarcophagi. The burials, which were disturbed, contained offerings of unguentaria, a gold dia- dem, gold leaves, a silver coin (obverse: sphinx; reverse: amphora) dated between 190 and 84 BC, a gold pin, glass beads and a miniature oinochoe. Sarcophagi VI and V had been in large part destroyed by later construction works. Sarcophagi I, II and III were transferred to Chios Museum, and grave VI was preserved by backfilling. Trial trenches on the Skandali plot on Odos Agia Kyriakis brought to light remains of a building of the 2nd Ct BC at a depth of 3m below present ground level. Six rooms of varying dimen- sions were uncovered, with stone-built foundations of 0.6-0.9m. The deposit contained little pottery, mostly coarse wares of the 2nd Ct BC. The remains were preserved by backfilling. Trial trenches on the Kostari plot on Odos Ieronymou Gorgia revealed antiquities only on the SW side of the plot: foundation remains of a 4th-Ct BC building; the deposit produced a frag- ment of an inscribed stele of the HL period: HPAKAELWD/THH APTE-ME2. The remains were preserved by backfilling. Remains of an anc. building were also discovered by trial trenches on the Smymaiou plot located on Odos Agiou Fotiou. The excavation uncovered a room (4 x 4.9m) with a pebble floor. Pottery found in the deposit was of the HL period. To a later period belonged a stone-built channel, which had partly destroyed the earlier construction. The date of the channel could not, however, be easily determined due to the disturbance of the deposits caused by continual use of the area up to the 20th Ct. The remains were preserved by backfilling. (ADelt 641-2) In the district of Agiou Dimitriou there came to light a num- ber of clay sarcophagi belonging to the extensive anc. cemetery, a section of which has also been discovered on the Sitaro hill. Stone sarcophagi were also found in the Frangomachala district, NW of the Monastery of the Panagia Boetheia. On top of the Delphinion hill, which is scattered with sherds, were noted rock cuttings for walls. The site is known from the work of the BSA on the fortifications, the temple of Apollo Delphinios (BSA 51 (1956) 41-54) and the HL house. (ADelt 663) Ano Phana. Lesley Beaumont (BSA) and Constantinos Skampavias (3rd Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities) report: 'In 1999 an area of approximately 2.25 km2 in the Ano Phana, or Managros, district was subjected to a programme of intensive surface survey. Preliminary observation of Ano Phana (Managros) situated some 4.5 km NE of the cult centre at Kato Phana, ancient Phanai, had suggested the existence here of a diachronic settlement site inhabited in both prehistoric and his- toric times. Systematic fieldwalking now produced evidence of hilltop prehistoric settlement and A, C, HL, R, Byz, Genoese and Ott remains distributed across the land below. Given the fertility and well-watered character of the extensive valley plain at Managros, this is perhaps hardly surprising. The earliest remains detected are an EBA acropolis site atop the Kastri hill. Finds here included much distinctive ceramic material and a number of stone tools including blades, rubbers and a mortar. A fortification wall encircling the acropolis and constructed of a double facing of large unworked stones packed with stone rubble more probably, however, belongs to a later period and further study of the construction style is now required.</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 Below the acropolis lies an extensive Byz and Ott settlement strewn with heavy sherd cover and numerous chapels, some ruinous and others restored, together with an elaborate water management system. Several of the Byz chapels incorporate much ancient spolia ranging in date from the A/C to R periods. Ancient in situ built remains include a set of massive walls which stylistically should date to the A/C period. As the line of the structure now disappears beneath later terrace and field sys- tems, geophysical testing using an electrical resistivity meter was carried out in the area by Dr Ian Whitbread of the BSA's Fitch Laboratory. Results reveal a large rectangular construc- tion, some 12m wide and at least 24m long, with what can prob- ably be correctly interpreted as a series of cross walls. About 1 km further to the W, the chapel of Agia Marina appears to be built atop C foundations, with much reused anc. material also incorporated into the superstructure. Dense sherd cover of the C period extends to the W of Agia Marina, while excavations conducted in 1993 by the 20th Ephorate just N of the chapel unearthed a quantity of white marble column drums and other architectural members. These architectural remains, together with preliminary analysis of the ceramic material from this findspot, suggest the location here of an anc. sanctuary, probably in use between the A and HL periods. The focus of R settlement at Managros was found to extend across a wide area on the NW edge of the plain, at the conflu- ence of two valley systems. Two hydraulic installations dating to the Genoese period point to the existence of two large Genoese estates on the N and W sides of the valley. These, together with the nearby fortified Med village of Pyrgi, must have formed an integral part of the Genoese control of mastic and other agricultural production in this area. Much further study of the pottery collected across the survey area, in large part coarse wares, together with the other artefacts found, must now be carried out before further conclusions are attempted. Such study will permit us to gain a more detailed understanding of the nature and chronology of the diachronic human occupation of the Managros district, and of the relation- ship of this area to the nearby coastal sanctuary site of Apollo Phanaios.' Kato Phana. Lesley Beaumont (BSA) and Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri (20th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities) report: 'In 1999 the Kato Phana Archaeological Project entered its third season of work (AR 1997-98, 100-01; AR 1998-99, 96-7) with the commencement of new excavations in the sanctuary of Apollo at ancient Phanai. Partial excavations by K. Kourouniotis in 1913 and 1915 (ADelt 1 (1915) 72-85; ADelt 2 (1916) 190-212) and by W. Lamb in 1934 (BSA 35 (1934-35) 138-64) had previously unearthed here remains of a G to ECh cult centre, including the NE section of the foundations of an A and C temple and parts of the surrounding sanctuary peribolos walls. A decision was now taken, therefore, to excavate within the sanctuary's SW boundaries, where an apparent depth of undisturbed deposits holds out the possibility of establishing a stratigraphic profile and clearer chronology, until now sadly lacking, of the sanctuary's various construction phases, use and architectural history. During the three week excavation period, which was ham- pered by Greek Army exercises in the area, two 5 x 5m trench- es were laid out. Though trench 1 was found to cut through the comer of one of the 1934 excavation trenches, this proved to be informative concerning Lamb's excavation methods. Trench 2, which was dug as far as LR/EByz levels, produced the comer of a building probably contemporary with the ECh basilica. 158. Hephaesteia, tower site This trench, and also a third trench which was opened in the extreme SW of the sanctuary in order to reveal the peribolos walls, were subsequently lined with heavy-duty plastic sheeting and backfilled to await resumption of work in 2000.' Lemnos Kastri (Kournos district). A site was discovered with building remains and sherds of the A period and MBA. (ADelt 663) Hephaesteia. A. Di Vita (Italian School) directed a short excavation at the tower in front of the Tyrrhenian wall that pro- tected the city on the side of the isthmus. He summarizes the results: in the soil that had previously produced no material, over all the length studied (ca 10m), a Myc occupation level was recovered (13-12th Ct BC). The LH III phase is followed by a phase of abandonment, at least in the outskirts of the low rises, until the construction period of the Tyrrhenian defence wall, which, based on the evidence of the small trial trenches, proba- bly dates to the 6th Ct. Part of this wall W of the 'tower', built on a natural projection, had collapsed, but a narrow supporting tower that incorporated the unstable projection had been built; this reconstruction work and the construction of the tower (which consists of pseudo-isodomic ashlar blocks) date most probably to the 4th Ct. In the period which followed (2nd-1st Ct BC) a regular proteichisma was constructed at a distance of 1.70-1.40m from the facade of the tower (Fig. 158: from SW) and ca 1.1 Om higher than its foundations (this was followed for more than 15m). In the area between the proteichisma and the Tyrrhenian wall, at a low level and above what survived of the wall (ca. 2.20-2.50m), ER dwellings were established at surface level, behind the original defence wall. A violent destruction hit these dwellings in the late 2nd Ct AD, followed by a phase of abandonment of at least 150 years. The walls of a LR house which appear on the W side of the section represent a last phase before final abandonment of the area. Myrina. Androni district. Rescue excavation continued in the Kazole plot, revealing two independent building complexes on different orientations, with an open area (square) between. The E complex contains in its final phase (early blue period of Poliochni) a megaron-shaped building, N-S (8.70 x 5.2m); and an ellipsoid building, parallel and to the W (internally 7.10 x 3m). A deep destruction level seals the deposit and distinguishes the two periods of occupation (early and late blue period at Poliochni). Straight walls, roughly built, define the houses, some of which were work areas. The green period of Poliochni is rep- resented by one wall. The same building phases can be seen in the other building complex to the SW. (ADelt 657-60 &amp; fig. 16) Aulona district. Excavations continued at the sanctuary site 1l1</page><page sequence="110">112 DAVID BLACKMAN where a sports complex is being built (Tratarou plot); walls were found, not of the main sanctuary building but of similar construction; the deposit contained no pottery. (ADelt 660-2) Poliochni. Work started on conservation of the site and pres- entation for tourists. (ADelt 662-3) Skandale. Road construction near the village cemetery revealed an EBA site (sherds of the latest Poliochni phases). (ADelt 663) Lesbos Submerged archaeological remains were located in 1994 and declared archaeological sites by the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (A. Simossi) at Myrina, Petassos, the Kabeirion, Kotsina and Hephaestia. (ADelt 853) Achladere area, former AYB army camp. During investiga- tion of the construction of army structures a broken pot was uncovered and was investigated immediately. It proved to be an infant burial in a pithos, the mouth of which had been closed by a large stone. The skeleton was placed on pebbles. In the soil, two pieces of sheet were found, one of bronze and the other of wire. (ADelt 655-6) Antissa. Lapsarnoi. Near the chapel of Ayia Triada, an inscribed column and sherds and structures of the R period were found. At Point Pochi. A flint quarry was found, probably PR, as well as scattered settlement remains. (ADelt, 663) Apotheka. On both sides of the road from village to harbour, extensive A building remains and part of a paved A road were located. (ADelt, 663) Geras Bay Pyrgiou. From investigation of the Kakasadelli plot, before the start of excavation, a section of a mosaic floor was found, together with sherds of coarse wares, ca 4.50m from the shoreline. Subsequent rescue excavation revealed two rooms, open towards the sea, 1.60 x 3.40m and 0.60 x 3.80m; the walls were preserved to a height of 0.60m and width 0.50- 0.70m, constructed of unworked stones and earth mortar. Inside room A a destruction layer of roof tile was found. The floor had a mosaic of white tesserae; traces of a similar mosaic were found in the NW comer of room B. From the tiles and the few sherds found in the overlying deposit, the remains could be dated to the LR period. The excavation is continuing. (ADelt, 655) Kara-Tepe. In the Hatzinikolaou plot, during excavation for modem building, a HL cemetery was discovered and excavated. An area of 450m2 was investigated in the E part of the plot, where 26 burials were found and two large (3m diam.) pits for secondary burials. The burials had been cut into the natural bedrock of the area and organized in large groups. They were of various forms, including cist tombs with slabs or unworked stone, shallow sarcophagi of rectangular shape, cist graves cut in the natural bedrock, hut-shaped with tile covering or cut into the rock. There were also small, four-sided graves (0.50 x 0.50m), which contained cinerary urns, and were constructed of rectangular slabs sealed with a cover-slab. Grave-goods were mostly utilitarian vessels and oinochoai. The irregular trenches contained large amounts of bones and grave-goods (silver ring, bronze pin, bronze mirror, strigils, silver buttons). In the tombs the dead had been buried with offerings of clay unpainted elon- gated unguentaria and small pelikai, dating to the 2nd Ct BC. The site of the new construction was relocated and the antiqui- ties were preserved in the back-fill. (ADelt, 651) Loutropoli Thermis. The test trenches in the E and N areas of the main building of the old Hotel Sarlitza were continued (AR 1998-99, 97). Under the N point of the hotel, a stone-paved road was discovered, 5.10m wide and 46m long, with an E-W orientation. The road was built with irregular stones and a strong mortar. N of the street were found a row of five four- sided rooms (from W to E: (a) 7.80 x 3.50m, (b) 8 x 2.80m, (c) 7.10 x 4.15m, (d) 6.50 x 5.10m and (e) 3.80 x 4.30m) with walls 0.90m wide. Wall 56 of area (a) is broken by an entrance with steps to a basement, where, 0.50m below the road, sherds, pithoi and part of a ceramic wheel were found. At the level of the stone-paved road, parts of the floors of the rooms were found, of ECh date, as were four burials built into the paving of the street, which had no evidence of grave-goods. In total six burials were investigated; grave-goods included gold earrings and bronze rings. The deposit over the structures was rich in undecorated domestic pottery and terra sigilata. A corbelled drain was uncovered 16.70m N of the street (2.80m wide, 21.40m long), and a bath system was revealed. 20.60m W of the street and 7.30m S of the hotel building. This appears to be a R bath complex, constructed in two phases. To the earlier phase, which rested on the natural bedrock, belongs the central section of a large basin (11.10 x 8.50m) with a semi- circular stair for descent. On the W wall was a niche which sur- rounded a warm water source from which two clay pipes carried the water under the clay floor. In the deposit above the floor there was a large destruction level of tile from the superstructure. In the later phase the area was transformed into three rooms by remodelling the rooms of the earlier phase with various addi- tions. On the N and E the main basins were surrounded by serv- ice areas, which contained a dense concentration of remains. Of particular note was room III, with basins (5.90 x 2.30m and 2 x 2.30m) which were cut in the bedrock and were used for mud baths. In the overlying deposit glass vessels were found, togeth- er with figurines, lamps, bone objects, cups, and skyphoi. N of the more recent hotel building a deposit was investigated which contained plaster, which may have come from the clearing of the first phase of the building. (ADelt, 653-5 &amp; PI 204) Makara. Koukos. Myc tombs in periboloi were located; their existence had been mentioned by Charitonides, without precise location. (ADelt, 663) Methymna. Dioikitiriou Street. Excavation continued in the Mauvridis-Linradatos plot and was completed in the N part of the plot, with the discovery of bedrock. Also investigated was the continuation of wall 7 to the E, a section of which was repaired in the HL period and belonged to the structure with a storage area, of which the earlier phase dates to the LG-EA peri- od (ADelt 48, 465). The overlying deposit contained a large number of sherds, mainly of undecorated coarse wares, but also of black painted kantharoi, skyphoi and oenochoai, and tear- shaped unguentaria, pointed-based amphoras, Megarian bowls and lamps. The same date was assigned to 35 bronze coins, fig- urines, spindle-whorls, loom-weights and bronze objects. Also investigated was the dump of an excavation by the owner of the plot, which took place during 1988 without the permission of the Archaeological Service. Finds included sev- eral coins, architectural fragments, fragments of figurines, a loom-weight and a mass of sherds of the A and HL periods. Also of note are the fragments of an inscription, part of a decree of Methymna and Kolophon, which referred to the imposition of court penalties. Investigation is continuing. (ADelt, 656-7) Dapia area (sewage plant of the deme of Methymna). After several test trenches were dug in order to select a site for sewage treatment facilities, two sections of wall that came to light were cleaned. Wall 1 was preserved 1.10m wide and 23m long; it was built of tile and unworked stone of small and mid- dle size, quarried from the area; wall 2 (1m x 49m) was of sim- ilar construction, with a N-S orientation. Both walls were attrib- uted to the LR period on the basis of their constructiion.</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 113 In test trenches dug in selected areas of the plot SE of walls 1 and 2, several building remains were found, of unworked stones and earth, 0.30m from the surface. These belong to part of a rectangular room, the interior of which has yet to be uncov- ered. Most of the removable finds were HL; a circular well with similar construction to the wall was also dated to the HL peri- od. At a depth of 0.80m, several earlier structural remains were found that were dated to the LC period. The treatment facility will be built elsewhere. Dapia. Agiasmateli. After an illegal excavation on the head- land, the investigation of the rocky shore took place. In all 31 burials were discovered in the natural cavities, mostly child inhumations, together with enchytrismoi. It would appear from the few grave-goods that the burials were of R date. Finds included glass vessels and unguentaria, a loom-weight, cups, a lamp and a fragment of a figurine. (ADelt 657) Mytilene. In the Synoikismos area, on Kydonion St (Petra plot) there was investigation of a building, the S part of which had been covered by the Saratza house in the 1970s. The build- ing consists of small four-sided rooms, built on three levels, fol- lowing the slope. On the highest level there exists a courtyard with a pebble floor, on to which open two rooms which are in turn connected with the two rooms of the second level and two of the first level by a staircase covered with clay slabs, as is the courtyard on the lowest level. The walls are preserved to a height of 0.50m, and width 0.30-0.75m. The finds indicate that this was a house occupied during the LR period. A proposal has been made to preserve these finds by backfilling. In Epano Skala, during new building at the 8th elementary school, a section of a wall was uncovered with pottery dating to the LHL period. In a lower level, a wall was revealed which belonged to an earlier building phase. Excavations are continuing. In the area of the Malloeis harbour in Epano Skala, during the excavation of some foundations in the P. Arapis plot, remains were found belonging to an anc. monumental building that related to structures found earlier nearby. Many glazed sherds and Turkish pipes were found in the upper levels, togeth- er with four separate graves with no grave goods, but obvious- ly Ott, given that it is well known that there was a Turkish graveyard in the area. In the deeper layers several walls were found which form a comer, made of stone blocks in pseudo-isodomic ashlar. The deposit contained many sherds of black painted vessels, of the HL period. A wall from an earlier building phase was found, composed of unworked stone, upon which the foundations of one of the HL walls had been laid. The associated sherds were mainly of grey A pottery. (ADelt 643-4) Kioski area (New Museum site). The rescue excavation in the S court of the new Museum of Mytilene continued. All baulks were removed between the trenches and the whole exca- vated area was unified. The excavation was then extended east- wards and brought to light the continuation of the clay pipes of the stone-covered drain which belonged to wall 32. In the NW comer of the plot, a section of a room was uncov- ered, called area B4; the rest of the room lies under the paving of 8th November St. On all three walls are preserved traces of mortar of whitish colour with evidence of red bands. In the mid- dle of one wall there was evidence of a niche with traces of mar- ble orthostats. In the middle of the room is a hearth at a depth of 3.68m. The area S of B4 was investigated (area B6), defined by two walls whose surfaces had evidence of a whitish mortar; on one wall there were signs of a niche comparable to that in room B4. The two rooms are connected with each other through a corri- dor, 1.95m wide. Sherds found in the deposit were dated to the early 5th Ct BC. At a depth of 3.69m several structural remains of an earlier building phase were found, dated to the 7th Ct BC. The best-pre- served part of the building was the comer: the walls were con- structed of large unworked stones and earth mortar. In the deposit several sherds with painted and incised decoration were found, together with Cor vessels, figurines, lamps and large spindle-whorls. The excavation was halted abruptly, lest further work would have caused instability to the building of the New Museum. The remains were preserved in a temporary back-fill. (ADelt, 644-6, fig 4, pl. 2033) In the Har. Avraam plot, next to the new museum site, where part of the sanctuary of Aphrodite had been previously investi- gated, new trenches were opened to look for more possible antiquities before permission for modem development was granted. In all the trenches, the topsoil produced a large amount of R sherds and figurines, mainly in the E and S areas of the plot. Immediately under the topsoil bedrock was revealed. In Kavetsou St following the demolition of a petrol station, a rescue excavation took place on the Papoutsanis plot, where a previous excavation had taken place during 1977 (AR 1998-99, 99). In all, 23 burials were uncovered, together with two wells and a monumental tomb of Macedonian type, which has been transformed into a visitable archeological site. Trenches were laid around the perimeter of the tomb and it was found that it was built on natural bedrock. The whole area around the monu- ment was investigated in order to ascertain whether there were other burials in the area or whether there was a dromos leading to it, but nothing was found. The stabilization and temporary covering of the walls by Ephorate conservators followed, in order to protect them from the nearby building activity. Two other burials were also investigated: burial 24 was a cist grave which had three cover-stones and contained two skeletons in contracted position, with the skulls towards the N, and had as grave-goods three bulbous unguentaria and an oxidized coin. In the deposit various figurines were found, large spindle-whorls, part of a lid, a lead connecting piece and lamps. Burial 25 had no grave goods, was cut in the bedrock of square shape and was re-used. During excavation activity for the construction of a modem building on the limit of the Kalpaka plot on Chrysomallousis Street, under the tarmac of the roads, a storage area was found which revealed the lower sections of two storage pithoi on either side of a wall. The structure to which the storage area belonged continued into the unexplored section of the nearby road. On Aginoros St (AEYAM excavations, in the area of Synoikismos) after the removal of the mosaic floor the substra- tum was revealed, made up of large irregular stones. Wall 12 (0.50 x 5.15m) was built of similar unworked stones. Also revealed was the wall of a stone-built drain parallel to and in contact with wall 12 (AR 1996-97, 93). A layer ca 0.1 m deep, with strong evidence of burning, was revealed under the mosaic throughout the area between the N face of wall 2 and the S of wall 1. On the natural bedrock was revealed the clay border of a horseshoe-shaped hearth, with strong evidence of burning and fragments of marble chips. The fill contained mainly red plaster and fragments of architectural pieces. In the SE section of the excavation the continuation of clay pipe A was revealed (diam. 0. 16m; length 3.50m) and it became</page><page sequence="112">114 DAVID BLACKMAN clear that this postdated the impluvium, which had been destroyed during its construction. In the fill several figurines were found together with marble architectural fragments. The excavation is continuing. Other AEYAM excavations took place in the Synoikismos area. Work on Diophanous street was completed. At a distance of ca 30m from the area of the oven, which had been investi- gated the previous year, in the E section of the street and near the junction with Ekatonissou Street, remains of several struc- tures were discovered under a destruction level of stone piles, tiles and sections of clay pipes. The walls had been built from unworked stones quarried from the natural bedrock of the area and had mortar as a binding agent. Between walls 6 and 7 a sec- tion of pebble floor was investigated (5.04 x 2.30m). Against the W face of wall 7 a bench was found (width im). The deposit throughout the site was disturbed by continued use of the area until the 20th Ct. In the deposit red painted sherds were found, together with black painted and plain wares, fragments of figurines, a com- plete incense-burner of Pergamene type (2nd-1st Ct BC) and fragments of others, together with a large amount of plaster with a design of white, red and black bands. After the laying of water pipes and drains on Agrippa St in 1993 (AR 1998-99, 98) excavation continued in 1994 in Leskou Street, which revealed a mosaic floor (8.90 x 3.50m) with geometric designs, bands with ivy leaves and running spi- rals (ADelt pl. 203y). The mosaic was in very good condition, except in the E area where it had been destroyed by the sewer. The walls around it were built of stones quarried from the local bedrock. Later activity, to which wall 4 belonged, caused dam- age to the mosaic. After removal of the mosaic, two trenches were sunk in the level below, revealing a drain and a layer of stone make-up for the mosaic, which was dated to the 3rd Ct BC. In the deposit several figurines were found, also a small plate and a lamp. On Krinis Street in the Synoikismos area, drainage excava- tions revealed, at a depth of ca 2m from the road surface, the clay lip of a well (internal diam. 0.69m). During further exca- vation, a hoard of bronze coins was discovered, at a depth of 2.30m, in a vessel: 1.226 coins, most of the well-known type of coinage of Mytilene in the 2nd-1st Cts BC (obverse: head of a beardless man; reverse: hermaic stele). (ADelt, 646-9). Perama district. At Halatses (Vousvouni plot), during the digging of foundations, several structural remains were discov- ered and a brief rescue excavation followed. In the NW part of the plot, under a destruction layer at a depth of 0.73m, a comer of a room was uncovered, and part of a storage pithos, support- ed by small stones. The destruction level, revealed at a depth of 0.50m, consisted of stone piles, tiles, traces of fire and building debris, and was dated to the LG period. The walls were investi- gated to a height of 0.90m, and the foundations have yet to be located. Further investigation is problematic because the plot is close to the sea. The excavation is continuing.(ADelt 655) Petra District. During excavation of several test trenches in the Kavakou-Katsamatsa plot, a section of a wall was found, which may have served as a peribolos, constructed of unworked stone, river pebbles and earth mortar; total length 31.60m, width variable 0.50-0.70m. The sherds collected from the deposit were ER.(ADelt 656) Pyrgoi Thermis. The salvage excavation in the Vas. Nianou plot began after the appearance of anc. structural remains dur- ing the construction of a greenhouse. The excavation focused on the extent and length of walls 1 and 2, which were revealed during the test trenches of 1993. The two walls were parallel, 4.45m apart, with a N-S orientation. They were constructed with unworked stones and the longest visible length was 13.20m for wall 1, and 9.50m for wall 2. The pottery that came to light when the surface of the walls was revealed belonged to the Byz and later periods. The excavation is continuing. (ADelt, 652-3) Rural district of Pyrgoi-Thermis. During the salvage exca- vation in the W part of the Skoulaxenos plot, part of a cemetery was found and eight burials were investigated. Graves I - V and VIII were covered with stone piles of irregular four-sided shape, with a N-S orientation. Following the removal of the stone piles, bathtub-shaped pits were found with walls plastered with clay (thickness 0.05m); they contained bone remains, organic matter and strigils. Grave VI was a monolithic sarcoph- agus; grave VII was constructed of stone of rectangular shape. All of them contained burnt bones, burned soil and parts of strigils. In graves V and II stone-built rectangular graves (Va and IIa) had been inserted with extensive remains of burning and bronze offerings. For lack of pottery finds, dating was difficult. One unguen- tarium was found in grave II and was dated to the 3rd Ct BC. The deposit over the graves contained very few sherds of unpainted domestic vessels. In the remaining part of the plot no antiquities were found. On the E boundary of the plot, a comer of a structure was revealed with walls of stone blocks, which were preserved to two courses (total height 0.60m). (ADelt, 651-2) Rondatsi. Remains of curving walls were found, built in Lesbian style of the A period. (ADelt, 663) CYCLADES AND SAMOS Andros Stavropeda. Surface survey by Chr. Televantou revealed a large anc. building (25 x 25m) dominating the area. About lkm to the N, at Pantoukia, is a rectangular building, probably a HL tower; three farmhouses in the vicinity are almost entirely built of re-used anc. material, probably from a building to the NE, damaged by road construction in the 1940s. (ADelt 678-9) Palaiopole (site of the anc. city): excavation at the Pertesi plot revealed an 1 im stretch of the W acropolis wall, a gate and tower or bastion, still standing 2m high. At the Michele plot at Peristerionas in the N part of the Palaiopole plain, excavation by the monumental terrace wall known as Ellenika revealed poorly-preserved remains of buildings with A and C-HL phas- es. Earlier pottery between one wall and the bedrock has G pot- tery, the earliest evidence for occupation in the Palaiopole area. Clearly the land was worked by inhabitants of the nearby G site of Ypsele, and possibly some moved and lived at Palaiopole towards the end of the 8th Ct, founding the city of Andros together with the inhabitants of Zagora. At Sotera in the outer part of the Palaiopole plain (Kasidone plot) an EByz building reused much earlier material. The SE side of the T. and N. Loukrezi plot coincides with a long stretch (110m) of the W wall of the anc. city. The W boundary wall of the Manousake site is built on part of the A wall of the anc. acropolis.

Two of the four seem to date to the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th Ct AD, giv- ing a terminus ante quem for the construction of the baths. This structure, which lies at the back of a shop opening onto Street 5, is also of interest for the current study of the Delian craft industry. In trench II, between the S wall of room Z6 and the N wall of square X, several successive destruction layers were found, one containing fragments of pigment, pieces of different miner- als, dross and bits of iron and bronze as well as a cylindrical stone object with a metal pin, possibly a grinding mill. Trench III, dug along the S wall of room e, was intended to discover whether there had been in an earlier phase an extension of the Street of the Theatre as far as dead end Y. Different occu- pation levels were found, but no clear indication of a street. One such level had a ditch tiled at the bottom and full of pure clay (Fig. 163: right). Trenches IV and VII, dug respectively at the SW comer of room V and against the E wall of room Z10 in the agora, revealed a portico bordering the agora on its S side before some rooms blocked it off and encroached onto the frontage. The grand scale of its foundation (Figs. 164-5) made of large blocks of gneiss, show that it probably supported the projection of an upper storey. Trench V, dug between the W portico, the Ionic naiskos and bases 97, 98 and 99, revealed two layers of fill separated by pockets of sand at the level of the enthynteria of the portico. The lower one is doubtless contemporary with the construction of the portico, whilst the other is connected with the laying out of the agora itself and the building of the naiskos. Trench VI, at the NW comer of room 2, had some A and G occupation levels under the rubble connected with the construc- tion of the walls of the room (probably of the Athenian period). Survey of the agora and its E and S insulae was completed.' Heraion. A study season was carried out by H. Sarian for the French School at the request of former Director O. Picard, with a view to a new publication. The Heraion had been exca- vated in 1911 by P. Roussel, and the monument and finds were published in various publications between 1928 and 1956. In 1953 and 1958 further sondages were made by P. Bernard, and in 1964 by J. Ducat. The re-examination of all the material caused Sarian to ques- tion the classification of pottery, terracottas and architectural fragments and the dating of both the finds and the monument, which consists of two successive temples, a peribolos wall, an altar and a retaining wall. The presence of fragments of LG (750-700 BC) and of Attic rf pottery, later in date than was thought, i.e. after 500 BC, indicates a problem with the original dating of the beginning and end of the sanctuary. House of the Seals. Francoise Alabe and a team from the French School conducted a season (August 1999) of study on the painted ceiling plaster from the House of the Seals (Skardhana district). The big room above the NE rooms had a ceiling (Fig. 166) decorated with a series of small motifs arranged in concentric bands framing a central square of red: a design typical of ceil- ings, including those of tombs, but not of mural painting. There were 15 bands between the edge and the centre in a field bare- ly im wide. They were of a small size and rich in colour which was subtly shaded. This closely resembles the ceiling in the House of the Sword, studied in 1986, though the colouring of the latter was damaged by fire. The room above the SE comer of the house had a ceiling of more complex design. Fragments of plaster discovered in the 1960s, and not previously identified as part of this ceiling, were included in the study, and cleaning and conservation work was done. The ceiling had a central square, framed by three concen- tric geometric bands, and some parallel linking bands on one of the two axes. One of these linking bands had a figurative motif of swans facing an amphora on each side. It was separated from the wall by at least one other band whose motif is indistinct. The composition seems to be completely asymmetrical.</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 117 France, carried out research on polychromy of the sculptures of Delos. It was felt that this formed a logical continuation of the study of the manufactur- ing process, since the application of colour to some extent dictated variations in the surface of the marble and the way in which the elements were put togeth- er. They started the study by going through the archive material in the French School and then examined the sculptures on Delos. They used a videomicroscope and a computer to produce a large number of negatives on diskette for processing, analysis and later printing. The theatre. J-C Moretti and other members of the French School completed the inventory of the stray blocks in the koilon (Fig. 167) and catalogued other scattered blocks from the theatre, including several fragments of the proskenion previously iden- tified by R. Vallois or now by Moretti. Fifteen parts of steps found in the houses of insula III in the the- atre area, to the E of the agora of the Hermaists and on the periphery of the agora of Theophrastos, will need to be added to the list. 166. Delos, House of the Seals, ceiling fragments Contrary to the opinion of Vallois (BCH 53 (1929) 282 &amp; 312) the seating blocks discovered in and around the ekklesiasterion must belong to this build- ing and not to the theatre. In one of the phases of the former, it must have had up to three flights of recti- linear steps (Figs. 168-9). Sarapieion. H. Siard and Fr. Muller, architect (French School) began a collaborative study of the architectural features of the N court of Sarapieion C (Fig. 170). They included in their study temple F, the L-shaped portico and a small tholos building. They were greatly assisted by the earlier records of Fr. Perdrizet, and by the catalogue and classification of the scattered blocks made in previous seasons. Temple F (Figs. 171-2) had a krepis of three steps in blue marble on its facade and part of its long sides (3.20m in length, the same as the pronaos). The tem- ple seems to have been systematically demolished after the abandonment of Sarapieion C, and only the first of these steps survived. The blocks of this step were broken up to extract the metal from the sealing cavities. The blocks of the second and third steps must have subsequently been used in other construc- 167. Delos, theatre House of the Stucco. Christian Leroy (French School) car- w t" B. 5 ried out a study season on the plaster work of the House of the Stucco, helped by Nikos Sigalas. They managed to carry out their programme in spite of the disruption caused by the removal of all the material from the sculpture storeroom to make room for the lion statues which were transferred into the museum. All the material was examined, and all significant fragments.... numbered and entered into the computer database. There were ., ! 531 entries which included provenance, storage location, full description with measurements, and details of photographs and plans, as well as the need for further work. Useful discussions were held with Fran9oise Alabe, now studying the ceilings of the second style on Skardana. Ph. Jockey of the French School in collaboration with B.

This was also the case with the columns, capitals and ele- ments of the entablature, fragments of which have been found in scattered locations. The walls of the cella consisted of poros courses resting on a base of gneiss. The temple was prostyle, tetrastyle with an intercolumniation of 0.95m. It is possible that the central intercolumniation was greater than that at the two sides and, if so, then the joints of the stylobate are more regular than as shown on Fig. 172. The diameter of the columns was almost certainly 36cm, and as the stylobate blocks show no trace of a setting for a base the order was clearly Doric. The traces of settings preserved on two of the blocks are exactly the same as those still visible on the krepis of chapel 1 of Sarapieion C. It is therefore likely that the columns of temple F, like those of the chapel, were not fluted on their lower parts. A complete restoration of the platform of the temple is impeded by columns from the L-shaped portico which have been wrongly restored on the first step. This 'anastylosis' must have been carried out after 1980, as photographs of that date show the temple without it: cf. P.H. Bruneau, BCH 104 (1980) fig. 5, p. 175 &amp; fig. 10, p. 181. From the historical data the construction of the temple is generally placed at the beginning of the 2nd Ct BC (perhaps 180). It may have been dedicated to Sarapis, for in the accounts of the hieropoioi of about 180 BC works carried out on a Sarapieion are listed (ID 440 A, 83-84). Also, a text found in the Syrian sanctuary confirms this identification (G. Siebert, BCH 92 (1968) 359-74). This inscription records the reconstruction of an oikos of the Syrian sanctuary destroyed as a result of the construction of the temple of Sarapis. The exact amount of the cost of reconstruction is given in Delian drachmas, which indi- - ii I _ yi; . , .... . 0H 10 o O10 170. Delos, Sarapieion C cates a date some time before 166 B.C. The analysis by G. Siebert of the dividing wall between the Syrian and Egyptian sanctuaries cannot be upheld, as the wall dated by E. Will to about 110 belongs to a more recent phase. Also, a number of remarks on the topography of the Sarapieion by Ph. Bruneau (op. cit. 179-82) can no longer be accepted since the re-exami- nation of the N area of the N court. L-shaped portico (Fig. 173). Blocks and fragments of this building are widely dispersed and in a poor state, indicating that this building too was systematically demolished, after the aban- donment of the Sarapieion. The building is not referred to in inscriptions and its date is not known, but it clearly involved an extensive modification of the N court. The W wing of the por- tico is constructed above the fill of a room which originally opened to the W below the actual level of the N court. If a trial trench were dug in the N court underneath the paving still in situ, it might be possible to date the fill and obtain a terminus post quem for the building of the portico. It is clear that it did not form part of the Sarapieion, but one room of the latter at least was annexed at the time of construction. It seems to have been contemporary with repairs carried out on the E terrace of the N court. D The portico was of the Ionic order. The polished columns had drums varying in size according to their position in the shaft. Drums belonging to the foot of the shaft were 130cm-179cm high, and at the top 20 m 93cm-156cm. Intermediate drums are more difficult to identify. It is, thus, possible that the number of drums varied from one shaft to another.

Delos, Temple F possible to work out the height of the columns but their base diameter is about 44cm (not taking into account the slightly splayed moulding with which they are decorated) and the top diameter is about 39cm. The top is decorated with a small moulding and the bedding above is therefore a little broader. 173. Delos, L-shaped portico The intercolumniation is calculated as 2.65m; one of the archi- trave blocks is complete and the stylobate bears some traces of the position of the bases. The capitals are poorly preserved and the best example is inaccessible, being part of the anastylosis on temple F. The architrave, 24cm high, has three fasciae on both faces. The denticulate cornice provides a frame for the roof beams which rest directly on the frieze. The interior comer block of the cornice was found, proving that the building was L-shaped. The frieze has almost entirely disappeared, and the total preserved length of the architrave is only 6.65m. The building must have been systematically demolished. Fragments of a small tholos: blocks found in the N court coming from this building show that it was circular and about 1.20m in diameter. It is likely that it was located somewhere in the Sarapieion, and was probably some sort of votive kiosk. Some curvilinear orthostats and Ionic architrave blocks and some roof blocks were identified. Three fragments presented small columns engaged in orthostats. Many of the blocks were poorly preserved and there was no trace of capital or base. There are other fragments on Delos of similar monuments, and there is the stucco decoration from the house of the Stuccos, which could provide comparative material. E peribolos area. Test trenches were dug by A. Famoux (French School) in 1999 in the E part of the sanctuary, and new sections thus produced were studied by E. Fouache to comple- ment his geomorphological survey conducted earlier in the year. As a result of this work, the hypothesis of Cayeux that the E part of the sanctuary was part of the lower valley of the Inopos, whose course ended in the sacred lake and the bay of Skardana, was disproved. The alteration of the gneissic granite in the area was limited, indicative of human scouring (between the 6th and 4th Cts) rather than flooding. Famoux suggests that the absence of buildings in this part of the sanctuary might be due to the later construction of the peribolos wall on this side. It was found that the water table lay at a depth of about 1.40m, which explains the existence of wells in the area. The lake was probably fed by this same water table, which consists of run-off water from the slopes of Cynthe. A 4th-3rd Ct floor was found in G4 (already evident in H4 and connected with the construction of the monu- ment of the bulls) and a well in M3 which can be dated by an amphora stamp to the 3rd-2nd Ct (N. Conovici attributes it to Cnidus). They also found trenches not recorded in recent excavations. Samples of beach rock were also taken from depths of-0.70, -1.70 and -1.80m below sea level in the Bay of Phoumi, to ascertain the level of the ancient shoreline by C14 dating.

Fyriplaka sample, electron microscope image field season: 'The Melos project continued in September 1999 with a short field season that incorporated four specific objectives. The overall aim is to establish the nature, origin, sources, mining methods, production methods, uses and socio-economic signif- : icance of Melian industrial minerals in antiquity. This aim has required the development of a research approach as the project has proceeded. One reason why this is not straightforward is that evidence for the mining, processing, production and use of the 'earths' of antiquity is easily assimilated into the back- i .. . ground of the natural environment. Their economic significance is similarly difficult to establish but probably under-estimated, as is the case with modem industrial minerals. The objectives, and preliminary results, were: (a) To extend the topographic survey of the Agia Kyriaki site using EDM and to quantify pottery concentrations. Artefacts . ! located during the survey that were of special importance, or at . special risk, such as glass vessels, were recorded and trans- ' ferred to the museum in Plaka.

During restoration work on the site opposite the Metropolis where many important finds were made (Myc wall, PG houses, etc.) a small supplementary test produced a fine mid-LH III C skyphoid krater (Furumark form 282: Fig. 176). Restoration work in town (Pantelaion plot) revealed more of the HL houses, now the largest building com- plex of the period in the Cyclades outside Delos. At the NE tip of the island, at the site of the half-finished colossal statue, construction of cement stairs by the National Tourist Organization (without Archaeological Service permis- sion) seriously damaged the site (Fig. 177); the Service finally had the stairway removed.

Ca 11.50m E of its SE comer, thick layers from pyres were found, surrounded by three enclosures/terrace walls (Fig. 178); the pottery was mainly A, a little G.

The complex was once thought to be the earliest not con- nected with the cemetery, but now many early structures have been found in two W coast areas, on terraces around the bays of Agia Triada, and further S on the plain of Kampos, with a sur- rounding wall and late 6th/early 5th Ct pottery (possibly some G).

On the S side part of the Byz sea wall was found at the inner foot of the mod. mole, partly overlying the anc. wall/breakwater (trial trench F', just E of the 1993 trench A'). A further trench against the E side of the mod. N breakwater revealed an anc. rubble breakwater, whose length, width and depth could not be determined. (ADelt 855, 858-62) Thera Akroteri. The construction of a new roof over the excavated buildings, under the direction of Chr. Doumas, has necessitated in-depth excavation of certain areas, in the form of deep pits, dug down to bedrock. Excavation has confirmed the continuous habitation of the site from the LN period down to LCyc I, when the town was destroyed by the eruption of the volcano. The ear- lier habitation in the N period was limited to the area of Xeste 3, while the ECyc settlement was more extensive, half of the size of the now-roofed space. Even more extensive was the MCyc town, which lasted to the end of the LCyc period. During the new excavations, the volcanic ash layer was observed to a height of 15m. In the trenches within building B, EB pottery from the islands of the NE Aegean was identified, possibly the property of refugees who abandoned their homes and established new settlements on the coasts of S Greece and in the Cyclades. Worth mentioning among the portable finds is a pair of bull's- head rhyta, and a pair of grill stands. To the SW of Xeste 3, within a layer of pumice, was found a pile of horns, mostly of goats, and nearby in the same layer, a small clay lamax containing a small golden animal figurine, possibly of a goat (weight 180gr). The statue was hollow-cast, the feet, neck and base being made separately (Fig. 179). (Ergon 1999, 77-80) Perissa. Investigation and consolidation continued at the EByz site of the Agia Eirene basilica. Even though this and ancillary buildings appear to be preserved to a great height, at times up to gallery level, excavation is made very difficult by the accumulation of rocks, some quite large, on top of the site. Investigation of the NW ancillary structure uncovered various phases, the latest of which contained a burnt destruction layer with a coin of Leo III, dating to 720/725. (Byz chronographers, appropriately, tell us that Thera erupted in the year 726). Found with the coin were nails and parts of metal objects, including part of an iron cross. A lower level included a coin of Constans II (646/47). Remains of column capitals and columns in situ were uncovered, some still supporting blocks of the springing of a vault. Work continues. (ADelt 690-2) The important cemetery on the Karamolengos plot has proved to be more extensive than expected. Two broad burial layers exist, the earliest going back to the ER period in the region, and containing burials on a N-S alignment. Of the 53 burials uncovered, most were pit burials of E-W alignment. Of especial importance were the number and range of the lamps found here. One particular location, now submerged in the sea, provided virtually all types to be found in the Aegean from the 5th to the 8th Cts AD. Also, late Attic, Knidian, Ephesian and R types were found. These finds have made possible stratigraphi- cal understanding of this important cemetery. (ADelt 692-5) DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS Amorgos The Archaeological Service cleaned the sites of Minoa and the tower of Agia Triada (mod. village of Arkesine) and received a large number of objects handed in to the museum by private individuals at the suggestion of Prof. L.

Excavation continued at the Spanou Mavrou site, where important architectural remains of the 7th Ct AD had already been found, probably related to the ECh church of Katapoliane (AR 1998-99, 105). In 1994 walls and pipes were found on different alignments and of different phases from the 7th Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD. A room 5 x 3m, with a paved floor, may be the inner court of a house, going back to the 2nd Ct AD (its original form has been changed by later building). We have here new evidence for occupation of the ancient harbour of Minoa. On the Nomikou site remains of houses of the LR peri- od were found. (ADelt 797) Minoa. Restoration work, directed by L.

The site of the historical cemetery was identified in the area outside the walls of the town, to the SE of the gate (kalpe of the end of the PG period). To the N and NE of the gymnasium were discovered remains of important build- ings, in one of which was incorporated the inscription: opos oiKiS 'louSViKrS.

On Lord Byron Street (Danitsa plot) the S end of the anc. agora was further investigated: the rob- ber trench of the stylobate and of the back wall of the E stoa of the agora were found; the trench of the stylobate contained many marble fragments from the superstructure; an E/W wall was a partition wall between shops along the E stoa. Laying drains along Gregoriou E' revealed the destruction level of a (probably R) house by the R odeion, and a fragmentary wall of poros blocks, probably the S side of the HL decumanus. (ADelt 783) E sector of City. Work continued on Odos Makrigianni (Tsimisiri plot: cf AR 1998-99, 106-7): an insula 31m wide between two N/S streets was further investigated. The W wall and W side of the drain of the E street were found; an insula of the same width had been defined just to the E (AR 1997-98, 109). The W wall of the insula was 4m wide, with a central poros-lined drain. Within the insula the buildings were poorly preserved; the phases cover the EHL to LR periods. Excavation of the Christaki plot continued (cf. AR 1998-99, 107) extending to E and N: the N/S street (5m wide) found in 1993 was followed N to its junction with an E/W street. This part of the city seems to have had short duration of use; the drains are built on a fill with HL pottery, and the road surfaces are of R date. To the SE, parts of an ECh house were found, with two phases; in the later phase a destruction level in the house contained cover tiles, two amphoras and a 'late Roman C ware' plate of the late 5th/early 6th Ct. (ADelt 784-7) W sector of City. On Odos Theophrastou (Donlou plot) excavation continued on an E/W road, finding its continuation westward and T-junction with a N/S road running N; of the E/W road a length of 15m has now been uncovered, and six surfaces of the R to ECh periods; of the N/S road only 3m and road sur- faces of the HL to R periods, but the construction of the E/W road seems to have preceded that of the N/S road, both in the HL period. The monumental building on the Pitsi-Papakonstantinou plot (AR 1998-99, 107) excavated last year, will be preserved in a basement. The eastward continuation of its walls was found during work by the telephone company (OTE) on Odos M. Alexandrou: the building had a series of rooms along its E stoa, unlike its W side. OTE excavations on Odos Nymphaias dis- covered road surfaces of a (probably N/S) road over a length of 12m. (ADelt 787-90) Cemeteries. Marmaroto. Excavation was carried out on the Ploumi-Vallianatou plot, E of the Kavoura plot (AR 1997-98, 109) and the Chandrou plot excavated in 1993 (AR 1998-99, 107). In all, 53 graves of the HL and R periods were found, mostly tile-graves and cist graves (six of them double) with a few pot burials or in sarcophagi. Some graves were re-used, others destroyed by the construction of later graves; most were robbed. At the S edge of the site the N part of a R built grave was found. On Odos Australias (M. Thymanaki plot) more of the R and EHL pottery deposit was found, as found on the Dem. Thymanaki plot in 1992, and two graves without grave goods; also a built drain of the R period. On Odos Nymphaias (OTE works) a 4m-stretch was found of a solid wall running NE/SW, probably the city wall, badly damaged by a drain of the Italian period; it seems to have turned S, to join the point where it was found on the Gregoriadi-Giavasi plot. E of the wall, road sur- faces were found; there seems to have been an ancient road along the inside of the wall here, as found by Italian excavators in the N part of the city. On Odos Asklepiou, drainage works revealed various types of tombs of the HL and R periods, notably 12 cist tombs; a mon- umental tomb of poros masonry containing two sarcophagi; and two R built tombs. (ADelt 790-3) Kos Island. Mesaria. Nine HL tombs were found at the foot of the Food Ko AE site: 6 cist tombs (3 with finds of 4th-Ct kylikes, 1 pithos burial and 2 in sarcophagi).

In Gouma Bay on the W side of the island, EB remains had already been noted at Agios Isidoros Drymonos and Agios Konstantinos. On a visit in 1994, sherds and stone tools were picked up, including much obsidian (apparently locally worked) on a rocky hill NW of the Byz chapel of Ai- Giorgis. (ADelt 798) Pharmakonisi (anc. Pharmakoussa) an islet SE of Leipsoi and Leros. At a strong point in the centre of the islet, near and NW of the chapel of Ai-Giorgis, two towers (4th-3rd Ct BC) are visible, with careful workmanship. Some tools and sherds attest PR occupation also. (ADelt 798-9) Anc. remains were located in the sea in 1994 by the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (A. Simossi).

N sector: dredging in Mandraki Harbour produced Med amphoras, Byz colonnettes, much LHL and R pottery and some stamped Rhodian amphora handles. On 28 Octovriou and Amarandou (Louizidi plot) excavation continued of the insula between streets P2a, P38, P28 and P28, revealing a private house with four building phases between EHL and R imperial times; these include a mosaic floor in the andron of the EHL House, built over later, and a courtyard of the same phase, reduced in size in later phases. (ADelt 760) W sector: on Navarinou, excavation of the Papamichael plot was completed (in the insula between P8, P10, P28, P38); three building phases were found: of E/MHL date (basement rooms), LHL date (major ashlar walls) and R date (supplementary walls probably to reinforce a structure whose size or height had been increased). (ADelt 760-3) On Pavlou Mela the insula between P27Oa, P28Oa, P5 and P10 was clearly not crossed by secondary streets P8 and P9. A fine LHL water basin was found, clearly belonging to a palatial house. Both sides of P27Oa were defined, the E side serving also as a terrace wall; also at least eight road surfaces, a water pipe on the W side and a drain covered with poros slabs on the E side. The area between this street and the basin seems to have been a garden (Tsabikaki plot). On the Kaka plot the remains were more confused. A major rectangular building of ECh date was preserved after excavation, allowing little study of earlier levels. (ADelt 763-8) Excavation of the sanctuary site on Agiou Ioannou was con- tinued (cf. AR 1997-98, 110; 1998-99, 108) and completed. On the NE part of the plot, two further rock-cut underground struc- tures were found, like one found to the west in 1993; all must have been related to the cult. The structures were rectangular, and lined with ashlar (Fig. 182), roofed with timber and approached by rock-cut steps. The fill of one contained pottery of the LHL (late 2nd-1st Cts) R (1St-2nd Cts), and mainly ECh periods, fragments of broken archaeological elements, dedica- tory stelai and bases, sculpture, bronze objects and glass ves- sels.

AR 1998-99, 108). Test trenches in street P39 revealed up to 15 surfaces dating from the 2nd Ct BC to LR times. The interior of the monumental structure built over the street was further investigated, revealing further evidence of water-supply from higher areas of the city to the S: four clay water-pipes replaced by a tunnel. W of P39, fragmentary remains were found of a rich building of R date, including two corridors with mosaic floors, one providing the entrance from the street; from below the floor of a room to the S came a bone disk-a counter from a game, or a theatre entrance ticket (Fig. 183). At the junction of Meg. Konstantinou, Venetokleon and Karaiskaki (Neophytou plot) the W side of N/S street P30 was found, which served as a terrace wall for a higher terrace to the W. (ADelt 769-71) Central cemetery. In the Analepsis district at Athenon and Lardou (Christodoulou plot) two burial complexes were exca- vated. The first consisted of the usual rock-cut tombs and graves, dating from the 3rd-1st Cts BC; in one were placed large sheets of lead, covering an area of 2m2 (Fig. 184). The other was not in the normal Rhodian tradition, having a large, deep rock cutting with four underground tomb chambers around it, of EHL date (one with LHL reuse). 183. Rhodes city, bone disk 184. Rhodes, central cemetery, tomb with lead sheets On the Rhodes-Lindos road the Karagiorgou plot between tomb groups E' and XT' was further investigated. Removal of the pot- tery deposit was completed; it was not a closed chronological group but covers the EHL (2nd half of 4th Ct) to LHL periods (late 2nd Ct); it probably relates to the levelling of the area in front of(S of) tomb group 2T' in the late 2nd Ct BC. Below this deposit was found the 'forecourt' of 2T'. The tomb group is still to be investigated. (ADelt 771-3) E cemetery: on the Rhodes- .......... .. .

The rows probably contin- ued NW under the modem building, and terminate on the SE, where the grounds falls away (Fig. 185). To the NE were two sets of graves meeting at right angles: a NW/SE line of cylindrical (and some rectan- gular) rock-cut graves, with remains of a third line (61 graves in all) and a NE/SW double line of 21 circular and 10 rectangular graves along the</page><page sequence="124">126 DAVID BLACKMAN 185.

(ADelt 816) During investigations at the SE corer of the hos- tel of St Catherine, extensive pottery and lamps of the R period were found, including thorn ware and terra sigillata, along with two EByz tile fragments stamped with monogramme inscriptions (figs. 1-2, ADelt 817). The many coins were difficult to discern, and were accompanied by minor objects made from many different materials. The area appears to have been used for a long time as a dump, from the 2nd Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. Territory of Ialyssos. Trianda. S Sector: on Odos Trianton (Paraskeva plot) promising test trenches in 1992 (AR 1997-98, 111) were followed up in 1994 on the E half of the plot. Successive phas- es of the LM IA town began to appear at a depth of 2.63m; to the N the SW corer was found of a large building oriented SW/NE, with fine exterior walls. The W wall extends at least 9.65m to the NW, and the S wall at least 7.85m to the NE, before it is disturbed by a later level (Myc sherds). Within the building were found the base of a polythyron parastas and a paved floor; and earlier walls and floors beneath. S of this build- ing was found the continuation of two parallel walls found in 1992. The continuation eastwards of the layer of volcanic tephra found in 1992 was found in the SE comer of the excavation. On Odos Trianton (Xenaki plot) four sections were cut in the S part of the M settlement. Important finds included a wall with fragments of fallen painted wall-plaster, and part of a HL cis- tern. On Parodos 9 Maiou (Hatziioannou plot, immediately N of the Platsi plot) a trench was cut partly in the bed of the Peristeri stream, without archaeological supervision at the start. Remains of walls were found of successive LMIA phases; best preserved were the remains of the latest phase. Riverine or flood deposits of pebbles all over the site at various depths may explain the absence of a layer of volcanic tephra. (ADelt 775-8) Kremasti. In the EB III settlement, a third megaron building was excavated with an open area to the W, with surface levels destroyed by later intrusions and earlier architectural remains beneath. On the S and E sides narrow streets separated house 3 from houses 1 and 2, and on the N side lay a broader street (III). It is clear that the buildings of the settlement were grouped in insulae, like the PR settlement under the Samos Heraion (with which it has close cultural relations), with less close grouping than similar or earlier settlements in the Aegean (e.g. Thermi, Poliochni). A destruction level was found within house 3. The close grouping of pithoi in the SW corer of the house indicates activities in the open areas just outside the house. There is new evidence of social differentiation in the Aegean EB II and III. Traces of an earlier EB III phase (IIIa) were found, and pise walls of an even earlier phase (EB II?).

Many amphora handles were also found, some stamped and inscribed. Three bore the inscription XAPMY- AOY. (ADelt 811) The ruins of a R / ECh settlement, cemetery, basilica and olive press are reported at Gennadi (Megale Ge site). At least four of the eleven bronze coins found during investigation of the four chamber tombs exposed by the sea are of Licinius (307-324). One of the tombs was oriented N-S, the others E-W. (ADelt 820) Remains of an ECh settlement were found at Lardos, at the Keskintos site (building remains, a counter-weight from a mill, coarse ware sherds, tiles, burials). A three-aisled basilica was also uncovered, with a three-sided apse on the outside, inscribed as a semicircle within. (ADelt 811) Remains of another LR/ECh and Med settlement were dis- covered SE of the settlement of Mesanagrou (Paleokastro, Zopes, Agia Sotera sites). A basilica was located some 150m above the remains of the settlement. The basilica is three-aisled, terminating in an apse. A narthex has been added, and a water fountain or cistern is located in the middle of the W exterior side of the narthex.. Together with ancillary buildings, the basilica would have covered an expanse of 1,540m2. A recent (?) church of Agios Georgios appears to be built on an earlier structure. (ADelt 811-2) At Psinthos, the chapel of Agia Triada preserves an anc. spring that was considered holy in Byz times, and is today. Ruins of a 5th-Ct AD reservoir (sacred spring?) were identified. These included spolia from an earlier structure and HL ampho- ra handles.

It has sometimes been con- sidered to be the tomb erected on the island by the Spartans after the naval battle of Syme (411 BC) referred to by Thucydides. Ephorate archives show that two test trenches were dug in the Italian period; a sketch survives but there is no record of finds. The new trenches produced only a few unpainted sherds; full details will be published in the next Deltion Chronika.

Excavation under the direction of V. La Rosa (Italian School) took place in July-August 1999. He reports: 'Conservation work on tholos A and its side chambers took place in collaboration with the Ephor of Herakleion, A. Karetsou. At the end of the excavation period it was finally pos- sible to begin the conservation and reconstruction of the exca- vation house. The excavation concentrated on the sector W and SW of the small rooms, excavated by E. Stephani in 1904, near tholos A. The evidence uncovered this year has once again proved that the area had been seriously disturbed (pits by Halbherr, at least three Venetian excavations, LR interference) a fact that has occasionally made the connection between levels and structures impossible. Firstly, the large MM IA deposit of level 6 (discovered last year) was wholly uncovered; vessels were thrown in this, which had been used for ceremonies in honour of the dead, and were probably originally kept in the nearby small rooms 1-10. The samples recorded amount to a total of 214 (110 conical cups, 35 small jugs and 13 small plates) (Fig. 189). New information has been gathered on an important number of fragments of 'baking plates', incompletely documented the previous year. Although their function is still under debate, their shape constitutes evi- dence for the reconstruction of the 'meals' prepared during the ceremony. As for structures, wall M/9 (use uncertain) was located; it was built during the MM II period and irregularly abutted wall M/4 (last year this wall was identified as the limit of the deposit, and dates to MM IA-MM IB). An unstable structure, M/10, on the W edge of the excavation, limits a deposit area used in the MM III- LM I period (with almost total absence of LM III material). 189.

Archanes, conical vase S of small room 9, the narrow S belt of room alpha was iden- tified (with useful internal space ca 2.50m) with walls built of small stones, which rest on the only clearly EM layers of the whole excavation. They are probably the remains of the first service area for tholos A to its SW, which dates to the MM IA period (unfortunately without finds). The section N of the wall with the baetyls produced no result (as to whether it continued). After the purchase (on behalf of the School) of the olive grove where the tholos is located, part of the team was occupied with the cleaning of the tholos and of its annexes (Fig. 190: from the S) with the intention of carrying out detailed recording and consolidation and conservation work, which could no longer be postponed. As for Stephani's structures, it was possi- ble to identify an eleventh annex (room M), a section of the interal circumference on the N side and two buttresses on the S (Fig. 191: from SSE). The diameter of the structure is 8.70m. The external walls, judging from the height difference between the preserved structures and rock level, must certainly have exceeded 3m. The large 'Cyclopean' wall, excavated by C. Laviosa in 1970, was cleaned and conserved. This consists of a single series of large limestone blocks, with sharp points, which are placed vertically in the ground. This structure (12.85m length and 0.80/0.90m height) was connected, as mentioned above, to the circumference of the tholos tomb. A careful re-examination of the junction of the two structures led to the conclusion that the tholos wall was already in ruins when the arrangement took place. A limited trial trench N and S of this wall allowed the con- struction of the 'Cyclopean wall' to be dated to the PG period (or at least later than LM IIIA) and led to the conclusion that it was built to limit an area of worship in direct relation to the ruined tomb (ancestor worship?).' Archanes. Resumed excavations, under the direction of Y. Sakellarakis and E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki, revealed, in the NE comer of room 25, the remains of a rectangular built construc- tion, containing figurines and vases, a bull figurine, a fruit-stand and conical cups. Similar cups, in association with cooking pots were found in another part of the same room, as well as a pair of conical clay vases, decorated with representations of lilies, and apparently used as flower pots (Fig. 192). Area 33 was constructed of large poros blocks, within a wooden framework. Judging by the debris from the upper floor, which was paved with variously coloured marble and schist slabs, the room was destroyed by fire, while the discovery of a few half-worked steatite fragments suggests that this was the workshop of a stonemason. Among the other finds were part of a clay bull's head, a clay sealing, some obsidian fragments, a bead of a semi-precious stone and many conical cups. On the ground floor were found nine pithoi, with plastic rope decora- tion, mostly broken (Fig. 193; ht 1.20m). At a higher level was located a R tomb. (Ergon 1999, 81-7) Asterousia. Tsimbraga.

Roughly at the centre of the excavated area, a LC tomb was found containing, among other finds, a bg medium-sized oinochoe depicting a human figure.

In the S trench part of a room, possibly a paraskenion, was exposed. The interior skene wall ran for 28m and was preserved to a height of 1.50m; but in the area of the paraskenion this wall was found preserved to 2.85m with an addi- tional 0.45m foundation. The foundation for the spectators' seats was also revealed. The orchestra floor was partially paved. Sections of the terrace wall for the cavea are preserved up to 2m high; its E face, starting at 1.90m, is lined with square clay slabs indicating which section of the wall was meant to be visible.

Only a summary of these important discoveries is given below, after consultation with the excavator: Surface finds showed that the settlement extended over 70 acres. All visible buildings seem to have the same orientation as the palace, suggesting pre-conceived town planning. Most buildings are located S and SE of the palace in a 30-acre area. Walls are visible around the palace especially towards N and NE, although the N end of the hill was left clear so as not to obstruct the view towards Knossos and Iouktas. Building 1</page><page sequence="128">130 DAVID BLACKMAN 195. Galatas, palace, room with four pillars 196. Galatas, pottery (Chronakis plot, excavated in 1992) is located some 100m S of the palace, whereas building 2 (excavated in 1997) is located in front of the palace's W wing. The excavation results can be summarized as follows: The palace has a paved central court. Its E and W wing have been fully excavated. The main rooms of the E wing are: 'the room with four pillars' equipped with a hearth in the middle (Fig. 195), 'the room with the column', kitchen, storage rooms, staircase to the upper floor and a S paved court. The W wing was severely destroyed by modem ploughing, so that most architectural remains belong to a pre-palace building dating to MM IB. Some rooms belonging to the palatial building were preserved, such as room 22, equipped with a built circular hearth. Room 23b had a raised platform-like feature. Both archi- tectural features were probably areas for depositing offerings. The earliest habitation evidence dates to EM II and comes from the area later occupied by the palace's W wing. A series of tests below floor levels within the E wing revealed the following stratigraphical sequence: MM IA and MM IB pottery was found above bedrock, comparable to the contemporary pottery from the nearby M site of Kastelli Pediados. This pottery probably belongs to pre-palace build- ings, for which no building remains were found or were demol- ished in order to erect the new palatial building. During MM IB a large building was constructed in the area of the later W wing of the palace. Ample evidence for grain pro- cessing was discovered, at a scale that exceeds ordinary domes- tic need. Predominantly Pediada type pottery was found with few Central Cretan imports and destruction deposits dating to the end of thus phase. There followed construction of the E wing of the palace incorporating 'palatial' architectural features, such as ashlar masonry, mason's marks and miniature frescoes. MM IIIA pot- tery was found in the E wing as well as building 1, predominant- ly Knossian with limited appearance of local Pediada pottery. During MM IIIB/LM IA the central palatial building was constructed and completed. Clear evidence in support of the palace's date of construction comes from a foundation deposit of twenty vases found below the 'kitchen'. The palace's E wing rooms were re-designed and re-built: the kitchen and paved roads to the SE were added, the central court was paved, and the N wing facade was possibly changed. Within the same ceramic period the kitchen was destroyed and subsequently buried. This room produced evidence for food preparation on a massive scale: movable finds include numerous plates, cups, tripod cooking pots and large clay trays (Fig. 196). Other finds include fragments of baked earth and carbon together with large quanti- ties of animal bones, mainly bovid, pig, goat but also seashells (the latter presumably transferred in sea water from the N coast 30km away). Building 1: to this period also belongs neo-palatial (MM IIIB/LM IA) pottery and cult vessels (chalices, incense- burners, a lamp and a clay mask with horns that resembles MM IA bell-shaped idols). Large quantities of decorated plaster frag- ments were found depicting floral and geometric motifs. In LM IA, the palatial character of the palace is lost: the 'room with the column' is made into a kitchen, support walls are added in the 'room with the pillars', the storage rooms are aban- doned, doors leading to the upper floor are blocked. Gradually it was abandoned and becomes a ruin. Frescoes are removed from the walls of building 1. Destruction by the earthquake is associated with the eruption of Thera. Finally, after the LM IA abandonment of the palace, in LM IB the separate building 2 is constructed along the space in front of the W wing. It remained in use during LM IB and was destroyed by an earthquake. There is a limited re-occupation dating to LM IIIA2/IIIB: this LM IB building has strong exteri- or walls. Fragmentary horns of consecration, similar to frag- ments found along the palace's E wing, were re-used and incor- porated into building 2's make-up. These horns of consecration, possibly originally located at entrances and overlooking a courtyard, provided direct links with Knossos. Building 2 had an upper floor. 100 pounders provide evidence for food prepa- ration: compare similar but earlier deposits from the palace (in MM IB, MM IIIB/LM IA, LM IA). Within two storage rooms seven pithoi were found. The extensive scatter of spherical loom-weights within different rooms of the ground floor sug- gest that a loom was located on the building's upper floor. A stirrup jar decorated in the special palace tradition with floral and marine style decorative motifs was imported from Knossos. A cup-rhyton with olive-spray decoration, a cup decorated with papyrus and another with figure-of-eight shields are reported. The first two above-mentioned vases were found together with an offering table made out of serpentine, together with pumice fragments, and a fragmentary bronze stick. The assemblage could have belonged to the furnishings of a shrine located on the upper floor. Gortyn. A. Di Vita (Italian School) reports on the 1994 exca- vation season (ADelt, 711) covered in AR 1994-95, 60. Also under the direction of A. Di Vita, excavation took place in July-August 1999 in the praetorium. The excavation focused mainly S of the temple of the so-called Augustan Deities, in the southernmost part of the W side of the stadium, which came to light in 1998. Di Vita reports:</page><page sequence="129">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 131 'We discovered that the back wall of the peristyle of the great court of the so-called first praetorium rested directly on the W retaining wall of the stadium. At the point where the sta- dium ends, to the S, a wide staircase (Fig. 197: from the N) descended for about 3.50m (and was partially excavated) behind the S retaining wall of the stadium, leading from the courtyard of the so-called first praetorium to an open space, where there was an entrance to and exit from the stadium. The excavation did not continue as far as this 'square', the floor of which was of well-trodden earth behind the S retaining wall of the stadium, but stopped 6m further S after a truly exceptional discovery. At this point, between the stadium (of the 1St Ct BC) and the temple (dating to the time of Marcus Aurelius) a monumental altar was erected in the time of Augustus, with a height of 3.10m (plus 20cm for the founda- tions) and a perfect E-W orientation. The altar has the monu- mental staircase on its E side, so the priest would have been pre- cisely facing the sunset. The altar, with sides ending in a pediment and decorated with spirals and a small akroterion (now lost) seems to have been shifted by an earthquake, but is perfectly preserved; the large limestone blocks of which it consists have all been pre- served, except for one at the height of the sacrificial table where the rites took place. Furthermore, the S wall of a 5th-Ct AD large room which uses the S wall of the temple as its N wall, touches the steps of the altar (which was completely preserved). This fact constitutes even more of a miracle, if we think that the large well-shaped limestone blocks of the altar would later have become perfect building material. The explanation for their sur- vival is possibly given by a small cippus altar (Fig. 198) which preserves a valuable inscription (1St Ct BC-1st Ct AD) which says: GECjl YlIoT(cbt) / EUXr(v) / Tti(fiptos) KXaU(itos) / KaTa TrXo(uv). I think that, without much difficulty, despite the absence of the title 'NEpcov', this can be attributed to Tiberius, who had not yet been adopted by Augustus, and the dedication to the 'supreme god' had secured for the cippus altar, and the large altar on which it was placed, the respect of the Christians until the 6th/7th Cts, when the whole square was cov- ered by the debris of the nearby baths, after the temple of the Augustan Deities was built. It appears that the altar was used for night-time rites. Under the last slab, which constituted the level of the altar, but was broken, and the large fragments of stone blocks, which consti- tuted the interior of the monument, ca 50 oil lamps of the 1St Ct AD were found, most of them fragmented; they must have been preserved when a new altar table was put in place, perhaps dur- ing the reign of Trajan. As for the temple of the Augustan Deities, a fragment of a large statue was removed from one of the later small walls that divided the sekos of the still-covered structure into small rooms: probably the cult statue of the temple. It is preserved from the height of the hips to the ankles and is a female figure with rich folds, which indicate careful execution. It is very pos- sible that it dates to the era of Marcus Aurelius, when the tem- ple was built.' Metropolis. The team, directed by R. Farioli (Italian School) and M. Borboudakis (Ephor of Byz Antiquities) worked on the basilical church in August-September 1999. They report: 'Central nave (sectors III-IV, according to the old nomen- clature). The destruction level (US 6) in IV was removed, from W to E, and the S parts of the two already partially-known mosaic panels were revealed, as were another two which are located S of the 'walkway' on the longitudinal axis of the nave, and correspond (in terms of their geometric decorative motifs 197. Gortyn, staircase 198. Gortyn, inscribed altar and their dimensions) to those which constitute the floor of sec- tor III, N of the 'walkway'. The 'walkway' has the same width as the solea; it begins at the W staircase of the pulpit and reaches the facade, thus defin- ing, along with the lateral mosaic frames, the width of the cen- tral door of the basilica. The floor of the 'walkway' is laid with slabs of white marble (US 542) and is clearly contemporary with the mosaic floor. The mosaic floor that was uncovered is divided into large dis- tinct spaces. Each of these spaces consists of four panels, which are located N and S of the oblong 'walkway', contain geometric decoration and are enclosed by the usual frame of chained cir- cles; most of this floor survives. It is defined by a 'diazoma' (US 541) of marble slabs along the length of the stylobate. It is interesting that the mosaic frame also defines the E limit of the mosaic panels, beyond which we meet a second, N-S ori- entated 'walkway', of substantial width (1.60m) and covered with marble slabs from Iasos (US 523). This 'walkway' cuts the first one at right angles, creating a cross. A gap makes it difficult to understand which was the dominant 'walkway'. Some frag- ments of white marble from the crossing of the two 'walkways' indicate that the E-W one probably cut across the N-S one.</page><page sequence="130">132 DAVID BLACKMAN 199. Gortyn, narthex of the basilica The distance from the facade of the N-S 'walkway' is ca 12.80m, and from the start of the bema 23.75m. It is probable that its presence, with the aim of highlighting the side entrances of the nave and of the church generally (on the N-S axis) is relat- ed to the function of the large circular building (baptistery?), which is in line with the church and is located ca 15m from the N perimeter of the basilica (USM 448, discovered in 1997). The marble N-S 'walkway', along with the E-W 'walkway', divide the mosaic floor into four large rectangular sections; these are connected by the strip of marble slabs (width 0.45/48m, US 541) which, working as a frame, runs along the length of the peripheral structures of the nave. As for the E-W 'walkway' (US 542 = floor of white marble), starting at the facade wall and continuing E, we removed all levels between the destruction level (US 6) and the mosaic, leaving in place the sporadic slabs of later flooring (US 80) and keeping distinct the levels connected to the two phases of floor- ing of the 'walkway'. As mentioned above, the two sectors NW (sector III) and SW (sector IV) correspond to a large extent in terms of their dimensions and definitely in terms of their deco- rative typology. In sector III, in contrast to the W part of the N-S 'walkway', the mosaic panels do not correspond in the two sectors, neither in terms of their dimensions nor in terms of their decoration. The first two panels have not been preserved, although traces of vegetal scrolls have been confirmed. The third, which was total- ly uncovered, contains octagons and crosses, and the fourth, which was already known (as were the next ones in sector III), is decorated with scales. In sector IV, immediately to the E of the N-S 'walkway', a new mosaic panel was uncovered; it is largely preserved, and is decorated with a central circle with four smaller circles inter- loped externally. Contained within the circle is a kantharos within scrolls. Two peacocks (in profile) are depicted drinking from the kantharos. In the space left over between the figured design and the border are lines of an inscription mentioning the name of the archbishop who restored the mosaic, Betranios (not found in the Gortyn catalogue of bishops). A very incomplete mosaic panel follows (no. 2); on the top part some tendrils with ivy leaves have been preserved. The fol- lowing panels were already known. As mentioned previously, the mosaic panels have been through various restorations, prob- ably at different chronological periods, which indicates the long life span of this floor. Generally, the parts that were added do not follow the original decorative typology, except for the fifth panel S of the pulpit, which has decora- tion of opus pavonaceum, with one restoration, but with scaly decoration of greater dimensions. In order to have an overall picture of the floor dec- oration of the nave, Bucci carried out a 1:100 scale reconstruction of the mosaic panels of the nave and a 1:1 plan of the mosaic with the inscription. The areas studied in the N part of the basilica were: (a) the narthex, area B; (b) the NW exten- sions; (c) the extension in the area to the N of the N perimeter of the tetrastoon; and (d) near the gate, at US 187 (faCade wall) which communicates with the small S nave. (a) In the narthex (Fig. 199: N comer,, from the E), below the destruction levels and the intermediate occupation levels, and adjacent to the later walls 368 and 357, a bench (US 504) was uncovered, consist- ing of slabs in secondary use; these rest against a structure of small poros blocks and bricks. The first slab to the E is a fragmentary lintel of Prokonnesian marble, with secondary treatment, which bears, above a series ofkyma- tia constituting the frame, a frieze of acanthus leaves, in the middle of which there is a cross with extremely extended arms. It is possible to estimate its size based on the preserved right side. Finally, the floor of this part of the narthex was uncovered, con- sisting of large poros slabs (US 512). The connection of the bench to this floor appears to relate to an occupation phase contempo- rary with the later walls. This is indicated by the rectangular plac- ing of an element from a window (US 526) in front of the third slab of the bench; this was reused as a step for door US 520; the door, the threshold of which was discovered, connects to area T. (b) An equivalent structure with a bench was found within curving wall 372. Here two flooring phases have been estab- lished: a later one of trodden earth (US 528) probably of the same phase as threshold 424, and an earlier one, consisting of big poros slabs. The room communicates through door 518 with the area W of area T. The door opens to wall 545, which appears to be an extremely heterogenous construction; on its W end there is a fragment of a lintel, now in secondary use. (c) In the area defined on the S by wall 545, a floor of large poros slabs was uncovered, different from the one in the narthex. (d) During the excavation of pit 508/509, in area next to the door (US 536, width 1.86m) which opened to the small interior nave B, threshold US 538 was discovered (length 1.90m, max width 0.54m, spot-height 154.44m). It is possible that the lintel mentioned above originates from this door. The floor (US 512) at this point, near the threshold, is at a spot-height of 154.24m. In June and October, architect M. Ricciardi continued her work in the rotonda, the circular building, located N of the great basilica and probably to be identified as a monumental fountain (or a baptistery?). Four beautiful limestone blocks of a lintel were discovered, with two phases (2nd Ct AD and Justinianic) and decorated with alternating lion and bull heads. Above this was a later occupation level with at least two phases, at a time when the rotonda (with a preserved roof, but its lower part ruined) was used as a shelter. The date of this occupation level is indicated by a halffollis of Anastasios Artemios (713-714)." Herakleion. An eighth season of underwater research was car- ried out in 1994 by M. Anagnostopoulou and N. Lianos (Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities) on the 17th-Ct French war- ship La Therese; work included video photograpy and TV film- ing. (ADelt 854-5)</page><page sequence="131">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 133 Karnari, Temenous. N. Demopoulou reports on the discovery of an LM III chamber tomb at the site of Kamperi Armi, locat- ed at the foot of Mt Iouktas, which could probably be associat- ed with traces of walls and LM III pottery 80m distant from the chamber tomb. A total of three sarcophagi were discovered, which were associated with fragmentary human bones, a plain hemispherical cup and jug with spherical body, which date to LM IIIB. (ADelt, 710-11) Kastelli (Parish plot). P. Galanaki and G. Rethemiotakis report on the ongoing excavation, which has revealed parts of build- ings belonging to six different architectural phases: neo-pala- tial, LM IIIA1, LM IIIA2, LM IIIB, HL, mod. The neo-palatial building had a staircase at its N end leading to an upper storey; it was destroyed in LM IB. The building was re-used in LM IIIA1 by adding floor levels at a higher level. As distinct from the old-palace and neo-palatial period pottery, the LM IIIA1 material follows Knossian decorative motifs. At the W end of the plot, part of a separate building revealed LM IIIA2 pottery, whereas the N end of the plot revealed an LM IIIB building, which contained decorated pottery. Some walls in the N, centre and S of the excavated plot date to the HL period and are asso- ciated with two destruction levels. Finally, part of a pre-WW II building was recorded and removed.

Karetsou reports on the impressive restoration pro- gramme conducted at Knossos under the auspices of the TaCEl'o AtaXEipioris TFloTTcbsEoV. In the palace, restoration concentrated on the NW storage rooms, the W court and the S corridor. The W wing excavation notebooks have been comput- erized, and emphasis has been given to the excavation archives (photographs, plans, notes, etc.). Necessary actions were taken in order to protect the Edwardian Garden of Evans's Villa Ariadne. The architectural plans for the restoration of the Villa Ariadne and roofing of Villa Dionysos were approved by KA2. Necessary funding was provided by the Regional Fund for Crete. (Epyov YTTO7 2, 142-3) Venizelio Hospital. E. Grammatikaki reports that a trial excavation was conducted in a 1000m2 area, located along the E side of the Hospital. Bedrock was reached at 0.30m; only the foundations of a much destroyed, 5.60m long and 0.60m wide R wall was found, running NE-NW. Pottery dates mainly to LR- ECh; two bronze coins, a loom-weight and the head of a R clay figurine were the only finds. SE of the 'Oikos Adelphon' the head of a bearded figure constructed in white marble was dis- covered, which probably belonged to a 1st-2nd Ct AD herm. (ADelt, 698) Ambelokepoi, I. Daphermou plot. I. Serpetdisaki reports on the discovery of five tombs cut into the rock, a section of a chamber tomb dromos and one circular cutting. Three of the tombs are LHL rectangular pit caves, the remaining two are PG chamber tombs. Chamber tomb 5 contained three deep and vaulted cuttings for the dead and was associated with PG finds, including amongst others two decorated fibulae (one bone, the other bronze), 23 identical beads coated with a black paint and incised with an eye motif and several PG vases. The tomb had been robbed; even the rectangular slabs which originally blocked the entrance had been moved aside. (ADelt, 698-9) Bougada Metochi, Blachakis plot. G. Rethemiotakis and E. Grammatikaki report on the successive building and occupa- tion phases dating from MM IIIA up to LR. The oldest occupa- tion phase was founded on bedrock. A destruction deposit con- tained plenty of carbonized remains and coloured plaster frag- ments. This MM IIIA destruction deposit contained a variety of pottery shapes, the first such closed deposit found at Knossos including carinated cups and Vaphio type cups with finicky style decoration. An ashlar-faced new building was founded during MM IIIB-LM IA, its walls preserved 1.50m high. In the two excavated rooms, which were equipped with earthen floors, pottery was sparse but included dark-on-light with spiral and reed motifs. An earthquake subsequently destroyed the building, during the neo-palatial period. Superimposed was a large pit, which contained mature LM I pottery including imported sherds. The pit was re-used in LM IIIA (mainly LM IIIA1), in LM IIIB (advanced IIIB2 or early IIIC) and during the G period. The last building phase dates to the R period: a well-con- structed building, equipped with mudbrick walls, had two entrances with monolithic threshold and earthen floors. Some blocks are architectural fragments belonging to older buildings including one with the carved image of a fish. The most inter- esting find is a bronze figurine of Artemis, possibly attached to a bronze vessel. (Kritiki Estia 7, 222-4) Villa Dionysos. S. Paton reports on a three week period of work in May 1999 to excavate holes for the foundations of the new shelters: 'Thirteen holes were dug to hold the pillars to support the new roofs. Five of the holes, to the N and E of the site, had to be dug through the spoil heaps of earlier excavations and con- tained nothing of interest. One, to the SE, was dug through spoil but revealed at the lowest level the footings of the Villa's E wall. The seven holes dug within the building tended to confirm the view that the Villa had been picked clean of all useful mate- rial (such as paving stones) immediately after the catastrophe that destroyed it and before it was backfilled in the early 3rd Ct AD. In the S peristyle walkway a fill was found which includ- ed a Sub-M sherd together with PG and Orientalising pottery. In the N walkway two holes produced fills of LM IA with some MM and a little EM. Bedrock has not been reached at any point on the site of the Villa Dionysos, and the question of how the Roman buildings relate to earlier occupation in this part of Knossos is still unresolved.' She also reports on more recent work: 'In December 1999, it was revealed that the approved plans of the new shelters for the mosaics required the digging of six more holes for supports, and that this had to be done immedi- ately. E. Hatzaki therefore dug two holes on the W of the site in December and S. Paton dug four more holes on the S side, as well as another one within the Villa, in January. West: one of the two holes (to the N) contained walls. At the request of the contractor's representative on site, the uppermost of these walls was later removed after planning. The second hole, farther S, was dug in an area where there is a large gap in the upper mosaic (that is, the floor discovered in October 1998). In this hole the Curator found fill which appears to resemble closely the fill found by Michael Gough in the principal rooms of the Villa Dionysos. This mosaic therefore was probably the floor of an upper-storey room laid, at least at this point, above a ground-floor room, and had fallen to ground level onto the floor below when the Villa was destroyed. It was not, of course, pos- sible to dig deep enough to test this hypothesis, but although</page><page sequence="132">134 DAVID BLACKMAN unusual it would not be unprecedented; a similar case has been found in a Roman villa in W Crete (personal information from Stavroula Markoulaki). South: a hole in the SW had the remains of some interesting plumbing arrangements. We found a comer of a tank built of brick lined with opus signinum. A large pipe led into it from the W, neatly plastered into a small fluted column drum of white marble which had been hollowed out to function as a stop-cock. From this a lead pipe entered the tank, just above the level of its floor. Since the tank was at an upper level and shallow, and the water in it could be cut off in order to allow it to stand, it was probably intended to contain warm water for the Villa, heated by the sun. In holes to the E of this one we found (a) a late N-S wall abutting the southern E-W wall of the Villa, and (b) farther E, a pit with fine HL pottery (information from Jonas Eiring) and, at the lowest level reached, what might possibly be a M level. Kommos. J. Shaw (ASCS) reports on the 1994 (19th) excava- tion season at the coastal site of Kommos (ADelt, 712-15, cov- ered in AR 1994-95, 61-3). Joseph and Maria Shaw also report on the 24th season (1999): 'During the past year considerable progress was made in our ongoing efforts to make the results of the discoveries of 1976- 1985 and 1991-1994 available to the public through publica- tion. During the academic year our major effort was to finish volume IV, The Greek Sanctuary, a project involving more than twenty authors, and one that has been in preparation for over a decade. The book deals with the history of a rural sanctuary which lasted from ca 1020 BC to ca 250 AD. Chapter 1 (Joseph Shaw) deals with the architecture and stratigraphy of the three superposed temples, as well as with the altars and the auxiliary buildings. Chapter 2 (Peter Callaghan, Alan Johnston, Patricia Bikai and John Hayes) presents and analyses the stratified pot- tery, much of it used for dining during festivals, found inside and outside the various structures. The periods represented are SM through R, a sequence found only rarely in the same limit- ed area. Chapter 3 (Eric Csapo and Daniel Geagan) records and interprets the numerous graffiti (some of the earliest from IA Greece) and later inscriptions. Chapter 4 (Maria C. Shaw) sur- veys and discusses the many bronze, faience and terracotta fig- urines dedicated in the sanctuary during the thousand years it functioned as a religious center. Chapter 5 covers the miscella- neous finds: the lamps (John Hayes), coins (Alan Walker), loomweights and jewellery (Mary Dabney), scarabs (Nancy J. Skon-Jedele), furnishings, tools, weapons and nails (Joseph Shaw) and implements and bronze vessels (Kathy Swab). Chapter 6 presents the numerous fauna, with a special focus on animal sacrifice (David Reese) and the fish remains and fishing (Mark Rose). Chapter 7 (Thomas and Jennifer Shay) reports on the flora. Final Chapter 8 (Joseph Shaw) discusses evidence for ritual in the sanctuary, places the temples in historical perspec- tive, and discusses questions of the deities worshipped and the ancient name of the site. A second publication that is also emerging as an Hesperia supplement is A LM IA Ceramic Kiln in South-central Crete: Function and Pottery Production. It consists of three parts: first discussed is the kiln's construction and use (Joseph Shaw), then the typological analysis of the associated pottery (Aleydis Van de Moortel), after which come the analyses of the clay and pos- sible firing procedures (Peter Day and Vassilis Kilikoglou). The kiln is unique in Crete since so much of the pottery produced in it was found within and around it. Fieldwork and the preparation of texts for our next volume (V), The Minoan Civic buildings, continued. The volume attempts to elicit the character and development of the enor- mous structures S of the E-W paved road that separates houses from civic buildings. There are three such successive buildings, largely superposed upon each other: protopalatial (MM IIB) building AA, built on a huge platform with a central court and flanking stoa(s) at its core; neopalatial building T, also with central court, colonnaded stoas, and extensive rooms for stor- age; and, on the upper level, Postpalatial buildings P and N, the former of which may have served to house ships of a Minoan fleet. In this volume there will be five chapters, of which the first (Joseph Shaw) almost complete, details the architecture. Chapter 2 (Maria Shaw) is on the plasters, both those with painted patterns and those used in construction, as well as plas- ter objects, such as tables of offering. Alain Dandreau (Sorbonne) has completed a scientific analysis of samples of plaster and pigments, and he and Maria Shaw will be collabo- rating in a series of studies to be published in Volume V and in scientific periodicals. Chapter 3 is divided into two sections: the first (Aleydis Van de Moortel) deals with protopalatial pottery, the second (Jeremy Rutter) with pottery from neo- and Postpalatial con- texts. AA appears to have gone out of use at the same time that the Old Palace at Phaistos was destroyed by earthquake at the end of MM IIB. For the neo- and post-palatial periods, 79 pot- tery groups have been ordered stratigraphically and stylistically in order to chart the relative periods during which various areas were in use. The study, using the unique stratigraphy at Kommos, has for the first time distinguished the many foreign ceramic imports to Kommos during their two respective peri- ods. Adding to those already known last year from AA are many recently identified, including large and small containers, as well as open shapes, from Cyprus. Chapter 4 deals with miscella- neous finds (Joseph Shaw, Maria Shaw, Deborah Ruscillo) such as bronzes (also the evidence for metal working), loomweights (and weaving), ornaments, stone implements and tools, terra- cotta sculpture and fauna. The final Chapter 5, the writing of which awaits the completion of the other chapters, will deal with such substantive matters as the function(s) of the buildings and the nature and significance of the international trade at the site. Thanks to the help and collaboration of our Italian col- leagues Enzo La Rosa and Filippo Carinci, it will also incorpo- rate a chart correlating developments at Kommos with those established by those scholars at Aghia Triada and Phaistos. The next phase of publication is already under way, namely the publication of house X, situated just N of the E-W road mentioned above. The house is one of the better appointed ones on the site, and with many stratified floors and pottery, as well as local and imported ceramics, frescos, and bronzes. Another unusual feature is the house shrine. Maria Shaw and Jeremy Rutter, respectively, will study the architecture and pottery for the volume, which may emerge in the Aegaeum series. Over the past year members of staff have been active in other communications about Kommos. Maria Shaw has submit- ted her publication about actual and depicted M/Myc pier con- struction. Joseph Shaw has contributed a study of certain bases and piers suggesting that they are exclusively neopalatial and, therefore, can serve as dating criteria. The two Shaws also pre- sented a joint talk on the Greek Sanctuary to the AIA Washington Society. Joseph Shaw's review of international contacts and trade at Kommos has now been published in the acts of the recent conference at Rethymnon (eds. N. Stambolides and A. Karetsou).

Chamber tombs, tombs in natu- ral cavities and the small tholos tomb contained burials and pithos burials. Tomb VII produced evidence for cult practices in honour of the dead: libations practised on top of a natural cavi- ty, which contained a pithos burial. The tombs contained 71 vessels, gold, silver and bronze rings, pins, fibulae, necklace beads, fragments of iron spits and KpEdcypas, proving that funerary meals were practised.

Serpetsidaki reports on the important discoveries at a pit cave tomb located 5km SE of Profitis Elias (Kanli Kasteli) on the road towards Kyparissi. The cave was semi-circular in shape with three shallow cavities. Its entrance was towards the W whereas towards the SW the lower part of a substantial wall was found. The tomb was used during the pre-palatial and old palace periods (EM IIB, EM III, MM IA-early MM IB). The cave and surrounding terrain were much destroyed by extensive stone quarrying, as a result of which most finds including ample skeletal remains, sarcophagus frag- ments, burial pithoi, pottery, sherds and stones were collected during soil sieving. Only a small section of the cave along its E side was left undisturbed. It contained only a few human but plenty of animal bones together with traces of burned soil. Amongst the most important finds collected were the following: five Cyc figurines, one of the Agios Onoufrios, the remaining of the Koumasa type, plus two clay figurines; 13 ivory, three bone and three steatite sealstones mainly cylindrical but also conical, pyramidal, prisms and one button-shaped mainly decorated with linear motifs but four depicting animals such as deer, scor- pion and lion; 17 necklaces, 23 beads, two stone vessels, obsid- ian blades and worked pieces of animal bone and finally only one metal object, probably belonging to a necklace. Sixty vases, such as conical cups, egg-cups, monochrome semi-spherical cups and jugs were collected, most of them dating to EM III and in a good state of preservation. A smaller group of mainly light- on-dark and polychrome pottery date to MM IA-early MM IB. Noticeable finds are a jug with a ram-shaped attachment, a ker- nos type vessel composed of three communicating vessels and a bird-shaped tripod EM II white ware vessel. One small and two large sarcophagi and one flat pithos lid are also reported. (ADelt, 700-1) Lenda (anc. Lebena). Asklepieion. S.

They continued the strati- graphical study of the outer parts of the area, extend- ing it to the N, NE and NW, established the chronol- 1: ogy of occupation of these areas and confirmed that they were used as a depository after the first destruc- tion of the building. Three sherds had Linear B inscriptions. 200. Mall After an examination of the rooms in the E wing they were able to restore vases that were being studied and mend vases from dispersed fragments, bringing the total to over 450, the most important LM III assemblage in Crete. After studying the rooms to the N they were able to confirm the architectural analysis which suggests they were probably added in the second phase. A fourth stirrup jar with a Linear B inscription was found in room X13. B. Hallager examined the pottery from the latest phase in the Nu area and suggested (by comparison with material from Chania) that the latest occupation was LM IIIB or LM IIIB2 and not LM IIIC. The catalogue of whole vases carried out since 1993 by I. Touravitou was completely reviewed and corrected with a view to final publication. C. Knappett took samples from complete vases for petro- graphic analysis at the Fitch Laboratory (BSA) in order to deter- mine where they were manufactured. A study of the methods of pottery production was started and an analysis will be made of the inclusions and their quantities, to establish what character- istics in the clay create a suitable substance for pottery. The material in the Agios Nikolaos museum coming from Area Nu was studied, drawn and photographed by D. Evely. The archi- tectural description of the E, W and S wings was completed and recorded on computer. A. Sarpaki and D. Mylona of the Institute of Mediterranean Studies in Rhethymno studied soil samples (separating bone, fishbone, grains, etc.) and identified the oldest known Greek example of a silkworm cocoon. Building Kappa Beta (hypostyle crypt). Alvaro Allegrette (French School) carried out the cleaning of building Kappa Beta, comprising the group of magazines, the space S of the 'gate of the magazines' and the S part of the 'street of the sea'. In the 'street of the sea', two superimposed alignments of sandstone (ammouda) slabs showed that this street had two phases. The orientation of the second phase is not the same as that of the magazines (Figs. 200-02). The cleaning made it pos- sible to pinpoint the extent of the Van Effenterre excavations and to reveal two curved steps set into the supporting walls of the W court of the palace. Postholes and other evidence indicated that there were no stone divisions between shops M1 and M2. On the N wall of M3 some fragments of reddish plaster were found in situ. NE edge of the palace.

Also the E end of street 64, which abutted the porch with three columns (61, 62 and 63) marking the NE entrance to the palace, can be confirmed (Fig. 204). The central part of street 64 is covered by slabs of yellowish sand- stone (Fig. 205) arranged on two distinctly different axes. Malia plain survey. Sylvie Miiller Celka and a team from the French School set out to complete the topographical record of sites and to study the objects collected in the surface survey carried out in 1996. They report that they were unable to com- plete their programme because of the problems caused by the areas of public and private construction in the area. The nation- al road planned to by-pass the village of Malia is scheduled to cross several archaeological sites discovered by the survey or long known: Alonaki, already partly encroached on by the ter- racing works to the SE of Malia; Darmaros, a planned junction on the road; and the Frangantoni cave about 500m S of the mod. village, a site of great archaeological interest (cf. P. Faure, BCH 80 (1956); 100 (1994); Lafonction des Cavernes cretois- es (1996) 60). The access corridor and vaulted entrance of this cave were carefully finished (Fig. 206) as well as a natural opening in the roof of the main chamber. In the chamber a raised platform backs onto the S wall, and walls of small cut blocks (Fig. 207) appear in an old trench at the foot of a natural pillar joining the floor to the ceiling. The surface sherds belong to the LR period, consistent with a coin of Constantine once found by an inhabitant of Malia. The vault, now very low, prob- ably originally allowed for a man standing, which suggests an archaeological fill of 1-1.5m.

The Ephorate of Spelaeology was able to complete the work with specialized equipment in October. If the cave is to be dam- aged or destroyed in the path of the road a rescue excavation is essential. The industrial area at the SW foot of Prophetes Elias hill is being expanded. Existing construction does not threaten any sites discovered in the survey, but at Limnia just to the SE, some stones marked with red paint indicate a planned road. Here there is an important building of the M and R period (No. 20 on the plan in BCH 120/2 (1996) 923, fig. 2). Photographs and schematic records of the surface remains were made. The construction of a marina in the old fishing port has led to the almost complete disappearance of the dunary sandstone (ammouda) quarry of Hagio Pnevma, in spite of the warnings of 1995 (BCH 116/2 (1992) 752 and fig. 44) and the interven- tion of the 24th Ephorate, which authorized the work provided that archaeological remains were respected. The team recorded the remaining visible traces of where blocks had been removed (Fig. 208). At the E end of the plot another, smaller quarry no longer exists. This had led to a programme of systematic recording of all the dunary sandstone quarries discovered in the 1995-1996 surveys. In the bay of Hagia Varvara, damage by the erosion of the shore through modification of the sea-bed in the construction of a hotel was pointed out in 1995 (BCH 120/2 (1996) 927-8). Since then the coastline has been worn away by more than im, forming a vertical face showing a complete stratigraphy of the three periods of the BA (Fig. 209). The passage of hotel visitors has also done damage, with the LM III layer disappearing, and a layer of pumice with LM IA vases sticking out of it being gradually destroyed. There is a network of walls on the level ground between the shore and the chapel of Hagia Varvara (Fig. 210) on a different orientation from those recorded in 1998 (BCH 114/2 (1990) 927 fig. 27, walls 19, 20 &amp; 21). Various facilities illegally constructed (swimming pool, open air theatre,</page><page sequence="136">138 DAVID BLACKMAN 208. Hagio Pneuvma quarry 209. Hagia Varvara bay, shore erosion handball court, and stone ornaments) on ruins of the historical period, and plans for further extensions, have all been complet- ed despite complaints from the 24th Ephorate. Tourists have also worn away the soil to expose walls W of the open air theatre, in particular the monolithic threshold of the 'House of the Fishermen' (Etudes Cretoises IX (1953) 10-11). The damage was photographed and a LM IA cup was removed from the layer of pumice (Fig. 211) as a precaution. The relationship of the site of Malia and the sea has not been fully researched and the bay of Hagia Varvara offers the only natural harbour and the only harbour settlement in the area, and one stratified from EM times. It is therefore a site of great archaeological importance. As regards the study of finds: the lithic tools (with the exception of the obsidian) were classified and catalogued. The ceramic material of the marsh area (central island and E edge) was studied with a view to contributing to the geomorphologi- cal study of that area by R. Dalongeville and his team. This area seems to have been occupied from the end of EM to LM IIIB and then again in the LR period (4th -5th Ct). The nature of the material is not such as to permit a conclusion as to whether there was continuous M occupation. It was an integral part of the palace city which extended to the W along the shore probably as far as the hotel 'Phedra' beyond the quarry of dunary sandstone on the promontory of the Mill. P. Petrides examined the ceram- ic material of the historical period and confirmed a gap in the occupation of the plain between the 6th and 13th Cts AD. The topographical record of the sites is complete and a cata- logue in card form has been reorganized and completed. A pro- 210. Hagia Varvara bay, walls 211.

Part of a large old palace period building (MM IB-IIA) was discovered. A foundation deposit produced fine quality pot- tery, bell-shaped figurines and goat horns. Sections of neo-pala- tial (MM III-LM IA) and post-palatial (LM IIIA2-B) buildings were also exposed. Pre-palatial levels were also found. Two rock-cut tombs, which belong to the neo-palatial ceme- tery of the PR town, were excavated. Within the first most of the skeletal remains belong to the LR re-use of the tomb. The sec- ond tomb had been robbed. (Epyov YT7T70 2, 144-5) Odos Poseidonos and Leophoros Ikarou. N. Demopoulou reports on the discovery of two large pit cave tombs. The coastal settlement of Poros was the main port for Knossos. The tombs discovered date to MM III-LM I and form part of the well-organized cemetery consisting (up to 1994) of a total of six tombs, which have produced important evidence for neo-pala- tial burial practices in the immediate vicinity of Knossos. The tomb located at Odos Poseidonos had an ante-chamber and two main chambers divided into compartments by different surfaces and walls. The roof was supported by a pillar located between the ante- and main chambers. In a central part of the tomb, between the ante- and main chambers, a large pit was cut into bedrock, which was used as a repository for earlier burials. The entrance path, which was cut into bedrock, sloped down- wards and ended at a blocked entrance. :a, breakwater Although the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, when its entrance path was used as a rubbish dump, hundreds of finds were collected. Despite the ample skeletal remains, parts of only seven skeletons and 12 skulls could be clearly defined. Small finds include the following: one imported scarab and 14 first-class sealstones, mainly made out of semi-precious stones, depicting animals, birds, griffins and female figures. Amongst the jewellery that the robbers left behind are: a gold ring with a plain circular bezel, one pair of gold and two pairs of silver ear- rings, silver, bronze and ivory pins, beads made out of gold, sard, rock crystal, glass paste and faience. Some small gold beads were made to imitate the shape of an altar. Other finds include a small ivory head belonging to a male figurine, a bro- ken ivory comb, a miniature vessel in faience and a decorative plaque shaped like a figure-of-eight shield. Only a few bronze objects were found, since these were the main objective of the tomb-robbers. The bronze fragments sup- port the argument for 'warrior burials' and 'burials with bronzes' practiced in LM IA. Finds include a bronze knife, the handle of a sword, nails belonging to wooden biers, spear-heads and a bronze attachment in the shape of a figure-of-eight shield. A series of pierced boar's tusks formed part of a boar's tusk hel- met, an important early example of its type. Traces of painted plaster suggest that some wooden biers were plaster-coated. A series of unbaked bricks with traces of wooden beams suggests that a raised platform was specially designed to receive important burials. There is no evidence to indicate that the platform was used for ritual practices, i.e. an altar. On the contrary, amongst the disintegrated mud bricks, bone fragments, jewellery, sealstones and other evidence in support of a 'warrior burial' were found. Over 90 vases, most of them plain cups, prove the extent to which the tomb was robbed in modem times. According to the</page><page sequence="138">140 DAVID BLACKMAN 213. Poros, MM IIB vase 214. Poros, MM IIIA vase -&gt; q preserved pottery the main use of the tomb dates to the neo- palatial period (MM IIIB-LM IA). Post-palatial sherds (LM IIIA2-B) located at the tomb's entrance are not to be associated with a later burial practice. The tomb, which was found intact, has been preserved and can be approached through the base- ment of the A. Tsilimpari building. The tomb discovered on Leophoros Ikarou lies 50m S of the tomb on Odos Poseidonos and is of a similar type to the remaining five excavated tombs of the cemetery: a rock-cut pit cave consisting of a raised ante-chamber and three consecutive chambers set on different levels. In one part of the ante-cham- ber a carved pillar, which supported the roof, was abutted by circular walls, and the spaces behind served as repositories for the collected remains from earlier burials. Characteristic of the tomb's excellent state of preservation are the dense traces of the M workmen's finger imprints on the mud-coated walls of this area. The burials and the removed remains of earlier interments together with the plentiful pottery and small finds gave the impression that the tomb had not been robbed. The tomb had, however, been partially robbed during the post-palatial period, when the small ante-chamber became used as a rubbish dump. The number and quality of the finds suggest that the tomb was, however, not systematically looted. The tomb was in full use from the old palace period (MM IIB) but was probably then smaller in size and more simple in design. During the neo-palatial period (MM IIIB-LM IA) the tomb acquired its final form. Most burials date to this period although the latest date to an advanced stage ofLM IB. Some good-qual- ity LM II vases were deposited in the ante-chamber but they do not seem to have been related to the burials. The tomb was used for a large number of burials, which were initially deposited on funerary biers, beds or litters. Only five burials were preserved in situ, but 27 more skulls were retrieved. The most important of all 700 small finds is undoubtedly the exquisite and excellently preserved gold signet ring, depicting a reli- gious scene: the central scene depicts a figure standing on a pedestal but other sectors depict a tree cult scene, a seated female fig- ure, a smaller 'epiphany' goddess, sacred symbols, birds and flowers. The signet ring is associated with a burial dating to the LM IB period. Jewellery from the tomb includes the following: two more silver signet rings, a gold ring, a bronze ring, leaves of gold, possibly sewn onto the funerary garment, four pairs of silver and two pairs of bronze earrings and a silver pin. Over 300 beads formed parts of necklaces, made out of a variety of materials such as gold, amethyst, sard, rock crystal, blue paste, faience and glass. Amongst the gold _H ¢¢w| beads some are made in the shape of ivy leaves, whereas other jewellery is of previously unknown types. Six sealstones carved out of semi-pre- cious stones such as amethyst, sard, agate and crystal depict the follow- ing scenes: a feline set in vegeta- tion, a bull, a bird and various dec- orative motifs. A small agate cylinder depicts a dolphin. Carbonized olives and seeds, in addition to the bones of a small animal (possibly a reptile kept in a vase), will contribute towards our understanding of M burial practices. Over 500 complete vases were collected, including many decorated, which belong to all periods associated with the tomb's use: MM IIB (Fig. 213), MM IIIA (Fig. 214), MM IIIB-LM IA, LM IA, LM IB and LM II. The most common types of vessels are jugs, cups, lamps and incense burners, strainers and double vases. A series of 150 MM IIB vases together with some MM III-LM IA were found in the pit in a layer of burned earth and fragmentary bones. A group of MM IIB with polychrome Kamares style pot- tery includes specimens with obvious Phaistos stylistic paral- lels. The earliest vessel, an MM IB jug, comes from E Crete and was probably an heirloom by the time it was deposited within the tomb. Amongst the post-palatial pottery deposited in the small ante-chamber was a Canaanite amphora, loom-weights, fragmentary bellows from bronze smelting, pounders and pol- ishing stones, worked pumice, possibly for fishermen's nets, and fragmentary vases.

Mandalaki reports on the excavation conducted within the village of Tsoutsouros, next to the beach, where 4th - 2nd Ct BC graves were excavated. The total number of graves rises to 107, built tombs and hut-shaped tombs usually containing one burial. Most graves face W-E, and burials were accompanied by clay vases including lamps. The necks of broken amphoras were positioned together with the tomb cover-stones and were used in some ritual that involved pouring libations to the dead. In three adult graves egg-shells were found. Three graves were equipped with a small peribolos built out of pebbles, limestone blocks and plaster. The large number of child burials suggest a high mortality rate.

This book includes the geolo- gy, toponymy, land use, and other studies dealing with the region in general. A preliminary report has now appeared in Hesperia (68.3, 343-70). Significant progress was made in several areas. Approximately half of the pottery from the two locations at the site has now been studied in preparation for publication; it ranges from FN to Ott, with all periods from EM I to LM III represented, a testament to the long use of this area. The most important periods are EM III for the metallurgy site, when the tiny workshop was engaged in smelting copper, and LM I-LM III for the nearby habitation site. Particularly important this season was the continued study of the furnace fragments, which resulted in a better understanding of the design of the furnaces. These fragmentary furnaces were made of coarse clay and were apparently in use from the FN period until EM III. Several alternatives for the restoration of the furnaces are now being discussed, with the most likely being a simple bowl-fumace with a clay chimney over it.' os, N necropolis Ierapetra.

Didier Viviers and his team from the French School carried out a study season in 1999 on the material discovered in previ- ous campaigns. They also continued excavations on the N necropolis which were begun in 1950 and resumed in 1996 and 1997, and conducted a field survey of the area. Study of the pottery and coins helped to date the various pot- tery groups and to distinguish pottery imported from other Gr cities (Eleuthema, Knossos, etc.) and from workshops outside the island (Attika, Corinth, Cnidus, etc.). N necropolis: what was labelled 'large tomb' in 1950, was subsequently discovered to be part of a vast necropolis, densely used between LG and the end of the HL period but not extending to the W (Fig. 215: from the N; Fig. 216: from the SW; Fig. 217). The 1950 excavations were taken down further to reveal several new burials (essentially HL) and, in the area to the W, the traces of a building of the 7th Ct BC, abandoned at the beginning of the 5th Ct after at least one major rebuilding phase. The ruins were then re-used with an altar built against the base of the A walls, basic drains built to remove the water probably contained in basins and a burial in the most easterly room of the building. Finally, field survey was carried out in three ways: GPS recording of several sites (Kastelas, Toplou, Soros, Petrokopio, Stephanes...); cleaning and a topographical study of a number of structures with selective surface sherding (Petrokopio, Stephanes...); and the investigation of new sites or sites identi- fied from aerial photographs (notably in the Pithos valley, at Soros, Alatopatela, Atsikiari and Stephanes).</page><page sequence="140">142 DAVID BLACKMAN 216. Itanos, N necropolis Kavousi. Geraldine C. Gesell (ASCS) reports on the 1999 study season: 'The emphasis was on drawing and photography of the artefacts restored in the 1998 season, and the study of the stratigraphy of the sites at Kastro and Vronda. In particular, all the material from the Vronda settlement and graves has been studied once and also much of that studied in the earlier seasons has been restudied in the light of conclusions based on the total study. Study of the Vronda shrine material also pro- gressed. All reasonable restorations had been com- pleted in 1998. What remained was the photography and drawing of the goddesses and their equipment. This continued during the 1999 season. Work on the catalogue followed the drawing and photography as i ..: closely as possible. Work on the materials from the Kastro site, which ^^ has much more complex stratigraphy, is less com- plete. However, more than 15 deposits of pottery studied in the early seasons were re-checked and over 1200 new catalogue entries were completed. The results of this pottery study are leading to a new interpreta- tion of the SM and EPG styles of pottery of E Crete, which are the key to the transition point between the LBA and EIA. Scientific analysis of the material continued. Peter Day, the petrologist, who is studying the clays for source and firing tem- peratures, has completed his testing and is writing up his chap- ters to be included in each volume. Lynn Snyder, the zooar- chaeologist, received all the Vronda contexts and after discus- sions decided on which were the most important for study this winter. The remaining specialists also received the Vronda con- texts so that they could begin the interpretive part of their work. In October 1998 a display of shrine objects was set up in the Ierapetra Museum. This summer arrangements were made for the preparation of three more displays, including the terracotta window frame from building B at Vronda and a selection of sherds from the Kastro, illustrating all periods of inhabitation from the 12th to the 7th Cts. The third display would be a recon- struction of one of the Vronda cremation burials.' Kera Pediados. Sidirokephala-Stavros. Th.

The tomb, which was partly destroyed during stone quarrying, belongs to the Karphi type: rectangular on its exterior and circular in the interior. Its floor was paved with rectangular slabs and pre- served for 1.50m in width. Four plain LM IIIC vessels were dis- covered on the floor. The single burial was accompanied by a small gold ring. Trial trenches did not reveal any additional tombs. The tomb is located in the vicinity of the Sidirokephala hill, known for its LM IIIC settlement.

Pal which form part of a previously known G cemetery. Tomb 13 was a pithos burial but the single interment was not accompanied by any finds. Tomb 14 was a cist burial, which had been robbed. Both tombs were consolidated. (ADelt, 749- 50) Megalos Lakkos. K. Kontopodi and G. Perisunaki fields. S. Apostolakou reports on the discovery of sherds, including pithos fragments depicting centaurs and Pegasus in relief. Sherds derive from tombs, destroyed during ploughing. In the same area a small rectangular building was located and explored, revealing domestic pottery and bones. (ADelt, 750) Mochlos. J. Soles and K. Davaras report on the 1999 season: 'We spent the 1999 field season conserving and studying finds from the excavations carried out in 1989-1994, and preparing two of the five projected volumes publishing results from these excavations: Vol. III, Mochlos Period IV: The Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetary and Vol. II, Part 2, Mochlos Period III: Neopalatial Settlement on the Island, Houses in Blocks A, C and D. We also initiated a number of sci- entific investigations, including the lead isotope analysis of all copper ingot fragments from the excavation, and the archaeo- magnetic dating of fired mud-brick and clay in situ. In consul- tation with the ephor, Mr Papadakis, we also carried out some cleaning on the site and created a tourist route through it.' Neapoli Merabellou. Moni Koufis Petras, Agia Photia site. Th. Eliopoulos reports on the discovery of a substantial postM wall, 5m long and 2m high in sections. Other walls are visible in the immediate vicinity. Wall masonry is similar to that found at nearby Dreros. At a lower level and within a rock cutting a collapsed Ch sanctuary was located. (ADelt, 750) Palaikastro. L. H. Sackett and J. A. MacGillivray (BSA) co- directed a further study season. Environmental studies (A. Sarpaki and D. Mylonas) continue at the Institute of Mediterranean Studies, Rethymno; two conservators have made much progress in mending, and restoring to a high standard, vases from the LM IB wells dug in 1994. The 'Palaikastro Kouros' volume has been completed for publication, and work continues towards the publication of the LM IB wells and Buildings 1 and 5. Teams from two universities started coordinated pro- grammes of geological and geophysical survey in the area of aikastro, early map Palaikastro, under the aegis of the BSA. The first team was led by Dr F. W. McCoy (University of Hawaii) who reports: 'Geophysical surveys used electromagnetic inductance tech- niques within and in the environs of the site. Results showed that this technique works well through the alluvial sediments of Palaikastro, an improvement over ground-penetrating radar techniques used previously. Surveys over reburied portions of the site imaged walls shown in early maps (Fig. 218). Surveys elsewhere found additional buried walls, buried extensions of various types of bedrock, some with possible cuts suggestive of road passages, and indications of the former riverbed buried beneath the playa area. Subsurface sampling by augering devel- oped a preliminary geological stratigraphy in the playa that sup- ports the presence here of a river outlet to the sea. Future sur- veys with geophysical equipment with deeper imaging capabil- ity, and trenching to develop better and date the geological stratigraphy of the playa area are planned for this summer. Geological surveys continue in mapping bedrock as a foun- dation for depicting the LBA landscape. Stratigraphic criteria from the playa are designed to understand sea level position in the LBA here at Palaikastro. Coupled with this effort will be off- shore surveys of water depth and bottom types, again critical to mapping the LBA landscape. Additional geological surveys have started in the quarries at Ta Skaria. A manuscript is in preparation for the BSA Annual on Santorini ash found at the site. Remote sensing surveys were an attempt to see if hyper- spectral imaging techniques using CCD cameras might be a viable technique for detecting buried structures. Cameras were suspended at low elevations of about 50m from a kite, images were collected at visible (red, yellow) to near infrared wave lengths, with signals transmitted via a coaxial cable to the ground for recording. Excellent and detailed images were obtained and are being studied. Problems with kites, wave- length constraints, and need for better ground-truthing, dictate modifications for the 2000 season.' The Monash University team led by Dr &amp; Mrs J. Peterson undertook the first stages of the work involved in determining the topography of the area surrounding the LBA settlement at Roussolakkos, preparatory to constructing a computer-based reconstruction of that landscape. They report: 'Cores were taken from two sites at Palaikastro, one from the 'playa' behind the sand dunes of Chiona beach, and the other in the marsh area NW of Kastri. Dr F. McCoy is currently examin- ing these cores. Results of 1999 fieldwork suggest, first, that</page><page sequence="142">144 DAVID BLACKMAN 219. Palaikastro, topograhy shoreline retreat has been the rule during the last 3-4 millennia and that the search for remnants of ancient harbour works must include off-shore as well as near-shore areas; and second, that Minoan quarrying (the formation of 'Red Pit Valley') has mod- ified the topography and water tables of the area surrounding the excavation site of Roussolakkos. As a result we can argue that, first, the coastline (which entails Chiona Beach, the Promontory and East Beach, and houses an extensive LM I-III settlement) and the back-barrier deposits, may hold clues to the whereabouts of the Minoan har- bour postulated by MacGillivray &amp; Sackett in 1992; and sec- ond, that 'Red Pit Valley' (located SE of the settlement of Roussolakkos) is a quarry rather than a natural valley because of its geomorphologically anomalous orientation, and 'erosion history' as seen in the outcrops of truncated cemented scree cir- cumscribing its steepest slopes (Fig. 219). Survey work (EDM) aimed at linking the Roussolakkos excavation site plan to the Greek topographic map was under- taken, and archival research at the library of the BSA led to the copying of all available historical maps of the Palaikastro area. These maps and plans are currently being converted to digital format and included in the digital spatial database. Where pos- sible, the maps/plans are also being converted to a common coordinate system (UTM). Terrain reconstruction (DTM) in ARCINFO will be completed early in 2000, &amp; this will allow (among other things) modelling of quarry growth and concomi- tant water table modification, the latter having implications for the selection of ancient water well sites.' Petras. Sitias. M. Tsipopoulou's earlier excavations (ADelt, 741-46) were reported in AR 1997-98, 119, referring to Kritiki Estia 5 (1994/5) 344-58. She now reports on the 11th (1995) and 12th (1996) excavation seasons at Petras. On the flattened hilltop: a series of 10 stratigraphical soundings produced evidence for earlier neo-palatial occupa- tion phases on site, and clarified the architectural phases of this large building. Preliminary results suggest that EM IIB habita- tion extends throughout the area of the later palatial building. MM IA floor levels produced high quality pottery imported from the Ierapetra isthmus area. The first core of the palatial building dates to MM IB-IIA. Within the 6th and 7th narrow spaces located S of the N entrance to the neo-palatial building, excavation of the LM IA destruction deposit continued. Within an area 4 x 2m, which had strong traces of burning, at least 400 vases were discovered: cups of different shapes, plain and decorated, closed shape and domestic ves- sels, as well as stone tools and many painted plaster fragments. This LM IA destruction deposit has pro- duced so far a total of 850 vessels from all three excavation seasons. The discovery of an MM IIB hieroglyphic archive deposit raises to four the total number in Crete. The Petras archive is the first to derive from a sealed deposit. It had fallen from the upper floor, within the NW entrance, onto a yellowish earthen floor. The deposit was severely burned and was accompanied by complete and broken pottery. Preliminary study of the associated pottery suggests strong parallels with contemporary Goumia, Malia and Myrtos Pyrgos. The hieroglyphic deposit contained unfin- ished tablets, indicating that the archive was func- tioning at the moment of destruction. Its discovery shows that Petras was an administrative centre dur- ing the old palace period and thus maintained its important posi- tion during the neo-palatial period. The new texts have also added a new symbol to the hieroglyphic syllabary. The N entrance to the palatial building, blocked after the MM IIB destructions, was discovered after the removal of a mod. electricity pole. The two 12th-Ct AD tombs excavated in the area of the pala- tial building raise the total number of Byz tombs to 33. Traces of cloth were preserved on a bronze fastener. EM installations at the NE comer of the flattened hilltop were investigated: a third room further to the W had a square cistern installation. Interesting Vasiliki ware and 120 obsidian pieces, mainly blades, were discovered. Settlement, sector III: excavation continued to the W of house 1. Late pre-palatial and early old palace period high-qual- ity pottery was found in pits. Numerous clay weights, stone tools, fragments of stone vases and obsidian blades were also found. Sections of neo-palatial houses (sector B2) were found to contain pottery deposits in situ. In one of these houses an MM IB-IIA pit also produced pottery of the highest quality, including a tall-footed kemos. In sector B3 a stamped pithos handle was discovered. The impression was made by an old palace type sealstone depicting two lions positioned antitheti- cally (Fig. 220). Large stones, located W of the neo-palatial houses, could have supported the roadway leading to the palatial building. LM IIIA2 walls were found in different sectors together with inter- esting finds such as fragments of animal figurines. The LM III finds provide the first solid evidence of extensive post-palatial occupation at Petras. In sectors I and II, the two-storied neo-palatial houses were founded during this period, or on earlier old-palace clusters; they were destroyed in LM IA (sector I) or in LM IB (sector II) and were never re-occupied. On the contrary, in sector III exten- sive building activities date to MM IB-II, LM IA and LM IIIA, with each phase causing serious damage to the pre-existing structures. Architectural remains dating to MM IB-II are the least well preserved; however, deep contemporary deposits define a very specific event in the history of Petras: levelling out the hill-top for the subsequent foundation of the palatial building. The MM IB-IIA pottery and other finds provide a ter- minus post quem for the foundation of the palatial building and the old-palace period buildings in sector III.</page><page sequence="143">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 145 220. Petras (Sitias) pithos stamp MM I-IIA pits found in sectors A3 and A4 produced exqui- site pottery, including imports from the Mirabello area, which had been broken before their deposition in the pit. This deposit will become a reference point for the pottery styles of E Crete and will define the relationship which Petras had with other important contemporary sites. Most walls and associated earth floors in sector III date to LM IA, which often produced complete vases in situ. During the LM IIIA re-occupation, LM IA walls, preserved after the LM IA destructions, were re-used. The large boulders described above could be associated with this phase. (Kritiki Estia 7, 298-310) Praisos. J. Whitley reports on the 1999 study season: 'The season was primarily devoted to study of the finds picked up in the 1998 fieldwalking season. Most (though not all) finds from the 1998 and 1993 seasons were described, cat- alogued, entered on to our Paradox database, drawn and pho- tographed. Our endeavors were greatly helped by the assistance of Mr Brice Erickson and Dr Natalia Vogeikoff, both of the ASCS. Mr Erickson was able to assign much of our finewares from site 14 (Prophitis Ilias) to three phases: a LA phase (131 sherds, dating to between 525 and 500 BC); a 5th-Ct phase (3 sherds); and a 4th-Ct phase (40 or so sherds). Dr Vogeikoff, however, was unable to identify any HL pottery either from the sherds strewn this year or from a sample from Praisos. It seems then that most of our 'bg' sherds are of either 5th- or 4th-Ct date. This raises the interesting possibility that Praisos had ceased to be a town by the time of its destruction in ca 140 BC, and may have simply served as a political centre for the ports of Trypetos and Ambelos. The assistance of Mr Erickson and Dr Vogeikoff has enabled us to create a reference collection of datable A and C sherds, which should, in future years, enable us precisely to date the surface finds from Praisos itself.' Pseira. Philip Betancourt (ASCS) reports on the publication schedule for the Pseira Project: 'The Pseira Project was an American-Greek synergasia directed by Philip Betancourt and Costis Davaras. After a year of preliminary work in 1984, excavations began in 1985, and field work was completed in 1992. Study seasons with the material in Crete were conducted at the same time as the exca- vation, and continued until 1995. No field work has been con- ducted since that time. Twelve volumes are planned as the definitive publication for Pseira, in addition to publications on specialized aspects of the excavation. Most volumes will be multi-authored. The original publication plan called for the completion of approximately one volume every two years, as the University of Pennsylvania Museum Press suggested this was what would fit with their other publication commitments. Volumes have been turned in more quickly than this, and they await the publication schedule of the press. The following three volumes have been published: P. Betancourt and Costis Davaras, eds, Pseira I. Buildings at the West Side of area A (1995); Pseira II. The "Shrine" and other Buildings on the East Side of Area A (1996); Pseira III. The Plateia Building, by C.R. Floyd (1998). Pseira IV(Area B) and Pseira V (The Architecture of Pseira) are completed and in press. All other volumes are in progress. Schinia, Merabellou Lasithiou. Profitis Elias and Lenika sites. Two M installations were recorded. S. Apostolakou reports that the sites were declared a unified archaeological site. (ADelt, 752) Schisma Eloundas. D. Cheirakis plot. S. Apostolakou reports the discovery of two robbed shaft graves, which follow a NE- SW orientation. Offerings were sparse but included pottery dat- ing to the end of the 4th/beginning of 3rd Ct BC. These tombs form part of the cemetery of ancient Elounda reported in previ- ous ADelt, from 1983. (ADelt, 749) Traostalos. Zakros. S. Chrysoulaki reports on the 1995 exca- vation season at the peak sanctuary of Traostalos. A total of 720m2 was explored, and the W part of the site was almost fully revealed. Although the area was much disturbed by illegal exca- vations, LM IA pottery is regularly found within undisturbed levels. Finds were discovered in cavities in the rocks, suggest- ing that offerings were usually placed in cavities between pro- jecting sections of the natural rock. Offerings such as animal figurines or miniature pithoi were usually set in pairs. The cult centre seems to have been located at the SW end of the natural- ly flattened hilltop, in the immediate vicinity of the Geographical Survey Point. Numerous stone trays (12-15cm diam.) were found under a layer of ash; these could be inter- preted as models of offering tables. The trays, together with the burned, greasy soils must have formed an important part of the cult activities. Traces of burning were also located at the N end of the flat- tened hilltop, in the area of the building previously excavated by K. Davaras. Traces of two more, badly preserved buildings were located: the first 20m E of the Geographical Survey Point, the second 60m to the SE. The excavation produced numerous small finds, most of which were offerings at the peak sanctuary similar to those found during previous excavation campaigns. Figurines, solid or hollow, are mostly bovine; sometimes the animal's sex is dif- ferentiated. Human figurines are of small size; female figurines are adorned with fancy hairstyles or large head covers, whereas male figurines have only a few long hair locks across the skull. Only a few male figurines are bearded, implying older age. Special reference must be made to offerings of human limbs in the form of small clay models, which could be suspended. Other finds include a fragmentary boat model; miniature vessels, especially pithoi, were found in great numbers, one contained a</page><page sequence="144">146 DAVID BLACKMAN 221. Tripitos (Sitias) house, room B7 carbonized seed. Some bronze objects were found, but a most important category of finds is that of stone vases, mainly offer- ing tables and lamps made out of local soft limestone. Only small quantities of bones were collected from the pyres, where- as numerous sea pebbles were discovered throughout the sanc- tuary area. In the area of the Geographical Survey Point below the deposit of stone trays, N pottery together with flint chip- pings were found. (Kritiki Estia 7, 310-317) Tripitos, Sitias (B. Plakaki and B Drakaki plot). N. Papadakis reports on the resumed excavations, which have revealed remains of a small, but important HL town. The site is located on a small promontory 3.5km E of Sitia. The town can be asso- ciated with a series of coins reported by the excavator in Kritiki Estia 3 (1988) 335ff. and ADelt 43 (1988) 561ff. Excavation concentrated in the E sector beyond the area revealed during the 1987 season and exposed a series of rooms which form part of previously or newly discovered houses. One of the rooms (B7) was equipped with a square hearth installa- tion made out of large schist slabs and associated with burned earth and organic matter (Fig. 221). Similar installations were found in other rooms. Within the N wall three installations were probably used as benches. A wealth of clay vessels are report- ed, together with some metal finds including a bronze coin of Praisos. Excavation beyond the northernmost exposed area of the town and near the fortification wall, which protected the W side of the site, revealed two new rooms. Amongst the most impor- tant finds was the handle of an amphora bearing the inscription IEPATT/YTNIWN ICWIOY. (ADelt, 746-7) Tsambi Merabellou. An MM III-LM I burial pithos containing one burial was discovered. (Epyov YTT7TO 2, 6) Vasiliki Ierapetras. Kephala. Th. Eliopoulos reports on the discovery of a new LM IIIC settlement located on a hill 210m high, at the N end of the Ierapetra Isthmus. At least seven struc- tures were identified, built out of large roughly hewn blocks. Amongst the most interesting finds is a PG small crater and a curved millstone. (ADelt, 748-9) Th. Eliopoulos also reports the necessary survey in the 'air- port' area located near the Pachia Ammos-Ierapetra road. The N edge of the site lies very near the EM Vasiliki settlement. (ADelt, 750-1) Vrokastro. B. Hayden (ASCS) reports on the 1999 season: ' Vrokastro Pottery Study 1999. Work with the pot- tery collection from the Vrokastro Survey Project: the catalogued sherds belonging to the Gr, R, and Byz through mod. periods were separated from the larger collection, permanently labelled, and then sacked together and stored with the remaining mate- rial from each site. Study of the FN through EM IIA periods under- taken by B. Hayden and T. Strasser was continued. A representative number of sherds belonging to sites of this period was selected from the overall collection and, if diagnostic in terms of shape or treatment, sherds were catalogued, drawn and inked. The over- all group of early sherds was then separated by fab- ric into a few large categories: these included quartz, limestone/marble, phyllite and granodiorite fabrics. The fine buff and orange sherds were separated by surface treatment into dark-on-light and red-painted. A repre- sentative selection of these basic fabric groups, and the diag- nostic sherds, were then photographed. The report concerning the basic division of pottery according to fabric and treatment, and the catalogued FN-EM IIA pottery, will be published to substantiate and illustrate the settlement pattern as derived from the Vrokastro Survey Project. Istron Mapping Project, Vrokastro Survey Area 1999. The Istron Mapping Project was designed as a 3-year project to map with an EDM anc. and Med sites within part of zone 1 of the Vrokastro survey area. The area to be mapped consists of a coastal region between the base of Ioannimiti, a coastal promontory N of Pyrgos village, on the W, and the coastal promontory of Vrionisi, to the E; it extends on the S to the national highway (Greek military maps nos. 9635/5, 9635/7). The director of the project was Barbara J. Hayden. During a two-month period the following sites were mapped: Nisi Pandeleimon, site of the Greek polls of Istron, a 7th- through 2nd-Ct BC town located primarily on this large promon- tory. Ancient architectural evidence, including foundations of houses, possible administrative buildings, warehouses, and pos- sible streets, were mapped on the SE side of the promontory (the area known as Visalo or Katevati), the S slope, the central to N area of the promontory, and the W slopes. These were mapped in conjunction with new construction on the promonto- ry, which has occurred primarily in its central and S portions. During the mapping of the promontory, it was discovered that the walls in the sea on the E side, previously thought to belong to wharves or a shipshed, are in fact structural or house walls. Rooms and corers were found extending from the beach into the sea, and these were mapped. These walls indicate a beach or coastline during the Gr period that could have been as much as 100+m N of its present location. Thus coastal subsi- dence and erosion significantly altered the location of the coast- line from the R to the mod. period, bringing the sea much far- ther S than had previously been thought. Elias to Nisi: this promontory, located to the E of Nisi Pandeleimon, is enclosed on its S side by a 6m-wide fortifica- tion wall of probable LM IIIC date (the dating of this wall was based on the chronology of sherds eroding out from under the wall and contemporary LM IIIC-G pottery on the SE slope</page><page sequence="145">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 147 above the cove; this is area E-F on the map). The line of this for- tification was mapped during the summer of 1999. Structural or house walls were also mapped at various loci within the area enclosed by the fortification. These walls were located between areas A and B on the preliminary sketch of the W side of the promontory. Associated pottery suggests that this is the site of a much disturbed FN/EM I-1IA settlement. Other ancient structures that were drawn were located in the center of the cove, on the beach, extending into the water (area C); an iso- lated structure on the highest point of the E prong (area D) that might have functioned as a watch-station; and an area of frag- mentary walls (E and F) that probably comprised part of the LM IIIC-G settlement contemporary with the fortification wall. New data derived from the project include the extent of the EM settlement on the W side of the promontory (B on the map). Priniatikos Pyrgos. All ancient walls on and near this promontory were mapped, including walls on the beach that extend into the sea. Other site features were also mapped, including field walls that incorporate anc. building material and that may overlie lines of ancient wall. New data include the extent of the settlement, with walls mapped that are located off the promontory, to the W and E of it. These walls extend into the sea and suggest not only the large size of the settlement dur- ing the M and R periods (ca 200m) but also the fact that a sub- stantial part of the settlement may now lie below sea level. Sites that remain to be mapped include: Ioannimiti (IM15: large R settlement that extends 100-150 E along the beach toward Priniatikos Pyrgos, and an Ott port and possible small village with carob apothekes and a small harbour facility); Priniatikos Pyrgos (PP2.3: Med church and Ott chimney mill); Priniatikos Pyrgos (PR4: R pottery scatter in fields between IM15 and PP2); Kato Arniko (KA3: R construction (tiles and pottery) and Ott chimney mill); Istron (IS3: large R settlement of 2nd-7th Cts AD just N of the coastal highway and SE of a R port on Priniatikos Pyrgos); Nisi Pandeleimon (NP2: Venetian-Ott fort and cemetery area SW of the promontory); Vrionisi (VN1-3: FN-EM II settlement, probable late LR/EByz monastery, Byz-Venetian settlement). Mod. construction and roads also need to be added to a digitized 1:5000 map of the overall coastal zone.' Zenia Merabellou. A small SM tomb discovered contained two burial phases. (Epyov Y71O70 ) 'Minoan Roads' Project. I. Tzedakis, S. Chrysoulaki, L. Vokotopoulos and A. Sfyroera report on the work conducted during the 1995-97 seasons: Kokkino Phroudi. The building overlooks the pass between Zakros and Xerokambos. Two main construction phases have been identified. The fort was founded during the old-palatial period and extensively modified in LM I, to accommodate the installations of a pottery workshop. Two kilns were found near- by; however, the main workshop area was probably located within a building S of the fort. (Kritiki Estia 7, 317-20) The building S of Kokkino Phroudi Fort was cleared of veg- etation and proved to be of substantial dimensions. Choiromandres. This building revealed consecutive occu- pation phases: MM II, MM IIIB, LM IA, LM I and a few R sherds. The foundation of the building is associated with old palace period pottery. Korakomouri, Sfakas. From this MM III peak sanctuary, Traostalos, Mare and Modi are visible, in addition to all the main Zakros and Xerokambos passes. Animal and human fig- urines were found, the latter being exclusively male. Tumblers, jugs and cups are most common pottery types. Most small finds have marks of burning. This peak sanctuary bears a strong resem- blance to the contemporary major sanctuaries of Petsophas and Traostalos. Korakomouri was a small, local early shrine, which did not continue in use into the neo-palatial period. Zakros and Xerokambos area. Several new sites were located, with special emphasis given to FN and EM habitation (total of 17 sites). These are located along the border of the coastal and inland zone at some altitude (Rizobiglo Zirou, Koufotos at the Hordaki plateau). Usually small, some are more extensive, such as Kastella Xirokambias, and normally control inland passes such as Kephali Agias Paraskevis. In contrast, the Paranoma site is a coastal one, located on the small bay of Amatos. These new sites support the argument for extensive occupation during the transition to EBA. (Kritiki Estia 7, 317-26) Museum work. S. Apostolakou reports ongoing work on the Archaeological Collection of Neapoli which was opened to the public in Autumn 1999. In the Archaeological Collection of Ierapetra, two further rooms, containing pottery and sarcopha- gi, were opened to the public. On display are finds from the well-known LM III tomb of Episkopi Ierapetras. (ADelt, 741) N. Papadakis reports on finds handed over to the local Ephorate: a fragmentary clay figurine, found in the Zakros 'Gorge of the Dead'; M and R pottery from Chandras Sitias; an aryballoid lekythos from the area of anc. Itanos. (ADelt, 752) Work by the ASCS teams at Chalasmeno, Gouria, Kavousi, Mochlos, Pseira and Vrokastro in 1994 (ADelt, 754-8) was cov- ered in AR 1994-95, 65-71). WESTERN CRETE Aptera. V. Ninnou-Kindeli gives an extensive report on the 5th and 6th excavation seasons at anc. Aptera. Sector VI: work concentrated in the areas partly excavated during the season of 1995. The peristyle was fully revealed under a destruction deposit, containing HL and R pottery, show- ing 5 x 7 columns in situ on the stylobate, which originally had 18 columns; 23 column drums were found fallen within the courtyard, suggesting that the building collapsed after a very strong earthquake. Soundings below the floor produced mixed, but predominantly HL, pottery. A small headless statue of Aphrodite fastening her sandal was found within the sounding and above the second floor level. A test made below this pro- duced HL pottery mixed with A and C. Later walls dating to the LR period were removed and a small marble head originally belonging to an hermaic stele (Hermes of Alkamenes) was dis- covered within the fill. Additional excavations revealed the outlines of walls only a few centimeters below the surface. An interior courtyard was exposed in area B with eight doorways along the long sides of the courtyard, forming part of the original phase of the building; three doorways along the narrow end belong to a later R phase. At the N end of the W wall, the soundings below the floor lev- els produced G, A, C and HL pottery, the latter dating the foun- dation of the building. All other upper levels have HL pottery mixed up with R, although the latter types predominate. Only in certain areas did the topsoil reveal ECh pottery. In the W cemetery of Aptera, at the mod. settlement of Plakalona, 27 tombs of the 1 St Ct AD were excavated. Tomb 20 was associated with a limestone tombstone, its upper end shaped like bull's horns. It bore a HL inscription: (IAcoTEpa / ApioToroaS a / ZEAEva / 2aTUrpc. (Kritiki Estia 167-75)</page><page sequence="146">148 DAVID BLACKMAN Agios Vasilios Valley. Analysis and recording of the material found in the surveys of 1990, 1994 and 1997, now stored in Rethymno Museum, continued under the supervision of Dr J. Moody (Baylor University). Study also continued on the impor- tant sites of Ambelos, SE of Koxare village; the Koule fort, with LB to modem activity (especially a large MM presence, and the Turkish fort) and the nearby 'rock piles' BA site, S of and overlooking Koule and Ambelos. Smaller sites on the N side of the valley were studied, including the hill near Angouseliana village with dense obsidian scatters among FN- EM-MM material. H. Hall undertook study of the large and important sites at Frati Crag and the Koule. Frati Crag is the MM site on a bare- ly accessible crag overlooking the entrance to the Kourtakaliotiko gorge to Preveli. It had sherds of a few medi- um-sized storage vessels, a surprisingly high proportion (nearly half) of fine wares, and concentrations of obsidian. Koxare Koule has LN-Turkish occupation. This year's study revealed an earlier chapel, whose shape appears LR, although this does not seem to be supported by the pottery-it could be Venetian, as could the fortress. In either case, it adds a third important phase to the history of the site. It is now appar- ent that the Koule may not be the main M settlement in the val- ley. The sites found N of the National Highway through the val- ley may indicate a complex at least as important as Koule. Chamalevri. Kakavella hill. Extensive post-palatial and neo- palatial installations were discovered which are related to the M settlement. (Epyov YTO770 2, 9) Chania. In 1998, 21 different excavations were conducted within the mod. town. Most important was the excavation of a section of the Kydonia HL and R necropolis. A multiple burial dating to the 1St quarter of the 3rd Ct BC was found to contain 33 bodies. Its location, some 200m E of the anc. town, suggests that the dead could be victims of a plague or battle. Soundings along the S moat of the Venetian fortification proved that the steep slope of the hill NE of the central court of the mod. Chania agora was transformed into a gently sloping street. Nearby a complete LC or EHL wine pressing installation was discovered. (Epyov YT7T7O 2, 9) M necropolis. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on the dis- covery of LM III chamber tombs at three different plots in the Agios Ioannis quarter. In the Robithakis plot, all five LM IIIA/B chamber tombs were found robbed. The entrance passage of tomb 1 was left intact and among the finds were three stirrup jars and some bronze fragments. Within the burial chamber, the badly-preserved parts of two skeletons were discovered. A col- lection of human bones and a dog burial had been deposited next to the entrance. Two oblong fragments of decorated lime plaster were part of the decoration for a wooden bier. Other finds include three clay vessels, a crystal necklace and a glass paste bead. Tomb 2 is the largest and most impressive LM III chamber tomb yet discovered at Kydonia, obviously rich in finds, which had been violently plundered. Only 11.40m of the sloping dro- mos leading to the burial chamber was excavated. It was 2.00m wide and 8.55m deep. Amongst the rubble which originally blocked the entrance, a large comer-block was discovered which had been used as a tomb marker. The upper part of a Canaanite amphora was found in front of the entrance. The mud-coated rubble wall, which originally sealed off the side chamber located along the S wall of the square main burial chamber, was practically destroyed by the tomb robbers. 222. Chania, bone plaque Within the main chamber, faience necklaces, traces of gold and clay vases were all that was left of the rich burial. Additional clay and stone vessels were found in the chamber fill. Among the most striking finds are several bone plaques made out of hip- popotamus and elephant tusks, depicting warriors wearing hel- mets, female goddesses, heraldic lions, figure-of-eight shields and other themes (Fig. 222). They once adorned a wooden box, similar to those found at the tholos tombs of Archanes and Phylaki. This elaborately decorated wooden box was originally deposited in the side chamber, but when the tomb was robbed its pieces were scattered in different areas. Tomb 3 was severely damaged; only the sparse remains of one burial accompanied by one conical cup were found within a rectangular cutting. Tomb 5, located 4m from tomb 2, was pos- sibly equipped with a tomb marker. A unique feature is the two SM burials, located within the tomb's chamber and above part- ly collapsed rubble, which originally blocked the entrance. One of the two burials had been destroyed during the subsequent plundering of the tomb. Two fragmentary sealstones, a bronze buckle, two bronze rings and a faience bead were discovered. Five human skulls and a few bones belonging to a dog and sheep (or goat) were collected from the main chamber. Five intact clay and six stone vessels, conical loomweights and a bronze imple- ment were the only finds left behind by the robbers. Tomb 5 contained two burials: the one located along the E side was found intact, with the dead man lying on his right side and accompanied by bronze weapons, a bronze mirror, three clay vessels and a few stone beads. Tombs 2 and 4 have been preserved below the mod. building constructed after the end of the excavation. Another chamber tomb was later discovered nearby; it con-</page><page sequence="147">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 149 tained a female burial accompanied by two sealstones, beads of semi-precious stones, a faience necklace, one clay vessel and parts of a bronze object. Odos Dimitraki: during construction work for a sewage sys- tem, three LM III pit cave type tombs were discovered. Only a small skull fragment was preserved together with a total of seven LM IIIA2 decorated clay vessels. In the E and N sections of the Kostakis plot, which is locat- ed within the most densely occupied section of the E cemetery of anc. Kydonia, a total of seven LM underground rock-cut tombs and one cist tomb were excavated: tombs 1-6 were robbed and contained only one or two burials each, accompa- nied by very few finds; tomb 7 was the only cist tomb and prob- ably contained a child burial. The extensive excavation of LM IIIA and B tombs at Chania has shown that the cist and pit cave type tombs, known from other LM III cemeteries on Crete, co-exist with the usual cham- ber tombs in the cemetery of anc. Kydonia. (Kritiki Estia 7, 143-52) P. Drosinou reports on the discovery of an LM III chamber tomb at Egoumenos Gavriel street: only part of the dromos was explored, which on its S side contained a rock cutting blocked by rubble. Of the burial, part of the skull survived together with one conical cup. The dromos fill produced some M pottery and a broken HL figurine depicting a child. (Kritiki Estia 152-3) C necropolis. M. Andeadaki-Vlasaki reports the discovery of tombs which form part of the S necropolis of C Kydonia. At the Charopakis plot, 0.66m below the surface, a double shaft grave was discovered, with a monolithic lamax in each compartment. Although found robbed, the burials were accompanied by clay figurines placed within and outside the lamakes together with several clay vessels dating to EC. To the E a HL tile grave, a pithos burial sealed with a stone, and a pit grave of the LC peri- od were found. Further S, within a rock cutting, three succes- sive burials were discovered: an infant burial within a pithos superimposed on an earlier pit grave, below which was found a tile grave. Another tile grave contained a child burial, accom- panied by a small bronze ring and clay female figurines. At the Dimitroulaki-Kiriakaki plot, five single and four dou- ble tile graves were discovered. All the single tile graves con- tained plain limestone monolithic lamakes; grave B contained a few clay vessels and a faience alabastron; grave F was destroyed by a T burial. Except for grave 0, all the double tile graves also contained plain monolithic lamakes; 33 clay vessels and two clay figurines were discovered within the tomb but out- side the larax of grave A. The double tile grave 0 deserves special mention since instead of the usual stone lamakes one of its compartments was found filled with numerous tiles together with human bones, fragmentary clay vessels, two figurines and metal objects. The second compartment contained the remains of three badly preserved burials accompanied by burning and two very worn vessels. (Kritiki Estia 153-8) S. Markoulaki reports the discovery of a C shaft grave at the junction of Odos Dictinna and Odos Phlorion. Four additional shaft graves were discovered at Odos Phlorion, one of which was a double grave, containing at least two burials, one male and the other female, the latter being accompanied by the lower half of a Cor lekythos and two cylindrical pyxides. The male burial was associated with a clay kyathos, two bronze and one iron strigil. At the Public Nursery School plot, located W of the old Frankish Cemetery, a hut-shaped tomb was discovered; the head of the single burial was resting on two stones. According to the neighbours, similar tombs were found 25 years ago at the nearby plot. Quite possibly a row of hut-shaped graves belonged to the NW cemetery of anc. Kydonia. Odos Demitraki: During construction work related to the foundation of a sewage system a shaft grave was discovered 1.78m below the present street surface. The interior of the tomb had a plaster coating with many colours; it contained 2-3 buri- als. Two skulls possibly belonged to an elderly couple: the female skull was placed on the chest of the male burial as if they were buried in an embraced position. Below these two, was an earlier burial with which an aryballos-shaped lekythos and a lamp should probably be associated, with an earlier burial found at a level lower than that of the two skulls. The tomb dates to the 4th Ct BC. At the junction of Odos Giamboudaki and Odos Xanthoudidou, V. Ninnou-Kindeli reports the discovery of a large chamber tomb, which belongs to one of the most impor- tant sections of Kydonia's HL cemetery. The tomb was only partially excavated since its N-S orientation was different from that of the mod. road. The tomb was cut into bedrock but some of its side-walls were faced with medium-sized and roughly chiselled stones. Its central entrance was of sandstone; the door and lintel were monolithic. A plaster coating sealed off the doorway. Four burial chambers were discovered; their floors were coated like sections of the side walls, but the ceiling was not coated. All burial chambers have the same shape: a deep pit to receive the dead, narrow benches on either side with a vault- ed ceiling. Three contained one adult burial each, whereas one held two adults and one infant burial. All burials had plain burial goods apart from one female that was associated with a bronze mirror depicting a bathing Aphrodite, four large female clay figurines and one pair of gold earrings depicting Cupids. Clay vessels accompanied the other burials, two iron strigils and two tweezers, one bronze and the other gold depicting a bird. The offerings date the burials to the 3rd Ct BC. Within the earth fill of the tomb's dromos EHL pot- tery was found: pottery sherds, plus twelve plain squat and solid myrodocheia, which had been intentionally placed outside the tomb, a well-known local custom. All had their rims and bases intentionally broken off. The discovery of a similar tomb on an adjacent plot implies that they form part of the cemetery's sector reserved for mem- bers HL Kydonia's upper class. The tomb was backfilled but remains preserved below the moder street. P. Drosinou reports the discovery of seven shaft graves at Odos Giamboudaki. The tombs had a N-S orientation and were constructed of large monolithic slabs, some of sandstone and others of poros limestone. Their interiors were plaster-coated. The burials were found much disturbed; broken or partly moved cover-stones indicate that all the tombs had been robbed. The tomb finds date the burials to the second half of the 3rd Ct BC. Special reference should be made to tomb 2, which con- tained a female burial. Although found disturbed, the rich finds suggest that the robbers failed to complete their work since pre- cious gold jewellery of exquisite craftsmanship was left behind: gold rings, necklaces, a diadem and jewellery originally sown onto the woman's garment, 38 cylindrical beads and an intact pendant. Other finds included a gold tray imprinted with the image of a bird, a bronze mirror, a bronze strigil, a bronze Charon coin depicting Zeus and a clay squat myrodocheion which conforms to the local LC and EHL burial custom. At the Paterakis plot, S of the seven shaft graves previously mentioned, a double shaft grave and two tile graves were dis- covered. Pottery collected from this plot dates from HL and Venetian times.</page><page sequence="148">150 DAVID BLACKMAN At Odos Kritovoulou a badly preserved tile grave and an LM III chamber tomb were discovered. At Odos Polyrrinias a shaft grave constructed out of lime- stone slabs had a plaster floor. Two stones placed under the head served as a pillow. Five clay vessels, an iron strigil and fibula together with a silver Charon coin were also found. The burial dates to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC, according to the finds. At Odos Dragoumi two shaft graves were discovered, which date to the end of the 4th Ct BC. At the junction of Odos Botsari and Odos Sphakianaki a T burial was discovered. Parts of the wooden coffin, the iron nails and traces of cloth were still preserved. Re-used anc. cover slabs covered the burial, whereas the tombs fill contained quan- tities of LC pottery. (Kritiki Estia 161-4) C settlement. S. Markoulaki reports on the excavation at Michelidakis Street and the Raisaki-Benaki plot, which revealed parts of the C settlement. Six A but re-used fluted col- umn drums columns are of the Doric order and belong to a dis- mantled A temple. During the excavation of a modem drainage trench, sections of at least seven R walls and associated floor surfaces containing pottery rubbish pits were recorded. (Kritiki Estia 165-6) Manolikaki plot: I. Christodoulakos reports on the neces- sary conservation work conducted in order to preserve chamber tomb no. 4. (ADelt, 740) Gavdos. A HL or R farmstead was excavated, which contained a wine-press. At the Sarakiniko beach a R building was found filled in with sand; as a result its walls were preserved to the remarkable height of 2.30m. (Epyov Y1T70O 2, 9) Gournes, White Mountains. P. Drosinou reports that M pot- tery was collected from the site of 'Salybara'. No anc. structures were reported but the soil associated with the pottery was black and soft in texture compared to the reddish soil of the plateau. (Kritiki Estia 178) Kalathas, Apokoronou. M. Andradaki-Vlasaki reports that concentrations of pottery dating to LN, EM and historical peri- ods are visible at the Tsilonera Kalatha site. The sparse remains of a rectangular EM construction were associated with pottery and obsidian flakes. A semi-circular construction was cut into bedrock. (Kritiki Estia 167) Kalives. V. Ninnou-Kindeli reports that a small-scale excava- tion was conducted on the hilltop located W of the beach of Kera and W of the modem church. A pithos burial contained a 7th-Ct BC Cor aryballos. (Kritiki Estia 178) Kambanos, Selinou. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on dis- coveries and small-scale excavation: Panagia site (R tomb con- taining a handleless clay skyphos); Kamini site (R robbed chamber tomb, which contained much pottery and a gold disc with incised decoration); Agios Athanasios site (W side of the church peribolos, where an anc. wall was discovered); Tribes site (R robbed cist tomb containing fragments of glass vessels; M pottery was collected from the vicinity, W of the dirt road); Stavraka site (the base of a burial pithos was discovered within the edge of the dirt road; eight glass beads were collected). (ADelt, 739-40) Kisamos. A R workshop was found containing exquisite moulds and small finds. Another house was rich in finds, including two hoards of bronze coins. (Epyov Y17T70 2, 9) Camping site. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on the chance discovery within a modem earth fill of a HL statue fragment. The white marble fragment depicts a female hand, holding a fruit and probably resting on a tree branch. (ADelt, 739) Smari. During conservation work conducted by D. Vallianou for the Archaeological Institute of Crete, supplementary evi- dence in support of the date for the construction of the acropo- lis exterior peribolos wall was discovered. MM pottery and a sealstone depicting two female figures were discovered in area E. (Epyov YTO770 2, 9) Stylos. M. Adreadaki-Vlasaki reports that an important M set- tlement, possibly identified with M Aptera, has been located in the area of Stylos; a tholos tomb and a pottery kiln dated to LM III have been excavated. Trial trenches were conducted at the Christodoulakis field. In the E part of the field an important building dating to the end of the 7th Ct BC was discovered; four large rooms and a long staircase were excavated. The rooms were filled in with Im-deep deposit and the earth floors were found much destroyed; bedrock was also used as a floor sur- face. Apart from plentiful pottery, clay loom-weights, stone pounders, obsidian flakes, bronze sheets and iron small finds were discovered. Within Room 1 earlier walls date to LM III. In the nearby Markogiannakis plot, which is located W of the previously mentioned plot, small quantities of MM pottery were discovered. (Kritiki Estia 175-7) Thronos/Kephala. Anna Lucia D'Agata reports on the 1999 excavation campaign: 'Greek-Italian excavations at the M and post-M site of Thronos/Kephala (anc. Sybrita) which are a collaboration between CNR/ Istituto per gli studi Micenei and the Ephoria of Chania, were resumed in 1999. Three sectors were opened in various parts of the settlement on the summit of Kephala. On the N plateau, investigation focused on building 2, the paved room, and an extensive sector to the immediate N of the area previously excavated. It has been possible to trace the SW limits of the built-up area and to detect, and follow for about 8m from E to W, the northern boundary of the plateau occupied by the built-up area in the course of LM IIIC. The discovery of this northern limit, at least one stretch of which does not coincide with the present limits of the plateau, is of considerable impor- tance for the reconstruction both of the original limits of the set- tlement and the phenomena leading to northward extension of the limits of the plateau itself in PG and G times. Finally, the construction of building 2, originally situated on the northern limits of the settlement, and of the paved room, has been attrib- uted to a late phase of LM IIIC. In the central area a new pit was identified which can be ascribed to the phenomenon of ritual pits. The stratigraphy of pit 53, containing material attributable to a probably early phase of PG, confirms the hypothesis that the pottery found together with ashes and animal bones was placed here following proce- dures that can be defined as ritual. On the S plateau excavation went ahead on G building Al, proving particularly difficult due to the pronounced slope of the ground, the presence of a paved road overlying the building, and of collapsed and surface structures identified in 1995. On the evidence of the SW corner of the building unearthed in this year's excavation, it appears that it was roughly square in plan, with a stepped ramp abutting the SW corner. Of great impor- tance was the discovery, in a layer of destruction adjacent to the ramp, of a bronze head from a male statuette, and a tiny bronze</page><page sequence="149">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1999-2000 151 SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS American School of Classical Studies 1-5, 35-7, 97-101 Archaeological Receipts Fund (TAP) 6-9, 18-25, 27, 38, 52, 60, 62-5, 71-3, 75-7, 89- 96, 102-7, 109-23, 126- 36, 150-7, 176-8, 180-8, 194-6, 213-4, 220-2 Archaeological Service/ Goulandris Museum 10-17 and cover 223.
