Suzanne D. Smith Department of the Air Force ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to use the driving- point impedance and transmissibility techniques to evaluate and compare the resonance behavior of two male humans, the Hybrid III aerospace manikin, and a rigid body mass using a rigid seat and a selected helicopter seat cushion. All occupants represented the 95th percentile or higher of the male population for weight. The results showed that the resonance frequencies associated with the peak impedance, chest, and head transmissibilities were significantly higher in the manikin regardless of the seating configuration or input acceleration level. While the magnitude of the peak impedance was higher in the manikin, differences in the chest and head transmissibilities depended on both the seating configuration and acceleration level. Neither the manikin nor the rigid body were effective in predicting the primary human resonance effects occurring in the sensitive region of 4 to 8 Hz. However, some similarity did exist when comparing the manikin response to human spine transmissibility data. A discussion of an alternative method for predicting human body resonances using mathematical models is included in this paper. INTRODUCTION The operation of both civilian and military ground vehicles, including automobiles, tanks, and trucks, can expose the occupants to whole-body vibration which has been shown to affect comfort, performance, and health. Griffin [1] applied the ISO 2631 [2] to seat transmissibility data collected on cars, buses, and trucks operated over several terrain surfaces. For all vehicles, the vertical seat vibration was found to be more severe than vibration measured in the other translational axes. The weighted accelerations were found to be about twice as severe on the poorer surfaces. For the cars, the values reached the reduced comfort boundary [2] within 30 minutes of operation over the poorer surface. The exposure limit, which should not be exceeded according to the ISO 2631 [2], occurred within as little as 4 to 8 hours. Griffin [1] observed that higher weighted acceleration levels and shorter acceptable exposure durations occurred with the operation of buses and trucks. In the military, health hazard assessments of new Army ground vehicles have shown that the exposure limit can be reached within as little as one hour [3]. Pilots of both Army and Air Force Black Hawk helicopters have reported symptoms of low back pain and general discomfort after about four hours of flight [4]. The improvement of comfort, performance, and safety in ground vehicles challenges the commercial and military communities with designing vehicle suspensions and seating systems which minimize vibration effects. Both experimental testing and mathematical modeling provide the methods for evaluating suspension and seating system design concepts for reducing human body vibration, however, both methods must be capable of properly predicting human body resonance effects. For example, vibration testing and analysis methods have used manikins and rigid body masses to evaluate seat and cushion concepts for human use, particularly when human testing was not feasible. Gurram et al. (1995) compared the vibration response of a human and a plastic water-filled dummy of similar weight while sitting in a seat/cushion system. Transmissibility was measured between the output acceleration at the subject/cushion interface and the input acceleration at the shaker table. The seat itself was shown to have a transmissibility near unity. The primary resonance of the human occurred at 4.25 Hz with a secondary peak observed between about 7 and 8 Hz. The single resonance peak observed for the dummy occurred at 7.5 Hz. The magnitude of the response was found to be quite higher in the dummy. Using both the driving-point impedance and transmissibility techniques, Smith (1994, 1996) tested military aircraft cushions using humans weighing between 50 and 105 kgs, and using rigid masses weighing between 39 and 68 kgs. While the primary resonance peak for all of the human subjects occurred between 4 and 7 Hz, the single peak observed for the rigid mass tests occurred between 8 and 15 Hz. The limitations of the manikin and rigid body mass in simulating human body resonances should be well understood before using 1074</page><page sequence="2">these methods to optimize seating systems for human use. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the vibration response characteristics of the human, manikin, and rigid body mass of similar weight using a rigid seat and a selected helicopter seat cushion. The driving-point impedance and transmissibility techniques were used to generate frequency response profiles for the whole-body and for specific anatomical structures or regions. The resonance behaviors observed in these profiles were evaluated and compared between the humans, manikin, and rigid body mass. Also included in this paper is a discussion of the mathematical modeling method for predicting human body resonance behaviors and seat cushion effects. METHODS AND MATERIALS Four 'occupants' of approximately the same weight were used in the study. Two of the occupants were human males weighing approximately 104 kgs. The third occupant was a Hybrid III aerospace anthropomorphic manikin obtained from First Technology Safety Systems, Inc. and weighing approximately 99 kgs. The fourth occupant was a rigid body mass comprised of bags of metal shot weighing approximately 101 kgs. All occupants represented the 95th percentile or higher of the male population for weight. An electrodynamic vibration platform (Unholtz- Dickie) was used to provide the vertical vibration exposures. The system was designed to operate in the frequency range of DC to 5000 Hz with a force limit of 6672 N peak and a payload of 1 13 kgs. A rigid aluminum test seat was mounted on top of the platform and included a seatback, lapbelt, and double shoulder harness. The angle between the seatback and seatpan was 90 degrees. The test seat has been shown to respond as a rigid system for the subject weight and frequency range under investigation. No additional padding was provided for the seated subjects. The humans were loosely restrained, similarly to what would be expected during the operation of civilian ground vehicles. The human subjects used in this study were experienced in vibration testing and fully understood the importance of maintaining the upright posture during data collection. The presence of the seatback aided in this process. It was necessary to restrain the manikin more tightly to maintain the upright posture. Due to the seat payload limitations, both the human and manikin legs were allowed to hang freely. The subjects hands were folded and placed in their lap during testing. The transmitted force of the combined seat and occupant was measured by three load cells (Strainsert FL1U-256 KT) located between the seat and vibration platform. Two accelerometers (Kulite GYD-4-280-20 and Kistler 815A5) were attached to the seat for measuring the input acceleration magnitude and phase, respectively. Vertical accelerations were measured using miniature accelerometers (Entran EGA- 125-1 OD) attached with double-sided carpet tape to specific anatomical regions on the occupant. For the human, accelerometers were attached on the chest (at the level of the manubrium) and on a bitebar (head) molded with dental acrylic. For the manikin, an accelerometerwas similarly attached at the chest (on the surface). Manikin head acceleration was measured using an accelerometer mounted within the head. The location was slightly anterior to and above the attachment site for the head and neck. For the rigid body mass, an accelerometerwas attached on top of the mass. In order to evaluate the effects of a cushion on the vibration response of the occupants, tests were also conducted using a seatpan cushion obtained from a Black Hawk helicopter and placed between the rigid seating surface and the occupant. The cushion was fabricated of three layers of foam with different densities. The bottom layer was made of high density plastic foam and varied in thickness from about 1 cm at the back to 6 cm at the front, providing a contour or "bucket" seating surface. Air vents ran from the front to the back along the inside surface. The top layer consisted of polyurethane foam about 2.5 cm in thickness. Sandwiched between these two materials was a layer of polyurethane foam of greater density than the top layer and approximately 1.5 cm in thickness. The cushion was covered with black lambswool and weighed 910.5 gm. For the cushion tests, a ride quality meter, consisting of three orthogonal accelerometers imbedded within a rubber disk, was placed between the occupant and cushion for calculating the interface transmissibility. Only the vertical acceleration was used for the evaluation and comparison. The three input vibration profiles at the seat included discrete sinusoidal frequencies and two sum-of- sines profiles generated by combining the discrete sinusoidal frequencies. The frequency components used for all three input profiles ranged from 3 to 21 Hz in 1 Hz increments. Two seat acceleration levels were used; 0.59 m/s2rms and 2.35 m/s2 rms (0.06 gms and 0.24 g^). While the frequency content and rms acceleration levels were identical for the two profiles, the crest factor (CF= 2.9 and 4.2) was varied by altering the phase relations between frequency components. The crest factor, defined as the ratio of the peak acceleration to the rms level, is an indicator of the impulsiveness of the motion. Figure 1 illustrates the two sum-of-sines profiles (PI and P2) at 0.59 m/s2 rms. A computer program was used to generate the vibration profiles at the seat and for simultaneously collecting all transducer data. Data were collected for two seconds at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. A Fast Fourier Transform algorithm was used to determine the transducer magnitude and phase difference between the sum of the three load cell forces and the input velocity calculated from the input acceleration at the seat. The impedance frequency response profiles were calculated as the magnitude ratio and phase difference between the transmitted force and input velocity at each discrete frequency component between 3 and 21 Hz. The impedance of the rigid seat (collected separately) was subtracted from the calculated impedance to obtain the impedance frequency response profile of the occupant. The magnitudes of the vertical transmissibility frequency response profiles were calculated as the ratios between the accelerations measured at the chest, head, ride quality meter, and rigid body mass, and the input acceleration at the rigid seat at each discrete frequency component between 3 and 21 1075</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 Sum-of-sines vibration profiles. Hz. The impedance magnitude and phase, and the transmissibility magnitude frequency response profiles were generated at each of the two acceleration levels. The three magnitude frequency response profiles (sinusoidal and sum- of-sines) were used to compare and evaluate the frequency location and magnitude of the peak or resonance responses. The means and standard deviations were calculated for the resonance frequencies and peak magnitudes extracted from these data and represented the subject response variability occurring for different types of vibration exposures. In addition, the mean impedance and transmissibility magnitude frequency responses were calculated from the three profiles. RESULTS RIGID SEAT EFFECTS - Figure 2 illustrates the mean impedance magnitude and phase frequency response profiles for the occupants using the rigid seat at the lower acceleration level (0.59 m/s2 rms). Figure 3 shows the means ± one standard deviation for the primary impedance resonance frequencies and peak magnitudes occurring at the two acceleration levels for the humans and manikin using the rigid seat (labeled R in the figure) and seat cushion (labeled C in the figure). The seat cushion effects are discussed later in the paper. The impedance response of the rigid body mass was calculated using a mass of 101 kg and the known relationship for the impedance magnitude and phase of a rigid mass [8]. Both humans showed a primary or highest resonance peak between 6 and 7 Hz. Additional regions of resonance were observed at higher frequencies, particularly for the first human subject between 11 and 13 Hz, where a smaller peak was observed in all three magnitude response profiles. The impedance magnitudes for the humans remained relatively constant at frequencies DRIVING-POINT IMPEDANCE DRIVING-POINT IMPEDANCE Rigid Seat, 0.59 m/s2 rms , Rigid Seat, 0.59 m/s2 rms /*-s 25 , 100 ~7' *o Human 1 - Qn _ /"V; t-H Human 2 .

For the humans, the phase declined rapidly through the primary region of resonance from about 90 degrees to around 0 degrees. There was a phase change through the second region of resonance observed for the first human subject as illustrated in Figure 2. The phases for the humans tended to remain within ± 20 degrees at frequencies beyond the primary peak. In contrast, the primary or highest impedance peak observed for the manikin occurred at a higher frequency around 14 Hz and was approximately four times the magnitudes of the human peaks. In addition, the majority of the manikin data showed smaller magnitude peaks at 8 and 17 Hz. As shown in Figure 2, the impedance magnitude decreased with increasing frequency beyond the primary region of resonance. The phase changed rapidly through the peak regions. For the manikin, the phase continued to decline at frequencies beyond the primary resonance (14 Hz) to between -60 and -70 degrees at 21 Hz. Figure 2 also shows the calculated magnitude and phase responses for the rigid body mass. Figure 3 shows that the primary impedance resonance frequency observed for both the humans and manikin decreased by 1 to 2 Hz at the higher acceleration level with the use of the rigid seat (labeled R in the figure). The two human subjects showed a peak at 5 Hz, while the manikin showed a peak around 12 Hz. The humans showed no significant difference in the magnitude of the primary peak at the higher acceleration level. The manikin did show a decrease in the primary peak at the higher acceleration level although less variability was observed in the data at this level. In contrast to the effects observed in the humans and manikin, the impedance of a rigid body mass is not affected by the input acceleration level. For both the humans and the manikin, the additional peaks observed in the impedance frequency response profiles appeared more attenuated or were shifted by several Hz at the higher acceleration level. Figure 4 illustrates the mean magnitudes of the chest and head transmissibility frequency response profiles for the humans and manikin at the lower acceleration level using the rigid seat. Figure 5 shows the means ± one standard deviation for the primary resonance frequencies and peak magnitudes associated with the chest transmissibility, while Figure 6 shows the means ± one standard deviation for the primary resonance frequencies and peak magnitudes associated with the head transmissibility at both acceleration levels using the rigid seat (labeled R in the figures) and seat cushion (labeled C in the figures). The seat cushion effects are discussed later in the paper. The frequency location of the primary or highest chest and head transmissibility peaks coincided closely with the primary resonance frequency observed in the impedance data for both the humans (peaks occurring between 4 and 6 Hz) and the manikin (peaks occurring between 12 and 15 Hz) at the respective acceleration level. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the magnitude of the peak chest transmissibility observed for the manikin was significantly higher as compared to the human at the lower acceleration level. Figures 4 and 6 show that the magnitudes of the peak head transmissibilities were more similar between the humans and manikin at the lower acceleration level. As depicted in Figure 4, the first human subject showed a relatively pronounced secondary peak between 12 and 15 Hz in both the chest and head transmissibility frequency response profiles, while the manikin showed a consistent peak at about 8 to 9 Hz. The secondary peaks occurred at frequencies which coincided closely with the secondary resonance peaks observed in the impedance frequency response profiles for these occupants. For the rigid seat, increasing the acceleration level had variable effects on the frequency location and magnitude of the primary resonance peaks for the chest and head transmissibilities. As shown in Figure 5, both the humans and the manikin showed a tendency for a decrease in the primary chest resonance frequency with the increase in acceleration level. The second human showed an increase in the magnitude of the peak chest transmissibility, while the manikin showed a decrease in the peak chest response. The first human showed no significant change in the magnitude of the peak chest response given the variability in the data. Figure 6 shows that both humans showed a slight tendency for a decrease in the head transmissibility resonance frequency while the manikin showed a larger decrease in the head transmissibility resonance frequency with the increase in acceleration level. Both humans showed a significant 1077</page><page sequence="5">CHEST TRANSMISSIBILITY HEAD TRANSMISSIBILITY 5 Rigid Seat, 0.59 m/s2 rms Rigid Seat 0.59 m/s2 rms Human 1 Human 1 Human 2 Human 2 4 Manikin Ą Manikin g /-' g s ^ s /A' ^ ' 0 i i i i 0 i 1 1 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 FREQUENCY (Hz) FREQUENCY (Hz) Figure 4 Chest and head transmissibility frequency response profiles using the rigid seat.

For the rigid seat in general, the peak chest transmissibilities were higher in the manikin as compared to the human at the lower acceleration level, but more similar between the humans and manikin at the higher acceleration level. In contrast, the peak head transmissibilities were similar 1078</page><page sequence="6">between the humans and manikin at the lower acceleration level, but higher in the manikin at the higher acceleration level. The transmissibilities measured at the rigid seat interface were also unity for all occupants, i.e., the interface acceleration was equal to the input acceleration with the use of a rigid seat and no intervening cushion.

SEAT CUSHION EFFECTS - Figure 7 illustrates the mean impedance magnitude frequency response profiles for the humans, manikin, and rigid body mass with the use of the cushion at the lower acceleration level. Figure 3 includes the mean resonance responses of the rigid body mass using the cushion. Figure 7 shows that, with the addition of the cushion located between the rigid body mass and the rigid seat, a prevalent impedance peak is observed at about 10 to 11 Hz at the lower acceleration level. Both the resonance frequency and peak impedance magnitude for the rigid body mass coincided more closely to the manikin data, with both showing a significantly higher resonance frequency and peak magnitude as compared to the human subjects, similar to the results observed using the rigid seat. Any additional resonance peaks appeared to be more attenuated with the use of the cushion for both the humans and manikin. As depicted in Figure 3, the primary impedance resonance frequency was decreased in both the humans and manikin with the addition of the seat cushion (labeled C in the figure) regardless of the acceleration level. The maximum decrease was 3 Hz. The addition of the seat cushion appeared to have a minimal effect on the peak impedance magnitude for the humans regardless of the acceleration level. Given the relatively large variability in the data, the addition of the cushion also had a minimal effect on the peak response of the manikin at the lower acceleration, however, the peak response was significantly reduced with the use of the cushion at the higher acceleration level. The acceleration effects observed with the use of the cushion were similar to the effects occurring for the rigid seat. The peak resonance frequencies were reduced by 1 Hz in the human with larger decreases being observed for the manikin and rigid body mass at the higher acceleration level (up to 4 Hz). The associated magnitude peaks were also decreased for all occupants at the higher acceleration level with the most pronounced differences occurring for the manikin and rigid body mass. Large variability was observed in the rigid body data at the higher acceleration level. This may have been due, in part, to the relatively high acceleration peaks inherent in the sum-of-sines profiles at the higher level in combination with the cushion effects. Figure 8 illustrates the mean magnitudes of the chest and head transmissibility frequency response profiles for the humans and manikin using the cushion at the lower acceleration level. The figure also includes the mean transmissibility frequency response measured for the rigid body mass with the addition of the cushion. Figures 5 and 6 include the mean resonance responses of the rigid body mass with the use of the cushion. Figure 8 shows that the chest and head resonance frequencies and peak transmissibility magnitudes for the manikin were more similar to the responses observed for the rigid body mass. At both acceleration levels, the primary chest resonance frequency tended to decrease for the humans while the associated magnitude peak showed an increase with the use of the cushion as compared to the rigid seat. The manikin also showed a decrease in the resonance frequency with the use of the cushion. The decrease was more pronounced at the higher acceleration level. For the manikin, the peak chest transmissibility did not change significantly with the use of the cushion at the lower acceleration level given the variability in the data. At the higher acceleration level, the peak chest response tended to decrease with the addition of the cushion, in contrast to the results observed for the humans. The primary head resonance frequency showed a tendency to decrease with the use of the cushion for both the humans and manikin at both acceleration levels. The decrease was more pronounced in the manikin. Given the variability in the data, the magnitude of the peak head transmissibility tended to decrease for the humans and increase for the manikin at the lower acceleration level with no significant changes observed at the higher acceleration level with the addition of the cushion.

Both graphs include the rigid body transmissibility frequency response profiles using the cushion. effects of acceleration on the chest and head resonance frequencies were similar for the rigid seat and cushion showing a tendency to decrease at the higher level. The effects of the acceleration level on the magnitude of the peak chest transmissibility were minimal for both the rigid seat and cushion for the first human. The second human showed no significant effect of acceleration with the use of the cushion as compared to the tendency observed for the rigid seat. The manikin showed a more pronounced decrease in both the chest resonance frequency (up to 4 Hz) and peak magnitude response at the higher acceleration level with the use of the cushion as compared to the rigid seat. For the humans, the tendency for a decrease in the magnitude of the peak head response at the higher acceleration level was less pronounced using the cushion as compared to the results for the rigid seat. In contrast, the peak head magnitude response appeared to decrease in the manikin with the use of the cushion at the higher acceleration level as compared to the minimal effects observed for the rigid seat. The effects of acceleration on the magnitude of the peak head transmissibility were less pronounced in the humans as compared to the manikin with the use of the cushion as compared to the rigid seat. The peak resonance frequency was also decreased for the rigid body mass at the higher acceleration level. However, the magnitude of the peak responses were similar at both acceleration levels given the large variability in the data collected at the higher acceleration level. In general, the manikin resonance frequencies remained significantly higher than the humans with the use of the cushion. However, the peak chest transmissibilities were more similar between the humans and manikin, while the peak head transmissibilities showed higher responses in the manikin at both acceleration levels with the use of the cushion. The contrasting effects can be observed by comparing Figures 4 and 8 for the lower acceleration level. For the transmissibility measured at the interface between the occupant and cushion, all occupants showed resonance frequencies which coincided closely with the resonance frequencies observed in the other measured responses. The peak magnitude responses at the interface for the humans and manikin were less than 2.0. The second human did show a slight increase at the higher acceleration level. As with the majority of responses, the manikin and rigid body mass showed a higher transmissibility peak at the interface as compared to the humans. For the manikin and the rigid body mass, the acceleration level did not appear to have a significant influence on the response. The rigid body mass did show a lower transmissibility at the interface than at the top of the mass. The placement of the metal shot bags on the cushion and the location of the accelerometeron top of the mass may have caused some off-axis motion in the mass. DISCUSSION HUMAN RESONANCE BEHAVIOR USING MANIKINS AND RIGID BODY MASSES - The results of this study showed that the whole-body vibration response characteristics of the human were different as compared to the response characteristics of the Hybrid III aerospace manikin and rigid body mass representation. The differences were specifically reflected in the dramatically higher resonance frequencies observed in the driving-point impedance and transmissibilities for the manikin as well as the rigid body mass regardless of the seating configuration (rigid seat vs cushion). Both the manikin and rigid body mass produced significantly higher impedance magnitude peaks as compared to the humans regardless of the seating configuration. Although the two human subjects were specifically selected to avoid response differences occurring due to body weight, the results strongly suggest that the distribution of the mass, stiffness, and damping characteristics are different between these humans and the manikin. In a recent study [7], in which the vibration response characteristics of a wide range of female and male subjects were compared, including the two males used in this study, the same conclusion was drawn about the distribution of structural properties. However, the differences between 1080</page><page sequence="8">the humans were primarily observed in the magnitudes of the peak responses and not on the location of the resonance frequencies. A comparison of these data shows that, in general, the manikin tested in this study produces significantly higher primary resonance frequencies as compared to humans, regardless of any structural differences occurring among the humans. Of particular concern for predicting cushion effects were the contrasting trends observed in the peak impedance and peak chest and head transmissibilities between the humans and manikin with the addition of the seat cushion. There does appear to be some similarity between the primary resonance behavior observed in the manikin and the secondary resonance observed in the humans at higher frequencies. In the human, the primary impedance resonance peak occurring between 4 and 8 Hz has been considered to be strongly influenced by the dynamic behavior of the upper torso, including the shoulders and the soft tissues contained within the chest cavity [9]. The coincidence of the peak chest transmissibility and peak impedance in the frequency range of 4 to 8 Hz further supports this influence [7, 10]. In addition, these observations indicate that the resonance behavior observed for the head at the low frequencies was strongly influenced by the motions of the upper torso. The contrasting effects of the acceleration level and cushion between the head and chest peak responses requires further investigation of coupling effects in the human body. The majority of subjects tested in this laboratory have also shown a prominent transmissibility peak at C7 at higher frequencies between 12 and 18 Hz [7]. These findings have strongly indicated that the spinal column structures may be a major contributor to the additional impedance resonance peak which has been observed at higher frequencies between 12 and 19 Hz [7, 10, 1 1]. The additional peak located at about 13 Hz for the first human coincided with the peak transmissibility measured at the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) in this subject. A peak was also observed at Ç for the second human used in this study but was lower as compared to the first human [7]. The second human did not show an identifiable impedance peak at the higher frequencies. While measurements were not made in the spinal column of the manikin, it appeared that the resonance frequency observed in the impedance and chest transmissibility frequency responses for the manikin coincided more closely with the spinal column resonance observed at the higher frequencies in the human. The magnitude of the peak chest transmissibility in the manikin did fall within the wide range of the peak spine (C7) transmissibility magnitudes observed for humans and coincided closely with the magnitude peak observed at C7 for the first human. The similarity between the resonance behavior of the human spine and the primary impedance and chest resonances observed in the manikin becomes even more apparent when considering the effects of the seat cushion on vibration response. The majority of current seat cushion designs have been shown to increase the transmission of vertical vibration to the human in the vicinity of the primary resonance (4 to 8 Hz) as demonstrated in this study and in previous studies [7, 10, 12, 13, 14]. In contrast, these cushions tended to attenuate the vibration at higher frequencies as shown in the tendency for a decrease in the peak spine (C7) transmissibility occurring at higher frequencies for humans [7, 10]. Interestingly, the results of this study showed that the addition of the cushion decreased both the primary impedance and chest transmissibility peaks in the manikin, similar to the tendencies observed in the human spine transmissibility at higher frequencies. Current biodynamic manikins are primarily designed for simulating the effects of short duration, high accelerative loading of the human body. These designs do not consider the low frequency, low amplitude human body sensitivity observed during vibration exposure. The manikin used in this study did appear to show the attenuating effects of cushions at higher frequencies which coincide with human spinal motion, however, the ability to simulate the resonance response of humans in the region of greatest sensitivity (4 to 8 Hz) is critical for developing improved seating systems. PREDICTING HUMAN RESONANCE BEHAVIOR USING MATHEMATICAL MODELS - Lumped-parameter mathematical models have been used to predict the primary resonance behavior of the human body occurring between 4 and 8 Hz. These models use mass, spring, and damper elements to represent the dynamic response of 'lumped' anatomical structures or regions. A five degree-of-freedom (DOF) model was developed to simulate the multiple regions of resonance identified in the driving-point impedance response [11]. The model elements were selected to represent the dynamic responses of the upper torso (chest), spine, legs, and lower torso. The current model does not include the model elements for the head. The five DOF model was found to be effective in simulating human impedance response. Based on transmissibility data collected at specific anatomical sites, the model was also found to be quite effective in predicting the general resonance behaviors of the anatomical structures represented in the model [10]. The model was expanded to include seat cushion stiffness and damping properties estimated from rigid body mass tests. On comparing the predictions for two military cushions tested in this laboratory, the model was found to be effective in simulating the relative increases in the impedance and chest transmissibility peaks occurring at low frequencies (4 to 8 Hz), and the relative decreases in the impedance and spine transmissibility peaks occurring at higher frequencies (12 - 19 Hz) with the addition of the cushions [10]. A simplified three degree-of-freedom model, which lumped the torso and spine structures, was also shown to predict the relative effects of the seat cushions, but only in the low frequency region [10]. It appears that human models which are capable of predicting the low frequency response effects would be more appropriate as compared to manikins for evaluating the effects of seat cushions on humans, particularly if human testing is not feasible. The cushion stiffness and damping properties required by the model could be estimated from rigid body testing of the cushion or from known cushion material properties. Caution should be taken in using these models since differences in 1081</page><page sequence="9">vibration response have been observed between females and males of varying sizes [7]. It is important to consider the ability of a model to predict these differences. Specifically, the five DOF model developed in this laboratory requires further modifications and validation of its predictive capabilities before being used as a tool for optimizing seat cushion designs for a variety of occupants.
