Literary Music: Writing Music in Contemporary Fic- tion joins the sizable population of studies of the relationships between music and literature. It stud- ies representations of music within fictional litera- ture, taking off from certain assumptions about the structural and ontological elements shared in the</page><page sequence="2">100 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "interaction between two cultural forms" (p. 4). Its prime purpose is to extrapolate from its various case studies a sense of the ways in which literature can be said to be musical. In the introduction, "Music for Reading," Stephen Benson defines his titular term as follows: "literary music refers in the first instance to the self-evident fact that such music [as written about in literature] is by definition literary, a music made by the nar- rative in which it occurs" (p. 4). The interest is in treating representations of music within fictional lit- erature as "primary evidence" rather than "historical detritus" (p. 4), and to progress beyond unhelpful no- tions of music as cipher, supplement (p. 13), "adjec- tival icing," "corroborating sound," "cap" (p. 14), as "merely a realization of a non-musical narrative un- derpinning" (p. 70). The point is to argue, or at least provide evidence for the case, against the notion that "language in literature frequently speaks about mu- sic ... but music is not felt to speak about literature" (p. 13). The key to literary music, then, "is not the suc- cess or otherwise of the evocation, but the nature of the performance: the question of how and why music is staged [in the fiction], and to what desired end" (p. 4). The question is less about what music means on its "own" and more about what it does in certain literary contexts. This, the Janus-headed dynamic of "literary music" - the work of music within literature and the work of literature in staging music - is the core of Benson's thesis. "The writing of such music in contemporary fiction is not only a matter of recep- tion history; it serves also as one arena in which we can witness the cultural work to which music is put" (p. 7). Benson places some emphasis on the work in- volved in joining, or at least juxtaposing, musical and literary acts, and to this extent the title could also be "through" (p. 38 n. 45) or "into" fiction, since the focus is on the active passage from the one to the other, on their dynamic interaction (this is par- ticularly evident in the chapter on Maurice Blanchot, whose thematics are particularly suited to these pur- poses). Hence Benson argues, like Lawrence Kramer (a frequent methodological presence in Literary Mu- sic), that "all writing about music seeks to make mu- sic known and so becomes part of that music's means and mode of existence" (p. 5). "Within this critical context, fictional representations serve as one more performance, one more instance of music making (in both senses of the term)" (p. 5). In Chapter 1 Benson considers how the novelist James Hamilton-Paterson engages in Gerontius with the cultural phenomenon of the English composer Edward Elgar. The focus of Benson's engagement is the musical figure of melody, the intention being to confront the subject with a real presence (Ben- son mentions George Steiner in a later chapter), as opposed to the fictional music conventionally con- sidered by the literary camp within music-literature studies. Focusing in particular on the opening motto theme from Elgar's First Symphony, which is famous for ap- pearing pretty much fully formed on its first occur- rence, Benson's analysis leads him from music to cul- ture, and to the remark, quoting Kramer, that "[t]he melody arises where whatever subject enunciates it has departed, or may depart, or will have departed, and arises, moreover, imbued with both the pathos of this departure and its mitigation" (p. 39; the quoted passage is from Musical Meaning: Toward a Criti- cal History). Indeed, Benson's broader cultural ar- gument is that the symphony is "too confident in its own presence" (p. 39), and not ironic and ambiguous enough, since a sense of its own authenticity is al- ways on hand. This idea would bear comparison with themes in the Elgar anniversary celebrations, during which, on the one hand, the relation of the composer- as-English-icon to the subjects of the realm and, on the other hand, the tangled relationship Elgar had with modernism, are being rethought in new political and demographic contexts. Benson notes, correctly, that in the symphony "the melodic voice [is] the mas- ter sound of authenticity itself, yet it is a voice at once over-emphatically near and, in its yearning, naggingly distanced. Its affective intimacy is not entirely com- forting" (p. 39). Chapter 2 considers the musical engagement with Rudyard Kipling in Michael Berkeley and David Malouf s opera Baa Baa Black Sheep (1993). The fo- cus is the libretto, and the chapter's work begins with the familiar observation that libretto texts tend to be predicated on a prior understanding of the condition of music to which they are destined and to be con- ceived as the below-stairs facilitator of the real mu- sical life of the multimedia work of opera proper - a text to be heard but not noticed. Methodologically and aesthetically, Benson makes the interesting suggestion that the work going on in operatic setups like this takes place at the "border" between the libretto as literature and the libretto as musical fodder (pp. 59, 76); between prose and verse (p. 60); between text as central and as supplemen- tal; between, one might add, Wagner and Stravin- sky, paradigm cases of these ideological positions. This idea's application is broader than opera. Ben- son draws on Gerard Genette and Peter Kivy for support, following Genette (Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation [Cambridge University Press, 1997]) in the idea that "[m]ore than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold ... an 'un- defined zone' between the inside and the outside" (p. 66 n. 54), and Kivy's belief {Introduction to a Philos- ophy of Music [Oxford University Press, 2002]) that "listening to absolute music is, among other things,</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 101 the experience of going from our world, with all of its trials, tribulations, and ambiguities, to another world, a world of pure sonic structure, that, because it need not be interpreted as a representation or description of our world, but can be appreciated on its own terms alone, gives us the sense of liberation that I have found appropriate to analogize with the pleasurable experience we get in the process of going from a state of intense pain to its cessation" (quoted twice, pp. 123, 156). For Benson these two otherwise quite different texts come together at the "threshold" over which music becomes literature becomes music in a contin- ual process of "going from" one place "to another." These movements are indicators of the important role played by links, bridges, and passages (p. 6, see also pp. 25, 33, 71, 77, 87, 141, 148) between "music" and "literature" in literary music - even when passages are thwarted (p. 96) or become a Sisyphian labor. Elsewhere, too, Benson notes the importance of this movement between music and text: "We pass thereby from the felt immediacy of the musical experience to the seeming inadequacy of our ability to put that ex- perience into words" (p. 1). This otherwise tangential remark on an aspect of Benson's methodology sug- gests one reason why Blanchot - otherwise a slightly odd bedfellow in this book - has a vital role in the argument: his work, drawn alongside that of Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett, presents a limiting case of the passage-as- waiting where music in literature - literary music - never arrives but is constantly on the verge of doing so. Chapters 3 and 4 turn to narrative theory, begin- ning with the idea that, although "voice in literary narrative is a metaphor we live by" (p. 103), little "attention [has] been paid to the work of polyphony as metaphor, to the non-literary discursive sphere it implicates, as opposed to the concept that it pas- sively enables" (p. 70). Benson's argument turns on a frequent problem with narrative readings of mu- sical works, namely that they ignore the question of whether "music" is already implicated within the nar- rative theory: whether narrative theory has already needed to perform its own idea of music - to have al- ready read music (p. 70) - as a means of setting out its methodology. This is an argument about bootstraps. Chapter 3 considers Bakhtin's concept of polyphony and compares it with Milan Kundera's the- ory of the novel. Kundera, it transpires, is more willing than Bakhtin to allow the idea of a musical influence on the form and content of novelistic narrative, while for Bakhtin and Blanchot music enters through the figure of the voice, which in turn brings with it no- tions of sound. Sound, of course, even though it is never transparent but always mediated and, strictly speaking, is lacking from the text and in this sense uncanny (p. 51 n. 23), is nevertheless a sign of self- hood and thus a necessary key to theories of nar- rative. Benson concludes that "[m]usical polyphony thus defined can only ever be a virtual property of narrative literature, but it is precisely the discursive gap bridged by the metaphor that is of interest, the aspiration to polyphony conceived as a paradigm of musicality itself (pp. 86-87). In Chapter 4 Benson tackles Blanchot's complex analogizing of narrative voice as a form of absent song. In Blanchot's attempt to work through the idea of a voiceless, musicless text, the musical trace returns (was always there) as a shadow, a keenly felt absence. In order to unpack this paradoxical dynamic, Benson explores Blanchot's reading of the myth of Odysseus and the sirens ("The Song of the Sirens"), in particu- lar the twist that Odysseus does not resist heroically but is a coward, risking nothing in his passage by the sirens. Problematizing the conventional reading of the myth whereby the sirens simply delay, distract, disrupt, and divert Odysseus from his journey (pp. 92, 93, 139 n. 47) and tempt him to spend time with them instead, the key concept here (if not in Literary Music as a whole) is this: "The Sirens' song, like the song of Claudia, is 'insufficient' and 'imperfect.' Its power as event lies in its being preludial, the before of music; an 'overture of the infinite movement which is the encounter itself, always at a distance'" (p. 103). This position allows Benson to take a stand against a certain brand of musicology: "The problem with the notion of subject formation in music as suggested by [Lawrence] Kramer, at least when considered as a means of reading literary music, is that it relies upon the anthropomorphic presence of the narrative voice in the act of listening: the written voice in narrative as signifying a speaking voice in the world, which voice is perceived in turn as the sound of a subject present to itself (pp. 96-97). Chapter 5 considers novels in which music is valued "for its abstracting separateness - from the world, from the everyday and above all, from lan- guage" (p. 10). (One might ask why "abstracting" and "separateness" are always juxtaposed, given that the one does not necessarily imply the other.) Wittgen- steinian ideas about what language is capable of (pp. 44, 138-139) are juxtaposed alongside case studies of the performance of musical canon in Vikram Seth's An Equal Music, the role of the notated score in Jeanette Winterson's Art &amp; Lies, and the concep- tion of compositional practice in Ian McEwan's Am- sterdam, J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace, and Bernard Mac Laverty's Grace Notes. Benson shows that their very condition as novels compromises their attempts to place music out of reach, for in the novel the worldli- ness of music is laid bare. The necessary failure - and hence success - of these novels, Disgrace and Amster- dam in particular, harks forward to the matter of the next chapter. Indeed, echoing the Bakhtin discussion in the previous chapter, Benson theorizes that "[t]he</page><page sequence="4">102 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism novel need not defer to music as that which it can only verbally name, and so gesture towards; rather, the novel might be granted a particular privilege as that form in which the sociability of music can be represented, accorded a thick description of a piece with the interwoven strands of the musical act" (pp. 139-140). Chapter 6 concerns fiction "in which the repre- sentational act of literary music is itself problema- tized, even withheld" (p. 10). (Here we will pass over the difference between 'withheld' and 'without,' the word used in the title of the chapter.) The case study is Kazuo Ishiguro's The Unconsoled, in which, although music - and, unusually, contemporary music at that - plays a massive thematic role (its central protago- nist is a professional pianist), the narrative revolves around the endless deferral of a projected musical event. Music, Benson argues, resists the enticements of its narrative description and expectation. To enrich his analysis Benson invokes Kafka's poetics, in which music was doubly problematic, on the one hand be- cause of its ravishing sensuousness and on the other hand because of its resistance to language. Benson's point, following on neatly from his earlier analysis of Blanchot, is that "the more successful we feel the evocation of music to be, the more oxymoronic is the novel, in that the proximity to music only serves to draw attention to what is missing" (p. 142). In this respect, The Unconsoled is quite differ- ent from the novels discussed in the previous chap- ter. In Art &amp; Lies and An Equal Music there is a moment of exchange in which music and literature meet as equals in full view of each other. "The nar- rative proves its worth in this moment of exchange, with the predicted enigma resolved in 'plenitude' - paradigmatic plenitude, in that the reader is lifted out of words and towards the apparent semantic im- mediacy of music" (pp. 148-149). However, as Ben- son notes, Kafka and Ishiguro stubbornly, but with great artifice, refuse to let music arrive in any ma- jor sense, and the silence of the novel - both literal and musical - becomes part of the point (p. 155). It is only fair to point out that, unlike Ryder, the (anti-?) hero of The Unconsoled, Brodsky, one of the secondary characters, does in fact eventually get to conduct his orchestra, albeit in somewhat unconven- tional circumstances; although Benson does not read the novel this way, it could be said that this secondary narrative strand, which has after all coursed all the way through the novel toward the climactic public showdown, does provide the reader with some kind of musical arrival, and perhaps even catharsis, given the degree to which Brodsky's plight inspires sympa- thy from the reader and given the detailed description of the performance provided by Ishiguro. Even if this is the case, though, Benson is right to argue that "just as the other displacements serve to defamiliarize and thereby heighten basic human predicaments, so the burden placed on music is resolutely conventional. Music is valued for its singular powers of affect, and by these means, its powers of consolation" (p. 146, see also pp. 69, 149, 156, 159). In this, Ishiguro is less radical than Blanchot. Literary Music is an interesting book and repays repeated reading. It should probably be read along- side other similar studies rather than on its own. Al- though it starts from a now familiar Kramerian posi- tion with respect to its musicological contexts, which might be said to limit its scope a little and age it pre- maturely, it is more usefully disciplined by its ground- ing in literary theory and fiction studies. Some of Ben- son's arguments have a use beyond the case studies from which they emerge, particularly in the case of the Bakhtin and Blanchot chapters, and many of his ob- servations provide useful insights into the workings, intentional or otherwise, of contemporary novelists and the cultural discourses that they work through and (usually) uphold.
