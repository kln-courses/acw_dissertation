<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Spalding TOWARD A MODERN TORAH: MOSES MENDELSSOHN'S USE OF A BANNED BIBLE Scholars have stressed how Moses Mendelssohn (1729--86) integrated Jewish tradition with modern thought, especially that of Christian Wolff (1679-1754), in ways that were formative for modern Judaism.' A strik- ing, heretofore unnoticed example of Mendelssohn's creative synthesis is the way he critically used an infamous Wolffian precedent for his most influential work, the firstJewish translation of the Torah or Pentateuch into modern German.2 THE WERTHEIM BIBLE On a visit to a friend one day in the summer of 1756, a young Moses Mendelssohn picked up an impressively bound and printed Torah in German. As he perused the work, he became more and more inter- ested, soon pronouncing it "an excellent book."3 Eventually he obtained a copy of it for his personal library.4 What Mendelssohn had stumbled upon was the so-called Wertheim Bible (WB), named after the small Franconian town where it had been printed in 1735.5 It was an anno- tated, dynamic, modern-language version of the Pentateuch, one often verging into paraphrase. Its unnamed author was a Christian Hebraist namedJohann Lorenz Schmidt (1702--49), house tutor for the Lutheran counts of L6wenstein-Wertheim. Schmidt's book had provoked a storm of controversy in the German Protestant world. Because Martin Luther's two-centuries-old German translation of the Bible enjoyed virtually canonical status in the Protes- tant community, some church leaders viewed any new version as a veiled attack on God's Word. Even more objectionable to traditionalists was the way in which Schmidt rendered his translation and its notes into the rationalist language of Leibniz's disciple and popularizer Christian Wolff, the German philosopher most widely read in the mid-eighteenth century.6 Against Christian orthodoxy, Schmidt noted that the literal text of the Torah did not describe the Trinity or predictJesus Christ.

The constitu- tion of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation allowed public expression of only three Christian confessional communities and pro- hibited innovations objectionable to their arbiters. On this legal basis and by other regional laws similarly intent on preserving the status quo, the Saxon and Prussian governments, the imperial court council (der Reichshoftat) in Vienna, and then a wave of various territorial states throughout the Empire banned the sale or possession of Schmidt's book. The Catholic prince of Wertheim, cousin of the book's patrons, seized Schmidt for interrogation and incarceration by order of the Ger- man emperor. Only after a year, and with the help of powerful friends fearful of Catholic intrusions, did Schmidt manage to escape. Until his death in 1749, he continued to produce important though anonymous work, including the first German-language translation of Baruch Spin- oza.8 He did so, though, only by living under an assumed name in the relative anonymity and freedom of Germany's largest city, Hamburg. Although the Wertheim Bible faded from public attention, it contin- ued to exercise an important influence on biblical study.9 After Schmidt, other German theologians began openly to apply universal standards of interpretation to the Bible, including consideration of its historical context and critical treatment of the language of miracle.10 The Wertheim Bible helped provoke Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694-1768) to write a confidential Deist critique of the Bible, excerpts of which the great writer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-81) pub- lished in the 1770s. These excerpts, in turn, sparked the central German theological debate of the later eighteenth century." Subsequent ob- servers dubbed the Wertheim Bible the first systemically rational analy- sis of Scripture in Germany; that is, the first attempt to use reason to arrive not only at historical but also religious truth.l2 The book ap- peared at the very beginning of Germany's two-century position of scholarly domination in critical historical research of the Bible. INFLUENCE ON MENDELSSOHN'S TORAH It is highly likely that the Wertheim Bible influenced Mendelssohn's own German Torah of 1780-83, his Sefer netivot ha-Shalom ("Book of the Paths of Peace"). Despite the problematic nature of establishing the relation- ship between the two, both circumstantial and internal evidence point in this direction.</page><page sequence="3">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 69 There are several hindrances to making the case that Schmidt's work contributed substantively to Mendelssohn's. Although Mendel- ssohn had expressed delight in discovering the Wertheim Bible and ob- tained a copy for his library, he does not refer to it explicitly in his surviving correspondence or published writings after the letter he wrote about his initial encounter. Mendelssohn was a cautious man, and there were obvious reasons not to talk about this heterodox work: it was tech- nically illegal to possess it, and citing it with approval would damage the public reputation of any scholar.'3 Also, though Mendelssohn read non- Jewish biblical scholarship extensively and discussed it elsewhere,'4 he did not seem to feel it necessary or prudent to cite it in explicit detail for the intended Jewish readership of his German Torah.15 Some of the aspects that Mendelssohn's work shares with Schmidt's may actually have come independently from the same sources. Both were adherents of Wolffian philosophy.'6 Both may have drawn on the same Jewish com- mentaries. According to one report, Schmidt had been able to consult commentaries borrowed from the Wertheim Jewish community.17 Though Mendelssohn shared Schmidt's positions that the Torah did not literally prophesy a future Messiah and that anthropomorphic speech about God in the Bible was figurative, he also found precedent for both views in existing Jewish scholarship.s8 On the other hand, Mendelssohn's first encounter with Schmidt's book and subsequent purchase of a copy, a difficult and expensive un- dertaking because of the early bans and the passage of time since its sole print run,'9 indicate the great Jewish scholar's preoccupation with the work. The fact that some of his most intimate friends shared his in- terest, and that Mendelssohn's intentions and perspectives mirrored some of Schmidt's, would have made the Wertheim Bible a natural ref- erence for him. Some close non-Jewish friends of Mendelssohn, leaders in the Ger- man Enlightenment, knew of the Wertheim Bible and may well have en- couraged his interest in it. They included the man at whose home Mendelssohn discovered the book, the Berlin writer and journal pub- lisher Christian Nicolaus Naumann (1720-97), as well as the man to whom Mendelssohn reported his discovery, the literary satirist Georg August von Breitenbach (1731-1817). They also included his dearest non-Jewish friend (a friend of Naumann and Breitenbach, and the age's greatest writer) Gotthold Ephraim Lessing; the Hamburg salon leader and writer Elise Reimarus (1735-1805, the daughter of Hermann Sam- uel Reimarus); and Elise Reimarus's brother-in-law, the Danish diplomat August Hennings (1746-1826). In 1751, Lessing had taken up Schmidt's most controversial position by arguing that some Hebrew Bible passages that traditional Christian exegetes claimed to express the Trinity or prophesy Christ do not actually do so.20 In 1754, over a year before</page><page sequence="4">70 Paul Spalding Mendelssohn's discovery of the book, Lessing referred explicitly to the intimidating effect of censorship against the Wertheim Bible on the publication of innovative writing."2 In the 1770s, at the very time Mendelssohn was composing his German-language Torah, Lessing was publishing the infamous excerpts of Hermann Samuel Reimarus's Deist critique of the Bible. In the process, he tried to protect the Reimarus family by suggesting Schmidt to be the writer." Elise Reimarus referred at this time to the case of the Wertheim Bible in correspondence with Lessing. Finally, both Mendelssohn and Reimarus were warning August Hennings to tone down his open enthusiasm for heterodox thought, with Reimarus cautioning Hennings specifically to avoid expressing public support for the Wertheim Bible.23 Another Mendelssohn friend who wrote about the Wertheim Bible and the forces of repression it set off was Friedrich Nicolai (1733-1811), the single most important publisher of German Enlightenment writ- ings-which included the first volume of Mendelssohn's Torah in Ger- man script.24 In his memoirs Nicolai singled out the Wertheim Bible case as exemplary of the failures of official attempts to suppress hetero- dox books.25 Although his memoirs appeared in print several years after Mendelssohn's translation, they gave expression to Nicolai's lifetime ex- perience and attitudes in the book trade.26 Not only did Mendelssohn's non-Jewish friends introduce him to the Wertheim Bible in the 1750s, then; they continued to talk about the book while Mendelssohn was trying his own hand at a German transla- tion of the Bible. This would have made Schmidt's translation a likely reference for his own. Schmidt's intentions in writing his translation also would have made it an especially appropriate foil for Mendelssohn's work. Schmidt had wished to present the literal meaning of the biblical text, as opposed to the symbolic meanings that traditional Jewish and Christian biblical in- terpretation had previously emphasized, and to do so in a more under- standable language than earlier renditions. His interest in undertaking a fresh translation arose out of his work as a tutor of the young counts of Wertheim (still in their minority). Eventually Schmidt determined to publish his work also for the benefit of educated Germans exposed to the latest intellectual currents, including attacks on the very notion of revelation.27 Whereas the standard German-language translation of the Bible, especially for Protestant Christians, was the formidable but dated version of Martin Luther, Schmidt tried very consciously to render the literal meaning of the Hebrew originals into clear, contemporary Ger- man. To do so, he found it necessary to offer a dynamic equivalent rather than a literalism so close to the original that it would bewilder, tit- illate, or repulse the modern reader.28 Schmidt justified his renditions in footnotes9."</page><page sequence="5">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 71 Mendelssohn's own project was strikingly similar on all counts. He found earlier Yiddish translations, already a century old, to be inade- quate both in accuracy and style for the instruction of his own chil- dren.30 In trying his hand at translating, he focused like Schmidt on rendering the literal meaning of the biblical text31 into modern German by a dynamic rather than rigidly literal equivalent.32 At the encourage- ment of his children's tutor, Mendelssohn eventually decided to publish his translation for the benefit of other Jews and provided it with exten- sive notes not only to explain the biblical text more fully but also to jus- tify his translation." The results may also be understood as a defense of biblical revelation against modern critics.34 Finally, although Mendelssohn shared with Schmidt and many other eighteenth-century German intellectuals the philosophical per- spectives of Leibniz and Wolff, Schmidt was the first person to apply these perspectives in a systematic fashion to the Bible. His version of the initial chapter of Genesis, for instance, dropped all reference to God's consecutive commands, actions, and perceptions. Instead, it described everything as evolving by natural processes according to God's eternal, unchangeable intentions. God appeared in Schmidt's work as Leibniz and Wolff conceived the Deity to be-a cosmic clockmaker who built the universe and then set it to run on its own. Surely this very first chap- ter of Schmidt's translation was part of what had caught Mendelssohn's attention on his initial encounter with Schmidt's translation at the home of Christian Naumann. Although in his own translation Mendels- sohn was far more careful not to distort the text, he offered similar per- spectives in his accompanying commentary, the Bi'ur.35 He explains there that at the beginning of God's creation, "... the primary matter was created without quality of form fitting the end, but it contained all the forms in potentiality..."36 References to God speaking thereafter are to "the will of God to bring an object from potentiality to existence," and references to God's seeing, to "[H]is will for [the object's] continu- ance." God's will itself does not evolve or change. Rather, it represents "the primordial wisdom which is the first way of God." This sounds sus- piciously like Schmidt's explanation of God's speaking as referring to things that occur "as the divine intention required" or "according to the divine intention"; and God's seeing as referring to something that oc- curs "according to the arrangement which God made" (WB Gen. 1:3, 6) Another early example of shared Wolffian perspective is how Mendelssohn tries to explain, in view of evil's reality, the last passage of Genesis 1, which describes everything God has made as "very good." ... [E]very existing thing, from the point of view of its existence, is good. And were these evil things not good from one aspect, they would be unable to exist in the universe created by the Good One who does</page><page sequence="6">72 Paul Spalding good, who loves goodness with a perfect love, and abhors definite evil with complete abhorrence. And know from this that the specific evil is also good and fitting to the intended end of all creation.... 37 Evil, in other words, is necessary for the ultimate good: a classic princi- ple of Leibniz and Wolff. It is Schmidt, though, who had first intro- duced into a modern biblical translation this claim that since God was a perfectly omniscient and omnipotent Creator, evil must ultimately con- tribute to the greater good.38 Again, the argument could be made that Mendelssohn drank from the sources of Wolffian philosophy directly and did not need Schmidt to think and write like a Wolffian. Still, Schmidt was the classic precedent for carrying out Wolffian perspectives in a biblical commentary, and so seems an obvious source of encourage- ment for Mendelssohn's work. Although the Wertheim Bible was a logical reference for Mendels- sohn's project, stronger evidence that Mendelssohn actually used Schmidt's book must lie in an examination of shared vocabulary and phraseology. There are several areas in which there is identical or closely approximate language. The Wertheim Bible's more precise Hebraic forms of proper names had struck Schmidt's non-Jewish readers as a striking innovation of Luther's standard German forms, and his use of these renditions be- came part of the national controversy over his book." Mendelssohn also used the more Hebraic pronunciations in his Pentateuch, although when he began translating the Psalms around 1770 he had followed Luther's practice.40 Thus for the Pentateuch he joined Schmidt in em- ploying Mizrajim and the Hebrew-German hybrid mizrisch for Egypt and Egyptian, instead of Luther's Egypten and egyptisch. Other examples are le- gion: Noach instead of Noah; Jischmael instead of Ismael; Jizchak instead of Isaac; Riwkah/Ribhke instead of Rebecca; Jaakow/Jaakobh instead of Jacob; Jisrael instead of Israel; Jehudah instead of Juda; Iwrim and iwrisch instead of Ebrier and ebrdisch.41 Mendelssohn could have decided to be more He- braic than Luther in rendering biblical personal names independently of Schmidt's example, of course. After all, the practice was characteristic of earlier Yiddish translations of the Bible. But Mendelssohn had explic- itly rejected their adequacy for modern German speakers,42 and earlier followed Luther's models for proper nouns in the Psalms. What except the Wertheim Bible could have persuaded Mendelssohn that the He- braic pronunciations of Jewish tradition could, after all, be an accept- able usage in modern German? There are scattered instances of other shared vocabulary in the translation. Mendelssohn used the precise words Schmidt had chosen to translate the names of two of the three wells in Gen. 26:20-22 (Zankbrunnen and Freyheitsbrunnen), for instance--words that Luther</page><page sequence="7">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 73 had left untranslated. To name the body of water the Israelites crossed to escape Pharaoh, Mendelssohn chose Schmidt's Binsenmeer rather than Luther's Schilfmeer ("Reed Sea").43 In the story of Moses' destruc- tion of the golden calf (Exod. 32:20; Deut. 9:21), both Mendelssohn and Schmidt adopted the unusual word calcine, meaning "to oxidize." Thus Moses "calcined" (calcinierte) the calf, according to Schmidt and Mendelssohn, rather than "burned" (verbrannte) it, as Luther more liter- ally rendered the word. Both eighteenth-century translators shared re- cent scientific understandings that forced them to explain how even the greatest of prophets could "burn" a metallic object. Where did Mendels- sohn find the chemical term that he thought would solve the problem, unless in his copy of the Wertheim Bible, which not only used the term but also provided an extensive footnote to justify its use? The language of Mendelssohn's in-text notes, originally appearing in brackets, seems to compel one to believe that he referred to the Wertheim Bible. Both Schmidt and Mendelssohn explained the He- braism that something "is caused to stink" (Gen. 34:30) to mean it is "made hateful" (verhafit gemacht). Both pointed out that the divine at- tempt on Moses' life when he was returning to Egypt (Exod. 4:24) was "sudden" (pl6tzlich) and brought Moses "into mortal danger" (in Lebens- gefahr). Both clarified the phrase in which God declared Israel to be "my people" (Exod. 6:7; 8:17, 19 [21, 23]; 9:17) with contemporary political language, that God was calling them "my subjects" (meine Unterthanen). When the Ten Commandments describe God to bejealous (Exod. 20:5), a matter upsetting to Enlightenment thinkers who saw God in more elevated terms, both Schmidt and Mendelssohn offer the explana- tion that God "cannot tolerate anyone beside Him" (der keinen andern neben sich leiden kann [Mendelssohn]; welcher keinen neben sich leiden kan [Schmidt]). A few verses later (Exod. 20:11), both explain that God's blessing and consecration of the Sabbath meant that He had given [it] special preference(s) (wichtige Vorziige gegeben [Mendelssohn]; einen besonderen Vorzug beygeleget [Schmidt]). Schmidt was notorious for having "improved" on the literal mean- ing of the biblical text by rationalizing it for modern consumption- often but not consistently pointing out and justifying his liberties in the notes. In passages indicating that God had encountered someone, for instance, Schmidt often translated the phenomenon as an "appearance" (Erscheinung) or "vision" (Gesicht) of God or some "divine envoy" (gitt- licher Gesandte), although the strictly literal meaning of the original text did not warrant this interpretation. Likewise, Mendelssohn inserted the word appearance or appear into passages concerning the theophanies at Mt. Sinai without the brackets he usually used to indicate an interpola- tion (Exod. 19:24; 20:18 [22]; 24:1-2, 10-11; 33:3, 9, 23; 34:6).44 As both Mendelssohn and Schmidt translate it, God has not "met" the Israelites,</page><page sequence="8">74 Paul Spalding as Exodus 3:18 would literally have it. Rather, He has "let Himself be perceived by us" (hat sich uns verspiiren lassen), according to Mendels- sohn's version; or, in Schmidt's words, "we have had an appearance" from Him. God promises not to "meet with" Moses at the tabernacle (both translations indicate) but to "appear to" him there (Exod. 25:22).45 Mendelssohn shared Schmidt's conviction that God encountered the Israelites, including Moses himself, only in mediated ways: in vi- sions, other psychological experiences, or through envoys. Perhaps Schmidt's willingness to make direct interpolations in the biblical text on this matter encouraged Mendelssohn to follow suit. Even where Mendelssohn differed from the Wertheim Bible, the lat- ter surely exercised influence by way of warning what not to do. Mendelssohn remained far more faithful to the Hebrew text than Schmidt and showed a sensitivity to biblical poetry that Schmidt almost entirely lacked.46 Mendelssohn avoided the extensive Wolffian para- phrase typical of Schmidt and systematically justified his renditions by citing traditional commentators. Mendelssohn surely had Schmidt's no- torious paraphrasing in mind when, despite the admiration Mendelssohn expressed for how Christians had carried out fluent translations of the Torah "in every generation;" he specifically condemned their inatten- tion to the details of the Masoretic text and their tendency to do vio- lence to the literal meaning. ... They add and delete and change the Torah of God, not only the points and the accents, but also sometimes the letters and the words (for who can control them?) according to the thoughts of their mind and their perception, and as a result, they often do not read in the Torah that which is written there, but rather that which they conceive.47 Even Christian critics of the Wertheim Bible had condemned it pre- cisely for this too-loose treatment of the Hebrew text, a text distorted to fit Schmidt's own theological and philosophical agenda. Finally, Mendelssohn was far less willing than Schmidt to challenge traditional doctrine openly. Elsewhere, especially in his Jerusalem--an apologetic for Judaism that appeared in the same year as the final volume of his German Torah (1783)-he explicitly defended the Torah as a uniquely authoritative, divine revelation of laws for the Israelites, one that pre- supposed the Israelites' acquaintance with the truths necessary for salva- tion and one universally accessible to reason. In this way he was able to avoid any doctrinal discussion but at the same time indicate that Wolf- fian rationalism did not threaten Judaism's foundations.48 Though Mendelssohn did not face the extensive official condemna- tion that Schmidt had, his translation still aroused some angry re- sponses byJewish religious authorities fearful of its innovative character.</page><page sequence="9">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 75 Forewarned by Schmidt's experience, Mendelssohn was very quick to quash an impending ban by the chief rabbi of the greatest Jewish com- munity in Germany, Raphael Cohen of the "triple congregation," Al- tona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek. Mendelssohn turned to his diplomatic friend August Hennings, who managed to engage no less a personage than the Danish king as a subscriber to the translation. On that occa- sion, Mendelssohn stressed to Hennings his concern that the book "not be an ouvrage scandaleux": "... [my] translation of the H.[oly] S.[crip- ture] absolutely does not intend to question its majesty and truth."49 He then described with horror how recent heterodox authors, "perhaps in- nocent victims of their old German straightforwardness,:' had ended up "misunderstood and abandoned." Schmidt was certainly one of those victims. Mendelssohn was following in Schmidt's wake and was aware that he was doing so. By producing an annotated contemporary language ver- sion of the Torah informed by Wolffian perspectives in order to make Holy Scripture accessible to modern readers, Mendelssohn was trying to do for the German-Jewish community something of what Schmidt had intended to offer the German Christian community a generation before, while avoiding his mistakes. Mendelssohn's project marked an early instance ofJewish engagement with modern critical scholarship of the Bible, analogous to the position which the Wertheim Bible had taken in the German Christian theological world. Mendelssohn acted in creative tension with the example that the Wertheim Bible set for modern Bible translation. He was quite selective in his use of the earlier Wolffian version, adopting some of Schmidt's approach and language but rejecting most of his liberties with the text. What Mendelssohn knew Schmidt had attempted and suffered for could only have strengthened his own resolve to avoid any conflict with tradi- tional doctrine. The resulting translation embodied Mendelssohn's judi- cious synthesis of the traditional Jewish and the modern German, an accomplishment that helped to revive Jewish biblical scholarship and shape new forms ofJewish identity in the modern world.

The contemporary intimidation of intellectuals in matters of theological discourse appears in a letter by Mendelssohn to Protestant biblical scholar Jo- hann David Michaelis (1717-91) of the University of G6ttingen. Here, shortly after he had begun to translate the Psalms, Mendelssohn alluded to the reality that one didn't dare voice doubts in writing about the traditional Christian in- terpretation that some of the Psalms prophesied the coming of Jesus Christ. After expressing disappointment in having missed a planned personal visit to Michaelis, where they could have had a discussion "on various points and espe- cially on the Psalms and the prophecies that are alleged to contain," Mendels- sohn made the observation, "But this can't be done in writing."

Mendelssohn had in his library a wealth of modern Christian biblical scholarship.

A notable exception was a reference in his introduction to Johann Got- tfried Eichhorn: Mendelssohn, "Or Lintivah" GSJub, Vol. 15.1; pp. 38-39; En- glish translation by David Fox Sandmel, "A Translation and Critical Analysis of Sections I and II of Moses Mendelssohn's Introduction to His Commentary ("Bi'ur") on the Pentateuch As Well As the Part of the Genesis Commentary Written by Himself" (Thesis for ordination, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Insti- tute of Religion, 1983), pp. 103-259; German translation by Werner Weinberg, GSJub, Vol. 9.1; pp. 54-55. Hereafter, English citations of Mendelssohn's "Or Lintivah" and "Bi'ur" will be from Sandmel. Concerning the influence of various recent Christian scholars on Mendels- sohn's pentateuchal commentary and translation, see Perez Sandler, Men- delssohn 's Edition of the Pentateuch With an Introductory Note byJ. Klausner (Hebrew title: Ha-Bi'ur La-Torah shel Moshe Mendelson ve Si'ato: Hithavuto ve-Hashpa'ato) (Je- rusalem, 1940), pp. 19, 32-38; Edward R. Levenson, "Moses Mendelssohn's Un- derstanding of Logico-Grammatical and Literary Construction in the Pentateuch: A Study of His German Translation and Hebrew Commentary (the Bi'ur)" (Ph.D. diss., Brandeis University, 1972), pp. 10-11, 146-53, 218-22, 229-31, 340 (note 233); and Edward Breuer, The Limits of Enlightenment: Jews, Germans, and the Eighteenth-Century Study of Scripture (Cambridge, Mass. 1996), pp. 117-18, 272 (note 24), 147-75, 177. 16. Arkush calls Mendelssohn "the only noteworthy Jewish disciple of Leib- niz and Wolff" and "the last great representative of the Leibniz-Wolffian school": Moses Mendelssohn and the Enlightenment, pp. xi, 37; see also pp. xiii, 1-35. Sorkin notes how similar Mendelssohn's approach to the Bible was to that of Protestant Wolffians: Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment, pp. 85-86. 17. Note of Johann Christoph Harenberger, 8 Aug. 1768, file 20 Cod. Ms. philos. 143, Niedersichsische Staats- und Universitatsbibliothek G6ttingen, fol. 98v. Though this note appeared almost twenty years after Schmidt's death in Wolfenbiittel, Harenberger, a pastor in Wolfenbiittel, claimed that Schmidt had told this to a local acquaintance, the ducal privy counselor Heinrich Bernhard Schrader. A learned rabbi named Ephraim Reischer, who was serving the small Jewish community in Wertheim in 1728-35, was the obvious person to whom Schmidt would have turned: Leopold L6wenstein, Licht und Schattenseiten aus der Geschichte derJuden in Wertheim, Beilage zumJahresbericht des Historischen Vere- ins "Alt-Wertheim" (Wertheim; 1907), p. 11. On p. 6, L6wenstein cites records of thirteen Jewish families with sixty-seven members living in Wertheim in 1625, and thirteen families with seventy-three members in 1793. 18. Mendelssohn's 1783 translation of the Psalms also refused any support for Christological readings, a matter which provoked rebuttals from Michaelis:</page><page sequence="13">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 79 see Sorkin, Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment, p. 52. On Mendelssohn's use ofJewish precedents, particularly Rashbam, in his treatment of anthropomorphisms, see ibid., pp. 70-71. 19. Mendelssohn's friend and publisher Friedrich Nicolai claimed an early price increase from the initial 3 florins to six Louis d'or (equivalent to 45 florins), followed by a fall in the 1750s to three (22-4 florins): Ueber meine gelehrte Bil- dung... (Berlin and Stettin, 1799), p. 246 (note). A Louis d'or or Pistole was a standard gold piece worth 7-4 florins or 5 imperial dollars: Walter H. Bruford, Germany in the Eighteenth Century: The Social Background of the Literary Revival (Cambridge, 1952), p. 330. 20. Lessing, Werke, 8 Vols. (Miinchen, 1972-79), Vol. 3; pp. 25, 63-64. 21. Lessing, Werke, Vol. 3; p. 197. 22. Lessing, Werke, Vol. 7; pp. 313-314. Before publishing excerpts, Lessing shared his manuscript of Hermann Samuel Reimarus's work with Mendelssohn, who judged the author to be "unfair" in his treatment of biblical characters: Mendelssohn to Lessing, 29 Nov. 1770, printed in GSJub, Vol. 12.1, No. 352, pp. 237-38. 22. Lessing and Elise Reimarus referred to the Wertheim Bible in correspon- dence late in 1780: Lessing to Reimarus, 28 Nov. 1780; Reimarus to Lessing, early Dec. 1780, printed in Lessing, Siimtliche Schriften, ed. Karl Lachmann (Leipzig, 1907), Vol. 18, pp. 355-56 (No. 699) and Vol. 21, pp. 314-15 (No. 873). Elise Reimarus also referred to the Wertheim Bible a few months earlier in cor- respondence with her brother-in-law August Hennings. The first instances ap- pear in Reimarus to Hennings, 18 August 1780, NL Hennings 80, Staats- und Universitditsbibliothek Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky, fol. l0b. Although Reimarus uses the abbreviation "Sch" twice, she spells out "Schmidt" in a third reference here. Her next letter to Hennings refers to her warning "in reference to your ideas about Christianity" and "in reference to Sch.[midt]": 29 August 1780, fol. 13a-b. I am indebted to Almut Spalding of the University of Illinois-Urbana, re- searcher of Elise Reimarus, for pointing out all these references. 24.

Nicolai refers to the impact of the Wertheim Bible on Germany's intellec- tual life in Ueber meine gelehrte Bildung... (Berlin and Stettin, 1799), p. 246. 26. Soon after Mendelssohn discovered the Wertheim Bible, he described having had intimate frequent conversations with Nicolai in Nicolai's garden: Mendelssohn to Lessing, 2 Aug. 1756, GSJub, Vol. 11, No. 27, p. 55; Nicolai to Lessing, 31 Aug. 1756, No. 28, p. 57. It is highly likely that they discussed Schmidt's book, not only because of the exciting nature of its contents for Mendelssohn but also because of the fact that it had been the center of the cen- tury's most dramatic German censorship case-a matter that Nicolai would have known well through his profession. Presumably Nicolai would have impressed on Mendelssohn the wisdom of keeping one's enthusiasms for such a heterodox work confidential. There was a continuing market in Berlin for the Wertheim Bible in the years after Mendelssohn became acquainted with it. In the autumn of 1761, the Berlin book trading and publishing firm of Haude and Spener was inquiring of Wertheim printerJohann Nehr whether it could obtain some copies at the origi-</page><page sequence="14">80 Paul Spalding nal price: Haude and Spener publishing house to Nehr, 28 Sept. 1761, Abt. Freudenberg, Rep. 22 Nr. 91, Staatsarchiv Wertheim, Wertheim. It is provocative to consider that Mendelssohn himself or other members of his circle might well have been behind this request. 27. Schmidt discusses his concern to relate the Bible to educated contempo- raries in his anonymous tracts Oeffentliche Erkldrung vor der ganzen evangelischen Kirche ... (Wertheim, 1736), pp. B2, 1-b (in Sammlung, 354-55); p. C-a (Samm- lung, 357) and Griindliche Vorstellung der Streitig*eit... (n.p. [Wertheim]: n.p. [Nehr], n.d. [1737]), unpaginated; cited in the contemporary journal of church events, Acta Historico-Ecclesiastica Vol. 2 (1737) p. 618. 28. Schmidt discusses the need for a fresh, dynamic translation in the intro- duction ("Vorrede") to his Pentateuch: WB, pp. 23-28. 29. Schmidt explains this in his "Vorrede" WB, pp. 31-33. 30. Mendelssohn discusses this in his introduction to the Pentateuch, "Or Lintivah," GSJub, Vol. 15.1, pp. 39-40; English translation by Sandmel, "A Trans- lation" pp. 85-89; German translation by Weinberg, GSJub, Vol. 9.1, pp. 55-58. 31. Mendelssohn explains this in "Or Lintivah," in a section on translations: GSJub, Vol. 15.1, pp. 40-41; English translation in Sandmel, "A Translation," pp. 92-93; German translation by Weinberg, GSJub, Vol. 9.1, pp. 59-60. 32.

Weinberg discusses Mendelssohn's reasons to carry out the publishing project, in "Einleitung" GSJub, Vol. 15.1, pp. xv-xxviii. 34. Sorkin notes Mendelssohn's polemic against contemporary biblical crit- ics: Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment, pp. 78-87. Breuer empha- sizes Mendelssohn's defense of the Masoretic text: The Limits of Enlightenment, pp. 109-75. Arkush details Mendelssohn's overall defense of biblical revelation against modern rationalists: Moses Mendelssohn and the Enlightenment, pp. 133-65. 35. Mendelssohn personally wrote only the first part of the Genesis com- mentary in his Pentateuch, the section known as the "Parashat Bereshit," cover- ing Gen. 1-6; most of the Exodus commentary; opening and closing sections of Deuteronomy; and bracketed additions to the commentary in the rest of the Pentateuch: Levenson, "Moses Mendelssohn's Understanding" pp. 5-6; Werner Weinberg, "Moses Mendelssohns Ubersetzungen und Kommentare der Bibel" Zeitschrift fiir Religions- und Geistesgeschichte, Vol. 41.2 (1989) p. 113.

Schmidt saw the "hardening" of Pharaoh against the Israelites, for in-</page><page sequence="15">Mendelssohn's Use of a Banned Bible 81 stance, as an example of God appointing evil "as a means to encourage the good" (WB Exod. 4:21n; also Exod. 9:12; 10:20; 14:4, 8, 17; and their notes). 39. Sinnhold, for instance, attacks Schmidt's usage of more Hebraic forms in Ausfiihrliche Historie, p. 19. 40. For a modern edition of Mendelssohn's Psalms, see GSJub, 10.1, ed. Werner Weinberg (Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, 1985), pp. 1-228. Sorkin comments on the influence which Luther's Bible exercised on Mendelssohn's Psalms, in Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment, p. 51. 41. My citation of the Luther Bible comes from an eighteenth-century edi- tion: Biblia, Das ist: Die ganze Heilige Schrifft Alten und Neuen Testaments Verteutschet durch D. Martin. Luther (Liineburg, 1722). 42. In his "Or Lintivah" Mendelssohn deems earlier Jewish-German transla- tions as inadequate for modern German readers, including those of Elijah Bachur [Elijah Levita or Michael Adam] (Konstanz 1544), Josel Witzenhausen (Amsterdam 1679, 2nd, ed. 1687), and Jekutiel Blitz (Amsterdam 1676-79): GSJub, Vol. 15.1: 39; English translation in Sandmel, "A Translation," pp. 85-86; German translation by Weinberg, GSJub, Vol. 9.1, pp. 55-56. Mendelssohn specifically claims to have read the translation of Blitz and found its German "very corrupt and perverted": "A Translation" p. 86. Descriptions of the three translations and selected portions of each appear in Willy Staerk and Albert Leitzmann, Die Jiidisch-Deutschen Bibeliibersetzungen von den Anfingen bis zum Aus- gang des 18. Jahrhunderts (Frankfurt a.M, 1923), pp. 114-30 (Bachur), pp. 172-77 (Witzenhausen), pp. 163-71 (Blitz). 43. Although Mendelssohn follows Schmidt's word in Exod. 13:18 and 15:22, he uses Luther's word Schilfmeer in 23.31. 44. To indicate that he is in fact making an interpolation about God "ap- pearing," Mendelssohn does use brackets in Num. 12:7. There are Jewish prece- dents for this kind of translation. In his introduction to the Pentateuch, Mendelssohn cites how Onkelos, a Jewish biblical translator of the second cen- tury C.E., made interpolations in order to avoid personifying God: GSJub, Vol. 15.1, pp. 32-33; English translation by Sandmel, "A Translation," p. 56; German translation by Weinberg, GSJub, Vol. 9.1, pp. 38-39. The many parallels to how Schmidt did this, however, still suggest his influence. 45. Mendelssohn's tendency to soften the literally direct action or presence of God finds expression also in his occasional preference to translate the He- brew word El or Elohim as "a divine being" (ein g6ttliches Wesen) or "divine beings" rather than as "God." Thus Jacob declares after his famous night of struggle, ac- cording to Mendelssohn, that he has wrestled with "divine beings" rather than God, and seen "a divine being" rather than God Himself face to face (Gen. 32:29, 31; see 35.7), a solution not much different than Schmidt's use here of the word angel. Likewise, according to Mendelssohn, "a divine being" rather than God meets the Transjordanian seer Balaam (Num. 22:9-10, 12, 20, 22, 23:4, 15-16)-a rendering quite similar to Schmidt's use here of the words vision and divine appearance. 46.
