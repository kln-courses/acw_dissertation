<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN: TOWARD A BIOSOCIAL THEORY OF AGGRESSION PIERRE L. VAN DEN BERGHE University of Washington American Sociological Review 1974, Vol. 39 (December): 777-788 Human aggression is explained in terms of resource competition. Resource competition results from both the pressure exerted by population on material resources and from socially created demands for material and psychic resources. Resource competition producesaggression which is in turn mediated through territoriality and hierarchy. The latter two have the paradoxical effect of both regulating and provoking aggression. Drawing comparative evidence from primates, I suggest that Homo sapiens rates high on territoriality, hierarchy and aggression, and that these forms of behavior are biologically predisposed. With the food growing revolution, the cultural elaborations on these biological predispositions became increasingly important; but an understanding of human behavior must necessarily be both biological and socio-cultural. In the last few years, an increasing number of anthropologists, zoologists, ethologists and primatologists have been suggesting that we look at humans as one biological species among many (Alexander, 1971; Campbell, 1972; Crook, 1970; Eisenberg and Dillon, 1970; Morris, 1967b, 1969; Simpson, 1972; Tiger and Fox, 1966, 1971, 1973). By now, most sociologists fully accept the necesssity of a cross-cultural approach to define the range of human behavior.' They continue, however, for the most part, to resist cross-specific comparisons (Mazur, 1973; Tiger and Fox, 1973) for largely dogmatic reasons. They have postulated a sharp discontinuity between human and non-human behavior, and thus refuse to accept the relevance of the latter to the former. Yet, how else are we to know what is specifically human behavior? At the risk of belaboring the obvious, let me summarize what I think we may safely accept as established facts concerning com- parative animal behavior,. with special refer- ence to mammals, and even more especially to our close relatives the higher primates (monkeys and apes). 1) The behavioral repertory of every species is determined in part by a set of biological predispositions which are at least to some extent species-specific. 2) Animal behavior is modifiable through learning in response to environmental condi- tions, and the degree to which behavior is modifiable is a function of the organism's complexity and its intelligence. 3) Many forms of behavior (known as "imprinting" or "critical period" behavior) are the product of a necessary interplay between biological predispositions and envi- ronment, which points to the artificiality of opposing these two sets of behavioral determinants. 4) The above propositions hold for both human and non-human behavior, most cer- tainly for mammalian behavior; and the "uniqueness" of human behavior has been misunderstood. Human behavior is indeed unique in the sense that the behavioral repertory of every species is unique in some respects, but human behavior is not radically discontinuous from that of other species. Man is not unique in transmitting socially learned behavior, and there is no reason to assume that our biological make-up does not effect our behavior when it so clearly affects that of other species. Indeed, it makes no sense to 1 This paper has benefited from a critical reading by Robert Burgess, Pamela Kennedy, Pepper Schwartz, David Spain, and Lionel Tiger. To my mentor, George Homans, I owe, among many other things, an apology for my irreverent pastiche, on the tenth anniversary of the publication of his "Bringing Men Back In." 777</page><page sequence="2">778 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW divorce behavior from biology, since the behavior of any species is so directly linked with its biological evolution. The implication of these propositions is that we should conceptualize human behavior much as we do that of other mammals, namely as the product of a complex interplay of bio-genetical and environmental factors. That is, the human body is not simply a bundle of drives (hunger, sex, etc.) and a set of capabilities (opposable thumbs, a large convoluted brain, vocal cords, upright stat- ure), a mere carnal vector, as it were, for an infinitely malleable culture. For all the plasticity and diversity of behavior on which we pride ourselves, our behavioral repertoire, though probably greater than that of any other animal known to us, is far from infinite. There is such a thing as human nature, just as there is a chimp nature, or an elephant nature. Our basic question is: why is man so aggressive compared to other mammals, and especially to other primate species? My argument, derived in large part from the work of zoologists, primatologists and ethologists (Collias, 1944; Kummer, 1968, 1970, 1971; Scott, 1958, 1962; Stokes, n.d.; Washburn and Hamburg, 1968; Wynne-Edwards, 1965), runs as follows: the root cause of aggression is competition for resources. There are two basic ways of regulating that competition: territori- ality which establishes monopoly rights over resources within a portion of usable space, and hierarchy which creates an order of precedence in access to, and distribution of, resources. The relationship between territori- ality and hierarchy on the one hand and aggression on the other is twofold. So long as hierarchy and boundaries are accepted, aggression is inhibited; but it is in the nature of both boundaries and hierarchies that they are not suffered gladly. Both are violently challenged and no less violently defended. Keen resource competition leads to the development of either territoriality, or hier- archy, or both to prevent a constant war of all against all; but, at the same time, the more hierarchy and territoriality there are, the more numerous the occasions for the aggressive challenge and defense of monopoly and privilege. Thus, species tend to be aggressive to the degree that they are hierarchical and/or territorial. Population pressure is obviously related to resource competition. Holding resources constant, increased density will lead to increased aggression through increased pressure on material resources. In addition to population pressure on material resources, resource competition, and thus aggression, in Homo sapiens are also greatly exacerbated by socially created demands for both material and psychic resources. (See Schema 1) Homo sapiens scores higher on territori- ality, hierarchy, aggressivity, and population pressure than most mammals, and nearly all of our nearest relatives, the higher primates.2 This is so because he competes more fiercely and constantly over a wider range of both material and social resources than any other species, so wide a range, in fact, that his needs have become insatiable. Human needs are insatiable because they are in such great part social and artifactual rather than simply material. Human aggression has, in the first instance, a biological basis in territoriality and hier- archy; but since the "Neolithic Revolution" (the development of agriculture a few thousand years ago), the cultural elaboration on our biological propensities towards territo- riality, hierarchy, and aggression has caused a quantum jump in these phenomena which must now be understood in both biogenic and sociogenic terms. Before returning to the main argument, however, I must attempt to do briefly three things: 1) Define my basic terms, since consider- able controversy surrounds their use. 2) Establish that Homo sapiens does indeed score highly on these variables compared to other primates. 3) Since my argument will be in good part cross-specific, establish that three of these traits, aggressiveness, hierarchy and territori- ality, are built into our in-born behavioral repertoire, though obviously also elaborated on culturally, and greatly modifiable through learning and environmental conditions. If I seem to stress especially biological factors, it is not because I deem them overwhelmingly determinant of behavior, but rather because they have been so over- 2The literature on primate behavior has grown enormous in the last decade, and much of it is of excellent quality; this has not saved it from being largely ignored by sociologists except in incidental footnotes in introductory texts. Among the best summaries of that literature are Kummer (1971), and Morris (1967a).</page><page sequence="3">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN 779 SCHEMA I: A CAUSAL MODEL OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULATION PRESSURE, AGGRESSION, TERRITORIALITY AND HIERARCHY Population Pressure Socially Created Needs Resource Competition Aggression Territoriality Hierarchy whelmingly ignored in social science. What seems no longer tenable at this juncture is any theory of human behavior which ignores biology and relies exclusively on socio-cultural learning as an explanation, as does, for instance, Bandura (1973) in his theory of aggression. Learning theorists, social behavior- ists and cultural determinists are not wrong in stressing the importance of adaptive learning in response to environmental conditions. Indeed, man, not-withstanding his greater virtuosity, is far from being alone in his capacity to learn and adjust. Rather, most social scientists have been wrong in their dogmatic rejection and blissful ignorance of the biological parameters of our behavior. A systematic re-examination by social scientists of the biological basis of behavior is long overdue. By aggression, I mean physical assault or the threat thereof directed at a co-specific (i.e., a member of the same biological species). Predation (i.e., killing other species for food) is clearly not aggression. Thus, the "killer- ape" theory of human aggression (namely that we are aggressive because we became pre- datory for a few million years of our primate evolution) does not make much sense (Ardrey, 1961). It may explain why so many of us find killing such good fun, but not why we so often kill our fellow men in anger. Leopards do a lot of killing, but are not very</page><page sequence="4">780 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW aggressive animals. Baboons are relatively aggressive primates, but do little killing. Humans kill a lot of other animals for fun and profit, and of fellow humans in anger or in self-defense. While both forms of behavior are probably in-born, they are very different nonetheless. Territoriality means the defense of a relatively fixed space against occupation and/or use by co-specifics. It is to be distinguished from the concept of "social space" which is an imaginary space that moves with ego. Thus when I keep my physical distance from other people, wherever I happen to be, I am not engaging in territorial behavior. Neither am I being territorial when I try to keep blue jays out of my garden. I am, however, territorial when I endeavor to keep my neighbor's children out of my house or garden. Species, such as baboons or macaques, that forage in areas that may subsequently be used without challenge by other bands of the same species, and that do have a social space around the group which may not be invaded with impunity are said to have "home-ranges," but are not territorial, as defined here.3 Finally, by hierarchy I shall mean a relatively stable rank order between co- specifics which determines preferential access to desirable resources, including the labor and sexual favors of co-specifics. Hierarchy is expressed through dominance-submission be- havior, which is typically highly ritualized in many primate species, and which often assumes a pseudo-sexual form, such as presenting the genitalia, displaying the penis, mounting, and the like. (In North American culture, we speak of getting "screwed", "shafted" or "fucked" to mean being on the losing side of a relationship.)4 Next, I have to show that Homo sapiens, compared to most other mammals, and particularly primates, is highly aggressive, densely settled, hierarchical, and territorial. About the first three, there is, I believe, little argument to the contrary. No mammal species comes even close to our rate of aggressiveness, and especially of lethal aggressiveness. Many other species display aggression and even engage in stylized combat, but almost never to the point of killing each other. In nearly all mammals except man, the first signal of submission on the part of the losing animal automatically inhibits aggressiveness in the victor. Thereafter, the loser is typically ignored by the winner. Humans can surrender in combat; but, as we well know, prisoners are almost never ignored and allowed to trot off peaceably: they are killed, tortured, muti- lated, raped, incarcerated, eaten, enslaved, or, if they are lucky, exchanged or ransomed. The old Roman saying, homo hominid lupus, is clearly slanderous to wolves. If it were true, we should be far better off. That we are overcrowded hopelessly beyond the hunting and gathering mode of 3The term territoriality covers a rather wide range of behavior which varies greatly from species to species. Some species defend territory primarily by marking with scent (e.g. dogs); others by aggressive threat displays or vocalizations (e.g. gibbons). Some animals defend territory primarily for breeding purposes, others mostly for exclusive exploitation of resources. The significant fact is not so much the diversity of forms of territoriality between species, (Klepfer, 1968) but the relative fixity of it within a species. For example, man defends his territory both by marking and by aggression; he has both breeding territories (the home), and territories for monopolis- tic resource exploitation (farms, mines, fishing territories, international boundaries). Indeed, man has even gone to the extent of reshaping the territorial behavior of another species, namely the dog, to defend his own. Man tries (rather unsuccessfully) to curb the marking behavior of his domesticated dog, and rechannels (rather success- fully) the aggressiveness of the dog to defend his territory against other humans. The man-dog relationship is one of the great success stories of symbiosis. Two hunting and scavenging species drew on their complementary skills to become more efficient killers than either could have been by itself. In addition, the dog became man's first (and cheapest) early warning system. The ability of the dog to adopt his master's prejudices in the way he defends human territory is nothing short of extraordinary. It has been widely observed, for example, that in racist societies, dogs, too, become racist, often without conscious training of their masters. In South Africa, for example, dogs of white owners tend to reserve their most ferocious barking for blacks. 'This pseudo-sexual character of dominance- submission behavior suggests that gender inequality, which is present in most primates, and markedly so in terrestrial primates, has become a generalized model for other forms of inequality as well. Besides gender, the other fundamentally biological inequal- ity in primates is, of course, age; and it is interesting to note that the subordinate partner in a sexual relationship is almost invariably the younger one. In humans, this is true both of heterosexual and homosexual relationships. I have dealt with age and sex inequality at length elsewhere (van den Berghe, 1973).</page><page sequence="5">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN 781 existence for which our hominid evolution prepared us is likewise evident. Our over- crowding has grown steadily for many thousands of years, and the rate at which it grows is itself geometric. Asforhierarchy, it is equally obvious that no mammal is as stratified as we are.5 Many other species, to be sure, have a "pecking" or precedence order, often based on strength, which allows the observer to rank order the individuals of a group. A few highly hierarchized primates such as baboons and macaques even have ruling oligarchies of adult males, and there is some evidence of infant monkeys "inheriting" socially the status of their mothers, thus suggesting the incipient existence of social classes among some subhuman primates. Many primate species, however, especially the arboreal ones such as gibbons, lemurs, and others, have almost no dominance order. No mammal species comes close to Homo sapiens in the elaborateness, and multiplicity of invidious distinctions. This leaves territoriality, a concept with which sociologists are not accustomed to work, and thus a phenomenon which many are not prepared to recognize in humans. Man is not only highly territorial, but he is territorial at practically every level of social organization: the family has its home, the juvenile gang its "turf," the ethnic group its ghetto, the state its national territory. Even monastic orders and "counter-culture" communes dedicated to ideals of equality and propertylessness post no-trespassing signs against outsiders, and establish pecking orders between their mem- bers. Few higher primates are highly territorial (the gibbon being an exception), and many are scarcely territorial at all (e.g., chimpanzees, and most terrestrial primates such as ba- boons). Even highly territorial animals are almost invariably territorial at one level only, that of the individual or the reproductive "family" unit (mother and offspring, or mates).6 There remains the most controversial task of arguing that aggression, hierarchy and 5A classic ploy of sociologists in rejecting the validity of cross-specific comparisons is to deny that the same categories of behavior apply to humans and other animals. In the case at hand, for instance, it is claimed that stratification in human societies differs fundamentally from a dominance order among other animals. The truth of the matter is that both individual and collective forms of hierarchy are found in both human and non-human societies. Age segregated juveniles or ruling oligarchies so common among savanna baboons, for example, are every bit as much social classes as their counterparts in human societies. Human social class can be far more elaborate, of course; but there is no reason for refusing to use the same conceptual categories of behavior across species, provided one bewares of anthropomorphism. The same anti-comparative argu- ment has been used in relation to aggression. Organized human aggression as in war, it has been argued, is radically different from individual violence found in other animals. Here too, both human and non-humans engage in both individual and collective violence. Ruling oligarchies of baboons, for instance, often gang up in a quite organized manner against challengers. If the fear of anthropomorphism were to stifle any attempt at cross-specific comparisons of behavior, then the fear of ethnocentrism should have killed off anthropology long ago. 6 Here I disagree with Mazur (197 3) who concludes that human territoriality is not, at least in part, biologically determined. His entire argument is phylogenetic. He attempts to show that the more closely related species are phylogenetically, the more likely they are to share behavioral traits in common. Conversely, he argues that if behavioral traits can be shown to be shared by closely related species, then they can be presumed to be biologically determined. Up to a point, the argument is cogent; but the reciprocal does not follow. When two closely related species exhibit different patterns of behavior, it does not follow that, therefore, these patterns are not biogenic. For instance, the Hamadryas baboon has a social organization and a mating pattern quite different from those of closely related species of savannah baboons (Kummer, 1968, 1971;Washburn and DeVore, 1961). In a famous incident when zoo conditions interfered with the natural sex ratio in a colony of Hamadryas baboons, a deadly pandemoni- um broke loose, with several monkeys killed. Hamadryas baboons behave much the same whether in zoos or in the wild, and so do other baboons, thus indicating considerable inborn predisposition of behavior. Yet, those morphologically nearly identical species behave quite differently from each other. The fallacy in Mazur's argument is the assumption that biological evolution is necessarily very slow and is not easily reversible. There is no reason to assume that such biological adaptations to environment as sexual dimorphism for example, cannot be appre- ciably modified in a few scores of generations (a few thousand years, on the human time scale). This is a much shorter span of evolution than that which separates even fairly closely related species, and certainly man from any other primate. As regards territoriality, the various species of gibbons (who are apes and thus close relatives of Homo sapiens) share with man a high degree of territoriality. So do many lower primates, though it is true that chimpanzees, gorillas and most terrestrial Old World monkeys are not highly territorial. Human territoriality, much like that of gibbons and of many lower primates, shows too much uniformity and universality within the species, however, to enable one to discount the biogenic hypothesis.</page><page sequence="6">782 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW territoriality are, despite a wide range of cultural elaboration, part of our biological heritage. Our run-away demography is, of course, largely a cultural achievement, being the result of vast improvements in productive and medical technology. Here, we cannot adduce any firm proof, but simply present presumptive evidence. Perhaps the best presumption that a behavior pattern is at least in part biogenetically determined is its universality within a species. This is especially true of Homo sapiens with his wide range of cultural adaptations to his widely different habitats. The near ubiquity of man on our planet is an adaptive feat shared by very few species, and then mostly by species that are symbiotic with, or parasitic on, man, such as fleas, dogs and rats. The probability of the same basic behavioral syndrome being arrived at in all or nearly all cultures in the absence of any biological predisposition is very slender indeed. My argument here is that, although the detailed cultural manifestations of human aggression, hierarchy and territoriality vary greatly, the basic species-wide aspects of these phenomena are too similar to enable one to reject the hypothesis of at least partial biogenic determination. Homicidal aggression exists in all or practically all cultures, and some forms of it are condoned practically everywhere. A few cultures are said not to engage in warfare, but they are characterized either by extremely low population densities (e.g., the Eskimos) or by extreme weakness in relation to their neighbors (e.g., the Pygmies in relation to neighboring Bantu groups). In the first case, competition for resources is minimized; and, in the latter, avoidance of war is the result not of a peace-loving nature, but of a realistic fear of being wiped out. There is hardly a culture which is not riddled with interpersonal or inter-group conflict, although some cultures are somewhat more successful than others in suppressing some of the outward violence characteristic of human aggression. Both hierarchy and territoriality as we shall see later are simultaneously means of suppressing aggression (when people "know their place," a locution that interestingly expresses pecking order in territorial terms), and a source of aggression. Additional evidence for the biolog- ical basis of aggression is the degree to which it is hormonally controlled through testoster- one both in humans and in other mammals. Differences in hormonal levels explain why males are consistently more aggressive than females, not only among humans, but in most other mammalian species as well. As for hierarchy, it is true that many societies are classless according to the usual definitions of class. However, all human societies are clearly hierarchized at least by age and sex (adult males being dominant over adult females, adults of either sex being dominant over children, and older children being dominant over younger children), and almost invariably by at least a loose kind of prestige hierarchy among adult males as well. That is, the least hierarchical of human societies are approximately as stratified as the most hierarchical of the non-human primate societies, like the various baboon and macaque species. Most human societies are, of course, much more elaborately hierarchical than this. Beyond the sheer fact that Homo is always hierarchicus (Dumont, 1970), there are rather striking cross-cultural similarities in the specific behavioral repertoire of dominance and submission. Thus, in most cultures, dominance is expressed through a posture of standing taller or higher, while.isubmission is manifested through bowing or crouching. Without knowing anything about a foreign culture, the stranger can gain through superficial observation a fairly accurate picture of its hierarchy. This would hardly be possible if the "grammar" of hierarchy were purely or even primarily cultural, as the grammar of speech was long thought to be.7 At first glance, it would appear that the expressions of territoriality are quite diverse in Homo sapiens. Some cultures are nomadic, others sedentary. Some stress individual land tenure, while others are more communal. Some specify international boundaries to the last meter, while others happily tolerate vast As regards speech, too, there is increasing speculation among linguists, that there might be an underlying, innate "generative grammar" common to all forms of human speech (Chomsky, 1968). Certainly, the way in which speech is acquired is amazingly similar in all cultures, and occurs at the same age (in the second year of life) thereby suggesting a similarity with phenomena of imprinting and "critical period" learning. Gender identification, acquired nearly univerally and irreversibly by human young, roughly at the same time as speech, probably falls in the same category of imprinting phenomena, necessitating a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors at a crucial and limited time during the individual's maturation period.</page><page sequence="7">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN 783 stretches of no man's land or every man's land. This cultural diversity, however, hides profound similarities. First, the universality of territoriality in the species is striking. In no society that I know of, can a stranger simply enter someone else's home without some ritual of warning and harmless intent. In all or nearly all human societies, the family unit (nuclear or extended) has some territorial space (if only an alcove in a "long-house"), even where the stress is on communalism. Even monks and nuns have individual cells. If it were not for territoriality, why would not each monk go and sleep where the fancy struck him? Similarly, nearly all societies specify international boundaries (though not always precise ones). These boundaries can be crossed by strangers, as indeed can the boundaries of family territory, but subject to special conditions that do not apply to the owners or natives. Moreover, these conditions are strikingly similar throughout the species: -basically, the stranger must give warning of his presence (e.g., through some kind of noise) and must go through a ritual of harmless intent. Above all, he cannot show any aggressiveness, but must assume a meek, subservient posture, unless he is prepared to face aggressive territorial defense behavior. As for the "bio-grammar" of hierarchy, the "bio-grammar" of territorial behavior is sufficiently universal in Homo sapiens for any total stranger to behave in such a way as to avoid being killed for territorial invasion. The roles of guest and host are astonishingly universal (about as universal, for example, as the bio-grammar of sexual attraction which is also highly transferable cross culturally, but not at all cross-specifically); and violations of these rules unleash violent conflict. The sheer fact that thousands of explorers, travellers, missionaries and the like have lived to tell the tale of friendly contacts with total strangers is powerful evidence for the existence of a species-specific bio-grammar of territorial behavior. The negative cases of those who got killed are generally traceable to universally recognizable transgressions of territorial be- havior (such as carrying weapons, and behaving arrogantly and aggressively). Let us return to the main aim of this paper, which is to suggest a hypothesis accounting for the remarkably high level of human aggression. There are at least three main theories of human aggression recently advanced by ethologists, paleontologists and others con- cerned with human evolution. None of them is very convincing. The most widespread one, popularized, for example, by Ardrey (1961, 1966), is that man is highly aggressive because he developed as a "killer ape." The outstand- ing weakness of that theory is that it confuses two very different types of behavior: predation which is inter-specific and aggres- sion which is intra-specific. It is true that Homo sapiens, in his extensive propensity for cannibalism and other forms of exploitation of his co-specifics has tended to blur somewhat the dividing line between predation and aggression; but, even so, killing other animals for fun and profit, and killing other humans in anger are clearly distinguishable activities. The leap necessary to explain aggression in terms of predation is not warranted by the cross-specific evidence. There seems to be little if any relationship between the two phenomena, and thus little ground to accept such a relationship in humans. A second theory of aggression, advanced by Konrad Lorenz (1966), is that aggression is common to a great many species, but that basically species fall into broad categories: either their biological endowment to kill is meager, like that of chickens or pigeons, and a lot of bickering goes on, but without serious consequences; or the animals have lethal natural weapons (such as wolves and other predators), but inhibitory mechanisms signify- ing defeat block aggression in the victor, and thereby prevent fatal injuries. Applied to humans, the Lorenz theory suggests that man is so lethal to his fellows precisely because he is biologically so poorly adapted to killing, and as such, has not developed effective in-born aggressive inhibition. Man kills with culturally and recently developed weapons, and has not yet had time to develop biological blocking mechanisms. Our technology of destruction has far outstripped in effect, our biological restraints. While Lorenz goes some way in explaining why human aggression is so commonly homicidal, it does little to account 'The concept of bio-grammar was developed by Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox (1971). It refers, by analogy to the grammar of a language, to the rules of behavior which are species-specific and determined by genetic factors.</page><page sequence="8">784 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW for the relatively high level of human aggression itself. Finally, a third theory, advanced by Louis Leakey, suggests that it was the humanization of man and especially the development of speech in the last quarter million years or so of human evolution, that turned man against man. The characteristically human aspect of aggression, says Leakey, is that it is organized and premeditated. This takes abstract speech. Here, I think that Leakey unwisely restricts the definition of aggression. Of course, it takes speech to plan military campaigns and execute them; but the scope of human aggression is far wider and the origin far more ancient than the more complexly organized forms of it such as warfare. Surely, mute hominids were perfectly capable of bashing each other over the head, and most probably did. In somewhat the same vein as Leakey's theory of human aggression is Bigelow's (1969). Cooperation and aggression, argues Bigelow are but two sides of the same coin. Humans cooperate for conflict, and the two qualities evolved side by side as hominids became increasingly intelligent. The more intelligent humans learned to cooperate in order better to wipe out other groups. In-group cooperation and inter-group conflict are characteristic of man. The difficulties with Bigelow's thesis are several. First, Bigelow's theory does not explain why humans should have such a powerful urge to destroy each other in the first place. Second, it does not account for intra-group aggression or inter- group cooperation, both of which occur with some frequency. Thirdly, the theory postu- lates the uniqueness of Homo sapiens and thus lacks generality. It may take brains to be cooperatively nasty, but the theory does not explain plain dumb nastiness. Besides these biological and evolutionary theories of aggression, there have, of course, been many attempts to account for aggression in terms of learning (Bandura, 1973), or in terms of psychic mechanisms such as the frustration-aggression theory (Dollard et al., 1939). The frustration-aggression theory has been the object of a vast critical literature (Allport, 1954), and its scientific status can best be described as shaky. As for social behaviorists they have indeed established that aggression, like other forms of behavior, is subject to experimental manipulation; but to say that aggression, like all behavior, is a matter of conditioning, is scarcely explan- atory of aggression as a form of behavior different from, say, salivating or copulating. So, let us try to formulate a theory of aggression which is both generally applicable to Homo sapiens as well as to other species, and which differentiates aggression from other forms of behavior. 'Cross-specifically, aggressive behavior serves the basic function of gaining access to or defending scarce resources for which other members of the same species compete. (Violence between species, which is not aggression, takes the entirely different form of seeking to eat, or to avoid being eaten.) There are two common ways of regulating com- petition for resources: territoriality and hierarchy. In the first case, a species spreads on the ground, dividing space into mutually exclusive territories to be exploited by small numbers of non-competitive individuals: lone adults, mothers and offspring, or mates. Hierarchy regulates competition by establish- ing an order of access to, or a scale of distribution of, resources between the mem- bers of a group. The common element to the two solutions of territoriality and hierarchy is that, while they regulate competition and thus aggression, they also require a great deal of aggression, both to maintain and to change. Boundaries and pecking orders are constantly tested, i.e., they are both challenged and defended. Aggression, then, is a mechanism making for both stability and change, the two ubiquitous sides of social organization. To simplify the problem, let us restrict our cross-specific comparison to the primates. We find an interesting inverse correlation in primate species between territory and hierar- chy: the territorial species are typically minimally hierarchical (even to the extent of sex equality and minimal sexual dimorphism); conversely, the hierarchical species tend not to be territorial. It is also noteworthy that the territorial species (such as gibbons and many lower primates) tend to be the most arboreal, while the hierarchical species (baboons, macaques) are more terrestrial. Chimpanzees, which are partly arboreal and partly terrestrial, seem to have the best of both worlds: abundant food minimizes competition, and they are neither territorial nor strongly hierarchical. As might be</page><page sequence="9">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN 785 expected, they show little aggression, al- though Jane Goodall has shown, in a striking simian confirmation of Marx's notion of primitive accumulation of capital, that artifi- cial feeding increases both aggression and dominance behavior. Placing large bunches of bananas in a restricted space immediately increased resource competition even though it merely added a surfeit to the already abundant food supply of the chimpanzees' rain forest habitat. This clearly suggests that, for humans and non-humans alike resource competition is not primarily a product of mere scarcity to sustain basic biological needs, but that surplus accumulation of resources is likely to lead to an escalation of secondary needs and to an intensification of resource competition, aggression and hierarchy. Per- haps the relation between resource scarcity (in relation to basic food needs) and resource competition is curvilinear. We might expect acute competition under conditions of starva- tion, least competition under conditions of satiation without surplus, and again more competition under conditions of superabun- dance. Gibbons, who live in territorial nuclear families, defend their territories through loud but bloodless screaming. Baboon aggression takes mostly the form of defending or challenging the existing hierarchy within a given troop. By now it should be clear where this argument leads us: Homo sapiens is unique among primates in being both highly hierar- chical and highly territorial. Therefore, he can be expected to be doubly aggressive: exter- nally, he fights wars of territorial defense and aggression (between states, between gangs); internally, he fights struggles for supremacy (class struggles, generational and sex conflicts, military coups, and so on). The next question is why Homo sapiens is both highly territorial and highly hierarchical. Here we get on much more speculative ground, because the answer to the problem is to be sought in hominid evolution. The living primates can give us hunches about human evolution, but they are not humans stopped dead in their evolutionary tracks. They are different species that evolved along separate tracks. We still know very little about hominid evolution. Earlier, I suggested that hierarchy was a way of regulating resource competition, but, for terrestrial primates, it is much more than that: it is a sine qua non of survival. Without the protection of trees, and lacking the fleetness of herbivores, a lone primate on the open savannah is a vulnerable morsel for the great cats, and even for pack-hunting canines. Therefore, all terrestrial primates had to seek the protection of organized numbers. That in tum, meant a coalition of adult males to defend each other and the females and infants against large predators. Early hominids were not only terrestrial primates, but terrestrial primates turned predators, or, better, turned scavengers and predators. Their social organization was probably broadly similar to that of contempo- rary baboons with the major difference that there was no need for females and infants to accompany the males on hunting-and- scavenging trips (as female and infant baboons do in foraging trips). The adult-male- dominated hierarchy of early hominids served both defensive and offensive functions, for they were both predators and potential prey. As predators, they were biologically implausi- ble. Until the relatively late development of efficient throwing weapons (spear, bow and arrow), man's ability to tackle big mammals was relatively limited. It seems more probable that his best bet, besides preying on reptiles, birds and small mammals, was to become a scavenger (like his natural symbiotic species, the dog) by stealing carcasses from the large felines. To scare large cats away, of course, took several men banding together. Early hominids opted for hierarchy and tyranny, because the egalitarian, anarchical solution of spreading out on the ground into mutually exclusive territories was not a viable option for a terrestrial primate. Why and how, then, did we become territorial as well as hierarchical? We do not know, of course, but it is at least tempting to speculate that the crucial intervening factor was population pressure. As hunters, gatherers and scavengers, hominids had definite popula- tion limits, both in the size of the band (probably around fifty, to judge by con- temporary hunters and gatherers, although the latter are far more efficient than early hom- inids), and in terms of absolute numbers that a given area could support. Yet, intelligence gave hominids the ability to fill these limits to capacity very rapidly, and thus to create strong population pressures that could be solved more quickly by homicidal aggression than by starvation. Population pressure, of</page><page sequence="10">786 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW course, was not a uniquely human predica- ment, but war seems to be a uniquely human solution to it. Survival thus meant not only banding together against biologically more adept carnivores, but banding together against competing predatory hominids, including very possibly hominids of closely related but biologically distinct species. The "killer ape" thus became not only simultaneously predator and prey to other species, but also to his own species. Through organized cannibilist war- fare, man is the only mammal to blur the otherwise sharp dividing line between intra- specific aggression and inter-specific preda- tion. Since endemic warfare between human bands has probably been universal or nearly so for hundreds of thousands if not millions of years, it is quite possible, indeed plausible, that territoriality at the band level developed as a means of regulating inter-band aggression. War was a quick and effective way to reduce population pressures; but, unfortunately, it had its dangerous and unpleasant sides. Territoriality became a way to avoid contin- uous warfare, with perhaps infanticide as a safer (to the dominant adult males) alternative for reducing population pressure. "Inter- national relations," to the extent that they developed beyond the stage of bashing one another over the head and running off with captured females, probably took the form of territorial agreements: "This is my turf, and this is yours. Let us each keep on our side." Inter-band ties may then have been further consolidated by matrimonial exchanges and incest taboos so dear to anthropologists, but it seems probable that these niceties followed rather than preceded the development of territoriality. So far, we have considered human evolution through the hunting, scavenging and gathering stages for which he evolved biologically into a highly competitive, and hence territorial, hierarchical and aggressive primate. Then came the greatest revolution in human history, the food growing one. Man suddenly found himself playing an entirely new ball game. Material resources increased dramatically; but resource competition, far from decreasing, was exacerbated by the technological breakthrough. Population ex- ploded, but even if population pressure on the band's food resources was temporarily re- lieved, the new technology suddenly meant the vast expansion of the scope of social resources, especially labor and the artifacts it could produce. Unlike natural resources, social resources and their artifactual byproducts are relatively unlimited; and unlike basic biological needs which are quickly sated, social needs are intrinsically insatiable. Surplus material pro- duction vastly increased the scope for resource competition, and the biological predispositions toward territoriality and hier- archy were culturally elaborated on far beyond the limits of the primate hunting band. As we know, surplus material pro- duction meant the rise of classes of rulers, priests, peasants and slaves, of centralized states, of organized means of violence and coercion, of a technology of destruction which immensely increased the lethality of human aggression, of alienation of land and of the product of labor from the producers, of population density and concern for Lebens- raum. In short, with the enormous cultural jump that agriculture represented for human- ity, Homo sapiens intensified and elaborated culturally on his biological predispositions toward territoriality and hierarchy. Let us now return to the problem of aggression. Ethologists have long known that population density, or better, population pressure, in many species is directly related to aggression. With some species, there even seems to be a fairly definite threshold beyond which any increase in crowding unleashes a veritable orgy of aggression in an otherwise relatively unaggressive animal. For man, there does not appear to be such an absolute threshold, but the evidence linking aggression and population pressure is strong. If crimi- nologists, for example, spent more time correlating violent crime rates (and violent police behavior and other forms of counter- aggression) with population pressure, they might change their perspective considerably. The negative correlation, for instance, be- tween violent crime rate and social class might well be a spurious one, with population pressure as the intervening variable: crowded urban proletarians appear to have high rates of violent crimes, but not, it seems, uncrowded peasants.9 9No doubt, the relationship between crime and population density is not a simple one. Some highly crowded areas such as Tokyo seem to have much</page><page sequence="11">BRINGING BEASTS BACK IN 787 We are now in a position to specify somewhat better the parameters of a six- variable model of human aggression. Resource competition within the species (including competition for human resources, notably control of labor and sex), leads to aggression. Population pressure is one of the main factors aggravating resource competition, and thus aggressiveness. Equally important in recent human history (last six to eight thousand years), are the socially created needs, which, being intrinsically insatiable, maintain a high level of resource competition even after basic biological needs are sated. Aggression in turn is managed or suppressed through the main mechanisms of territoriality and hierarchy. The former defines monopolistic rights of resource exploitation within a given space. The latter establish a rank-order of access to, and/or a scale of distribution of, both material and social resources. However, territoriality and hierarchy not only manage and suppress aggression; they also provoke it. Aggression is only suppressed so long as territoriality and hierarchy are tolerated by all parties conceded. Both territoriality and hierarchy, however, evoke challenge, as do other forms of privilege; and the challenge in turn evokes counter-aggression. The funda- mental contradiction in territoriality and hierarchy is that, while they appear to regulate aggression, and, therefore, to provide a solution to it, they also contain within them a dialectic of conflict: territorial rights and hierarchical privileges are both aggressively defended and challenged. Homo sapiens, being the most hierarchical, territorial, and for his size, densely settled, mammal, it should not surprise anyone that he is also the most lethally aggressive to his own species and devastatingly predatory on other species. Territoriality and hierarchy are the dual answer to the Hobbesian problem of order that so long obsessed sociologists. But they are not a very good answer because they simultaneously cause and suppress aggression. They prevent our being constantly at each others' throats, but they also insure that the social order based on force which they create will be violently challenged and no less violently defended. Surely, there must be a better way to manage our affairs. The point of view presented here is not one of biological determinism pure and simple. Rather, I suggest that, for both humans and "lower" animals, behavior is the product of a complex interaction of biological predispositions and environmental conditions. To say that we must be prepared to entertain seriously the hypothesis that we are by nature aggressive, territorial and hierarchical does not mean that we are slaves to our glands. As I have stressed, the extent to which our capacity or propensity for aggression is exercised is a function of many environmental variables, both physical and man-made, which make for varying levels and types of resource competi- tion. The development of culture in man (also present in other primate species, but in much more rudimentary form) does make for some discontinuity. However, a holistic view of human behavior makes it imperative that we also look at the important continuities between ourselves and other species, instead of only singing the praise of our discontinu- ities. Our cultural capability has allowed us to transform our environment so profoundly as to make our biological adaptations obsolete, or, worse, maladaptive. In Desmond Morris' (1969) ironic simile, we have caged ourselves in zoos of our own creation; and like caged animals, we have developed pathological forms of behavior: our concern for status has become obsessive; our territorial imperative has become rapaciously acquisitive beyond any need for survival; and our weaponry has increased a million-fold the destructiveness of our aggressiveness. The obvious need now is to develop our capacity for controlled biosocial change. Thi-s we can only do if we first realize that the problem exists. If we are to have any chance of success in controlling the nefarious effects of our acquisitive territoriality, our status striving, our aggressiveness and our run-away fertility, we must understand better the lower rates for crimes of violence than relatively less crowded areas such as Detroit, thus indicating a wide range of cultural variability. However, within a society (i.e. controlling for culture), the relationship between violent crime and population density seems to hold. Even then, it is far from perfect; but even if density were to account for, say, no more than 20 or 30% of the variance within a culture, it would still be a significant finding. After all, population density is only a crude indicator of population pressure. Spatial resources are only one of a whole range of resources, competition for which produces aggression.</page><page sequence="12">788 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW biological parameters of the social behavior of our species. The recognition that our behavior is in part biologically determined is by no means a counsel of despair. Biology is no more destiny than history is. The assumption that biological evolution moves at a desper- .ately slow pace is made patently obsolete by our biological technology. Animal breeders have long known how rapidly controlled biological selection can modify a species. The spectre of eugenics conjures staggering ethical problems, of course; but sticking our social scientific heads into the biological sand (a slander on the ostrich, by the way) is hardly a solution either.
