<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Interview with Steve Fagin PETER WOLLEN The following is an edited transcript of an interview, conducted in the spring of 1987, concerning Steve Fagin's two feature-length videotapes. Virtual Play: The Dou- ble Direct Monkey Wrench in Black's Machinery (1984) is a video essay on repre- sentation, narrative, and love humorously woven through the life of Lou Andreas Salome, the turn-of-the-century romantic intellectual who captivated, among others, Freud, Nietzsche, and Rilke. The Amazing Voyage of Gustave Flaubert and Raymond Roussel (1986) is organized around the lives and writings of two solipsistic, indulgent, maternally obsessed personalities who, as it has been said of Balzac, "saw nothing and remembered everything." The mood of the tape fluctuates between vaudeville and opera, and the narrative unfolds in the form of letters, diary entries, and postcards -all fictitious. Both tapes are distributed by The Kitchen and Video Data Bank. Wollen: How did you first get into video? I guess there is always a shadow to that question: why video rather than film? Fagin: The shadow that film casts is quite long. In fact, sometimes I feel like Cary Grant, in North by Northwest, pursued by an ominous, noisy thing casting a large shadow on the flat landscape. I really wrestled with the option of doing the Lou Salome project on film, but it didn't seem to fit. The financial demands of film are tremendous. Both the Salome and the Roussel and Flaubert pieces would have cost twenty to thirty times more in film than in video. I wanted to work cheaply to show that good work in time-based art could be done inexpensively, out of one's piggy bank. Sometimes I feel I'm Rumplestiltskin trying to weave straw into gold. Other reasons for working in video related to a general sense of film's losing its experimental edge; this is especially the case with the feature in the United States. Yvonne Rainer and Mark Rappaport remained positive exam- ples, but so many other filmmakers have crossed over into something called deconstructive mainstream cinema, which I distrust immensely. Also, the format of video production really turns me on. The indulgence of improvisation, the ability to work off the monitor - things just feel so resilient. I guess in the end I always think of cinema in terms of Bazin's story about rushing to the set of To</page><page sequence="2">76 OCTOBER Catch a Thief to watch the master at work, only to find the crew eagerly working and the great Hitchcock sound asleep. In addition, at least in the experimental venues, there no longer seemed to be a place where something could really happen. I remember reading about the splash Snow made in the mid-'60s with Wavelength. Video still seems to have events--the World Video Festival in the Hague and the American Film Institute Video Festival--where everyone is. Of course, the same people appear in both contexts. I was amazed at how few people constituted the world of video validation. I didn't mind seeing them over and over again; I just wished they had changed clothes between Holland and Los Angeles. Wollen: I have a follow-up question on the specificity of video. In your tape we see backdrops, close-ups, ECU's, miniatures, a very shallow space with bright, satu- rated colors, not very many camera movements, a preference for frontal shots and for "low altitude" top shots. Was this a visual strategy that you thought about in advance? Or did it evolve, did you find yourself adapting to the me- dium? Do you think the medium has that sort of aesthetic specificity? Fagin: When I decided to work in video, I sat down and watched a lot of MTV. In fact one New Year's Eve I sat home and watched all 100 top rock videos. Wollen: But music videos tend to have three-dimensional sets. They have a deeper space. Fagin: That's when they are originally shot in film. When shot in video they're extremely flat. I came to the conclusion that visually video combined two or three traditions from painting and very little from film. One is a postimpression- ist sense of space, like Cezanne's. Two is obviously a pop use of color, which comes out of video's/TV's formative years. And three is an ability to overlay materials and spaces from different traditions, which pushes the work in two directions: toward a collage aesthetic derivative of someone like Rauschenberg, and a Byzantine sense of space attached to early Madonna-and-child icons. But the two-dimensionality of my work relates to the fact that I only have sight in one eye. When people ask me why my work lacks the third dimension, I tell them I don't believe in the third dimension, only the second and the fourth. Wollen: You mean the fourth dimension in Duchamp's sense? Fagin: This emphasis on two-dimensional space also relates to specific issues which grow out of the projects. In the Salome tape there's an interview with a photography historian who discusses how the nineteenth-century portrait always used flat backdrops. And there's the picture of Salomb, Ree, and Nietzsche used in the tape which has such a backdrop. So fake flat backdrops are used in a</page><page sequence="3">An Interview with Steve Fagin 77 .............. i .... .. -iiiZ Steve Fagin. Virtual Play. 1984. (All photographs and stills: Margaret Hussey.)</page><page sequence="4">78 OCTOBER perverse sense to respect the nineteenth-century photograph, which that culture used to authenticate itself. It's my gesture toward "realism." Also, the flattening out of space allows me to juxtapose objects from different materials to produce a synthetic but rather uniform space, one similar to a rebus, where areas of people, pictures from books, and writing overlap, producing a zone of exchange among them. There's also an effort to animate the museum diorama. I believe it was Michelet who remarked that after his visit to the natural history museum in Paris, as a child, he felt history had come to life, and this inspired him to be a historian. Duchamp's glass became very important to me, and it related to several different ideas: a space more conceptual than retinal; the third dimension as a fold between the second and fourth, appearing only as a shadow; the sense of a bachelor/bride relation in the piece. But in terms of specific video aesthetics, what interests me is the sound/image relation and how different it is from film. In cinema, even in an extreme example like Earthquake, in "Sensaround," where the sound is literally above, below, and behind you, it still feels firmly rooted in the screen in front of you. Wollen: What about the "dimension" of sound? Fagin: I have never bought the arguments about Duras and the voice-off. In the cinema, at least at the level of enunciation, one never feels the voice is off screen. And ironically, in regard to Duras, for me the work is quite childlike, things speaking, the water, a bridge, a tree, and so on. Video is very different; techni- cally the sound in video is better than the sound in film, and the image in video is small. One's attention can be pulled off the image, toward sound and the space in between; the darkness becomes quite active. My aesthetic is based on that possi- bility, where you have a sort of Cornell box waiting, unavailable, tacky, flat, which you reach toward, and the sound is very full and energizing. The sound shocks the image to life, like Frankenstein's monster. Wollen: In most people's minds there is probably a contrast, a tension, between video, which is regarded as ultra-contemporary and high-tech, and the subject matter of your tape: the web of references to the late nineteenth century, a lost prevideo age, Roussel, Flaubert, the photographic backdrop, the optical toy, the museum diorama. How do you see this working - this curious juxtaposition of a contemporary medium with Victorian and fin-de-siecle material? Fagin: There's a quote from Nabokov that I like, that the future is the obsolete in reverse. On one level it's similar to my respecting and using fake backdrops, to dealing with the historical distance between me and the nineteenth century by using my own authenticating machine, TV. On another level, Europe and the nineteenth century are posed as an unavailable other, which needs to be put through secondary revision, American popular culture, so that we can have</page><page sequence="5">An Interview with Steve Fagin 79 anything to hold onto at all. Nineteenth-century Europe as the dream, and America as the daydream. Also, the project is posed in relation to the novel, but with TV as intermediary. I produced a makeshift machine using found objects to stand in for the novel, working as a sort of twentieth-century Robinson Crusoe using whatever bric-a-brac was available. Wollen: Doesn't the machine function as an emblem of the late nineteenth century: Edison's optical machine, the "machine" of academic painting, Roussel's bizarre textual machines? And you look back at them from the new electronic age? Fagin: There's a machine in Impressions ofAfrica, cumbersome, but able to tell the weather perfectly. After many generations of prosperity, the culture grew tired of the practical side of the machine and concentrated on its aesthetic qualities instead, admiring its elaborate construction. After several generations, they had entirely forgotten how to read it to tell the weather. Eventually the culture was overrun by storms and drought and, on the verge of extinction, tried to recover the lost art of reading this awkward objet d'art. But instead of trying to decode the top half, which was the relevant half, they concentrated on the bottom, reading a few badly scrawled, meaningless marks left in the sand. My relation to the nineteenth-century novel is like this, a relation to the bottom half. Wollen: I'd like to zoom in on Roussel and Flaubert, "fathers" who specialized in the exotic. Why-let's start with Roussel-why him? Fagin: As usual with an obsession, I've forgotten the initial impetus. I think I was attracted to the level of detail by which he is known to us, how many times he changed shirts, the fact that he never traveled to places he had been to as a child, never opened letters, was afraid of germs, etc. -all these seem so much a part of his reputation. But on the other hand, there is so little written which can be considered comprehensive biography; this surely overlaps with my interest in Lou Salome. They both seemed to be infinitely generatable at the periphery, transparent at the edges and totally opaque at the center. There is a void at the so-called core. Wollen: When Roussel traveled, he always kept the blinds drawn. Fagin: All these sorts of details stuck in my mind and are repeated in the piece. There is also in my piece a lot of Locus Solus, which I thought to be spectacular. Its relation to language, representation, its weavings of story into myth, with language blocking up and backfiring, producing lots of images, but failing to depict a world; the more the language describes, the more the images fall apart. It is fabulous, and I wanted to unravel its writing process and psychoanalytic</page><page sequence="6">80 OCTOBER makeup, to deconstruct it and at the same time reproduce a double of it, an invocation. Wollen: Did you use Roussel's system of composition, which he explains in How I Wrote Certain of My Novels? Owen Land works in a Rousselian way in The Marriage Broker Joke according to Sigmund Freud, and I used techniques derived from Roussel in Crystal Gazing. Or were you more interested in the projection of an exotic "other," the obsession with machines, the weird personal details? Fagin: All of the above. I really had trouble writing; and the level of ecstasy, then withdrawal, then system that allowed Roussel to start writing very young, then stop writing altogether, and then begin working in a systematic way was some- thing that intrigued me. I decided to work from theoretical texts, or movies I liked, or baseball games I had gone to; I would take notes of these things, then leave the so-called original material aside, and several months later pick up the notes and write stories from them. I found this comforting in the sense that I already knew I had something I loved. I had a grid to work from, so I didn't have to face the empty page, and it allowed me to produce combinations of words and story twists that I don't think I would have otherwise. For instance there's a story I told about books. The first book, Empire of Flora, is the title of a Cy Twombly painting. He interests me tremendously. A line, some scribbles, color, and then a title like The Veil of Orpheus. I feel two ways at once about Twombly's work. It is about gesture, the painter's hand, etc., and then like an archeological object full of hope of a lost civilization restored but charred almost past the point of recognition. Much of my work strives toward this sense of being both very close to some origin and full of death. So I say that Cy Twombly's father pitched in the major leagues, and I like baseball, so the names are those of baseball teams, and then you have Angel, Tiger, Cardinal, Twin. . Wollen: Now I get it. Fagin: And then Cy becomes a switchword, becomes sigh, and Cy Young, the name of the award in baseball given to the best pitcher. .. Wollen: This makes it hard for the European viewer. . Fagin: Yet people often say that it's too European, not American enough. But basically I feel the work is very American and situates Europe in a particular way. So the writing process is in the spirit of Roussel, but I didn't submit totally to the system. I used it as inspiration. Wollen: In the American way. Pragmatic and can-do.</page><page sequence="7">An Interview with Steve Fagin 81 Fagin: In the American way. I cheated and made it vulgar! Wollen: Let's turn to Flaubert - the novelist, the traveler, the decadent. Do you see Flaubert as the double of Roussel, or is there a difference between them? Fagin: There's a quote from Sartre that I use: "Why Flaubert? Because he is the imaginary. With him we are at the border, the barrier of dreams." One should remember that Sartre chose Flaubert over Robespierre for his magnum opus on the construction of the subject. For me Flaubert was a rich relative. With all the advantages and disadvantages of the literary validation withheld from Roussel. Initially I came across Flaubert while researching travel to exotic lands. I was impressed by his letters and also his relation to Maxime Du Camp, his traveling companion. His story is told in the received ideas section. The way Du Camp, the first photographer of ancient Egypt, would talk of Flaubert: of his languidness, his wanting to stay in and watch the world like a moving diorama. This led me to put Flaubert and Roussel together as traveling companions. The mood between them is a bit carping. First came the idea of a traveling companion, and then the idea of the companion relating to the way that Roussel wrote-with two words that sounded the same, taking the second meaning, the lesser meaning, and spinning the story off of that. So Flaubert somehow became the greater meaning. And then I read the Sartre book, which . . . Wollen: You're telling me you read the whole of Sartre's book? Fagin: I read a bit and thought, "This is good enough to read a bit more." Yale French Studies printed fragments from one of the unpublished volumes -exactly Steve Fagin. The Amazing Voyage of Gustave Flaubert and Raymond Roussel. 1986. "Line of Received Ideas." Elv~i'r</page><page sequence="8">82 OCTOBER the kind of mystery, the "missing archeological link," that really attracts me. Sartre was important to a generation of Americans just before my own - I think of "like, beatniks" snapping their fingers and quoting Sartre; a phenomenon I was never really part of. And I was overwhelmed by the way Sartre constructed Flaubert's infancy from so little information; the stories he created were so spectacular, and so cold. It's actually the only text in my piece that appears literally copied. Wollen: With "nauseating repetition," as you say in the tape. Fagin: The other source was Bouvard and Pecuchet, a novel about two people's . . Wollen: Bric-a-brac. An assemblage of bric-a-brac. Fagin: Yes, and the emphasis on copying, and the privileging of books in an effort to master the real. Also the sense of being lost in an infinite regress of quotation which eventually leads back to the beginning, simply copying. After the project, I came across a wonderful article in October by Douglas Crimp on the museum and ruins, which I thought a great companion piece to the tape. Wollen: There are two other important "virtual" characters: Flaubert's and Roussel's mothers. Now we are getting further into the Oedipal lineage. Fagin: After the Lou Salome tape I was quite lucky to have several very bright people become interested in my work. At a conference on psychoanalysis a friend of mine presented a paper on my work; since he knew that the original title of the piece was The Everyday Life of Lou Andreas Salome, he discussed it in relation to Freud and Lef&amp;bvre. But right before the talk, someone told me of an analysis which my friend had arrived at, but would not present in his paper: that my work was all about breaking up with my girlfriend. Well, the Flaubert/Roussel piece is organized around a personal incident, a very horrible eye accident I had, and a series of operations. The male narrator in the tape, someone in exile, running away, a very different amazing voyage, tries to fight off the pain of blindness in order to tell this tale of Flaubert, Roussel, the imaginary, their mothers . The work of Roussel and Flaubert, so invested in writing as a substitute for a maternal absence, trying to fill the space in ways diverting, but always insuffi- cient, is much of the terrain of the work. The mothers are stand-ins, mannequins brought to movement, somewhere between two worlds, Madonna and [the pop star] Madonna. These images as north stars guiding us into this prison of the imaginary. Often during work on the piece I felt trapped, as if in a coffin, digging through treasures, cut off from their function in exchange, being led by a voice, the sound track, which I thought would get me out of the trap. But, upon</page><page sequence="9">An Interview with Steve Fagin 83 hearing the voice, I knew it was just telling me over and over again, in different tongues, that I was trapped and would never get out. The tape is a mock journey, desperate, amused. In some ways I would have preferred to be Lautreamont- more hostile-or even Cdline, but the piece comes out more like Cornell. Several sections on the sound track, especially the one called "Penelope's Song," and the last section, where the sons are figured in conical mirrors, directly lay out and address the dilemmas of this trap. It is a bachelor journey, very sad, like the ones of Roussel and Flaubert. The effort is to pose questions not from the point of view of the hysteric, asking, "Am I a man or a woman?" Much of the work of contemporary film theory has focused on this question, but from the point of view of the obsessional, who asks, "Am I alive or am I dead?" And the world feels much different if you think, "I am dead." Wollen: To what extent do you see the "imaginary" as being on the side of the "feminine"? Perhaps I am asking why there isn't a single male character who appears directly on the image track, but posing it in a theoretical way. Steve Fagin.

Steve Fagin. The Amazing Voyage . . . , main title. Fagin: In the Flaubert/Roussel tape the feminine is that which allows the bache- lor entry into the imaginary, but the feminine is not the imaginary. The opening credit, of Ger6me's rigid guard standing in front of the opaque door, the sound of the sea bleeding through, cut to the stand-in for Roussel's mother wearing a red dress, holding a stick, guarding the ocean, dancing while she narrates the story of her son's journey, the telling never completed, broken across the tape. The tape ends with her at attention, head bowed, stick forward parallel to the sea, then the credits. Ger6me's guard returns, repainted, garishly, but unfin- ished, as bad Hawaiian music plays on the sound track. The painting is a fraud, Ger6me's forged signature at the bottom is only crudely imitated; the painting, unlike the work of Ger6me, has a poor sense of perspective. For me at least, as just another reader, this is not the meaning of the piece that I find especially interesting. What interests me is the piece's mobility, its evasiveness, so to speak. I think of psychoanalysis and Oedipus and remember what an uninteresting story it is. What interests me is not its deep meaning, but the fact that it's in the unconscious, subject to displacement, condensation, and the absence of negation. In its telling one can see the unconscious at work/play. My two pieces have a</page><page sequence="11">An Interview with Steve Fagin 85 complementary quality. The Salome tape is organized around the woman, but is distilled through Nietzsche, Freud, Rilke, Ree, and, most importantly for me, Victor Tausk. The Flaubert/Roussel tape takes the men as the organizing fig- ures, but images the feminized. Also, unlike the way Propp associated the Oedipus story with the coming of patriarchy, the tape -the section called "The Land of Propp"--tries to trace matriarchy's coming to power. So narrative in the tradition of The Thousand and One Nights becomes, from the side of the female, associated with the suspension of death. Wollen: Steve, I'm going to interrupt you. You know, I've written about Scheherazade. Her narration takes place in a setting which served as a screen for the projection of Orientalist fantasy- by Flaubert and by Ger6me, two of the "patrons" of your tape. Within the context of nineteenth-century Orientalism, you could interpret the tape as a succession of almahs or odalisques, confined by the images of the harem guard, which occur at the beginning and the end of the tape. So even if the "symbolic" is associated with matriarchy, the "imaginary" could be given a patriarchal reading. Steve Fagin.

Wollen: You mean the child who was brought up in the seraglio but has been excluded and looks back with regret to a lost paradise? Fagin: Yes, this is the sadness of the piece-its destiny. If I knew nothing else when I began the piece, I knew that there would be this inversion, and this is specifically dealt with in the last sections of the tape, most densely in the one called "Dying in Front of the Large Glass: The Perfect." The music: the Shangri-las singing "and that's called sad" over and over again, mixed with Bellini's Norma. The images, domesticated versions of Orientalism: Ingres's oda- lisque turned into a couch, Ger6me's Napoleon turned into a footstool, and the sphinx now a lamp - what an odd notion of ready-mades! And Magritte's Human Condition joined at the horizon line of sky and sea by a baseball game, Don Larsen and Yogi Berra, hugging, after the perfect game.

This is the only image in the tape that is perfectly still. Wollen: But not silent. Fagin: Often there is a vulgar separation, posing image on the side of the imaginary, language on that of the symbolic. One should remember that for Freud the separation is between word-presentations and thing-presentations. The tape is a game of cat's cradle interweaving the imaginary and the symbolic. Language and image are appropriated as need be, the game is always reset by the impossible, the hint of the real which causes the narrative to flee and latch on to whatever will keep it afloat. The images are animated from beyond the dead; they reek of the symbolic. Anyway, I don't see only woman, but a bachelor machine driven by the sound, the wind, and moved by the image, the sail. Wollen: What about the veil? This seems to be a very overdetermined image. It stands for the East and exoticism, it clearly connects to the harem guard, and then it also relates to the bride and thus to the bachelor; and, in addition to that, you tell the story of Zeuxis and Parrhasios toward the end of the tape, the story of a successful painting of a veil as a demonstration of trompe l'oeil. Fagin: Yes, there is much in the piece about veiling, unveiling, etc. To answer, I guess I should say a bit about meaning. When asked about the resemblance of his process to Sherlock Holmes's uncovering an enigma, getting at the heart of a story, telling the true meaning, Freud recoiled and said he thought his work not like Holmes's at all but like that of Schliemann, the man who uncovered Troy. The emphasis is in laying out, restoring things to their place, not interpreting. This is my ambition. Whether I'm right or wrong is not the point. Readings are always a question of timing anyway. The veil in the piece has two sides, one marked by red paint, which stands for both the blood of the Virgin and the stain of the son, the Shroud of Turin. A virgin already stained and a son already bloodied. A friend commented that the piece seemed to be constructed around Catholic envy, and there is a way in which Catholicism has a place for the mother that Judaism does not. Not a correct place, but one to start discussing. Between the two sides is a lining, the paste of royalty, depicted through purple satin, then displaced through a shawl worn by the Madonnaesque singer. The unveiling also relates to a turning of pages, relating the piece to reading and, in general, a series of unwrappings. But then there is the retort in the section organized around a series of packages, making exotic sounds: if unwrapped they would no longer be a gift. I guess at its most abstract the veil suggests the way the obsessional relates to his/her object of desire. It is as though a thin veil stands between him/her and the loved object, almost like a pane of glass. The tape is an exhuming, something that the nine-</page><page sequence="14">88 OCTOBER teenth century was obsessed with. Death is necessary for the obsessional to act. There's a famous psychoanalytic story about the obsessional's always imagining people to be dead so that he/she can pay his/her condolences. Maybe the piece is a condolence card. Wollen: Talking about regret and exhumation, I was struck by the number of traces of cinephilia in the tape. There are citations of many great classics: Lola Months, The Barefoot Contessa,Johnny Guitar, Morocco. Old favorites. How do you see cinephilia now in relation to the "imaginary" and to video? Fagin: Cinema is in some senses a tremendous inspiration. Part of the advantage in working in video is that it allows a more distant relation to the cinema. It becomes another arena of loss. I often say, very willfully, about the Lou Salome tape, that it's my effort to remake Lola Months, and I'm sorry I couldn't do any better. One of the sections people like the most in that tape includes Elizabeth Nietzsche and Lou Salome arguing about the status of language and truth. It's inspired by the sequence in Johnny Guitar between Sterling Hayden and Joan Crawford. Wollen: "Tell me lies. Tell me you love me." Godard takes that scene word for word in Le petit soldat. But it's as if you had shrunken the cinema into the video box of tricks. Giant images become scaled down into a world of postcards, playing cards, shells, tiny objects, toys, miniatures, all these diminutive things. Let's discuss this question of scale. I saw the TV set as an aquarium or a dollhouse. And then I related this to the Cornell boxes which are alluded to intermittently through . Fagin: I think you want to produce an anthropomorphic scale for video which would have more potential for identification. By reducing things to a certain size you are allowing an exchange. As when you make hands participating in some activity the actual size of your own hands. In some senses, ironically, when things are small, parts of your body seem the right size. So it's a way to engage the body actively, a bit life-size. Also I think there's a way in which whatever information you have in front of you can function as the full field. So you can have a picture of the Eiffel Tower which has the force of the actual thing for a second. Then when you pull back and see it's just a postcard, it's thrown into cultural relief, becomes kitsch. Wollen: It's another kind of trompe l'oeil effect. Fagin: Yes. Wollen: How did you accumulate all the objects?</page><page sequence="15">An Interview with Steve Fagin 89 Fagin: I usually steal them from people, borrow them. There are people who won't let me into their houses when I'm working on a project; they say, "Uh oh, he's back again, hide all the objects, he'll take everything!" I've also been very lucky to have people work with me who are able to make some things. But most importantly I've had a great producer, Jack Walsh. Wollen: The other cinema you cite is that of Melies. Like Roussel or Lou Andreas Salome, he was also a fin-de-siecle figure. He also used backdrops and tricks of scale and dreamlike props. Fagin: I think Mlie's is an extraordinary figure, and the whole phenomenon of "primitive cinema" and tableaux structure is something that's very interesting to me. It's a tremendously rich tradition, surely more interesting than things that have been done recently. Except for Pee Wee Herman's Playhouse, which is great. Wollen: What's that? Fagin: It's a Saturday morning TV show with an infantile character amidst lots of color, and objects, and silliness. You've never seen it? Wollen: No, no. I never had Saturday morning TV. Cornell used to collect trick films, didn't he? Mlies and Zecca. I was struck by the insistence of Cornell, not only the boxes, but the procession of female figures, which, with Cornell, begin with Lind and Malibran, with nineteenth-century opera, and then descend to the twentieth-century cinema, to Rose Hobart, Hedy Lamarr, and Sheree North. Fagin: Much of the relation to Cornell is a ruse. A woman I lived with for a very long time, Aimee Rankin, does these wonderful boxes- unfortunately we don't talk. Often my work is an exchange with hers; she makes a comment about Masaccio, I respond; she says something about Turandot, I give a different reading. A rather expensive form of letter writing. But I guess it's better than arguing. On the other hand, a ruse is a very serious thing. Wollen: A different topic: the traveler's tales, the ethnographic footage, the imaginary Land of Propp. Where is all this travel taking us? Fagin: In some sense both pieces are organized around Ulysses, whom I see as the patron saint of chutzpah. I looked in Freud for reassurance and was stunned that he had never written about Ulysses. Anyway, the organization of the voyage home and the series of wanderings is important, both personally and structurally. Also the way Ulysses becomes the meta-tale of telling, narration, in the West. So Joyce becomes a major influence. In the Flaubert/Roussel tape, Verne's becomes the meta-tale for the nineteenth-century voyage. After all, Roussel thought</page><page sequence="16">90 OCTOBER Verne the greatest writer in history. What we end up with is a library of the voyage with many different types of analysis: personal stories, geographical descriptions, political conquests, ethnography, etc., all stacked next to each other under the card-catalogue topic "the amazing voyage." Also, there is an effort to confront the postromantic imagination, of which Flaubert and Roussel are such a strong part. To join the work being done within the critique/discussion of Orientalism. Wollen: When you talk about this very complex web or mesh of allusions and threads of metaphor and metonymy, do you see it as a web that has some kind of a center or direction? Or do you let it grow haphazardly through a free play of signifiers? Fagin: Sometimes I think of the way things hold together in a rather mundane way. It's as though you've gotten up in the middle of the night, gone into the kitchen, turned on the light, and opened a drawer to find an empty center with all these cockroaches at the edge. You feel like closing the drawer, but instead grab at them to restore them to their place. Often when people think of how things connect they think of the symptom. There's a real meaning underneath, sweep the symptom to the side, and get to the bottom of it. But Freud himself remarked that he was bringing the plague. So things get connected from so little and can turn in almost any direction. The Western disciplines of the dead- archeology, geology, etc. - pull so much together from so little. From a bone we get a dinosaur eating ferns in a swamp. The object found is used to constitute discourses on origin, legitimacy, and custom. And this is what so many stories in the tape use as their methodological base. There is a quote I like of Cornell's: It's not that things so close feel apart that's the problem, but that things so far apart fit together so easily. Another issue of organization is very important to the piece, and this is a distinction that I would draw between Duchamp and Cornell, both so important to me. Much of the aesthetic of Duchamp is on the side of the ludic, the game of chess, and we know to what degree chess is a synchronic event; it doesn't need to know the move before. On the other hand, so much of the play structure of Cornell is modeled on the fort/da game, a waiting for the mother to return. I see my own work as closer to Cornell's. It's very important to me that it was the American movers who broke the large glass, made marmalade out of it, as Duchamp said, using a word that doesn't exist in French. All of this relates to the tape's prelude, the interrogation of virginity, very direct, set off in tone from the rest of the tape, which is sublimated and childlike. The interrogation is followed by the pop-up book which, in the tradition of the prelude, introduces all that follows. The body of the tape has a very symmetrical structure, rhyming both on micro and macro levels. Then there is the male narrator, the backbone of the piece, holding it together but turning it inside out.</page><page sequence="17">An Interview with Steve Fagin 91 ......... _I: . M d7 Z7 Steve Fagin. The Amazing Voyage ..., "Pop-Up Book." Wollen: The chess player can be figured as an automaton, as a bachelor machine. But this idea of the bachelor . . . Fagin: There's a very eccentric book by Craig Adcock on Duchamp and nth dimensional geometry, in which he traces Duchamp's last piece, Etant Donnefs, back to Ger6me's Guard of the Harem, discussing the door in great detail. Within my work there is an antinomy between doors and veils. The bachelor with a door in front of him sees a bride with a veil, who imagines she must be imprisoned by the veil instead of, like him, a solid door. This difference is represented and narrativized in many ways, ranging from the section on Flaubert's being locked in his father's study through the retelling of the Zeuxis and Parrhasios legend. Wollen: I think of Duchamp's bachelor more in terms of "nauseating repetition," the spectacle of repetition. The nineteenth century becomes the site of this spectacle. Fagin: For the twentieth century to have doubts about what it is missing.</page><page sequence="18">92 OCTOBER Wollen: Then there's the repetition of the image, the idea of the museum of the copy, which the tape keeps coming back to. Fagin: I was very interested in pursuing nineteenth-century modes of producing images. One of the major aspects of this involved the journey to Rome, where one would simply copy other images. There was even a museum of copies. It was thought that a good copy was better than a bad original. I was also fascinated by Ger6me's Orientalist work. I did some research into his work process and was interested to learn that people generally comment on his paintings' fini, their extremely finished surface construction. The image that was in front of Ger6me was in fact an extraordinary collage. I show the way the paintings were con- structed in one of the stories in the tape: there's a bunch of bric-a-brac, a woman there, a fake backdrop, a photograph, clothes brought back from the original place, and objects that he more or less always used. It's a very eccentric combina- tion. I was intent on reproducing that space rather than the finished space of the painting. Wollen: In dwelling on copies, did you want to get into a discourse about postmodernism? Fagin: I did once, but now postmodernism is an overused idea, it's become too fashionable, so it's hard to go back to it. It's the same with the issue of the simulacrum versus the copy. Wollen: That's a section that works very well, the dramatic knockabout debate between the finger puppet and the tape recorder. Steve Fagin. The Amazing Voyage ..., "Museum of Copies."

Fagin: The person who performed it, Valerie Manenti, is very good, and she really worked very hard on the ideas. This section also relates to Roussel's being a mimic, his thinking that his greatest triumphs were the mimicking of the music hall entertainers of his day in front of his family. As a child I was always impressed by ventriloquism; in the U.S. there was someone named Sefior Wences, who performed with a hand puppet and a box. My tape runs the Deleuze piece on Plato through my memory of Sefior Wences. It's meant to be a good illustration of Deleuze. You start with a Cornell box, and you substitute an image of a gremlin; I think of the movie Gremlins; the gremlin is the image of the simulacrum . . . Wollen: This is the sequence with an altered facsimile of a Cornell box? Fagin: Yes. I think the gremlin is the perfect idea of the simulacrum. And so a debate ensues between the copy and the simulacrum, sort of substitutions of substitutions. The ideas of the simulacrum and the copy are taken directly from Deleuze. I'm hesitant about Baudrillard's work. Actually, I think Baudrillard should become a painter-you know, "This is the real Baudrillard, see, there's the signature, if all you want to do is illustrate my ideas, here's my signature, this should be worth something." Wollen: I think he's probably becoming a gremlin. Fagin: I don't think he's interested though. To return to the question about postmodernism: I think the style comes to me from growing up on TV and always filtering things through an ethnic specificity. I have a hard time reading poetry, because it sounds to me like it comes out with my own accent, a Chicago</page><page sequence="20">94 OCTOBER accent. I have been resistant to reading much of the literature on postmodern- ism, though I think that even by scanning and trying to avoid it, I have probably read the equivalent of several books. Even when you avoid it, you see three words each time, and I've seen so much on it. Wollen: Like the person in the Godard film who worked at the check-out counter in a bookstore and always glanced at the first and last pages while wrapping the books. I was interested in raising the question of postmodernism because I wondered whether quotation, repetition, copying--whether all these things were necessarily pervaded with nostalgia and regret. Fagin: If one is presuming that wholeness can be restored, that's one thing; but if one is willing, more in the tradition of Benjamin, or Barthes, or even Nietzsche's best texts, to hold pridefully onto the fragment and use it as a critical fold, a tactical relation to the future. ... The effort to bind it always has to be undone. Wollen: You used this term fold, and I'm not quite sure . . . Fagin: Cooking! Like when you fold in egg whites; when you make a souffle you whip up the egg whites, then you fold them in so they keep their identity, though they're integrated completely with the other ingredients. Wollen: But my question was going to be about repetition. There's another aspect to it. One of the main features of your sound design is the use of loops. Fagin: Yes, I use the sort of circularity and delirium attached to loops to pull away from the imaging. I also tried to set up a series of repetitions in order to provide that sense of security one gets when things are repeated. You have, then, both sides of the roller coaster ride--delirium and the return to the point of entry. Wollen: There's a kind of aural bric-a-brac: snatches of pop songs, bits of opera, found noise . Fagin: The sound has a perspectival space that the image lacks. A rather eccentric space combining pop music, ambient sound, and opera, but it has a semblance of perspective, as in Escher. I work very closely with William Davenport on the tracks. They take months, and I'm very pleased with his input into my work. For me the pieces are sound entry pieces. The ear is the one organ that doesn't close, so everything begins with the ear. Unlike cinema, which grows out of the fantasy of its own origin as image without sound, video had sound from the beginning. In fact I think of TV, historically, simply as deposing the radio. It's a stand-in for the radio, which was so comforting a part of the American past. Think of Woody</page><page sequence="21">An Interview with Steve Fagin 95 Allen's Radio Days. From my own past, I remember Sunday mornings, the only time I ever noticed that my parents slept together, because they would sleep in, door closed. I would sit in front of the radio, Sunday funnies sprawled in front of me, and let the radio animate them for me. I've never read the Sunday funnies since; they make no sense to me without the sound. In my own work the sound is an anchor, which is a bit different than anchorage; if you hold on too tightly you'll drown. Wollen: You refer a lot to childhood memories of radio and TV. How do you see the tapes fitting into the landscape of video art? Fagin: One of the issues is long work versus short work. People readily under- stand the difference between short stories and novels; they know they are orga- nized around different principles. In film you have a distinction between the short and the feature. But in video you have, "Oh yes, you're the guy who makes the long tapes." And so I've made a real effort to intervene in video, to push away from the notion of video as moving wallpaper, toward something that might have to be looked at more than once. I've also been interested in shifting the space of exhibition to one where people might have to pay to sit, would commit their time. Wollen: Turn it into cinema. Fagin: No, turn it into a machine like the cinema, but with a different aesthetic. Wollen: How do you see your work in relation to museums, which are really the dominant space for video? Fagin: I think of the "Tristan und Isolde" section in Bunuel's L'age d'or. I see the image as a severed hand twitching on a kitschy, fake pedestal, very small, and the sound as a high school band version of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring played very loud, and the audience sitting attentively. Assuming the image as central, but being torn to the edges by the sound, even to the point of erotic delirium (perhaps a bit wishful). Anyway, I'm very thankful for the support I've gotten within the video world. Many of the curators have tried to accommodate video's particular demands, to give the best viewing context available within their institutions. Wollen: And how do you see the audience? Because the dollhouse, Cornell-box scale of the TV monitor in some way determines the scale of the audience as well. Fagin: In many ways video is more on the side of painting, for which there's not really an audience, but rather a kind of connoisseurship. If you had a gallery</page><page sequence="22">96 OCTOBER opening, and Mary Boone or the Saatchis walked into your gallery and said, "This is wonderful," and they were going to circulate or buy your piece, it wouldn't matter, in terms of validation within the institution, what anyone else thought. In place of a functional audience, video has an audience of connoisseurs. Wollen: There's no box office. Fagin: I look at it as an advantage in a way, because it allows me to experiment, to work at the edge, which I don't think I'd be able to do if I had to work in a forum that wasn't supported in this way. Wollen: Yet, in a way, there is a mass audience. I read somewhere that the attendance at museums was now greater than that at sporting events. It's not implausible. Museums are open all week. There are many new ones being built. They have lines around the block. The throughput must be immense. But it's an audience which just comes in and feeds through, pausing for a moment, moving on, stopping, skipping whole rooms, and so on. How do you create that fixed look, that attentive look, which you're talking about, when it goes against the whole grain of museum spectatorship? Fagin: One could argue that cinema has that same problem in the museum, it's not just video. But on the other hand . Wollen: I don't want to put cinema in the museum. I would much sooner it was in other kinds of spaces. But video art doesn't seem to have many alternatives. Fagin: I'm trying to work from what's there, to figure out a way to have it work. On one side I'm trying to work with the notion that the image isn't compelling. But when I try to organize a screening in alternative spaces, the thing I try to do is set up a system, perhaps like five very good monitors in a circle with thirty people around each monitor -nobody does window-shopping among monitors - and the sound coming from outside through large speakers. One of the advantages of having an art form based on connoisseurship is that it allows you to experiment and take risks, and the history of much of what passes for experimen- tal exists initially under a very protected patronage. So I think what I do is look at this as a license to be experimental. Wollen: Do you think video art in general has that license? Fagin: I think that one can take that license. Because of the demands of the museum and of broadcast, video often functions according to a middle-brow aesthetic which I don't like. I do like some of the work done in video; I like the</page><page sequence="23">An Interview with Steve Fagin 97 work of John Adams in England, and the installation work of Tony Oursler is fantastic. I like Paper Tiger's work very much-informal, alternative, and cheap. Video provides several different formats for doing interesting and cre- ative work, and I'm using some sort of license, and other people are using others. Wollen: We've talked about museums and the conditions of exhibition. What about the discourse that surrounds video? Do you see problems or constraints there? Fagin: The curators are the people who produce and are often the critics as well. This leaves very little room for the separation of estates. Video is an art form raised on pluralism as opposed to partisanship. And traditionally, at least where I come from, the cinema is based more on partisanship; there's a healthy disrespect for other people's work and you argue and work out positions and alliances across differences, not according to the pretense, I'm OK you're OK. That upsets me. Wollen: Is that because the video world is too small? Fagin: It's because it's developed as a sort of network, which probably relates to its smallness and the need for friendship. I don't know the history well enough, but coming to it at this moment in time, that's the way it feels. Wollen: When you talk about partisanship in the film world, isn't that connected to the role of film theory as a partly prescriptive force? There isn't any pressure of video theory in the same way. Fagin: I want to insist very strongly that one of the reasons I'm doing video is to run away from film theory. At a certain moment film theory felt very much like it had lost its exploratory and speculative dimension and had settled into a series of axioms in response to which you get people writing papers: "True or false: Desert Hearts is an embodiment of female desire." Wollen: "Undecidable." Fagin: "Undecidable." So it began to feel that theory had become a sort of Discourse Police over practice, which I think has now spread to the art world. So video struck me as a place where I could produce in an atmosphere of explora- tion and risk. Wollen: You see the theoretical culture as a kind of constraint, rather than as liberating?</page><page sequence="24">98 OCTOBER ~JjlL: := ~~::::: ~::':~ ~' c_.. I__-: Steve Fagin. The Amazing Voyage .. , "Proust of the Night." Fagin: I think it's switched its function in both the art world and the film world. There is a cross-examination of the text for correctness so that you eventually lose any sense of speculation and risk-taking. Wollen: I think maybe you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. You can't have the liberating side of theory without the constraints. And certainly you can't have partisanship without prescription. Fagin: Everything has its imaginary, even film theory. And for film it's the Soviet Union in the '20s, where there was a high level of partisanship. Wollen: That was an extremely constraining discourse-as well as liberating. Fagin: At what level? Wollen: Look what happened. Fagin: I don't think you can say, "Look what happened." I'm talking about the polemics surrounding LEF, not Zdhanovism.</page><page sequence="25">An Interview with Steve Fagin 99 Wollen: LEF was under pressure from the various proletarian groups and ten- dencies, as well as from more universalist currents; look at Trotsky's critique. After Lenin's death, the art world became inextricably caught up in inner-party struggles. The collapse of LEF and Mayakovsky's suicide took place at the end of a long period of intense theoretical and political struggle over the correct line. Fagin: Yes, but I think the flow of energy between creativity, risk-taking, and speculation within both writing, which is called critical, and production, which is called artistic practice, was very rich at that time. Also I feel my work and other people's work, including yours and Trinh T. Minh-ha's, have been trying to produce a Northwest Passage, an open-ended relation, where one sees both sides as being creative and speculative. Criticism at its edge, Barthes, Blanchot, Benjamin, and certain filmmakers, Godard and Marker, cross over-perhaps not dissolving the border but allowing one to travel freely, without a passport. Wollen: I agree with that. Without a passport. Fagin: I don't think that video criticism is lacking its Christian Metz; it's lacking its Jonas Mekas. Wollen: I would have thought it was lacking something other than either of these. Fagin: I'm talking about partisanship, championing, saying that something is important. Wollen: Mekas was a partisan for independence and experiment, but within that boundary, very pluralistic. I think that's probably the situation with video now. People see themselves as partisans for video as such. What about the relation to television? You've talked a lot about television, how you sat there watching the Winky Dink show all the time. Fagin: I mentioned Pee Wee Herman, but I did watch the Winky Dink show. You used to put this Saran Wrap piece in front of the screen, and it was up to you to connect the bridge so Winky Dink could go from one side to the other. I really liked that show. Wollen: There's all this childhood investment in television. And now here you are with video. How do you see its relation to television? Fagin: I have a hard time watching TV, except for news and sports-- assassinations and touchdowns -]where I think something's happening. Other- wise I begin to hyperventilate. Again, I see television as something that is pushing from behind and allows me to produce and organize things in a way that is</page><page sequence="26">100 OCTOBER probably different from those people who have only a high-culture background. But I do not at this moment in time see my work as an intervention in TV. Wollen: Would it ever be possible to see it in that way in the United States? Fagin: I think Paper Tiger is good. To work on cable, work at your own density, push your own issues, feel that if you produce something interesting, people will come to it, is important. But the level of compromise in relation to the institu- tions of PBS . . . I have not seen anything coming out of that tradition which interests me. Wollen: I find the audience for TV even more scattered and abstract than that in museums. Obviously, there is an audience out there, watching. But inchoate and ephemeral. Here one minute, gone the next. It's just the inverse of the museum: throughput of images instead of throughput of viewers. Fagin: For me video culture is more like a cell group. Like Freud: if he sells 100 copies of Interpretation of Dreams in ten years, what's important is who reads it and what they do with it. I've concentrated on people who could do something with it, people who will come to it, to the edge. The center will collapse because enough people will move from the center to the edge. There's more of an effort to conquer the edge than the center. Wollen: A kind of micro-cultural politics. Fagin: Yes. Wollen: Enough questions. Let's switch off. Can we still catch Pee Wee Herman?</page></plain_text>
