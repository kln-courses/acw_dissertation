<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Function of the Vision in Greek-American Culture GREGORY GIZELIS The study of visions has always been peripheral to the central concern of folklorists and regional ethnologists. The reason for this lack of interest might be sought in the assumption that this phe- nomenon, being of private and accidental nature, does not concern these scholars. In this paper we intend to show several important functions that visions serve within some small groups of Greek Philadelphians. A religious system is first and above all a cognitive system.' Granted that everyone has his own cognitive system, it would in- deed be a great mistake to state that an entire community holds one or another belief. Among those large groups who have the same ethnic and religious background similarities do exist. However, we found that the best way to tackle the problem of studying a large group is through small reference groups that we can subsume into similar categories. Visions are secular or religious according to their content, but an attempt to separate these two categories causes great difficulties. For our purpose, visions of religious content are taken to be those which the visionaries themselves associate with religious matters. In this discussion we are concerned with the latter kind of visions (V 510). Broadly speaking, religious apparitions have been witnessed in This is a revised version of a paper read at the annual meeting of the American Folk- lore Society, November 1971. Here I should acknowledge my gratitude to the Center for Urban Ethnography, University of Pennsylvania, and the National Institute of Mental Health, Public Health Grant MH 17, 216, for having supported my fieldwork in the Greek-American community of Philadelphia. 1.

Although the belief in the appearance of supernatural beings to men might be widespread within a large group, often there are pathological states that produce ecstatic conditions. These condi- tions stimulate a kind of psychological explanation which, in turn, accounts for the manifested interest of psychology, psychoanalysis, and parapsychology in the phenomenon of visions. As this phenomenon has been proven to have social significance, sociology gets involved in its study. However, with the exception of the so-called "Underground Sociology," the students of this disci- pline have related religious visions to the "great man" theory of movements and problems of charismatic leadership of a group. A similar approach is followed by anthropologists in their research into problems involving medicine men, shamans, witch doctors, etc. Moreover, their scientific curiosity is motivated by the fact that the belief in the apparition of gods or spirits necessitates a cultural theory.3 Students of folklore and folklife have recorded the said psychic phenomenon in connection with their study of witchcraft, magic, divination, second sight, and so on without having looked at it care- fully. In this paper we shall discuss the phenomenon of religious visions as an entity in its own right and as part of a network of be- liefs (V 510). In order for us to comprehend this subject we have to see the position that the official religion takes on that matter and the part that it has played in the development of the milieu which produces such experiences. As Paul W. Pruyser stated: Whether extrasensory or supersensory, the transcendence from or- dinary sight and down-to-earth reality testing to the special vision 2.

God is everywhere and is free to present Himself to human beings in modes He selects.5 In the Old and New Testa- ments at sundry times instances of divine appearances occur. If the divine presentation be materialized, it is perceived either as an anthropomorphic figure or as an object symbolizing a particular deity. As seen from the perspective of Christian religion these revela- tions are believed to be real. Therefore, the beholder is predisposed to this type of uncanny experience. Notwithstanding the fact that the Church preaches the mystic communion between God and men it "reserves the right to decide whether a revelation is to be con- sidered authentic or not."6 While the Church is quick to approve the verity of religious visions witnessed by its saints or ascetics it would probably deny the right to any everyday person to see real religious apparitions on the assumption that God can only speak to or present Himself to the man who is capable of hearing the word or seeing the figure. This man should be an extraordinary individual, one who has elevated his position to the higher levels of the hierarchy of religion. It should be noted that not only laymen but clerics as well may at times give interpretations which do not tally with the official viewpoint. Of course being cognizant of the opinion of the Church on that matter they recognize the possibility that they have been granted of God's extreme leniency and love. Many informants of mine in the course of giving their accounts of their interior com- munion with God paused for a while to make some remarks iden- tical in diction: "Who am I that the Lord (Saint ... , Virgin Mary) appeared to me." Furthermore, The Church provides symbols and words that its members utilize and interpret in accordance with the cultural and spiritual climate of the group to which they belong. The Church is God's house. At least this is part of the range of knowledge they have obtained by the teachings of the official religion. God Him- 4.

Let us see how an informant of mine con- vinced herself that God is always present regardless of the place where a religious ceremony takes place: Once I saw a dream [This is a literal translation. For better English read: I had a dream] that father K-- was officiating. An- other tall priest dressed in white tunic was standing next to him. When the service was almost over, that white-dressed priest came to the Holy Gate and said: "All of you eat." Next morning I went to Church and saw him who officiated with father K--. It was the same one I saw in my dream. He was in white clothes too. But he was half. There was light in the icon, and his face was so bright that I was moved. This icon was in the chapel where the house of the priest is now. He revealed to me that where a service is performed there is Christ. Since then I changed my attitude toward this chapel. In the past because it wasn't a real church I didn't feel like being in a church. But He revealed to me that He is wherever a service is conducted, no matter the place. So far we have talked about how the official religion unwillingly but-and this is the paradox-actively helps its faithful to produce ecstatic conditions. The Church has, also, a profound influence upon the emotional state which engenders visions in the beholder. It is not, however, aware of the massive role it plays in the gener- ation of these mystical situations. All religions have their sacred places where ceremonies take place; these sacred places are detached from the surrounding cosmic territory and are differentiated from it.' Particular place and time form the natural and cultural setting where encounters with the numinous occur. It is unquestionable that among the various means that stimulate a vision are fear in face of the strangeness of the world, and expecta- tion, incenses, penance, fasting, preparatory words and songs, and prayers. All these are either utilized or implied in the ritual and instructions of the Church. To some extent the whole array of psy- chic disposition which activates and directs saints and ascetics to- ward their various objects is due to the intensive use of these stim- uli.8 7.

Hastings, 2:231a.</page><page sequence="5">GREEK-AMERICAN VISIONS 69 Natural and cultural setting, rite, and precept create a mystical atmosphere responsible for wide associations made by the devout in a long period of religious education. These inveterate associ- ations, in different people, cause other deep religious associations which emphasize the importance of certain sensory processes to various groups. These sensory processes which are generally visually oriented in the Greek community are connected with specific value judgments and religious evaluations9 and explain the fact that some segments of the Christian religion favor visionary and others audi- tory experiences, though a multisensory process is always at work. While the structure of the Greek church cultivates the eye, the liturgy influences the ear. At times, it is very hard to tell which one prevails. At other times these two go together. Anyhow, in this article we concern ourselves with the former. We do not here con- sider dreams, for despite their great resemblances to visions, they belong to a different domain and have different functions.10 The visionary by internalizing the teachings of the Church about sacred places goes one step beyond and includes places that he or she decides to make hallowed. To support my argument I shall in- dicate the venerated corner of the Greek-American average house which contains icons and other sacred objects (V 130), for instance, a glass of blessed water (V 132). I should say that the very content of visions has definitely been affected by the instructions of the official religion. Thus, in the community where I conducted my research, it is almost a rule for the visionary to recognize specific icons in the anthropomorphic figures he or she perceives. Other images very often in abstract form have an overt association to sacred objects, as for instance the cross. In one small group the recurrent theme of apparitions was a light which was conceived to represent God himself or to be a mode of appearance of God. The following extract of a conversation I had with an informant will, I hope, elucidate my point. Her narration refers to an event that happened to a girl friend of hers: At the top of her house, they say, a star, big light, flashes of light- ning, filled the sky. People living across the street saw the light and thinking that the roof caught fire they called the fire station. Fire- men arrived. Her brother, the one who has died, comes. 9.

"Why do you say so?" she says. "With your candles you put fire." "There is nothing, my son," she said to him. They go upstairs, then downstairs, nothing. The light they saw was God. This was it (V515.1). Visions are induced to an individual not only by the means I have discussed so far, but by the narratives of his or her fellow-members of the group as well. This phenomenon is not novel. The reading of Plotinus, a neoplatonist philosopher, was proven effective upon Christian mystics who echoed the language of Plotinus in the ac- counts of their ecstatic experiences." Along this line, Eliade has advanced the hypothesis that many epic subjects, motifs, and cliches in the great epic poems "are of ecstatic origin, that is, they are borrowed from the narratives of shamans telling about their journeys and adventures in the spirit world" (V 511).12 The way that the visionary narrates his spiritual contemplation of God is determined by the language he uses and the culture in which he or she belongs.'1 Some of the saint legends may be of an ecstatic origin. Or a particular storyteller might have embellished them with material of his own improvisation after he passed through a mystical state. Of course one can barely tell when a vision gives birth to a story or the tale induces the vision. At any rate, in several instances I was able to attribute the cause of visions to cer- tain narratives that had had an effect on certain persons. The fol- lowing instance from my research will illustrate the point: INFORMANT: Whenever I go there, [she implies the house of a girlfriend of hers, a room of which the owner has turned into a chapel] I always feel something. Many times I hear psalmodies, or see figures. Once I was sitting in the dining room. The women were talking. I said to them: Cease talking because I hear music. Another 11.

COLLECTOR: What kind of voices have you heard? INFORMANT: There were men's voices... COLLECTOR: But are you sure that the saints presented themselves to you this way? INFORMANT: Yes, what else could be? There, many women have heard voices and seen Christ and saints. COLLECTOR: The psalmodies you heard, what kind were they? INFORMANT: I don't know. As they say, they are angelic psalm- odies. A bishop who is now in Australia, told us many stories of how angels appear and help people. Once a priest wanted to perform the service but because it was storming nobody went to help him with the psalmody. He called upon God. "My God," he said, "help me finish the service." As he continued the liturgy he heard beauti- ful voices. He thought that someone came in. He looked around and saw two beautiful boys. Then he realized that the storm had abated. The sky was blue. When the service was over and he looked for the boys, he couldn't find them. He saw their foot prints instead. Then he understood that they were angels. In a case such as the aforementioned there is no need for a vision to be produced by means such as austerities, narcotics, frantic danc- ing, and so on. From the discussion thus far I think it has been made plain that we deal with imaginative or exoteric visions, that is, visions that require a cultural stimulus.14 According to Malinowski the intercourse which takes place in dreams and visions between living men and the spirits "is not pub- lic; the whole community does not share in it collectively.""1 Many instances of my research are of this character. In order to delve more deeply into the problem we should not overlook the fact that the recurrency of this phenomenon with individuals who form some groups is due to a belief widespread throughout the entire com- munity. A great number of my informants, mostly female, confessed that they had had at least one visionary experience in their lives. Though these were private and accidental instances, we have to reckon with the fact that every such experience is both natural and cultural. 14.

As Thomas F. O'Dea has written: "It would seem that by providing men with a definition of the ultimate meaning of life and by giving them a sense of belonging to the religious com- munity, religion contributes significantly to self-definition."'6 In the same style Roland Robertson has asserted that in American so- ciety "religious commitment has been a major mode of self-location and identification." 17 The very society furnishes people with mod- els which they use for purposes of identifying themselves with cer- tain large or small groups.s8 An entire religious community is at times too vast to satisfy that need for identification of the individual who wants something more concrete. His or her attitudes and behavior mainly depend on the fact of conscious belonging to a small reference group. The impor- tance of a small group increases with the degree of intense danger which is felt by individuals. When people find out that their world is a frightening jungle they seek ways of lowering stress. They short- ly discover that the best way to obtain a secure and safe feeling is via reciprocal support. By crowding close together they reduce their anxiety and fear, and offer mutual protection.'9 They communicate their ideas only to those whom they can trust; that is, members of their intimate group. Now we may ask what is the problem that brings these people together? Actually it can be a combination of problems. As far as the groups I studied are concerned it seems to me that they worry a lot about an increasing trend toward secularization of the Church. This is deemed as breaking down the tradition. Their reaction to the current trend can be paralleled with that sort of revitalization movement which "profess[es] to revive a tra- ditional culture now fallen into desuetude."20 It is not a revital- ization movement in the real sense, however, because it lacks the 16.

The leader conceives such movements in hallucinatory visions and im- parts his feelings to his followers.21 In our case we found a collective manifestation of disapproval of the new trends which united the various individuals. Every single individual when with members of his group eases the multitude of spiritual ills that afflict him. On these matters by grouping they build a sort of imaginative wall which separates them from the rest of the community. By virtue of this spiritual solitude they think they have become the religious elite. The others, the majority, go their evil way. In this context we recognize a cardinal function of the vision. The appearance of a divine being to them has a thera- peutic effect on their psychic and mental world. The peace of their soul is achieved through the recognition that God approves their works and is on their side. As a consequence, it reinforces the belief residing in their mind that the others follow the wrong way, they follow the avenue which leads to catastrophe. It should be made evident that despite the fact that the individ- uals who formulate these groups have similar cognitive systems and although they react in the way mentioned to the norms of the ma- jority, they do not form unique ideological or dogmatic systems. To some extent they resemble the so-called "thaumaturgical sect,"22 but they are not a sect. They are, indeed, regular folk religious groups which emphasize ideas fed by the instructions of the very official religion, though the latter accepts these ideas on certain conditions.23 Members of these small groups are not alienated from the main body of the society, because the ideas they avow are not foreign to the majority which, under certain circumstances, may accept that kind of extrasensory perception. The majority criticizes and scorns these extreme cases but, by behaving this way, the main body of the whole community offers a great service to these individuals because it inhibits them from being always in a euphoric condition. It helps them to keep the balance between unrestrained hallucination and 21. Ibid., 270. 22. B. B. Wilson, "A Typology of Sects," in Sociology of Religion, ed. R.

In this context the function that visions serve is that of identifying one with a group of this sort. By following the model of identification that these small groups provide, the individual ad- justs his or her attitudes and behavior to their norms. In conjunc- tion with this function it is the function of being recognized by those who share the same ideas. It is a badge that shows one's mem- bership in a group. The story of an informant of mine will uphold my argument. The event occurred during the performance of a vigil. INFORMANT: Women only carry out vigils. Once, in a vigil, we finished the Salutations and then we decided to make a prayer to Saint Spyridon. I said: Let us put the icon of Saint Spyridon here, at the gate of the altar. The gate of the altar was closed; the curtain which covers the gate was pulled. Well, as soon as we commenced his prayer, I looked at him and said: "Saint Spyridon, we don't have a priest to minister the service. I wish you to come to accompany us with the psalmody." One of the women who were there heard psalm- odies inside the altar, beautiful psalmodies. She saw a priest, too. Because of her excitement she burst into tears. After we finished she told us what happened. COLLECTOR: Who is she? INFORMANT: I forgot her name. She goes to the church of Saint George very regularly. She is not one of those I associate with. She is illiterate. He showed her the miracle, so that she might accompa- ny us and be happy [italics mine]. Once one is in a group of visionaries he or she is exposed to his or her friends' frequent accounts of their experiences. As we have demonstrated, the situations that produce hallucinations are partly stimulated by these accounts. A person anxious to show that he or she has also been legitimately visited by the divine, will get involved in an unproclaimed competition with the others for the best per- formance. My view will be illustrated in the following narrative. (The event that this informant narrated took place in Jerusalem, 24. La Barre, 43</page><page sequence="11">GREEK-AMERICAN VISIONS 75 Easter 1969. Several members of her group from Philadelphia took a pilgrimage tour to the Holy Lands. Three of her friends envis- ioned the Holy Light coming down from the heaven.) INFORMANT: He showed His resurrection to me and I myself saw it. I closed my eyes and saw how Christ was resurrecting Himself. After the service we went to sleep. As soon as I had laid down and closed my eyes, I said to myself: Today, it is Christ's resurrection. And I put my mind there, to the grave, where He arose. As though I knew the place where Jesus Christ arose. As soon as I put my mind there, I see Him going up. I narrate it now, and I shiver. Some- times, when I remember it, I am moved. I say, see, my friends saw the Holy Light and He showed the resurrection to me. I wanted to relate it to the others; I desired to speak to my friends, because I was in the same room with Z-- and T-. I wanted to tell them that now I see the resurrection of God [italics mine]. My eyes were seeing. I was not asleep. COLLECTOR: I see. You were awake. INFORMANT: Awake, awake. I saw Him, as soon as I closed my eyes. I put my mind there. Today, it is the resurrection and the resurrection took place there. And as soon as I said there, immedi- ately I see Him going to the heaven this way [she made some ges- tures to describe the action]. I saw Him as He is in that icon. As you see Him in that icon. His feet were a little ... they were slant- wise. He was going up. [Few seconds of silence and then] Glory to Godl The impulse of identifying with a group derives from a feeling of wider identification that the visionary has to that inclusive whole, God.25 It is this impulse which works when it makes one bypass the procedure of the official religion in obtaining a direct communion with God. This activity reminds us of similar actions of many great philosophers and prophets who, not being satisfied with commun- ion through institutions, rejected them and pursued a way which leads to a personal and direct communion with God.26 This idea leads to consideration of one more function. Visions are deemed to be divine responses to human appeals for commun ion. Wishes, longings, aspirations can produce psychic conditions which seem real to the individual. "The internal becomes external- 25. Joseph Havens, et al., Psychology and Religion: A Contemporary Dialogue (Lon- don, 1968), 101. 26. Hastings, 3:737b.</page><page sequence="12">76 WESTERN FOLKLORE ized. The wish becomes projected in the double sense of a projec- tile being shot out and a picture being flashed onto a screen from where it is distantly visible."27 Again a story of one of my informants will make my point plain. INFORMANT: On Holy Cross day I took my mother to Saint Demetrius in order for her to be able to receive the Holy Com- munion. I was looking at the priest officiating. I said in my mind: My Christ, where do you stand? On the left of the priest or on the right? That is, I was telling it in my mind. And I said: I wish I had eyes to see you. And as soon as I said it in my mind, I see lights coming out from the cross, big lights. More than two yards big, thick, too. Thick rays. Thicker than hand toes. There were radiat- ing to the right and to the left and all around. As though He was telling me I am over here, neither on the right nor on the left. He showed it to me. How can I not believe it? I saw these things with my eyes. I do not lie. While the narrations of the psychic experience function in iden- tifying one with certain members of a population of the same frame of mind, the content of these visions helps individuals identify with smaller units; each small group has developed its own themes that emphasize some aspects more than others. Thus, where a group stresses the motif of light as representing Jesus Christ, another group sees Jesus Christ Himself. The beloved topic of a third group is the Cross. The focus on certain motifs can be explained by the fact that members of a group tell their stories more often to one another than to members of other similar groups. If I have correctly interpreted my informants' narratives of ec- static experience, it follows that religious visions are not only of private and accidental nature. They are also cultural phenomena with a recurrency which characterizes the folklore and folklife phenomena. University of Pennsylvania 27. Pruyser, 45.</page></plain_text>
