Il examine d'abord les notions du she dans la région de Putian sous les Song , puis le développement d'une hiérar- chie de temples en site propre dans la plaine irriguée. Il analyse ensuite les efforts de la cour au début des Ming pour standardiser les she et les rituels afférents. A ces efforts succé- dèrent des modifications locales quant à la théorie et la pratique du she. Un travail sur le terrain dans la région de Jiangkou lui permet de scruter des mutations du she à la fin des Ming et sous les Qing. Il étudie par ailleurs les attitudes vis-à-vis du she dans des ouv- rages littéraires et dans des inscriptions sur pierre datant des Ming et des Qing dans la région de Putian , ainsi que les changements dans V organisation du rituel au niveau des villages. Du milieu des Ming jusqu'aux Qing une transition s'opère entre les formes d'or- ganisation rituelle basée sur le lignage ou la parenté et des formes à bases territoriales. Les dernières pages contiennent une discussion sur le recouvrement de l'espace sacré au cours des quinze dernières années. Cette étude montre que les effortSy au début des Mingy pour institutionnaliser les structures et cérémonies rituelles au niveau inférieur du canton ont entraîné des conséquences imprévues. Le travail sur le terrain au Fujian durant ces der- niers dix ans a fait apparaître des matériaux qui suggèrent que ces autels officiels se muè- rent graduellement en une strate sous-jacente d'espace rituel de religion populaire. Les mesures prises périodiquement par l'État - jusqu'à l'époque contemporaine - pour affirmer sa suprématie par l'imposition d'un modèle standardisé et homologué d'espace rituel ont causé une tension insoluble entre l'État et les communautés rituelles locales en Asie orientale. INTRODUCTION Edouard Chavannes began his article on the god of the soil in ancient China by claiming that the god is the personification of the powers of the earth. 1 Few would contest the primordiality of this form of worship or the ubiquity of she altars through- Research for this paper was conducted between 1991-1997 in Putian, Fujian, and was supported by the SSHRC, the FCAR, and the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for Scholarly Exchange. 1 Chavannes' discussion of the she altar of the soil is based on a review of classical sources. He concludes that many aspects of the "classical" tradition were in fact innovations introduced in the Han dynasty, particularly during the reign of Han Wudi ātjKīļr.

This paper suggests, however, that it may be possible to trace a series of transformations in the history, structure, and organization of the she altar in a specific region: the Xinghua region of coastal Fujian province from the Song to the Qing and on into current times 2 Some of these transformations were the result of govern- ment policy, other reinventions relate to the efforts of local literati to shape local cul- ture, and still others to the unintended effect of the complex interplay of population growth, social differentiation, struggles between lineages and communities for local power and resources, and the growth in this area of a nested hierarchy of temples. Kanai Noriyuki has examined the transformations of the she in a series of articles.3 He distinguishes between the official cult of the altar of the soil and the five grains, celebrated at the imperial, provincial and district levels, which in his view became more and more formalized, and the village cult, which he argues preserved its archaic function of enabling communal solidarity ( kyodotai äIrJÜl) despite under- going many changes. Kanai notes the presence of shamanic practices in village cults from the Tang onwards. He traces the spread of anthropomorphic representations of the god of the soil in the Song. Kanai next examines the merger of the cult of the god of the soil (specific to each location) with other local, regional, or empire-wide gods worshipped in village temples (especially in the southern Song), linking these trends not only to growing village self-organization but also to rising commercialization. He examines the impact on the cult of the soil of the rise of lineages, and the popularization of Buddhism and Taoism. He goes on to note the differences between northern Chinese cults of the earth god, which are linked to the cult of the dead and Mount Tai, with 2 The transformations of court based rituals of the she ji altars from the Han to the Tang dynasty can be followed in Du Yu's Tongdian 45 IÜÄ, and later changes can be traced in many later compilations of ritual for the court and the field administration.

Taylor concentrates primarily on prefectural and district level official altars whereas this paper examines lishe M tí (village or sub-canton level shrines) and xiangshe Mìì. (village level shrines and temples) and explores the effects of early Ming orders to establish she altars within each li M (hundred and ten surname collectivity) of the realm. Taylor notes that the construction or repair of prefectural and district level altars to the soil and grain in all local administrative units was mandated in 960, 1279, 1386, 1425, 1620, 1723, 1796, and 1874. He notes a surge in numbers of altars in the early Ming (Hongwu) and again in the Qing Yongzheng period. 3 For an overview, see his article, "Shajin to dõkyõ" in Dõkyõ 2: Dõkyõ no tenkai Hifc 2: UffcOMIIi, 2: 171-208, Tokyo: Hirakawa Shuppansha, 1983.

He notes the role of the cult of the god of the earth as a fundamental unit of larger village, inter- village, and regional temple networks and village alliances. He concludes with a call for further fieldwork on the xiangshe (village-level altar of the soil/temple of the gods). This paper focuses on the early Ming dynasty effort to institutionalize ritual struc- tures and performance at the newly established lishe Míi (altars of the soil set up in each sub-canton, or one hundred and ten household unit) and argues that these attempts led to interesting and unintended effects. Wada Hinori has claimed that these officially instituted shrines lasted about one hundred years after the death of their founder, Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. He finds scattered records of these altars in the mid-Ming, but no trace at all in Qing dynasty ritual compendia and regional gazetteers.4 However, fieldwork conducted in Fujian over the past decade reveals that these official altars gradually mutated into an underlying strata of popular religious ritual networking and local social organization. These transformations can be compared to developments in ancestral worship and lineage structure, which have been studied by Patricia Ebrey and David Faure.5 As with efforts to legislate popular worship at the she altars, the efforts to impose a standard form upon kinship ritual led paradoxically to increasing mutations of the rites and the underlying forms of organization of ritually defined units. This paper will in fact trace an evolution in the Xinghua area away from lineage control towards networks of popu- lar temples that grew out of the she altar/temples. The interrelationships between ter- ritorially defined ritual space/place and ritually organized kinship ties, together with the periodic efforts of the state to reassert supremacy through the imposition of a stan- dardized, homological model of ritual space or lineage (temporal) order, generated irre- solvable tensions between the imperial center and local ritual communities in East Asia. The lishe or village level she altars were highly contested sites of the working out of some of these tensions. One difficulty in the sources, however, is the shifting value of the terms. In Song and often in later sources, the term li M may refer to a village, and 4 Wada Hinori ÍDE9WÍ8, "Rikõsei to rishadan kyõreidan: Mindai no kyöson shihai to sai- shi SWJ ¿Mii*!

Wada (pp. 419-22) provides evidence of the beginnings of the lishe system dating as early as 1370 in the early years of the Hongwu reign period. He suggests that the system was established through- out the empire between 1376 and 1381. Wada (p. 426) dates the beginnings of the collapse of the Ming lishe system to the Zhengde period (1506-1521). 5 See Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Confucianism and family rituals in imperial China: A social history of writing about rites, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, and David Faure, The structure of Chinese rural society: Lineage and village in the eastern new territoires , Hong Kong, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986.

Zhu Xi ( 1 130- 1200) used the term she in his suggestions for the establishment of shexue (community academies) and shecang %bit (community granaries).6 After the early Ming administrative geographic reforms of the sub-bureaucratic order, the term lishe S%h usually refers to a sub-canton made up of one hundred and ten families, with ritual activities centered around an officially recognized altar of the soil. However, writers in the Ming and Qing often played with the frame of reference of these terms, quoting classical texts in defense of diverse popular religious practices. One classical ritual associated with the she altar by writers from the Song onwards was the xiangyin Mffc (village wine drinking ceremony). The she altar was also the place where oaths were pronounced in the Ming ritual reforms, followed by the wine drinking ritual. Later efforts to promul- gate imperial values at the communal levels often centered on the she altar, or some substitute for it. These include the empire-wide promulgation of community compacts in the mid-Ming, and the Qing institution of the reading of the Sacred Edicts 7 Thus for the court, some degree of control over the formations and ritual activities of the she altar/temple at the sub-bureaucratic or village level was a long-standing aspiration. These sites would however evolve into highly contested arenas of ritual action and social organization. TANG AND SONG DYNASTY UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE SHE ALTAR IN FUJIAN The origins of the local culture of the Putian plains are multiple, and still little un- derstood. The Bamin tongzhi AHUMAS groups these traditions into three main streams: Buddhist, Confucian, and shamanistic. Early commentators frequently repeated the view expressed in the Han Shu ÝHilr that "people trust in shamans and demons, and treat licentious cults seriously."8 A Tang official in Fujian remarked that "there are still many licentious cults, and (the people) do not set up sheji ttíH (altars to 6 Richard von Glahn, "Community and welfare: Chu Hsi's community granary in theory and practice," in R.P.

He established several of these altars, bringing Confucian teachings to the people.9 But these efforts were not successful. The Song Sanshanzhi 9 HULlžŽ; complained that "every xiang M is led by over a dozen shamans and shama- nesses." The Song gazetteer of the Xianyou fill®? region, the Xianxizhi fllliU/È, repeats the refrain: "The custom of Min is to rely on demons, thus in the towns there are many shrines."10 Behind these remarks lies the complex ethnic melange of the Fujian region. The area was inhabited by Bai Yue Sfiç peoples, and later by the Min peoples, the She # ethnic group, as well as many others. A magical conquest of the ethnic groups of Fujian is described in the popular novel Ping Min shibadong ^111+ AM (The Pacification of the Eighteen Caverns of Fujian).11 Several of the cave-fortresses of the indigenous inhabitants of Fujian described in the novel were located in the Xinghua region (now consisting of Putian ļf EH and Xianyou counties). These include the Zhenshan Cavern Ä U-lM in Xianyou, the Shuichang Cave /KUM in Putian and the Huangcao Cavern ff on Hugong Mountain in the Putian plains. The magical spirits protecting these caverns include a black serpent, a golden carp, and an earthworm, all creatures related to the cultural chain of the "Bai Yue" peoples outlined by Wolfram Eberhard. 12 Xu Shaohong has suggested that these and similar creatures may have been the object of cults offered by Min ethnic groups prior to Han incursion.13 Other sources reveal traces of the cultural conquest conducted by Han Chinese colonizers. Several Buddhist culture heroes of the Fujian area such as Qingshui zushi Sanping zushi , and the Patriarch of Maile Mountain in Xianyou won renown for their magical battles with local barbarians (Man H, or She). In most cases, after defeat, these groups are taken in by the monks as spirit soldiers or guards of 9 Zhang Wenzong a Tang official posted in Jianning prefecture in the Yongwei reign-period (650-655), found that "the people of the province still carry out licentious cults, and do not set up sheji altars of the soil and grain. Wenzong sent down teachings (or descended to teach them) to make them worship in spring and autumn at the altar of the soil, and he eradicated licentious cults. He was calm and merciful in governing, and after his departure, the people established a shrine dedicated to him."

The god of the Wuyi mountains who appears on so many tomb contracts may be one early instance of this process.14 The Tang official's desire to establish altars to the soil where the people had failed to do so indicates an effort to impose official forms of worship on a unruly area. The establishment of these she altars can be seen as an index of the spread of Han culture into the Min region. Another possible indication of this process can be seen in the extraordinary increase in official population figures for Song Fujian. This may have been a result of a decision to register indigenous inhabitants of the area as tax-paying households. Such a process of Han cultural conquest, colonization, and increasing cultural assimilation may help explain the gaps, omissions, and distortions in official cadastral records and in the genealogies of many of the great lineages of the Xinghua area. Seen in this light, the widespread legend that the "eight great surnames" all ar- rived at once in Fujian in the eastern Jin must be treated with caution. Many of these putative Han kin groups may have included aboriginal peoples.15 Whatever the truth concerning the legends of mass emigration from the Central Plains of China, ancestor worship was certainly a distinguishing trait of the Han Chinese, and the practices of bloody sacrifice to the gods and the tending of the graves of the ancestors by early Han settlers must have left a deep impression on earlier in- digenous inhabitants of the Xinghua region. By the northern Song, powerful Han kin groups had established tombs for their ancestors, and performed rituals en masse at the side of these tombs. These practices led to the establishment of Buddhist graveside chapels, which conducted rituals on behalf of ancestors with the support of the descent group. Some of the graveside chapels later developed into major monasteries.16 By the mid-twelfth and thirteenth century, stone inscriptions record efforts to break free of the classical restrictions on ancestral worship. These regulations, as reworked by Zhu Xi 7^11 (1130-1200) and others, allowed individualized ancestral worship up to the fifth generation (great-great grandfather) only, and insisted that the 14 See Xu Shaowang (note 13 above).

Serious inter-ethnic conflict in the Xinghua region per- sisted into the end of the Ming, when She peoples in mountainous regions revolted against tax burdens in Xianyou. 16 Hugh Clark has discussed kinship practice and lineage formation in coastal Fujian in several essays, including "The Fu of Minnan: A local clan in the late Tang and Song China," Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orienty 38.1 (1995): 1-74; and "Kinship practice in southern Fujian from the 10th to the 13th centuries," n.d.

The worship was to take place at a jiamiao (family temple) set up at a side altar inside the home. The inscriptions show that descent groups began to break with classical regulations by setting up altars to the founding pioneer Fujian ancestor, and all subsequent generations, with special altars or tablets for those who had served in office or otherwise advanced the lineage. An underlying factor in these changes was the uncertainty of the economic status of the direct descent line over time. As the numbers of those involved in ancestral worship grew, the pressures (both economic and administrative) on the eldest member of the direct descent line could become unbearable, especially if his line was in decline. By opening up worship of a common early pioneer ancestor, as well as branch ancestors who had made particular contributions, the way was clear for descent groups to over- come the limitations of the direct descent line, and expand into a more flexible "lineage" organizations. Buddhist chapels and monastic landholdings were reap- propriated. Many of these increasingly powerful descent groups/lineages sponsored the canonization of the local gods worshipped in their communities. The temples dedicated to these gods often merged with or absorbed altars to the soil and grain. Despite the best efforts of Confucian educators, the sheji altars quickly deviated from official prescriptions. One form this took was that temples dedicated to an anthropomorphized earth god became common in the Song dynasty. Liu Kezhuang #J JnlJEË (1187-1269), a prolific scholar-literatus, was born in Putian, and rose to the position of Minister of Works. He later retired to Putian, and spent many years there. He remarked: "A marketplace with only three family stores, or a settlement with but some tens of residences, must have a shrine in which to beseech good fortune and to pray for a [bountiful] year. These [shrines] have images set up inside them, and are called lishe Mít [village altars (of the soil)]."17 Liu's collected works include several prayers addressed to the gods of the earth of the regions he worked in, sometimes reporting his arrival at a new post, sometimes praying for rain in a drought, and some- times expressing thanks for his good health during his stay under the god's protec- tion.18 Hu Bingwen (1250-1333) commented on the she altars of Tingzhou in western Fujian: The altar of the soil is part of the ancient Li Î® rites. It consists of an [earthen] altar with no building upon it. It is appropriate that wood [i.e., a tree] should act as ruler of earth [in other words, the mound of earth should have a tree upon it].

Moreover, they provide him with an old wife. All this is absolutely not in accordance with ancient ways. Zhang Taiyu ãS who came to Tingzhou, had read the Duke of Letters' [Zhu Xi's] Zhenghe Liyi iKÍOÍSKIi [Interpretation of the Rites composed in the Zhenghe reign period] and so seized the paintings and burned them. Thereupon, at Yindun in Tingzhou, he built an [outdoor] altar facing north, crowned with a stone, and surrounded by fine trees. In front he built a four pillar shelter in case of wind and rain. He bequeathed two mu Mk of a forest to cover the costs of sacrificial wine. The ancient regulations of the aljtar of the soil could thus still be seen in this day.19 As this source reveals, the popular notion of the she temple and that of the fanatic Neo-Confucians were sharply at odds. Increasingly, she altars merged with temples to local deities. While Neo-Confucian scholars and ritual purists attempted to preserve the integrity of the official shrines known as sheji citan (altars of the soil and grain, shrines and altars to the virtuous, the chaste and the filial), for many, including localized gentry, the notion of lishe (village altar of the soil/local gods) was becoming much broader. In the Putian area, an inscription entitled Shengdun Zumiaoji |B and dated 1 150, perhaps the earliest extant source to record the cult of Mazu ÜMfi, begins with the comment, "Villages have she (altars/temples) where people worship throughout the empire, but (this is done) especially fervently by the people of Min." The remainder of the inscription goes on to describe how the goddess came in a dream to direct the reconstruction of the Shengdun temple, and the repositioning of her statue into the place of honor in the center of the temple altar.20 In this text temples to local deities are equated with she altars. Other sources on village level ritual in the Putian area during the Southern Song, including official records of canonized deities, literati writings, and stone inscriptions, record the process of imperial recognition or canonization of local deities.21 A stele 19 Hu Bingwen, Yunfeng wenji 2, quoted in Kanai Noriyuki, "Nansõ ni okeru shashokudan to shabyõ ni tsuite ki no shinkõ otoshite chùshin t LT^'Ls" in Fukui Fumimasa łi# ed., Taiwan no shukyõ to Chügoku buňka 188-89, Tokyo: Fúkyõsha, 1992. 20 For the text of this inscription, see K.

Between 1107-1256, from the reign of Song Huizong to Gaozong on to that of Song Lizong , in Putian 59 titles were given to 23 deities, while in Xianyou 37 titles went to 17 deities and over the same period in Xinghua prefecture 18 titles were bestowed onto 10 deities.

The Xinghuajun Xiangyingmiaoji 13 (Record of the Temple of Auspicious Response of the Xinghua Commandery), was composed in 1138 by the Grand Master for Court Audiences, Administrator of the Taishou Taoist Belvedere for the Veneration of the Tao, Fang Lue (fi. 1 107-1 129) and written out by Grand Master for Closing Court, Vice-Director of the Branch Bureau of Equipment of the Ministry of War, Fang Zhao ýj^B.22, Both of these officials were from the village of Baidu in which the temple was located, some ten li M to the north of Putian City. (The stele is now at the Putian Museum.) The text states that in 1 107 Emperor Huizong Mtk worshipped the "hundred gods" in the southern subur- ban sacrifice. He commanded that all those gods of the mountains and rivers and the hundred gods that had performed meritorious deeds for the people should be reported to the Circuit Fiscal Commissioners. Therefore the deeds of the god were reported to the Court which responded to the request of the people and presented the temple with an official name. Nine years later in 1116 another worship of the "hundred gods, "con- ducted by Huizong in the Ming Tang led to another report and a request for a tide for the god of the temple. This was accepted by the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and signed with pleasure by the Emperor. The title of "Duke of Manifest Kindness" was granted in 1 122. Some god had already been worshipped with bloody sacrifices at the temple in the Five Dynasties at a different location. The temple was moved to the cur- rent location after a divine sign during a lightning storm. Local knowledgeable obser- vers remarked on the excellent geomancy of the new site. Fang Lue comments that the people of this village (and of the great and excellent [Fang] clan) now often reached high office, thus fulfilling the geomancy and prophecies surrounding the temple. The temple had been known for some time as the Great Official Temple, because "after a local man had become a great official, he retired and lived out his old age in his home village." The author explains that at every festival of the local she this retired official would lead the villagers in worship of the gods, just as in the ancient "Wine-drinking ceremony."23 inscriptions. Certain later gazetteers record discomfort with this proliferation of cults. The Jiajing Xianyou xianzhi M$míŮi claims that many such cults are illegitimate and licentious. The list in that gazetteer is sharply reduced from 17 deities to only 6. This early Ming gazetteer's exclusive attitude may reflect early Ming efforts to reform and systematize official worship of popular cults. This reformist zeal led to two efforts to stamp out licentious cults in the area. In 1465 Prefect Yue Zheng "destroyed licentious cults" and in 1519 Prefect Lei Yinglong Hflllfl "destroyed over 400 temples" (some accounts state that the total was 800). Such efforts were nevertheless the exception rather than the rule. Subsequent gazetteers, and presumably some degree of official recognition would revert to a broader set of criteria of legitimacy, i.e., 1 ) clear evidence of imperial canonization; 2) inclusion in early local gazetteers; 3) local custom.

Especially during the time between spring and summer, there were frequent typhoons and outbreaks of plague. On such occasions local people prayed to the god, and carried the god on procession, using Buddhist or Taoist rituals (Futu Laozi zhifa ) to worship him. The text describes several instances when the god speaks or performs miracles to provide divine protection: from locust plagues in 1 1 17, Fang La's bandit army in the early 1 120's, and rebel bands of soldiers attacking Fuzhou in 1 129 and 1 130. Next we find several passages describing the assis- tance rendered by the god to local merchants on their journeys by sea both along the China coast and overseas. A visit to the temple to collect incense becomes obligatory before embarking on a long voyage. The text goes on to describe restorations under- taken by retired officials of the Fang lineage in 1083 and 1116 and recounts the excel- lent effect on the community of the improved ritual conduct in the temple. We learn that the god is involved in every aspect of everyday life, from upholding morality to making business decisions. The text next discusses the most recent repairs to the temple in 1 134 to 1 136, in which the temple was enlarged to a size of 82 beams. They used ten million cash for these repairs. The text concludes with a description of the joys of retirement and a reminiscence on the author's youth in the village. He served in government for over thirty years, twice as Prefect. During that time whenever he returned to worship his ancestors, he would always worship in the temple. Having retired, he can now take part in the worship of the god and local feasting. His account of these village rituals is deeply felt. Liu Kezhuang was only a child when this inscription was written, but he would later write a poem about a scene in front of this same temple. His poem is entitled "On hearing about the great excitement at the theater in front of the Temple of Benevolent Responses," and it contains the following lines: 1. The lanes are empty, the people have all gone to have fun, The light of the candles is brighter than during lantern festival. An old man of the mountains falls asleep, then awakes, While in front of the stage people mindlessly push and shove. . . 2.

Liu explains that: "The god began as a commoner. His name was Master Zhan Ä. He used talismans and registers of gods to tame savage beasts, exorcise demons, and cure disease. From the Tang until now, the god was given five promotions in imperial enfeoffment [i.e., levels of official canoniza- tion]. He feeds on blood [offerings] from throughout this region. . . . The tomb of the god was on the west bank of the Qiulu river [which runs through Jiangkou township]. Passersby bow before it and clean the gravesite. Periodically, the elders have to worship the god by escorting its sedan chair back and forth between the pines and cypresses [of the tomb and the temple in the city]. Lanterns shine and drums and horns sound throughout the city. The empty alleys reverberate with the sound."24 Liu's brief inscription enables the reader to sense the role played by sound in local cults: fragments of a melody, bits of a song, blocks of sound drawn into a circle, by priests or by a procession of musicians, circling around or between sacred sites. Liu's poem and his inscription remind us that it is ritual and music that create sacred space, as much if not more than art and architecture, in the Song and in contemporary times as well. These are also the key constituents of the she , the "altar where the earth is made divine."25 Jiangkou is a township by the sea on the northeast border of Putian district, Fujian province, at the mouth of the Qiulu river.26 The land to the south of the town was gradually reclaimed from the sea, beginning in the late Tang. Throughout the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, the residents of the Jiangkou area built dikes along the sea and an extensive irrigation system beginning at the Nan'an Weir and con- structed a complex local cultural tradition notable for its nested hierarchy of temples, and its elaborate ritual organization. Currently, the Jiangkou plain has a population of 24 Liu compares this temple with other great Song temples of Putian, such as the Mazu temple in Baihu (the Shengdan temple mentioned above) and the Longpu shrine. He compares the efficacy of the god to that of the Nirvana Master of Guishan Monastery Ulll^f. The Nirvana Master referred to by Liu Kezhuang was most likely the Chan Buddhist Master Ye Zhenshen MMM.

In recent years, the town has seen phenomenal changes, with four-story apartment buildings going up along the highway and increasingly in the town itself. The temples of Jiangkou town have all been rebuilt, mostly with support from Overseas Chinese contributions. Beyond the wall of roadside apartment buildings lie the fields, irrigation channels, and villages. Jiangkou township formed slowly out of the union of seven villages. It is now the main market center for the villages scattered along the base of the mountains and ir- rigated alluvial plains along the sea to the south of the Qiulu river. Jiangkou has long been a harbor for ocean-going ships. It is also located next to a bridge linking the main trade route from Fuzhou to Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. From the Song on- wards, it was known as "a place where merchant ships docked, and the smoke of people's households was thick." In the Ming and Qing dynasty, a postal station, a cus- toms inspectorate, and a military garrison were located there. Thus Jiangkou was also the political center of the area. At the summit of the complex nested hierarchy of the temple system that gradually developed in the Jiangkou area is the Dongyueguan (Eastern Sacred Mountain Belvedere), which is situated on the main highway passing through the town. Interest- ingly enough, legend has it that the Dongyueguan was founded in the Song dynasty when a general of the famous Yang Jiajiang (the Yang warrior clan) led troops into Fujian to suppress the She "barbarians," based in their 18 cavern fortresses.27 While passing through Jiangkou, the troops supposedly stayed in a small tudigong miao zhtfe ÄIÜ (shrine to the earth god). After they had left, an incense sack containing a talisman of the Emperor of the Eastern Sacred Mountain was discovered in the shrine, and so the temple was expanded and rebuilt. All this is highly questionable, since the (Qianlong) Putian xianzhi fŽIHļf states that the Eastern Peak Belvedere was first built in 1336. "Later it collapsed, and not even the foundations survived." In 1609 the Putian District Magistrate He Nanjin Mfííâi "searched for the foundations and rebuilt the temple." The Xinghua Prefect Wang Maogong VīSītl presented the temple with plaques inscribed by the Vice Minister of the Board of Rites Zeng Chuqing b /ÉÍSP , proclaiming "Daizong tianfu ffi (Ancestral Eastern Sacred Mountain, Headquarters of Heaven)"and "Dongyue Siming r]pp (Eastern Sacred Mountain Controller of Destiny)." The Eastern Peak Belvedere was repaired in 1807 by a former District magistrate and member of the local gentry, Zhuang Yunzhi ffiÃíp . Further repairs were undertaken in the early Republican period, at the behest of the Censor Jiang Chunlin a resident of Jiangkou. His younger brother Jiang Chunshu fllłNSf "made the first major contribu- tion to the cause" and his son, Jiang Zuyan iÜflH "raised contributions everywhere to fulfill (his fathers) intent." The Belvedere of the Eastern Sacred Mountain was a center of authority. A stele from 1922 put it this way: 27 Ping Min shibadong , a Qing popular novel preserved in Japan. See note 11.</page><page sequence="13">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 3 1 Although Fujian borders the sea, yet the power of the spirits has truly displayed its dependability. The Belvedere was established here at the Brocade River (Jiangkou) in the Yuan, some five hundred years ago, and its incense fire is the most resplen- dent in all of Putian. As for the [god's] driving away disasters and resolving adver- sities, and invisibly creating good fortune for the people, such matters are too numerous to tell. When it comes to resolving difficulties and settling disputes, extolling the good and vilifying evil, then [the goďs] authority truly is able to fill in those areas that are beyond the reach of local officials and y amen runners. (Stone Inscription on the Restoration of the Eastern Peak Belvedere of Brocade River [i.e., Jiangkou], 1922)28 The Belvedere was a court of last appeals for complicated issues in local society. These matters were settled by the temple committee, consisting of fifteen members drawn from the fifteen most powerful villages in the Jiuliyang AM# (Nine- Ķ i.e., three mile Coastal Plain) area. The committee was also responsible for the maintenance of the Nan'an irrigation system, as we will see below. They also ran academies and schools, orphanages, old people's homes, public cemeteries, and charities. Each year on lunar 2/25 there was a large scale distribution of alms that attracted beggars and the impoverished from miles away. The temple was in effect a general local service center. Inside the temple hangs a giant abacus and a sign reading "First ask your heart." The sign enjoined visitors to search their conscience before casting blame on another. The abacus assured them that the gods would reach the correct tally of good and bad deeds. The front courtyard of the Belvedere houses the Ten Kings of the Underworld, each figured as a stern judge. As a symbol of the augustness of the Humane Emperor of the Eastern Sacred Mountain, the main god statue was not exposed to common view. Visiting villagers tend to present incense and offerings at a shrine located at the gateway of the temple dedicated to one General Cao WÍŘ, who is believed to have died in the local anti-piracy campaign led by Qi Jiguang SScUSt^. General Cao, it is thought, will transmit messages to the Humane Emperor. His birthday, celebrated on lunar 3/28, is even more exuberant than that of the Emperor. By the Qing dynasty and the Republican period, the temple committee of the Dong- yueguan often assembled at the somewhat more remote Donglaisi (Monastery that came from the East). This "monastery" is actually a conglomeration of small, one- room temples, built side to side, indicative of the mix of ritual traditions in the area. A Yuhuangdian 3lìÈÌ&amp; dedicated to the Jade Emperor stands next to a Xiongbaodian M dedicated to the Buddha. Next to that is a shrine to Peng Taishan a local deity noted for his spiritual efficacy M. Next to his shrine is one dedicated to Lin Longjiang WtÌT/I, Lord of the Three (Teachings) in One.29 Finally, next to that is the 28 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 362. 29 The Sanyijiao was developed by Lin Zhao'en (1517-98), the scion of a gentry family from Putian, Fujian.

In 977 the Quanzhou Jiedushi Chen Hongjin ISfíŽftíĚ built a weir in the Qiulu Stream that diverted water from the upper reaches of the river to a set of two major conduits known as the Upper and Lower Conduits. The Lower Conduit branches off into three channels. One of these three chan- nels irrigates the fields around the seven villages at the mouth of the river that grad- ually coalesced into the town of Jiangkou. The irrigation system moves water through these conduits and channels into a vast number of smaller irrigation ditches that would eventually irrigate a total area of 20,000 mu. The Nan'an irrigation system was repaired and expanded in 1065 by Cai Xiang Hit, a favorite son of Putian, and again in 1145. Further repairs were undertaken in 1441, 1613, 1727, 1748, 1823, and 1869.30 The shrine to the founders and early restorers of the Nan'an Weir was originally located in the Wulitang SSÍ# (Five-li Dike), and was repaired in 1685 and 1791. Shortly after this last repair, the shrine appears to have been moved into the Donglaisi. An inscription there originally entitled Chongjian Narianbi baogongci ji (Record of the Reconstruction of the Repayment of Merit Shrine of the Nan'an Weir) dates the construction of the Jiandeci (Shrine to the Construction of Merit) to 1792. Interestingly, the title of the stele has been altered to Xiujian Donglaisi Nananbi ji (Record of the Repair of the Donglaisi's Nan'an Weir). The line that originally read "long ago the Shrine for the Repayment of Merit was built at Wulitang" had been altered to read "long ago the Shrine to the Construc- tion of Merit was built in the Donglaisi." Clearly, the Donglaisi considered the presence of the shrine to be a source of its legitimacy. For the Donglaisi was also the headquarters of the unofficial "irrigation committee" that supervised the Nan'an irriga- tion system. The Nan'an irrigation system was a source of constant friction in the Jiangkou area. Each piece of land reclaimed from the sea put added pressure on the limited resources of the system. Numerous inscriptions record the acts of vandalism carried out by desperate or greedy people along the channels of the system. By the Qing dynasty, major repairs and day-to-day supervision had passed from the government to the local gentry. They set up steles listing the rights and responsibilities of the people dependent on the system for their survival. They also recorded the conflicts that had led to fighting and deaths. Control over the irrigation system was a crucial dimension of the Donglaisi the Three in One has over 1,000 temples in the Xinghua area with tens of thousands of initiates. See K.

The succeeding Ming dynasty ushered in a major restructuring of national and popular religious, social, and economic organization, The government first decreed the es- tablishment of pavilions for wine drinking ceremonies in which government drafted documents would be proclaimed. A unified ritual order known as the lishe xiangli Mtt MM system was decreed in Hongwu 8 (1376) whereby each li M subcanton was to have a sheji altar of the soil and of the grain, and a litan (altar to the unrequited dead). In Hongwu 13 and 14 (1380-1381), the court decreed that the population should be divided into li M (subcantons) and jia (groupings of ten families within a sub- canton). Almost simultaneously, the court issued the tax registration system known as the huangce üíffif (Yellow Registers).32 The Jiangkou plains, that is to say the entire area irrigated by the Nan'an irrigation system and referred to locally as the Jiuliyang, was divided in the Ming administratively into three sub-cantons, namely the Daishengli (Serving the Sage subcanton), Yongfengli (Eternal Rich Harvest subcanton) and the Wangjiangli MÖCM (Gazing at the River subcanton). According to the (Hongzhi period [1488-1505]) Xinghuafuzhi 9, "Litukao (Xinghua Prefectural Gazetteer of the Hongzhi period, Notes on cantons and subcantons), Daishengli was further sub- divided into three tu, and Yongfengli was divided into two tu. "One hundred and ten families make a tu, with ten families functioning as the lizhang MU: (sub-canton heads). The hundred families are divided into groups under [ten] jiashou (leaders of groups of ten families)." Each of the five tu of Daishengli and Yongfengli had an official she altar of the soil established by a government order set forth at the beginning of the Ming dynasty. These five altars were to survive the collapse of this official sys- tem, and became in time the main temples of five distinct local groupings of village temples (see Map below). Daniel Overmyer has translated the relevant passages from the Da Ming huidian A (ed., 1503 and 1587), 81, 93, and especially 94 on the requirement for the com- mon people to: 31 The office of the temple committee of the Donglaisi is now one of the central booking offices for local theatrical performances.

However, an undercurrent of dismay runs through the less prescriptive portions of the gazetteer. Thus we read in the notes to the same chapter, "the rites of the village she have long been abandoned; they are appropriate means for gentlemen of policy to supervise the people." In fact, however, when describing the annual Yuanxiao TcW (Upper Prime Festival of lunar 1/15), they note: The head of every she , just before or after the first full moon, gathers together the people to worship at an annual jiao SI (communal sacrifice) and carry the shezhu iii (master of the she) raojing [in a procession around the territory]. Drums and music lead the way, and lanterns light the path. There is not a single family that does not participate. In Shuinan within Putian the Fang ýj, Xu and Qiu řP lineages build earthen altars for the she altar of the soil, and carry out rites in spring and autumn, they do not pursue the frivolous ways of the subcanton lanes. Their rites can be taken [as a model].34 The "masters of the she" are in fact god statues being taken on procession, implying also the building of temples for them, quite unlike the proper earthen altars of the soil 33 Daniel Overmyer, "Attitudes towards popular religion in ritual texts of the Chinese state: The collected statutes of the great Ming," in Cahiers ďExtreme-Asie 5 (1989-90): 207. Overmyer also provides a translation of the text of the oath and the official invocation. Later passages translate the regulations concerning litan, altars to the uncared-for-ghosts (209- 212).

In the Zhengde period the Prefect Lei Yinglong ftJfiH "vigorously tore down licentious cults" numbering over 800.35 Yet despite such paragons of propriety, popular custom continued to deviate. The (Qianlong) Putian xianzhi notes: The altar of the soil of the subcantons originally were for the worship of the gods of the soil and the grain. Nowadays [the people] all build covered chambers and mis- cellaneously worship a variety of gods. Only Shangyu in Lianzhang SltC and Qian Wang mī in Daishengli fêlEM maintain the earthen altar.

In spring and autumn after having gathered the members of the she and carried out the sacrifices, they recite the regulations and the oath, and then carry out ritual wine drinking in the assembly. These [rites] retain the style (the wind) of antiquity.36 Yet the majority of the people of the Xinghua region continued to build temples to local gods. "As for the gods and spirits worshipped in the various subcantons, the names [of their places of worship] have been changed to gong Hf (palace) or miao IÜ (temple)." Moreover, these temples had absorbed the function of worshipping the uncared-for-dead. "The litan JH® (altars to the uncared for ghosts) of each subcanton and township were ordered established in the Hongwu period, but by now they have all fallen into ruin." By the early sixteenth century, it was not only the ritual order of the Ming dynasty that was crumbling. These changes were noted by Zheng Ji JřŽE (1440-1516), an offi- cial and economic counselor from Duwei, Xianyou, who returned home for twenty years after serving under three emperors.37 Zheng Ji remarks that the entire lishe system had fallen apart. The hundred and ten family units of the early Ming no longer bore any relation to conditions on the ground. His younger brother was due to rotate into the position of head of the li the following year, and Zheng's recommendation was that his brother simply take over responsibility almost on a contract basis for the delivery of 35 "[Prefect Lei] destroyed 800 sites of shrines to fei gui (illegal ghosts), and ex- clusively worshipped Wengong ~X'ň (Zhu Xi) and other Sages in order to expand the Daohua Hfk (Confucian conversion)," from Yihou Lei Juexuan qusibeiji in Fang Liangyong Fang Jiansu wenji 126-27.

It would no longer be necessary to apply an artificial order upon a growing population; rather than a system based on population, responsibility for the delivery of taxes as well as the ordering of local society would devolve upon the gentry, who would operate in the name of the H (subcanton) on a sub-contractor basis with the govern- ment.38 Such a change would of course also transfer authority over rituals at the she altar of the H (subcanton) into the hands of such local sub-contractors. These reflections on local social and economic arrangements relate to the rearran- gement of local finance and symbolic capital at the time. The reforms of the Single Whip Taxation system forced the complex tax and corvee system of the early Ming increasingly into a single monetary standard. Rather than taxing population, these reforms began the process of moving to a tax on land. The comparatively liquid funds raised by these tax reforms were rapidly sucked upwards towards the court and the higher levels of the field administration. This would have left little funding for the performance of symbolic ritual acts at the local level.39 The leading lineages were enlisted to be subcanton heads, responsible both for the delivery of taxes and increasingly for the ritual expenditures for the sacrifices at the altars of the soil and grain established by the Ming government.40 Over time, however, these duties became more and more onerous, as lineages diversified, tax pressures mounted, and tax evasion became an art form. Ultimately, the lijia M system com- pletely disintegrated, and by the early Qing, the powerful lineages had forced the government to reorganize the tax system along a rotation model whereby power to collect taxes was entrusted to large lineages who disguised their actual size and coerced disproportionate taxes out of smaller lineages.41 38 Zheng Ji, Xinbian muluxu §r#É SüW (Preface to a new edition of the table of contents), in Dongyuan wenji (included in the Siku quanshu). Zheng Ji wrote a similarly critical essay on the military populace registration system, noting that it too bore no relation to actual conditions of local society. Support for Zheng Ji's views can be found in Wada (1985) (note 4 above) who quotes a moving statement by Prefect Nan Daji (born in 1487 in Weinan district of Shenxi province, a 1511 jinshi , served as prefect of Shaoxing in 1523, later rose to bureau director of the Ministry of Revenue) on the rapid decline of the lishe system (and of social harmony) that he had observed during his lifetime all across central China (Shenxi, Henan, Zhejiang). 39 Zheng Ji comments that the local gentry of Xianyou agreed to pay for the costs of the replacement of aged Confucian ritual implements in the official Confucian temple when the government was unable to come up with the funds in an inscription entitled Xianyouxian wenmiao jiqiji (Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 404-405). 40 This was a gradual process. The assignment of subcanton heads to prominent lineages was made into official policy by Xing Yongchao, Governor General of Fujian-Zhejiang around 1690. 41 Chen Shengshao remarked of conditions in Qing Xianyou that "The small lineages fear the large lineages more than they fear the officials. Why do they fear them? Because if they are angered, they send out word, moblilize large numbers, and pick a fight. When the small lineages have put up with this for a long time, several of them gather together and fight back;" Wensulu (1842), in Licehuichao , Wensulu, 80, Beijing: Shumu</page><page sequence="19">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 37 TWO VIEWS ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE SHE One effort to respond to the collapse of the lishe system in the mid-Ming is recorded in detail in the Huían zhengshu ifiSrlEllr of Ye Chunji personal name Huafu it "S, cognomen Jiongzhai ŽRH, from Guishan in Guangdong #. Ye received his juren provincial graduate degree in 1552, and served as Instructor (principal of the district academy) in Minqing district (just north of the Xinghua area) until 1570, when he was appointed District Magistrate of Hui'an xian (just south of the Xinghua area). He served until 1574. 42 While in office, he composed one of the most detailed accounts of local governance that has survived from the Ming dynasty. The text is divided into twelve sections, the first three of which describe his intricate efforts to remap and conduct surveys of actual conditions in the district, and his findings concerning its geography and cadastral registration. Sections 5 to 8 include detailed maps and charts on the 34 du ÍÍP (townships - these had in fact amalgamated into 27 by the mid-Ming) into which Hui'an district was divided. The final four sections cover xiangyue com- wenxian, 1983. (Translated in Michael Szonyi, Lineages and rituals in Fuzhou in the late imperial and republican periods , 229-230, D.Phil, thesis, Oxford University, 1994). For an account of the decline of the lishe system and its replacement by a revived xiangyue baojia system in coastal Fujian in the mid-Ming, see Miki Akira "Meimatsu no Fukken ni okeru hokõsei ^ él &lt;5 Tõyõ gakuhõ 61 (1979): 67-107. Miki argues that the lishe system disintegrated as classes polarized, wealthy landowners and officials shielded themselves behind tax exemptions, and many abandoned their original sub-cantons, leaving the registers in shambles. The lishe system degenerated into a tax gathering machine. While some local administrators attempted to reconfigure the tax system by equalizing the landholdings of the subcantons, powerful landowners resisted. With escalating social discontent taking the form of millenarian revolts, rent resistance movements, and pirate raids, military administrators and governors advocated a revived baojia mutual defense system which simultaneously marked the militarization of local society and, in Milďs view, a further intrusion of government power and control into local society to back up the landlord class. 42 See the discussion of Yu Chunjfs contribution to cartography in Timothy Brooks, "Mapping knowledge in the sixteenth century: The gazetteer cartography of Ye Chunji," East Asian Library Journal 8.2 (Autumn, 1994): 5-32. Ye Chunji was born in 1532. He passed the juren provincial candidate exam at the age of 20 in 1552, but never passed the jinshi metropolitan graduate examination. Instead, he submitted a 30,000 character essay to the Longqing emperor and was appointed county school instructor of Minqing. Ye had paid visits to Luo Hongxian (1504-1564) in Jiangxi, and would employ his cartographic techniques and his advocacy of the community compact in his own administration of Hua' an. While in forced retirement in Guangdong, he compiled three regional gazetteers. He was finally restored to an official post as a prefect in the 1590's, and later was made a vice-director of the Ministry of Revenue, and finally rose to the rank of a bureau director of the Ministry before his death in office in 1595.

Ye comments that: Officials nowadays only worship at the district sheji altar. The [altars of the soil and the grains] of the li sub-cantons have mostly all been abandoned. Thereupon licen- tious temples were built [in their place], to the point that a single sub-canton will nowadays have dozens of these temples. They all [falsely] claim the name of altars dedicated to the gods of the soil and the grains. Private homes house shamans and mediums, who receive cults without measure. However, the State regulations specify that these altars should not be enclosed structures. The Son of Heaven is the most honored of the hundred spirits. If it is not recorded in the ritual compendia, who dares to falsely receive any such offerings? Therefore I completely eradicated [the temples], and established lishe [communal altars to the soil] in their place.43 Ye goes on to lay out the precise orthodox measurements of the sheji altar, and outlines the correct forms of leadership, organization, ritual action, and prayers of sacrifice. Ranks and duties are spelled out for the lizhangMLM: (sub-canton leader), jiashou (head of the ten-family unit), huishou H"|i (community head, often e- quivalent to the lizhang)y yinli 3 1 ÎS (leader of the [communal] rites J, shezhu (communal invocator),ywezhettg j^JIE (covenant rectifier), and th efulao 5C3Ě (elders). Ye outlines various scenarios that may arise within the collectivity constituted by the community covenant and organized around the lishe altar. Any civil accusations should be preceded by an oath made at the she altar, before the assembled members of the covenant and the baojia (mutual defense units). Any member of the community covenant who is judged guilty must make a pledge to the gods of the altar that he will accept the punishment of the yuezheng (covenant rectifier). Refusal to comply with the judgment of the yuezheng could lead to the person being expelled from the she collec- tive and his name being struck from the she register. Further comments follow on the unfortunate survival of Taoist and shamanistic practices in the villages, which should be superseded by standardized prayers and rites addressed to the gods of the sheji altar and the city god of Hui'an district. Ye suggests reviving the ancient No rites to take the place of current (Taoist) rites addressed to the stars and the Big Dipper, which useless- ly exhaust the resources of the people. Along the same lines, he forbade "drinking, singing, and heterodox rites, and the performance of miscellaneous plays" at rites of thanksgiving. Ye lists seven regulations forbidding various other forms of heterodox activity. The first and second of these were directed against popular temples, Taoist and shamanistic rites. By his own count, there were 551 licentious cult temples in the 80 sub-cantons of Hui'an district, where libations of wine were made, oxen were sacrificed, and Taoist fasts and communal sacrificial rites {jiao HI) were carried out.

"But I have heard it said that the people still (secretly) move the god statues and house them in their own homes, so that when I leave the gates of the city, the demons return to their temples! How mistaken they are! Elders instruct them!"44 Ye's reformist zeal made him many enemies, and at the end of his tenure in Hui'an, someone intercepted his official orders transferring him to a position as Prefect of Binzhou prefecture in Sichuan. Without his orders, he faced arrest on charges of deser- tion. Ye could only claim illness and retire. Subsequently, his name was in fact struck from the official registers, and he returned to Luofu in Guangdong for over twenty years, before being recalled to officialdom.45 His efforts were short-lived. Subsequent accounts of Hui'an temples reveal that the official lishe altars soon disbanded. A second remarkable source from the mid-Ming offers a far less confrontative look at the theory and practice of the she altar. Rather than an attempt to impose an artificial, classical model upon local custom, we find here an effort to understand the lishe from within. The Grand Secretary Ye Xianggao ÏÈ[a] M {zi, Jinqing hao Taishan §/l Slij, 1562-1627) was a native of Fuqing county, where Ye Chunji had served as a county teacher, just north of Putian on the Fujian coast.46 His "Record of the Cloud Mountain Altar of the Soil Shrine" ( Yunshan shed ji SLUttUgSJ explains in detail the importance of the cult of the Altar of the Soil within his home village: The she altar is housed in a shrine for the worship of the god of the soil and grain. This is a matter of ritual arising from [underlying] meaning. My village's shrine was ancient. Long ago it had been damaged and not repaired. I read the ritual texts, and when residing at home, I encouraged the village lineage members to raise funds and renew the shrine. When the shrine was first completed, I again had to take up office, rushing about in the wind and dust, but I never stopped thinking about stan- ding before the shrine. In my travels, I followed many officials and noblemen, but I always recalled the times I celebrated the annual festival days together with village elders. I remembered fondly how when at home, together with elders and younger relations, we laid out containers of wine and sacrificial meats, and faced each other with great joy. Now at a distance of a myriad miles, I regret that their feelings are distressed. This year no doubt famine has struck. I fear that villagers will not har- vest enough to live on. Whenever I hear that there has been a slight increase, I al- ways feel happy. Since I cannot forget my home village for even a day, how could I 44 Ye Chunji, Hui'an zhengshu , 337. Wada Hinori (note 4 above) cites several other mid-Ming officials who attempted to restore the lishe system. In each case, subsequent accounts in the region's gazetteers indicate the failure of their efforts. 45 See note 42 above. 46 Ye Xianggao was renowned for his uncompromising stance at court. He remonstrated with Emperor Zhu Yichun, and frequently requested leave to retire to his home, since his policies were not being adapted. He was a protector of the Donglin faction against the attacks of Wei Zhongxian. See L.

I appear far away from my village, yet day and night I revere the god. Thus I am but a villager. Now the means by which a villager extends reverence to the god and receives his mercy is not through con- scientious sacrifice and prayer, nor through offerings of incense. It is only by put- ting the family first with filiality and obedience, peacefully resolving village fac- tions [disputes], having pity on those in adversity, and supporting one another when in danger. The strong do not oppress the weak, the many do no violence to the few, all abstain and avoid doing anything that benefits themselves and harms others, or things that are good for themselves but troublesome for others. Thus my village acting as a virtuous and righteous village is due to the god's listening. Thus their families must flourish, and their lineages must grow. If on the other hand they cheat and dissemble for personal benefit, then in the same room blades and spears will battle. Those of the same residence will separate to Hu[nan] and Yue. Despising the success of other people and delighting in the defeat of others - in nothing having any sense of human love - this the god listens to as well. [Such people's] families will inevitable be ruined, and their lineages destroyed. The princi- ples involved are inevitable, and do not change by a hair. As for my fellow villagers, fortunately they have avoided [these faults]. I have dwelt here for a long time. Recalling this I feel ashamed, for what has been done has not completed what was in my heart. I fear I have offended the elders. This [failing] has been inspected by the god, so I dare not but exert my utmost, and I desire that all my fellow villagers will share my feelings. May the neighborhoods and village factions all be happy and re- laxed, as though they shared the flesh and blood of one family. Then though I be a myriad miles away, I will be delighted. When I left [the village] the elders asked me to write a record of the shrine but I didn't complete it. I have taken advantage of an official leave to write this and announce it to my sons. And also to show it to the children of the village. Let those who pass by the shrine and read my words also be moved and feel exhorted to do good.47 This text shows the forces of fusion that a shrine built around the altar of the god of the soil was believed to bring into play for villagers in the Ming dynasty. Perhaps the most important notion is that "liyiyi qi ÎSJ^ÎËjiË" (rituals arise from the meanings underlying the rites). This conception opens the way for local transformations of ritual practice, while at the same time providing the basis for a self-justifying discourse. In the same collection that includes this inscription, Yu offers another account of the reasons underlying the fission of she altars/temples. This is the Jiapu zonglin zhuan ^ Ih (Account of the lineage neighbors in the family genealogy). Here we find: All these families were our close neighbors. They all shared a she altar of the soil. 47 Cangxiacao îr®ÉI^ 11.32-33 (2:1127-30). The Cangxiacao was banned in the Qing. See Wolfgang Franke, Introduction to the sources of Ming history , 1.1.12, 5.8.47, and 7.1.8, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore: University of Malaya Press, 1968. The Cangxiacao has recently been republished by the Fujiansheng Wenshi yenjiuguan (Yangzhou: Jiangsu Guangling guji, 1994).</page><page sequence="23">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 4 1 The she altar had a shrine for the worship of the god of the soil and the grain... Thus the villages on the west of the mountain shared our she altar. Yet the people involved were numerous and contentious. Each year the god was invited to a feast in his honor and an assembly of the altar of the soil ttH" was held. Often liquor was consumed and curses exchanged to the point of fighting. The villagers suffered from this. When the shrine of the god collapsed and it was time to rebuild it the elders advised that we not accept one cent from the west of the Mountain and that we refuse to associate with them. The West of the Mountain village also built their own she altar and no longer came to [ours]. The avoidance of quarrels and fights at the assembly of the god of the soil began with this division of the she altar.48 Clearly the cohesiveness of the she altar/shrine was a consequence of exclusivity. This text goes on to describe geomantic conflicts with neighboring lineages that were resolved through carefully negotiated limits on the height of future buildings set down in contracts - early examples of geomantic zoning regulations. These comments also suggest that she altars to the soil were becoming basic building blocks of local temple networks. As we will see below, many official she altars merged with temples to local gods, and then sent off branch altars which formed the basis of new communities growing out of expanding lineages. What the lineages lost in terms of hierarchical domination they made up in terms of flexible networking. LOCAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE ALTAR IN THE LATE MING AND QING The local transformations of the she altar/shrine beginning in mid-Ming Putian were based on larger social and administrative changes. By the middle of the Ming the admin- istrative subdivisions of the Jiangkou area had begun to collapse. Of the original five tu in the area, there were left only one tu each in Daishengli and Yongfengli. As we will see below, however, the five original she altars of the soil associated with the five early Ming tu administrative regions continued to play a role in the local temple system and ritual organization. Fieldwork in the area has led us to conclude that the five early she became the chief temples within five larger clusters of she altars and miao temples.49 Over the course of the Ming and Qing dynasties five such clusters, known as jing (sacred territory), each made up of seven constituent units (called " qijing or seven-fold spiritual territory), took shape in the Jiangkou plains. The term jing thus refers both to the overall sacred territory composed of all the seven units, as well as to the spiritual territory of each individual religious unit. Each of these units contain both a she , altar of the soil, and a miao (temple to the popular gods). Only territorial units of 48 Ye Xianggao, Cangxiacao 15.35 (3:1595-99). 49 This section of the paper is based on fieldwork carried out in the Xinghua region with Prof. Zheng Zhenman of Xiamen University. Professor Zheng's innovative analysis of this data, upon which this section of the paper draws, was first published as "Putian Jiangkou pingyuan de zongjiao kongjian yu simiao tixi" in Simiao yu minjian wenhua taolunhui (see n. 29), 2: 579-600.</page><page sequence="24">42 KENNETH DEAN this kind have the right to hold religious processions. The term raojing (circling the sacred territory) implies a procession made up of its constituent groups that trace a line marking the boundaries of the entire territory. Any village that lacks either a she altar or a miao temple or both is prohibited from participating as an equal in these group processions, and must join one of the full-fledged member villages as part of their retinue. The following are the sacred territorial clusters of the Jiangkou plains with their respective most likely original she altar indicated (see Map):50 1) the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Fushan (Qianwang village, Fu- shan she MïtÎÂUJÎt) 2) the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Jiangkou town (Qianhuicun Xing- chun she 3) the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Shiting (Shiting village, Fuxings/ie EMfcMSmt) 4) the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Fengmei (Xiaxiao village Lixing- shernnmmm 5) the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Goushang (Qianmian village Jia- xings/ze MBföÄÄtt) Each of these clusters has its own internal dynamic and pattern of development. The following notes summarize some of our fieldwork on the main village temples and she altars within these areas, and relates the development of sacred territorial clusters over the Ming and Qing period. The Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Fushan The villages, temples, and she altars of the Fushan cluster are amongst the oldest in the Jiangkou area, because they are in the foothills of the mountains which once was the coastline prior to the reclaiming of the plains from the sea. They are all above the Upper Conduit of the Nan'an irrigation system. These villages have suffered from their harsh surroundings and their increasing distance from the sea, the road, and the market. Two of the original seven village units of the seven-fold territory have disappeared, leaving only Qianwang MŁ Shihui c, Youlan ÍÈJSL, Shantou, and Shishi. Many of these villages are impoverished and the temples are meager in comparison with the spec- tacular temples of Jiangkou town. Some simply refer to their temples as a shey rather than a miao . In Qianwang village, however, one can still find the Fushanshe, which is known as the "Main Temple of the Seven-fold Territory." This temple of course has statues of the Old Man of the Earth and his wife, but it also has statues of Zhanggong Shengwang Dutian Yuanshuai žl$;^7ÉÉlfl, Wengong Yuanshuai Ím07ÊÈí|J, 50 In some cases we were able to date the founding she altar back to the Ming. In many cases, however, the earliest attested dates (of repairs , renovations, etc.) were from the Qing. Nevertheless, even in late developing spiritual territories, we find similar structural features developing over time.</page><page sequence="25">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 43 Kanggong Yuanshuai Liugong Yuanshuai SJfi- ŤÉÉltl, Tiangong Yuanshuai EHÖTÜÜft, and Jin Dajiangjun on side altars. Local elders explain that the gods of the seven villages originally branched off from this set of gods in the Main Temple. Although evidence is scanty, these temples would appear to date back to the Ming. The Seven-fold Sacred Territory ofjiangkou Town The Jiangkou Seven-fold Sacred Territory took shape in the Ming dynasty. Almost all of the village units of the spiritual territory ofjiangkou contain both a she altar and a temple. Usually these temples had absorbed the she altars into themselves, setting up a side altar for them within the temple. 1) The Youshengguan fëlSIS in Xiaoyicun houses the Lingxingshe ®ü tt. This temple was built in the Ming, and repaired in the Qianlong period. 2) The Fuhaitang in Gangxiacun houses the Ningjiangshe This temple came into being by transforming the Fuhaian íêíS/i; Buddhist chapel in 1580. It was repaired in the Qianlong period. 3) The Qingdatang iff of Duweitoucun fi® M W houses the Longxingshe Ü fl%t. This temple was also created by transforming an earlier Buddhist chapel in 1721, which was repaired in the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. 4) The Chongqingguan in Liujingcun houses the Tiyunshe and the Linzhenshe üSíf^i . The temple was built during the Qianlong period. 5) The Fengchigong SUÊK in Xinjingcun houses the Longjinbeishe fÍÍ$ (Dragon Ford northern altar of the soil). This temple was first built in the Ming, and later rebuilt in the Qing Qianlong period. 6) The Lutaigong IpK of Huoduncun fêMM houses the Longjinshe ÜíMi (Dragon Ford altar of the soil). The date of this temple is unknown, but it must have preceded that of the aforementioned Dragon Ford Northern altar of the soil (no. 5 above), which branched off from it at some point in the Ming dynasty. 7) Miaoyinggong inQianhuicun ftífW+í houses the Xingchunshe The date of construction of this temple is unknown, but it was repaired in 1863. This she is said to be the founding altar of this cluster. One can conclude that the majority of the shemiao ttJÜ (temples containing altars of the soil) of the Seven-fold Spiritual Territory ofjiangkou town were built in the Ming, and that all of them had attained their final form by the mid-Qing. A few of the villages that formed into Jiangkou were unable to achieve independence and ritual equality with the others. Thus for example, Lower Houducun in Jiangkou town is said to have had a Xuantian Shangdi temple from the Ming onwards, but because it has never established a she altar, it could not be considered an independent territory for the purposes of the processions, and so has always had to take part in the Xiaoyigong's retinue when participating in the procession of the Seven-fold Sacred Territory ofjiangkou.</page><page sequence="26">44 KENNETH DEAN The Seven-fold Sacred Territory ofFengmei The fourth cluster of seven-fold sacred territories in the Jiangkou plain listed above is the Fengmei cluster. This cluster took on its current shape in the Qing dynasty, and even now has not yet reached a complete form. We have found the following dates for temples in this cluster: 1) The Beiyuangong jtiāK in Zhongzhaicun 4^ W houses the Chongxingshe S Ätt, and was built in 1759. 2) The Wudangdian in Dongtiancun iSEB W houses the Min'anshe and was built in 1 8 1 1 . 3) The Beijidian of Jingtoucun ífípttí houses the Lixingdongshe ĪSĀS and was built in 1868. This she altar probably branched off from the Ming founding she altar of the Fengmei cluster, the Lixingshe in Xiaxiaocun T NÉ Wîltfltt. The Seven-fold Sacred Territory ofShiting The Shiting seven-fold sacred territory, like the Fengmei cluster discussed above, also began to take shape in the Qing Qianlong period, and remains quite unstable. The Shiting cluster includes: 1) The Beijigong zltÜK in Dongshicun îfCÎÈtÎ houses the Qixingshe Ulitt and was built in 1723. 2) The Xinlinggong fjfSK of Xiliucun houses the Fuxing xishe łgUtt and the Lianjiangxishe SlffiSít The temple was built in the Qianlong period. 3) The Beichengong zibMK of Jiexiacun houses the Liangjiangshe Híltt and was built in 1862 (this temple and the she altar were both moved into the Zixiatang in Dongcaicun which houses the Zhenjiangshe SSŽItt, after their original sites were destroyed). This cluster also took shape in the Qing Qianlong period, and remains quite unstable, as the movement of she altars in no. 3 above indicates. The Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Goushang The fifth cluster is the Goushang Seven-fold Sacred Territory. Here we find an interesting set of examples that confirms the rule that a village must have both a she altar and a miao temple unique to itself before it can participate as one of the units of the Sacred Territory: 1) Qianmian Mfflłł village contains both the Guangrenmiao tUÜ and the Jia- xingdian both of which set up identical Jiaxingshe jSífl $£. But there is another separate small Jiaxingshe shrine in the village dedicated to the Earth God, his Wife, and the Dragon King of the Four Seas which is said to be the "ancestral she altar" of the entire Goushang cluster. 2) Youdun village's Jiletang Dingdun village's Guanghuitang I MM and Xiadun village's Lingxianmiao all established a com-</page><page sequence="27">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 45 mon she , the Jifushe HÛSÎi. 3) Houku village's Weixianmiao Licu village's Weixiandian Xindun village's Fuhaitang , and Tianzhongyang villages Yongfutang H all have established altars of the Xinxingshe íJŤfltt. All the above villages whose temples share a she altar rather than having one unique to their own village cannot participate on an equal basis with the older villages in this cluster, which took shape in the rapidly expanding land reclaimed from the sea during the Ming dynasty. Other villages in this area also developed later, but have been unable to establish a she altar. For example, the Xindiancun has a Longyutang Zheche village has a Weixiantang and Houcheng village has a Jinshan- gong ížiětíáĚ lil®. But since none of these villages has a she altar, even though they each have a temple, they too cannot participate as equals in the procession of the Goushang Seven-fold Territory. The evolution of the religious territorial clusters of the Jiangkou plain can be analyzed into four types, or phases: 1) multiple small villages sharing a common main temple (she). The Fushan cluster is the classic example. 2) independent villages with "self-established" she altars and miao temples: the majority of the villages that formed into Jiangkou in the Ming dynasty fit this category, as do some of the older villages in the Goushang cluster. The Shiting and Fengmei clusters appear to be moving in this direction, but are still unstable and incompletely formed. 3) second generation or newly established villages with one she altar shared be- tween several temples. Several villages in the Goushang cluster which moved into newly reclaimed land in the Qing dynasty fit this category. 4) third generation or additionally branched off villages with temples but no she altars. Some of the newest villages along the seacoast in the Goushang cluster fall into this category. What this suggests is that the lijia M Ç system of the early Ming had disintegrated while the she that had been officially founded in the administrative subcantons or tu H levels continued to provide an organizing framework for local social and cultural self-organization. The she began to mutate from a government shrine into a fundamen- tal building block of the local temple system. This process of mutation can be seen in the process of the founding of new villages or the branching off of new villages from earlier ones. As the population expanded, new settlements were formed. These new settlements sought to found branch she altars as the symbolic basis of their new ter- ritory, but many, for one reason or another, were not able to do so. The popular appropriation and manipulation of the sub-administrative system is an example of cultural individuation. In much the same way that the classical model of ancestral worship was stretched and appropriated to allow for the evolution of lineage halls worshipping an expanded set of founding ancestor, the Fujian pioneer ancestor,</page><page sequence="28">46 KENNETH DEAN and then any number of successful ancestors and branch founders, the official system of religious worship was also transformed. The early official requirement of one she it altar per H S (subcanton) was soon expanded in local practice to allow each jia (ten jia to a It) to establish its own shemiao . As the population increased, the size of the hu ^ associated with each jia ^ (officially ten hu to a jia) began to expand. Particularly in the context of the reclamation of land from the sea, a single hu (taxation-unit household) could expand into several villages on the newly reclaimed mudflats. Each of these villages, as a symbol of their relative independence, sought to build their own she it (altar of the soil). Later the she proliferate: one finds many cases of an East shey West she , a North she , and so on, with the growth of population and division of property. These she quickly developed anthropomorphic representations (Tudigong ztttfeß , known in the Putian area as Mingwang 0£J3E). Eventually, neighborhoods or even individual families built their own tudigong shrines. Other in-migrating people, especially those Minnan H ļ^f residents escaping exten- sive pirate raiding in the mid-Ming, brought along their local gods (but usually not their Tudigong). These gods were sometimes jointly worshipped with the gods of the local she in larger temples called miao , or shemiao it J® . Over time, the importance of these shemiao expanded. A hierarchy of ever more magnificent temples developed: miao - gong - dian - guan ®!1eïS£1S. A single large temple might house several she altars, and over a dozen gods. People in the Putian plains began to conceive of their she and miao as part of wider spiritual precincts known as jing To this day villagers give their addresses in terms that range from she to miao to gong to jing to li. The level of jing is particularly significant. As a boundary defined by religious processions be- tween several villages, it represents the evolution of a local conception of spatial iden- tity. It may have evolved from Taoist notions, for the term jing iff is used in Taoist ordinations certificates. In any case, we sense here a complex layering of historical and institutional arenas of identity, changing over time, but retaining some connection to their earlier meanings. To summarize the process of the transformation from the she to the miao , we find evidence in Jiangkou that the original, official Ming dynasty lishe Sit was the center of worship of a number of villages. These villages founded temples dedicated to gods that were worshipped alongside the founding she altar. Later, as peripheral villages became more independent, they established their own shey often within a larger temple. As new villages began to spring up in the land reclaimed from the sea, the pattern began again. Several villages might share one she altar within different temples dedicated to dif- ferent gods. Those newer villages that developed from the former set of villages did not yet have their own she altars, and thus in some ways resemble the first category of temples that developed from a founding she altar. These relationships are embodied in the ritual practice of the temple network of the Jiangkou irrigated plain, as well as within the internal ritual organization of the vil- lages within the temple network. Before turning to these issues, let us examine other evidence of the continuity and mutability of the she in the Ming and Qing dynasties.</page><page sequence="29">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 47 STONE INSCRIPTIONS ON SHE ALTARS IN PUTIAN Stone inscriptions on she altar/shrines from Putian and dating from the Ming and Qing can be classified into six general categories. The first set reflects the continued impact of the official re-creation of archaic rituals at the subcanton altar of the soil in the early Ming. These mid-Ming inscriptions thus reveal the continued strong role of the government in local society. They reflect the efforts of the Ming government to achieve cultural and political unification through the imposition of the combined baojia ÍS ^ , xiangyue Mffà , and lishe Sít systems. A first example of these mid-Ming inscriptions on the she altar is the Puban Zhengci zengjianji (Record of the expansion of the Zheng lineage hall of Puban), dated 1526. This inscription describes how a District Magistrate built a she altar of the soil to commemorate a major feat of irrigation engineering. On the former foundations of the Buddhist monastery, he built a room with four pillars, in which to worship the gods of the soil and the grain. To the side other gods were worshipped. The front was opened up as a gateway, and in the back resided the shamanic invokers. Then earth [en walls] and wooden beams were used to complete the she altar of the soil.51 A second inscription from this period is the Chongxiu lishe (Record of the restoration of the village temple) dated 1548, and written by Zhu Qi.52 The gods of the subcanton altar of the soil steer people away from disaster and avoid calamities. For generations they have eaten blood sacrifices at the earthen (altar), as shining spiritual powers. Our spiritual territory consists of the Yiqi eastern altar of the soil. The antiquity of the temple is not recorded, but it was repaired in 1391. From that time until today 157 years have passed. The old buil- ding had degenerated, and there were no longer sacrificial rites. The elders planned to carry out repairs, and everyone agreed on the project as if they were redoing their own homes. . . . For in the light dwell people, but in the darkness live ghosts and spirits; they support one another just like heaven and earth. If the gods are happy at heart, then times are harmonious and the harvest is abundant, disasters to not strike, and people live in health and happiness. Thus people pray to them as they have done since antiquity. My region, from the beginning of this dynasty to this day, has grown in population a hundredfold. Their customs have been careful and cour- teous, reasonable and just . . . and they have enjoyed the good fortune of great peace and harmony. Truly had it not been for the power of the silent care of the god this would not have been possible. Thus these repairs and the worship [of the god] are 51 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 154. 52 Zhu Qi was the author of the Tianma shanfang yigao tirili M 5ÍÍI, included in the Siku quanshu .</page><page sequence="30">4$ KENNETH DEAN indeed appropriate . . .(the inscription concludes with a poem in honour of the god in the style of the Chuci Songs of the South).53 A third inscription in this first set entitled Xiaoyi lishe chongjianji # IS Sít Jí ® (Record of the restoration of the village temple) and dated 1588 describes the dreams and visions surrounding the repair of an altar of the soil in Xiaoyi subcanton. The temple had been built at the beginning of the Ming by an early Lin ancestor but was destroyed by soldiers later. In the Zhengde period (1506-21) the sixth generation des- cendant rebuilt the shrine, and so the people of the subcanton still consider them the patrons of the temple. "The temple was built facing east. In the central hall is wor- shipped the [god of the] soil and the harvest, and the other saintly kings and various gods. To the east there is an altar to the Immortal Maiden." The temple was destroyed again in fighting. In 1587, by the end of spring no rain had fallen so the masses prayed at the altar of the soil. Huang Xunji filili! îÊî dreamt that an elder in a steep hat and a broad belt spoke to him, saying "The rain will come, but where am I to rest?"The next day it indeed rained. The masses thanked the god, and Huang told them all that had been said in his dream. That year in the ninth month of autumn, a neighborhood child was walking in the temple and saw the statue of the Saintly King suddenly stand up three times. He told people but no one believed him. On the next day a weird wind let out a thundering noise and the statue pitched out of its carved case and fell onto the floor. The masses were frightened and ran to tell me about it. I said, "Ah, the god really isn't content in his carved case, he is informing us, and we had better think about it."54 The local gentry agreed to assist in repairs and a committee was struck and many gentry made contributions. The temple was rebuilt, and an altar set out for the Immortal Maiden, and the temple renamed the Taiyi linggong . The completion of the shrine was marked by a visit and a sacrifice to the god of the soil and the grain con- ducted by the Prefect, the District Magistrate, and many other local officials. "The pledge was recited, and the rites were orderly and splendid." The renown of the altar is said to have reached the ears of significant officials far and wide. The second set of inscriptions, covering the Qianlong period, provides evidence of the continuity of the she altar/temples although now for the most part the costs of reconstruction and repair are locally borne. One reason for the gap in coverage of she altars from the late Ming to the Qianlong is the dynastic change and the coastal evacua- tion, not to mention the ravages of pirate armies that tormented the Putian plains through the late 1500's. The Chongjian xiaoyi shexue beiji iE (Stele 53 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 170.

This inscription from the same temple commemorates the repairs to the altar and of a school associated with it. The inscription states that "the altar is located in the midst of five jing if (spiritual territories), so [one character missing] fear [not ] that no one [will come forward to assist in the repairs]."55 This is another example of the first phase in the evolution of the she altar in the local temple system as discussed above in relation to Jiangkou, where several jing spiritual territories began sharing a central she altar. Three other inscriptions from the Qianlong period testify to the continued impor- tance of the shemiao. The Chongxiu Guangrenmiao beiji (Stele recording the restorations to the Temple of Broad Humanity), dated 1768, begins with the phrase, "The ancients prayed (in the spring) and repaid the gods with competitive (festivals in the fall). This resulted in (the building of) altars of the soil." The Xianying she zu xu (Preface on the village association rents due to the Temple of Manifest Responses), dated 1792, lists lands bequeathed to an altar of the soil. So does the Chongjian Longjin zushe juankuanbei (Stele listing con- tributions to the reconstruction of the ancestral earth god temple at Longjin), dated 1793.56 A third set of inscriptions relates to the absorption of the she into academies. Here we can see the she being used by local gentry to create their own network of connections within local society through the medium of temple networks. The Dingjian Jijiangshuyuan xiaoji (Brief record of the construction of the Jijiang academy) dated 1793, relates how some hundred households connected to the original temple had to move to Hanjiang at the time of the coastal evacuations of the 1670's, where they set up a temple in a storied building. This building later declined, and so an old building was purchased and an academy was built next to the she temple. Inside it Wenchang H was worshipped, along with Kuidou M-4-, with the City God and the Earth God to left and right. Another such inscription, the Chongxiu Gutang shexue ji (Record of the repairs to the Gutang village-altar and school) dated 1822, begins with the remark that "As for the people, the spirits are their rulers. For this reason, the Sage Kings first perfected the people, and then turned all their efforts towards the spirits. Thus the people have had she temples for a long time." The remainder of the inscription lists the contributions to the repair of the temple and the associated academy. A fourth set of inscriptions all from the nineteenth century Haopu lishe subcanton altar provides insights into the continuity of this form of she in the late Qing dynasty. The first of these is the Chongxiu Haopu lishe ji (Record of the repairs to the Haopu subcanton altar of the soil), written in 1813 and still extant in the Haopu lishe temple in Dongyang village near Putian city: 55 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 242-43. 56 These texts can be found in Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 250, 260, and 263.</page><page sequence="32">5° KENNETH DEAN According to the sacrificial regulations of the Book of Rites , the King sets up an altar to the soil on behalf of all the [great] surnames, and this is called the Great Altar of the Soil. The feudal lords set up altars to the soil on behalf of the hundred [common] surnames, and these are called State Altars of the Soil. The altars of the soil set up by various groups below the level of the great officials are called "local altars of the soil." The "local altars" are equivalent to our contemporary lishe (sub- canton altars). At the she altar one worships the soil and at the;z altar one worships the grain. Without grain people could not survive, and without soil they would have nowhere to live, thus when one worships at the altar of the soil one must also worship at the altar of grain... the Haopu altar of the soil was built in the Jiajing period (1522-1566) of the Ming dynasty. As a child I heard the elders discuss its history in great detail and so learned that the god had averted disaster and driven off calamities, showing mercy to my fellow villagers over several generations. Thus it is only natural that at one time, a request to the court made through the efforts of [my ancestor] the Honorable Zhong Shengshao Qi, should have been answered by the bestowal of a solemn title of enfeoffment. People say that the buil- ding of the she altar started when the Honorable Qi returned to the village, and divined a site by the side of the canal, and then together with the Wu lineage of Xizhu, led the [residents] of the jwg-spiritual territories of Xuqiao, Xishi, Gouxi, etc., in contributing land and pooling funds. . . . [the temple was rebuilt in the Qian- long period, after the wars of dynastic succession, but burned down in 1811. The author of the inscription lays plans for the reconstruction, stating:] During the Jia- qing period (1796-1820), my family has been crowned with official success, each generation from father to son has seen beautiful results in the examinations. Moreover, the Wu lineage and the Xu lineage have both enjoyed prosperous har- vests. Now all these lineages gained merit through their patronage of the altar of the soil. Their names have been carved in stone, and banners have frequently been bestowed upon them. Their meritorious deeds and actions sparkle and shine. The current rebuilding project will also start everything anew. How should I not think that [the results] will be any different than in the past? From now on, all those who join with me and unite their hearts and join their qi without drawing distinctions among one another and delighting in sharing with one another, then, when we ask for good fortune we will receive it, and we will see spring prayers and autumn rites of thanksgiving, harmonious times and bountiful harvest, with the hundred things flourishing and human talents spreading and growing. Thus the rites at the altar of grain shall have fine prospects. This is something I just had to record. 1813, au- tumn, Chen Bilai PiSí/BS, a man of the li (subcanton).57 An earlier inscription, the Chongjian Xizhang Haopushe bei (Stele on the reconstruction of the western Haopu altar of the soil of Xizhang village), dated 1801, reveals that the Haopushe had already developed several branch shemiao temples 57 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical Materials , 290-91.</page><page sequence="33">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 5 1 in the area of a founding she altar: "The she temple of my region was first built in the Zhizheng period of the Yuan dynasty by our ancestor in order to worship the gods. The she later turned into the Heavenly Flower Buddhist chapel ... [and many gentry vis- ited]."58 The decline of the temple provokes a descendant of the founding patron, sur- named Zeng "It, to undertake repairs. The bulk of the contributions come from fellow family members, with a few exceptions. The decision to transform the Buddhist chapel into a village temple housing a branch of the original Haopu she altar relates to the complex connections between these villages clustered close together along the same section of the Mulan irrigation system. Despite the references to harmony and unity in the preceding inscriptions, there were many matters that the leadership of the Haopushe would not tolerate. These are detailed in the Haopushe jinyue bei (Stele outlining prohibitions and statutes of the Haopu she [temple]) written in 1843 and still set in the wall of the afore-mentioned Haopu lishe temple in Dongyang village near Putian city. These regulations include provisions for the upkeep of the temple keeper JÜÍ, including a residence and some land that he alone could farm. He also supervised a grove of lychees, which would support the costs of "incense and oil" when they matured. One regulation demands that on the birthday of the gods, at the New Year, and on the spring and autumn rituals at the she altar, etc., worshippers were expected to watch over their lamps and fireworks until dawn, so as to prevent another fire. Other regulations insist that the temple be kept clear of garbage, that people not use it as a workshop for car- pentry, nor could people sleep in the temple, or attempt dream divination there. If any such were caught by the temple keeper, he was to report them to the gentry in charge of the temple, who would then consider the appropriate fine. The stele was inscribed at the behest of the association of gentry of the she.59 The fifth set of inscriptions presents a different facet of the she . By the late Qing, in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion and the decline of the Qing dynasty, local society in Putian had fragmented into militarized associations, organized into white and black banner associations around large lineage and trans-lineage temple alliances linking smaller single lineage villages and multiple surname villages. Local gentry came for- ward at this time to handle social needs the government was no longer capable of or- ganizing. These included, as can be seen from the following inscriptions, the repair of the official shrines of the soil, the unattended dead, the chaste and filial, etc. Chen Chiyang a local gentry, was responsible for the following restoration efforts. In one inscription, he states baldly that the "common people" now must take over tasks the government is no longer capable of carrying out. Chen was responsible for the organization and training of local militias which put down the efforts of rebel leaders like Lin Jun to organize the highly fragmented white and black banner associa- tions in an attack on local authorities. To give an idea of his organizational clout, Chen later organized massive irrigation repair projects on all four of the Putian irrigation 58 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical Materials , 265- 66. 59 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical Materials , 308.</page><page sequence="34">52 KENNETH DEAN systems. Chen reported his successes in quelling local rebellions and repairing dikes and irrigation canals in detailed accounts addressed to the local City God and the Empress of Heaven. His efforts to repair the official shrines should be seen in the context of a combined effort on the part of the officialdom and the local gentry in the wake of the Taiping rebellion to revive and extend the official Register of Sacrifices, the canonizations of local gods, and the entire system of symbolic authority that had been so seriously shaken.60 A sixth and final set of inscriptions demonstrates the underlying continuity of the original she altar at the village level, sponsored by local donations, but capable of ser- ving as the basis for various different associational forms, and as a basis for gathering funds from far-flung acquaintances of the village. These include: 1) the Chongxiu Wenxiasheji (Record of the repairs to the Literary Mist [village] temple), dated 1852. This small temple is a classic shrine to the Shegong and the Shema (Old Man of the Earth and his Wife);61 2) the Chongjian xianyingshe tijuan bei (Stele on the con- tributors to the reconstruction of the village temple of Manifest Responses), dated 1836;62 3) the Chongzheng Dongjiamiao tijuan bei ISSISI® SI ti iff (Stele listing the contributors to the renovation of the Dongjia Temple, dated 1851: here we see the she acting as the basis for shenminghui mutual aid associations centered on the worship of a particular god). Such associations pool funds which can be drawn upon by members when in need;63 4) the Chongxiu Zhong Wu wanshou zushe xu (Preface to the repairs of the ancestral Loyal Wu Wanshou altar of the soil), dated 1873: this inscription shows how an "ancestral" she was able to mobilize an extensive outside network of native officials serving elsewhere in China, merchants, shops in Shanghai and elsewhere, etc., to sponsor the rebuilding of the temple.64 Taken altogether, these inscriptions reveal the continuity and resilience of the basic unit of sacred space in Chinese religion in the Putian area in the Ming and Qing. Many scholars have noted the fundamental importance of kinship in Chinese religion. In Putian, the great lineages had indeed controlled much of local society in the Song and Ming dynasties. Putian produced more jinshi Slit over this period than any other 60 These texts include: Chongxiu Xingjun litanji fiilf 1847; the Xingjun chongjian xiannong tan ji Plf$IílÍ7fcJ|iásčí, Daoguang period; and the Xingjun chongjian jiexiao citang ji Daoguang period).

Several other inscriptions could be discussed in this context.</page><page sequence="35">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 53 district in China, with the sole exception of Nan Zhili, just outside the capital.65 These lineages intermarried and sustained a strong local tradition of Lixue scholarship in a network of village schools and higher level academies. As we can see from the stone inscriptions they composed, lineages were behind many of the efforts to build and repair shemiao , and to attract government recognition of these altars and temples, in the mid-Ming and even well into the Qing. But note that the Qing inscriptions like the Repairs to the Haopulishe above call on the assistance of several lineages. Indeed, by the late Ming a series of social changes had transformed the role of the lineage in local society. These changes included the pirate raids mentioned above, the Qing takeover and the guerrilla war waged by the troops of Zheng Chenggong in the area, the coastal evacuation, and a series of devastating plagues associated with almost a century of intermittent warfare. Other changes were more long-term but no less profound. The dispersal of lineage branches, the immigration of outside families, the commodifica- tion of social relations, the sharp impact of the Single Whip Tax reform on the funding available to the local officials, all led to the mutations of popular culture and religion referred to above. All of these changes resulted in a need to transcend lineage organiza- tion in the context of local society. Popular temple networks would provide the means for this transformation. FROM LINEAGE TO LOCALITY In the Jiangkou area, one can trace an evolution of forms of local ritual organization away from kin-based, lineage-based forms to territorially defined systems from the mid-Ming onwards.66 As suggested above, lineages did not simply wither away; rather they transformed internally, becoming less dependent on kinship ties and more like public joint stock corporations with partible shares and property. These new lineage forms developed new networking strategies, including participation in the expanding set of temples dedicated to popular gods. We are not yet through with the term she , for it appears again within village ritual organization and spatial structure. Take for example the village of Xiaoyi within Jiangkou. As noted above, Xiaoyi village contains the Yousheng guan, which houses the Lingxingshe. The following deities are all worshipped collectively by all the residents of Xiaoyi villaage in the Yousheng guan: Xuantian Shangdi Wang Zhongjun Shuntian Shengmu JUSTUS, and Shegong (God of the Earth) and Shema %b$§ (Earth Mother). The current population of Xiaoyi village is over 4,000, and they have divided into seven she , here meaning something like "neighborhoods." Each of these neighborhoods worships a particular god or set of gods within the Yousheng guan. The neighborhoods, and their gods, are as follows: 65 James. B. Parsons, "The Ming dynasty bureaucracy," in Charles Hucker ed., Chinese government in Ming times: Seven studies , 175-231, New York: Columbia University Press, 1969. 66 This trend was pointed out in the article by Zheng Zhenman referred to in note 49 above.</page><page sequence="36">54 KENNETH DEAN 1) Chenshe W%Ły with 173 households and 982 people, worship Chengong Taiwei ASÍ on 5/18 and Kanggong Yuanshuai Âô TĚĚfl on 7/7; 2) Xiajieshe Tffiít, with 63 households and 390 people, worship Jin Dajiangjun áĚAjfUE on 2/13. 3) Dongshe with 41 households and 218 people, worship Qitian Dasheng W ^ AS (Great Sage Equal to Heaven, i.e., Sun Wukong the Monkey) on 7/23, and Zhanggong Shengjun íMÃHS on 2/25. 4) Lishe with 184 households and 989 people, worship Ma Yuanshuai JSŤt; Ûi|j on 9/28. 5) Guanqianshe Hilíítt, with 66 households and 355 people, worship Dutian Yuanshuai ®^7Ûêllî on 9/13. 6) Lishe Ł with 30 households and 146 people, worship Tiangong Yuanshuai on 4/18. 7) Houdushe íèJSífc, with 57 households and 282 people, worship Zhanggong Shengjun 55Ä MS (in martial mode) on 7/23. The birthdates of the main temple gods are celebrated by the entire village, or- ganized by the general manager and assistant heads of the temple committee, and paid for by equal amounts of money collected from every villager. The birthdates of the neighborhood gods are celebrated in the temple by the members of the respective neighborhoods. All these gods, with the exception of the Shegong and Shema (Old Man of the Soil and his Wife), are carried on different days in procession around the jing during the Upper Prime Festival (Yuanxiao). Thus Lishe and Dongshe go on procession on 1/12; Chenshe and Lishe Utt hold their procession on 1/13; Guanqian and Houdu carry their gods out on 1/14, and Xiajieshe ends the neighborhood or- ganized processions on 1/15. The overall procession of the Yousheng Belvedere in which each of these subgroups takes part is carried out between 1/22-1/25, and invol- ves a circuit of all the main temples of the Seven-fold Sacred Territory of Jiangkou town.67 Another term used for these territorially defined sub-groups is jia yet another remnant of the lijia M ? system. Most of these units are named after various surnames, just as under the lijia registration system. However, they have already lost their ties to lineages and have become largely territorially defined. In the case of the Qingdatang fit of Duweitoucun JS SHI fa the Yushe's forty households include families surnamed Wu, Chen and Cai. The twenty households of the Chenshe fêfîîfc include the surnames Chen, Zhuang, and Liu. The surnames have been preserved, people say, be- cause the founders of the subgroups were gods. One village has gone so far as to name its subdivisions after the gods they worship in the temple. The Chongqingguan of 67 God statues can have either a martial or a civil iconography. In some cases, these indicate different collectivities. For example, the civil version of Sun Wukong in Houdutou village is one of the temple's principal gods, and receives a cult from the entire village on 2/25. But the martial version is worshipped by a neighborhood called the Yushe on 9/25.</page><page sequence="37">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 55 Liujing village #J # fcf filli has six jia as follows: 1) The Ligong ^ worships Dutian Jiangjun Li Nocha 2) The Zhanggong Jia worships Zhanggong Shengwang ã5&amp;153:. 3) The Zhugong Jia worships one of the Zhengyi Lingguan surnamed Zhu ieZ/SUT^. 4) The Chengong Jia worships one of the Zhengyi Lingguan surnamed ChenlEZM» 5) The Hangong Jia ^ worships one of the Zhengyi Lingguan surnamed Han IEZMÄ 6) The Magong Jia Ufi- ^ worships one of the Zhengyi Lingguan surnamed Ma IE ZiSïf JS. These organizational arrangements reflect the need to move beyond lineage struc- ture within multiple surname neighborhoods. Jiangkou developed rapidly as the seven villages clustered closer and closer together and the market grew. But we can see a similar transformation even in certain single surname villages. Xindun village is a single surname village in the Goushang cluster. A an- cestral hall of the Li $ lineage was built there in 1754. According to a stone inscription still standing in the ancestral hall, by 1756 "the hall was complete, and the ancestral tablets were brought into it. Gradually land was opened up to cover the costs of sacrifi- cial rites." In 1802 a second inscription records that the lineage "raised funds to cover sacrifices" and "broadly established sacrificial landholdings" all under the supervision of a "managerial committee." In 1805, the village withdrew from the "old temple," the Weixianmiao in Houku village, and built its own temple, the Fuhaitang, in which the Xinxingshe was established. According to a copy of a Qing manuscript temple record entitled the Fuhaitang Xinxingshe zhi (The record of the Newly Arisen Altar of the Soil of the Hall of Good Fortune and Mercy), the ritual organization at that time required that "all men who married that year should be listed in the record, and wait their turn to become an assistant head, on a basis of one a year, in accordance with their age. The others would serve as custodians each year." Each lunar 1/1 the custodians would assemble at the temple, and cast lots for one of a series of numbered roles in the procession of the temple's gods held on lunar 1/13, or for managerial or financial roles in the provision of sacrificial materials and theatrical entertainment for festivals dedicated to the gods of the temple throughout the year. The dates of all these occasions, and the numbers of custodians and the costs assigned each function are care- fully spelled out. Thus we can see that at the turn of the 19th century the organization of ritual roles in this village was rotated among the married male members of the lineage. Nowadays, however, the rituals of the temple are carried out on the basis of four dif- ferentia, or neighborhoods of the village: 1) Houcu jia íèJs ¥ worships Liugong Yuanshuai 81 &amp; tg Sí on 4/18. 2) Shimen jia worships Zhanggong Shengjun ŤCĚíll on 7/23.</page><page sequence="38">56 KENNETH DEAN 3) Weicu jia UJir worships Xuantan Yuanshuai jŽ^ŤĚĚÍÍ on 3/16 and Kang- gong Yuanshuai on 7/7. 4) Jingtou jia worships Jixiang Dajiang pf # AíHí on 9/9. Moreover, only one of these gods is taken on procession during the Upper Prime Festival. The god's turns are taken in rotation, and at the end of four years the cycle begins again. This suggests that territorial affiliation has overtaken kinship organiza- tion as the central element in ritual organization. This is confirmed by the dissolution of any form of lineage ritual in the ancestral hall, despite its having been repaired in recent years with Overseas Chinese donations. Certain villages, such as Qian Wang village, home of the ancestral she of the Fushan cluster, and site of the oldest lineage in the Jiangkou plains, have maintained a ritual organization based on branches of the lineage to this day. The same is true for the Huang lineage in Shiting, which had developed the area beginning in the Yuan dynasty. However, even there members of different branches of the lineage have settled within each others' original neighborhoods, complicating the pattern of village ritual org anization.68 Jing and she Organizations in the Republican Period Another source from the Xinghua area on the territorial organization of village ritual in the late Qing and Republican period that reaffirms the fundamental importance of the she is the Lin Xiaonu sidian Sangong Dengxianshangjing guipu SR Jlíii£S!js (Register of the regulations of the Three [Goddess] Temple of the Upper Ascending to Sagehood Spiritual Territory for the Ritual Observances dedicated to the Filial Woman Lin [Mo i.e., Mazu]). The original preface, and much of the text, dates to Daoguang 1 (1821). The text was updated, and an additional preface added, in 1932. The first preface begins: In the northern part of the district city [of Xianyou] there is a she altar called the Three [Goddess] Temple Spiritual Territory. At first it was known as the Flying Phoenix [Territory]; in it are worshipped the Saintly Mother on High (Mazu) and other goddesses [Fazhu Ma SÍÍI, the Mother of the Ritual Arts, surnamed Wu ^1, and Chen Ma I the Goddess Chen Jinggu who guard the state and protect the people. Spiritual manifestations and magical deeds have been performed there for a long time. Early in the dynasty, the adult males of the households within the she became abundant. They divided amongst themselves into different branches Thus arose the Dengxian (Ascending to Sagehood), Yingzhou, and other jing M (spiritual territories). Each of these groups participated in the sacrificial rites, but the celebrations in the Dengxianjing were the best. If one were to further differen- 68 For further details on the role of lineage in local society see Zheng Zhenman Ming Qing Fujianjiazu zuzhi yu shehui bianqian Hunan: Hunan Educational Press, Ph.D Dissertation Series, 1992.</page><page sequence="39">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 57 tiate, we would be known as the Dengxian shangjing (the Upper Ascending to Sagehood spiritual territory). Formerly, on each lunar 1/15, we would xingnuo fj #1 (carry out the Nuo exorcistic procession) and rest the palanquin of the goddess overnight in the Martial Temple. Rites and music were complete, each leading the good fortune of the Upper Prime Festival. Caps and gowns were in order, unifying our happiness at the altar of grain. Indeed it was magnificent. This preface indicates that the she altar- temple had by the late Qing become perhaps the basic territorial unit of local society in Xinghua (and a taxation registration unit as well). The s/ie/temple served to bring together multiple surname groups of neighbors. As the population around the temple expanded, they divided into different pai (a term taken from lineage discourse and usually indicating a branch of the lineage) and regrouped within distinct jing (spiritual territories). The text goes on to describe the efforts of one Wu Qingbao to raise funds to reconstruct the temple in Jiaqing 10 (1805). Wu visited every household in the she to collect 3000 strings of cash each. Certain people, and groups of 10 households (jia ), made additional voluntary contributions totaling 6000 strings of cash. The remainder left after the costs of construction was invested, primarily in land, so that the annual interest could cover the costs of the Yuanxiao festival and the celebrations of the god- desses' birthdates. These investments are itemized in the register (see Table). The register was to be updated annually, every 1/18. An altar was set up in the Martial Temple for this purpose and any new items were entered into the register. Provisions were also made that every participant in the rituals at Yuanxiao and on the goddesses' birthdates should take part in yinfu (drinking in good fortune) feasts, and receive a set portion of sacrificial raw pork ( zhuo ). The Republican preface further reports that copies of the Register were printed and passed out to members of the she in order to create a system of mutual pressure whereby none of the temple lands would be sold off or usurped privately. Troubles at the end of the Qing, and the decision on the part of the Revolutionary (Republican) government to ban licentious cults and destroy temple buildings had forced the mem- bers of the she to lie low and abandon the Yuanxiao processions. As a result, con- siderable amounts of temple land and rents had fallen into private hands. In 1921 the processions and sacrifices were held once again, and an effort was made, by means of a public meeting, to reassess the land claims of the she , and to collect and reinvest the rental income. "So they laid out offerings and performed theater and song. Each sheyou $tS (friend of the she altar) wore cap and gown and worshipped [the goddess]. They take part in the yinfu (drinking in the blessings banquet) and received a portion of sacrificial meat." Then in front of the goddesses they took lots and selected seven leaders who would manage the rites in rotation. The register was updated and redistributed to the members of the she. The seven leaders were responsible for the following seven jing: Shang Dengxianjing Xiebaojing fôHíjt, Qiuyangjing Chongxingjing ÄPMÄ, Wanshoujing Feifengjing fPIJE^ , Zhong- hejing Their primary duties involved the collection of rent from lands belong-</page><page sequence="40">58 KENNETH DEAN ing to the she. The following regulations reveal the inner workings of the ritual system of the Dengxian shangjing: 1) Any encroachment on public {à land for private % use was to be recorded in the Register, and fined at a rate of five times the original rent. 2) Rents were due ten days prior to the goddess' birthdate. Travel expenses in- curred in the collection of rent by jing leaders were permitted. Any refusal of payment of rent should be reported to the other jing leaders who would go as a group to press for payment. 3) On 3/21 the tables for the "drinking of good fortune" should be set up and the offerings recorded. The weighing of crimes and execution of punishments at that time should not be made in anger. 4) Provisions were made so that reductions in ritual offerings would correspond to any projected declines in rental income or inflation in prices. 5) Excess funds should be invested with merchants for interest and any compound interest should be recorded. 6) Each of the 68 sheyou (friends of the she) each year should receive one sheng of pork and one paper lantern. This is laid out in the Register and should not be allowed to become a matter of competition. 7) The thirteen families who initially made larger contributions, and their descen- dants, should receive an additional ounce of pork and an extra lantern in recognition of their contribution. 8) Wu Qingbao, the organizer of the reconstruction effort, and his descendants, should receive two ounce of pork, a goat, and a lantern in recognition of his merit. 9) The members of the she should pay special attention to looking after clever children in the she , and support their studies.69 10) The ceremonies should be held in the temple. 11) The rotation of leadership was to be conducted in a quiet place. The goddess would be invited in by the ten families and the incense burner passed to the succeeding leader. Any controversy would be settled by divination before the goddess. 12) The four principal patrons of the temple would always be included in the leadership circle. 13) The thirteen families who made extra contributions were commended. A group of farmers who improved some lands and produced a higher rental yield were com- mended. 14) Any purchase of household registration within the she required the new family to pay one silver dollar in registration, or name-changing fees. A meeting had to be called in which all of the registers were to be altered to include the new name. 15) Capital repairs were at the discretion of the annual leader if under 1000 strings 69 Here there is interpolated an account of a fine given in 1923. A tenant farmer named Lin Wei had usurped 7 fen of estate land. He was given an "examination fine" of 20 yuan. A subsequent meeting decided that he would receive two ounces of pork and a paper lantern the following year in recognition of his "contribution."</page><page sequence="41">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 59 of cash. Any costs exceeding 1000 cash required the concurrence of one additional jing leader for each additional 1000 expenditure, up to an amount exceeding 40,000, which could only be undertaken on a majority decision by all the households in the she. The Register notes that sacrificial rites for the Filial Woman Lin (Mazu) require the presence of two Taoist Masters. They were to perform a jiao SS (communal sacrifice), sounding their gongs and drums and performing a dachang (large rite). Everyone was required to contribute 40 cents in dayang (foreign) currency to cover the expenses of the jiao . The Register also lists the ritual offerings and paraphernalia each family was responsible for setting out on the festivals of the goddess.70 Objects for use in the "drinking of good fortune" banquet were to be assembled by the current year's jingshou MM.71 The leader for the upcoming year inspects the preparations of this year's jing leader to ensure the quality of the banquet items. When he is satisfied, and everything has been weighed out, the men seat themselves at separate tables with eighteen seats. One was only to "drink good fortune" at the table, it not being permissible to take any leftovers home. Any leftovers belong to the current year's head.72 All these items were the responsibility of the current year's jingshou (leader of the territory). The text notes that any increase in rental income should be propor- tionately reflected in the quantity of the banquet items. Theatrical performances can be dispensed with in the event of financial difficulty. The text further notes various items of measurement and objects that change hands with the rotation of leadership: The weights and measures of the Three Goddess Temple are marked with the name of the 70 These include: A pair of large candles (1/2 sheng); five bundles of incense; 500 sheets each of Golden and Silver spirit money; 2 sheng of regular spirit money; 5 strings of firecrack- ers; tea, wine, noodles, and rice; tall beakers and carved offering boxes; six kinds of vegetarian platters; a plate of fruit; a pig's head on a platter; a pig's tail on a plate; a platter of pig's trotters; a set of five sacrificial offerings (goat, egg; tripe; meat; liver); five tasty dishes; a large plate of noodles; a set of raw meat offerings; sandalwood incense. 71 They included: Eight Hang of cooked meat; one sheng two eight Hang of mutton; fifteen duck eggs; one sheng of cooked liver and lung; one cooked pork belly; two cooked pork kidneys; two sheng of roasted peanuts; ten sheng of noodles; four sheng of clear wine; one sheng of raw meat (to be diced and cooked in congee); one sheng of clams; two heaping plates of shrimp; two heaping plates of mung bean noodles (cooked with mushrooms, shrimps, and meat). Sacrificial objects to be used prior to and after the sacrifice are also listed: These include: the five tasty plates; a set of the three sacrificial offerings; 5000 sheets of silver spirit paper; one sheng of regular spirit money; wine, rice, noodles, etc. Miscellaneous items include: A pair of large lanterns; 83 small paper lanterns; large couplets for the doorway; and couplets for awnings. In addition, each family was also obliged to prepare the following objects: a gong; a drum; a pair of candlesticks; a table-hanging; goblets and offerings boxes; and a mat for kneeling; 72 The banquet tables each contain two plates of cooked meat, one plate of mutton, a plate of duck eggs, tripe, pork liver, two plates of peanuts, soups of meat, shrimp, pork liver, pork heart, kidneys, large and small intestines, mungbean noodles, and two plates of fried noodles. In addition there should be green vegetables, onions, bamboo shoots, salt, vinegar, soya sauce, mustard, and steamed rice.</page><page sequence="42">6o KENNETH DEAN temple. The metal incense burner of the temple is also inscribed. The wooden carrying case and the seal of the temple are inscribed with the words "Sangong dengxian shang- jing she (The she-altar of the Upper Ascending to Sagehood Spiritual Precinct of the Three Goddess Temple). Several pages of the Register are devoted to a detailed account of the land properties of the she. The contracts for these transactions were all kept by Wu Qingbao. These landholdings are summarized in the following Table . This source permits a detailed look at the financing and organization of a territorially based ritual unit which clearly identifies itself as an offshoot of a sřie-altar. Note that by Republican times the she- temple had expanded from one jing to seven, and that various levels of patronage were correlated with special leadership rights and symbolic recognition. There was an an- nual rotation of responsibilities for management of rent collection and ritual expen- ditures between the leaders of the seven jing . A mechanism was in place for the sale of shares in the she collectivity through the sale of land and the registration of new names in the Register. Indeed, the Register goes to great lengths to assure public accountability in all matters. The she-temple had become in effect a territorially based joint stock corporation organized around the performance of ritual.73 REFLECTIONS ON THE LISHE AT THE END OF THE IMPERIAL ERA The Register reflects local concerns over the appropriation of temple lands and proper- ties by the Republican state. This explains the need to itemize their holdings, outline their financial and ritual arrangements, and present themselves as a cult dedicated to the euhemeristic and uncontroversial sounding Filial Lady Lin Mo, rather than the goddess worshippers they were. Another text from this period by Zhang Qin, the last Putian jinshiy attempts to argue for the historic value and classical antecedents of many of the local cults of the Putian area. The Kaoli zhengsu baocun shensheshuotie #®IE (Memorial on the investigation of the rites and orthodox customs, and the preservation of the temples of the gods) is a memorial addressed to the Republican government, arguing for the orthodoxy of many local cults.74 The current government has ordered the destruction of licentious cults. It has established a set of regulations as a standard for the preservation of temples. These regulations are based on religion, philosophy, and the acts of merit before the people performed by the former saints, sages, and heroes. The intent of this is deep indeed. There are many licentious cults in Putian, but if one examines the essence of 73 For a detailed study of the finances and internal organization of a ritual community (she) that was active for over 300 years in Shouning district, Huizhou, see Shibutani Yuko àt "MinShin jidai, Heishū Konán noson shakai ni okeru saishi Shigaku 59.1 (1990): 95-129. 74 On Republican campaigns against popular religion, see Prasenjit Duara, Rescuing history from the nation : Questioning narratives of modern China , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995, chapter three.</page><page sequence="43">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 6 1 their intentions then few indeed are those that transgress against the [new] regula- tions. I have investigated the transmission, errors, transgressions, truth and falsity of these cults, basing my study on the [Books of] Rites , the [Five] Classics , the dynas- tic histories, and the commentaries [to the Annals of the Spring and Autumn Period]. Probing to the heart of the matter, I have extracted information that demonstrates their accordance with the regulations for the preservation [of cults]. In his discussion of the lishe , Zhang Qin rehearses many of the classical sources on the cult. He then goes on to comment that: The [common] people established she altars when th efengjian (feudal) system collapsed. Looking at it from this perspective, it is clear that the she is the harbinger of the development of the people's self-government. Because of the antiquity of the she, Master Zhu [Xi] in the Song dynasty established shexue (communal acadamies) and shecang (communal granaries). These advanced and became zizhi tuanti Ē in Bit (self-governing collectivities). Even today the remnants of these institutions have not disappeared. Elsewhere in his comments on chenghuang (city gods), Zhang Qin again refers to the collapse of the feudal system, and equates the establishment of a city god temple with the earlier distribution of a portion of the earth of the king's altar of the soil at the investiture of the lord of one of his subsidiary domains: After the Song, the worship of city gods spread throughout the empire. Some were given [official] temple plaques and some were given titles of enfeoffment, while some were by association given particular surnames and personal names, which borders on the non-canonical. However if we recognize that the she altar is the site where the gods of the soil and the grains are worshipped, then the name is correct and the terms accord, and nothing can be in doubt. Because the city god is the she altar of the soil of the prefecture or district, the people's prayers and thanksgiving are first and foremost directed towards his temple. Now the prefectural [city god] temple of Putian each year donates several thousand shi of rice to save the poor. These are all merciful families who voluntarily donate [food]. There is no forcible raising of contributions. Their achievements are impressive. Having justified city god temples and local lishe on the basis of classical precedents, political principles, and humanitarian grounds, Zhang Qin concludes his account of the institution by noting that there are even classical references to the use of stone tablets on earth mounds, a feature which could explain the worship of stone slabs and boulders as altars of the soil in Guangdong. Along the same lines, he explains that wood and stone (trees and stones tablets) developed into the carving of tablets, while the carving of tablets developed into the carving of god statues. "All this is but the evolution of society, and can provide material for cultural historical research." Zhang Qin's com-</page><page sequence="44">62 KENNETH DEAN ments on the role of the lishe in the self-governing of the people brings us to the issue of the range of social organizational forms found in village life. Numerous ethnographic studies that covered economic aspects of Chinese religion were written in the 1920's and 30's. Mao Zedong conducted several village studies between 1926 and 1930, refining his analysis of Chinese economic classes and their contradictions as he worked. In his Report from Xunwu (written in 1930, withheld for many years, translated and published in 1990) Mao Zedong found that 40% of the land in this Jiangxi village of 2,700 people was in corporate hands, 30% belonged to landlords, and 30% to peasants. Ancestral lands made up 24% of all land, and 64% of corporate land. Religious trusts, of which Mao found six different kinds, held 8% of all land and 24% of corporate land. The remaining corporate lands were held by admin- istrative trusts, that is Confucian educational trusts (4% of corporate and 10% of total), and public works trusts (4% of corporate and 10% of all land). The lineage trusts and the rich landlords became the object of his revolutionary fury. However, he was far less critical of certain kinds of religious trusts in Xunwu. Mao distinguished shen # (god) associations [various shenminghui - mutual aid associations centered on the cult of a particular god or jiaohui ¡BU" - associations that mutually sponsor com- munal sacrifices], tan Í8(shrine associations centered around a small altar), shetan %L ÍS (community shrines), miao JÜ (temples), si tF (Buddhist monasteries), and guari IS (Taoist belvederes). Mao's assessment of these groups is particularly concrete and politically significant, and so deserve to be quoted at length. Mao notes the economic and class struggles within lineage trusts, which are performed in the distribution of sacrificial meat in ancestral worship rituals. He also finds rich peasants and landlords at the origins of the god associations. "Ninety-five percent of the property of these god [or shrine] associations consists of land; 5 percent consists of contributions of grain or money." However, Mao finds the she association to be quite different in nature: A community (she) has a kind of community shrine ( shetan) that is different from a shrine association. Every village has one. Even if a village only has three families, there is a community shrine. Why do they want a community shrine? To ensure that their crops are not devoured by insects and that their livestock do not get sick, and to ensure the health of the people. Every community has an association. From the beginning of February to the end of October, there is a meeting each month. The meeting is usually scheduled for the second, but in some places it is on the six- teenth. On the day of the meeting, one person from each family in the community comes. Rich or poor, all have a share. A pig is killed and wine purchased for a big feast. After the feast, a meeting is held to discuss affairs like building terraces and water channels, prohibiting livestock from harming fields, and prohibiting care- less use of wooded areas. The regulations are numerous, and everyone has his say. Also, there is no chairman; nor is any record [of the proceedings] desired. The discussions are chaotic, but there is a kind of natural order. So when the so-called elders of the enlightened ones voice a reasonable view, then everyone says their words have "been spoke well." [When this happens], a decision has been reached. This community of the masses is totally different, even though they believe in</page><page sequence="45">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 63 gods, from the shrine associations of the rich peasants and landlords. The peasants run this sort of community discussions, not the bullies or the powerful gentry. Nor is it completely run by rich peasants. The informal chairman is the person whose reasonable manner causes people to trust him. Very few community shrines have public halls. In the majority, they hold the meetings on the second of every month [to worship the god], everyone contributes money. Each time everyone pays 2, 3 or 4 mao ; but if a person is not going to eat, he does not have to pay. As for "temples" (miao), they have rooms with images. A temple has a temple caretaker, called a temple elder JSMŠ in the local dialect, who is an old man who takes care of the image and tends the lamps and incense. Generally speaking, most temples have land, the rent from which is used to support the temple elder. Elders of the temples without land get their food and sundries from contributions of money and food from the masses. . . Shrine associations are needed by landlords; the community shrines are needed by peasants; temples are needed by both landlords and peasants. The land income of the temples is low, and the rent is not enough to pay for the cost of incense, spirit money, and the needs of the temple elder. These are not places engaging in serious exploitation. (Mao Zedong, Report from Xunwu , 126-29, trans, by R. R. Thompson, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990). Despite Mao's lukewarm approval, and clarity with regard to the qualities of the communal she associations, these groups too would be dismantled in the process of collectivization and the establishments of the communes, only to re-emerge once again after Mao's death. ADDITIONAL FORMS OF ORGANIZATION WITHIN AND BEYOND VILLAGE- BASED RITUAL SYSTEMS The surveys conducted during the land reform movement of the 1950's demonstrated that lineages held over 50% of the arable land in Fujian at that time. Although lineage organizations were a strong societal force in the Putian region, one can point to several other forms of organization in the villages which reveal an under- lying shift away from kinship towards territoriality, or beyond both towards commer- cial networks. Temple networks could evolve into regional nested hierarchies, or they could spread more widely and loosely across distinct regions through extensive division of incense networks. In the late Ming and Qing dynasties, the various sectarian religious movements that proliferated in the Putian area developed varieties of trans-kinship ritual organization that reached well beyond local territoriality. Of these groups the most extensive was the Three in One, which now has over 1,000 temples in the Xinghua region, with temples in Fuqing, Hui'an, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia as well. This form of religious organization suggests a further move away from kin- ship, as well as territoriality, towards voluntary membership in a potentially limitless organization. These forms of ritual organization began to move beyond the regionally based temple hierarchies, while still orienting themselves in relation to the founding</page><page sequence="46">64 KENNETH DEAN temple and tomb of the founder of the movement, or the local master. One form of voluntary autonomous organization that developed within temple organizations was the shenminghui #0^# (mutual-aid associations centered around particular deities). Such associations were quite widespread, and many sponsored rituals to their patron gods. These groups suggest the impact of flows and eddies of capital within local cults. Within the villages of the Xinghua region, the shemiao could also form the basis for the intensification of organizational forms, based primarily on territoriality (i.e., the representation of neighbourhoods). One striking example of these tendencies are guanjie ceremonies, or the group initiation of spirit mediums. Beginning in 1985, several temples in and around the town of Jiangkou began to revive an earlier tradition of group initiations for large groups of young teenage boys who were taught how to become spirit mediums, and initiated into tanban ÎËîïï (altar associations). As noted above, temples in the Jiangkou area house a multitude of gods, averaging ten to fifteen, but sometimes as many as sixty in one temple. All these gods receive a generalized cult from the members of the community. Each temple has at least one principal god that is worshipped by the entire community through a Taoist ritual on the goďs birthday. This birthday usually includes a three day Taoist jiao or communal sacrifice ritual, proces- sions of the god around the spiritual precincts of the community, days and nights of theatrical performances, special offerings prepared by the community representatives, and invocations and trance dances by the spirit mediums. The other gods are wor- shipped by distinct groups who participate in the temple. The birthday festivals of these gods are sometimes organized by distinct surname groups, but as we have seen above, more usually by different neighborhood groups, or by spirit-association mutual-assis- tance groups, that identify themselves with that particular god or goddess. Since spirit mediums are needed for all of the gods in a temple, the selection of future mediums needs to draw upon all the different types of social groupings involved in the temple. The initiation ceremonies involve three periods of seven, seven, and nine days respectively, which take place over a period of several months to three years. They are directed by the elder generation of spirit-mediums, whose names are recorded on stone tablets which form altars called "the spirit-altar of the ages." A new set of mediums is selected each generation, usually once every sixty years. One tablet in a temple in Jiangkou notes that the last initiation took place in 1909. The initiation begins with a Taoist jiao which commences inside the temple, and concludes on a stage outside and opposite the temple. Both at the beginning and at the end of the period of confinement inside the temple, the initiates took part in a Taoist ritual, where they were instructed as to their vows and prohibitions and received certificates of initiation from the priest. This certificate is called a Lushan Dafayuan dudie JSUl or certificate of the Great Ritual Institute of Mt. Lu, where the goddess Chen Jinggu received her training in the magical arts. These certificates are renewed once every New Year by the Taoist priest in an annual ritual. At the conclusion of this initiation rite, during which the mediums are instructed on the prohibitions they must uphold, and presented cer- tificates of initiation, the mediums and altar boys enter the temple. The doors are sealed</page><page sequence="47">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 65 and they are trained in chant, dance, and techniques of spirit possession by the elder generation of spirit-mediums. The training is conducted in secret, and many details are still unclear, but the climax is reached when the boys divide into pairs, in which one invokes the god while the other dons the costume of the god. One set of boys chants the invocations of the gods while the other set becomes possessed, and dances in special choreographed dance steps across the stars of the Dipper. Early on the morning of the final day of the initia- tion ceremony, they burst out the door of the temple and proceed to perform the exor- cistic Nuo ft dance. Various feats and trials are undertaken, such as bathing the body of the medium in a sea of sparks from firecrackers and incense. Thereupon all the gods of the temple emerge, led by their new mediums, and join in a procession, seated on mag- nificent, elaborately carved and gilded sedan chairs. At the conclusion of this proces- sion, the new acolytes are feasted by friends and relatives. Later that day, in the after- noon, they go on a second exorcistic procession around the village with the gods of the temple. Upon returning, they dance the Nuo steps once more, before charging back into the temple, and disbanding. Proclamations and decrees posted within the temple describe this dance and the procession as a Nuo exorcism. That evening a second Taoist ritual is performed to mark the conclusion of the initiation. This ritual is called a sanxiao jiao ÜT$iSl In addition, the tanban $ÈLÎ)î regroup each twelfth month, traditionally staying inside the temple for several weeks. During the extended Yuanxiao (Lantern festival), an annual ritual of renewal of the certificates of initiation is performed. These rites can be dispensed with only after the performance of a more complex Taoist ritual called a yuxiu jiao Sí® SS (sacrifice of preparatory cultivation), in which current and former tanban are all given permanent status. These Taoist rituals are unique, so far as I know, to this area. They cannot even be found in the southern part of Putian and Xianyou. The earliest texts of this kind ex- amined so far date to the Daoguang period. This discovery of a specific localized relationship between Taoist ritual traditions, spirit mediumism, and village self-or- ganization, in the development of which all three have been modified in relation with each other, is but one example of an almost infinite variety of ways in which Taoism has interacted with local cults and local forms of social organization in different parts of China.75 These social and ritual formations within the villages of the Jiangkou plain demonstrate the complex organizational potential of the lishe. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND RE- INVENTION OF THE NESTED HIERARCHY OF THE JIANGKOU TEMPLE SYSTEM Generally speaking, the most encompassing mode of territorially based village ritual organization in the Xinghua area is the regional nested hierarchy of temples. Each level 75 For more detail on the guanjie rite and the xingnuo processions, see K. Dean and Zheng Zhenman, "Group initiation and exorcistic dance in the Xinghua region," in Wang Ch'iu-kui ed., Minsu quyi 85.2 (1993): 105-95.</page><page sequence="48">66 KENNETH DEAN of the hierarchy can be marked by a regional association, often symbolized by a common cult. In other words, the village neighborhoods would first hold a procession around the village. Then the village as a whole would hold a procession around the village and its fields to affirm the spiritual territory of the god. Next the village would join in a procession linking several villages in a wider regional association. Finally, the village would join in a grand procession linking several regional associations under the com- mon symbol of a major regional cult, like the city god of Hanjiang, or the Humane Emperor of the Temple of the Eastern Peak of Jiangkou, or the Jade Emperor in the Temple of the Towering Clouds on the top of Hugong Mountain, the highest point in the Putian plains. These processions could involve between 36 and 108 villages. In 1993, the entire Jiangkou irrigated plain held a procession in honor of the Humane Emperor, Controller of Destiny. This procession lasted five days, and in- volved groups escorting the Emperor around the plain to most of its villages and prin- cipal temples. While the Emperor was "away," other gods would enter the Belvedere to "play the host," and "receive guests." On this occasion, and on the annual birthday of the Emperor, representatives of the five main Taoist families in the Jiangkou plain gathered for a "Saigong hui Ēf5Ā# (Taoist Assemby)." They conducted several days of Taoist rituals in the Belvedere. The five families are associated with the following areas, Taoist Masters, jing (spiritual territories), and tan (Taoist altars): 1) Shiting: Wu Jiutao (Chief Taoist Master) Qingjingtan. 2) Jiangkou: Lu Tianlin: Xianyingjing. 3) Jiangkou: Fang Peitan: Qimiaojing. 4) Qianmian: Huang Falin: Xuanmiaojing. 5) Guangu: Huang Wenrui: Shenyingjing. The renaissance of local culture and popular religion in Fujian culminating in the restoration of the procession of the Humane Emperor of the Eastern Sacred Mountain can be seen as a process of the gradual reclaiming or re-empowering of traditional boundaries of sacred space and cosmic time. In the late 1970s, abbreviated Taoist rituals were held under the cover of darkness to celebrate the birthdays of the local gods. Later, by the early 80s, as more and more communities became emboldened with their success, processions were organized to openly parade around the village and its fields. Taoist rituals began to be performed more openly by the mid-80s, with theater, marionettes, and other performing arts attracting large crowds. Ritual began to come into one of its core functions, competition, as can be seen in the expression " yingshen saihui Â# (competitive assemblies to entice the gods)". The government re- sponded with shows of force, determined to keep a lid on these developments, but was prevented from large-scale acts of repression by the ostensible policy of freedom of religion promulgated after the Eighth Party Congress in 1978. The process of the recovery of sacred space, whether that of the temple, the village level procession, or the wider and wider networks of processions within local nested hierarchies of ritual systems, all were primarily issues of scale. The Communist State,</page><page sequence="49">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 67 with its vision of modern nation state-building, had attempted to move beyond the sub-bureaucratic administrative organization of the late imperial state into the towns and villages of the Chinese countryside. Now they were confronted with the re-emer- gence, the re-formation of locally based networks that could mobilize tremendous social and cultural forces. Each negotiation of boundaries was contested. The recovery of sacred space was paralleled by the recovery of a sense of cosmic time. The year became increasingly punctuated by annual festivals and birthdays of the gods. Individuals' moments of life crisis - birth, initiation, marriage, death - once again were marked by rituals. This process has accelerated and deepened over the past decade. According to a survey I am organizing of several hundred villages in Putian and Xianyou districts, the average village in this area has six temples (usually two village temples, which frequently contain a she altar, an ancestral hall, a Three in One shrine, a Buddhist temple or nunnery, and a sectarian shrine). The village temples house an average of fifteen gods each, most of whom have rituals celebrated on their behalf, while the smaller monasteries, nunneries, and shrines also maintain an active ritual calendar. This generates something between thirty and sixty rituals per year per village. Due to the extreme density of population and settlement in this area, it is quite possible for a villager in, say, the Jiangkou area of northern Putian, to attend over 250 days of ritual and theater a year. The recovery of wider and more intricate networks of sacred space, and ever more richly articulated senses of cosmic time does not occur in a vacuum. Clearly, the Maoist vision of the Cultural Revolution led to a cynical burn-out of socialist ideals. The Party has turned to economic reforms and market socialism, stumbling in the process into institutionalized corruption, but this has meant relinquishing its vision as vanguard of the revolution, animator and facilitator of the masses. Now market forces and transna- tional flows of capital circulate through the villages of the Southeast Chinese coast. The Party has been forced to retreat from ideological control, mass mobilization, economic planning, and control of cultural expression. Into this volatile new field of forces, the re-invention of tradition has emerged as a profound force. At the present time, there appear to be geographic limits to the scope of localized religious and cultural organization that the authorities might eventually learn to live with. Whether or not the advocates of localism can find a vocabulary with which to make their concerns understood in the face of official incomprehension and apprehen- sion is a grave concern. If not, then forces of modernization may make the entire issue redundant. It is also conceivable that the forms of popular religion and local culture could be taken up by wider, regional or transnational forces in the future, transforming the stakes of the contest. I believe it is possible to approach this question both histori- cally and structurally, by examining the processes of the formation of local cultures within China over time. Taoist ritual, in its capacity as a code that reinterprets and reorganizes many of the forms and forces of popular religion and popular culture, plays a key role in the self-definition of local culture, the process of auto-organization within Chinese society. Thus the procession held in 1993, on the fourth day of the ninth lunar month (Oc-</page><page sequence="50">68 KENNETH DEAN tober 18), in which the Humane Emperor of the Eastern Peak, seated in his massive, ornately carved sedan chair, went on procession around the entire extent of the Nan'anbi irrigation system in Jiangkou township, joined by the palanquins of the multitudinous local gods of all the villages in the irrigation system, completed a perfect cycle of time (60 years) since the last such procession. And by means of completing the circuit the gods reinscribed their hold on their territory: their spiritual precincts had been reclaimed. CIRCLE AND CENTER The creation or the rhythmic reaffirmation of sacred space returns eternally to the powers of the earth, the founding of the she , and the tracing of the boundary of the sacred precincts of the god through processions. Already in the inscription mentioned above by the Song scholar-literatus Liu Kezhuang that described processions to the tomb of a god in the Jiangkou area one senses the importance of sound, movement, and light in the processions of the local gods.76 This is not to claim that such rituals are unchanging - this paper has suggested instead that it is possible to uncover the genealogies of local ritual practices. We must turn to those very qualities within ritual that ensure the potential for transformation. This entails an ethnographic interlude. The following brief description of moments of extreme intensity in ritual events is based on visits to the Xinghua region in February 1994 and 1995. A typical procession, as we have seen above in village ritual registers, includes a group carrying banners and signs and lanterns at the front, followed by several groups carrying gongs, followed by the group of initiates (the tanban , or altar association), followed by groups carrying the palanquins of the gods, the keepers of the incense burner, and the temple committee. These groups include men and women of all ages. The groups trace a sonar trajectory around the spiritual precincts of the temples. A small number of private homes, selected by divination, are visited by the procession. These sites erupt into extraor- dinary explosions of sound, further punctuating the rhythm of the procession. Moreover, throughout the afternoon, theatrical troupes perform before the temple. When the procession returns to the temple, even more firecrackers and rockets are exploded, until the entire courtyard and the temple are filled with thick clouds of sul- furic smoke. The sound is ear-shattering, vision is obscured by smoke and seared by exploding firecrackers, incense and sulfur overwhelm the nose and fill the lungs. In the courtyard, the palanquins of the gods continued to circle wildly, pitching right and left as they charge about. The palanquin bearers continue to carry their heavy loads, oblivious to the fire crackers that explode under their feet, sending sparks into their clothes and hair. This goes on far longer than would seem endurable. The gods enter into the temple in order of hierarchy. Entry into the temple at the end of the procession is a highly charged moment. The 76 Chongjian Lingyoumiao gulou (Reconstruction of the Drum Tower of the Temple of Numinous Aid), quoted in Puttan xianzhi 4.</page><page sequence="51">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 69 entire procession first parades before the temple. A troupe known as the Eight Guards, costumed in black robes with red fringes, wearing rattan hats, and carrying long paddle shaped staffs, lines up on either side of the stairs leading into the temple. A final troupe is led by the Messenger of Death, a tall hanged ghost, dressed in white, with a peaked hat inscribed "One look brings good fortune," and with a long red tongue protruding from his mouth. He carries a tattered fan and a snake staff in his hands. He is followed by a contingent of ghosts, masked dancers with hideous faces, wearing black robes, and carrying instruments of torture. They perform a jerking dance, taking up various con- torted postures, and shaking their weapons. At the end of the dance, they enter the temple. At this point, the sedan chairs of the gods arrive before the temple and begin to twirl around at great speed. They charge in and out of the courtyard three or four times. Finally they race into the temple, only to run out backwards. This goes on three or four times. As the palanquin of the principal god charges into the courtyard, a line of children in yellow costume wave flags at them and shoo them away. When all the god's palanquins have finally entered the temple, the Eight Officers perform a call and response series of hoots and whistles, led by a figure in mandarin robes and hat. Then they too enter the temple. Inside the temple, the community representatives are lined up and videotaped. Then they assist in returning the gods to their thrones. They present offerings to the gods and bow down to worship before them. After the gods have been returned to their carved and gilded thrones before their elaborate altars, the altar association begins to chant the spells of the gods. They are led by rhythmic, compelling drum beats, and they play a variety of percussive instruments in time to the drum beats. After a sufficient intensity has been generated, a pair of mediums are prepared for trance. They are stood facing one another before the altar. A tight band is tied around their heads, and another around their waists. They are clothed in embroidered gowns, and a god's decorative hat is placed on their heads. They are swayed left and right in time with the rhythmic chant until they begin to tremble. Their eyes roll upwards in their sockets. They are handed a sword, which they hold between their hands in front of them. They begin to move the sword up and down a few inches in time to the chant. They suddenly leap towards one another, bow, turn to the altar and bow again, and then lead the altar association out the door of the temple. They then lead the group in a criss-crossing dance in the courtyard in front of the temple. The drum- ming and the chanting continues, gradually accelerating in pace until the entire group is running at top speed. The tempo slows and speeds up again as the group shifts into different patterned choreographies. This goes on for about twenty minutes. Finally, the mediums, one by one, slow to a halt, begin to shake violently, and then fling themselves backwards into the waiting hands of altar associates. They are gently led back into the temple, and their hats and gowns are removed. At that point they collapse, are given a seat, and slowly regain their original composure. Mediums at some temples conclude the group dance with a show of impervious- ness to pain. Six inch bamboo Roman Candles are set on the top of the stairs of the temple and ignited. The mediums remove their gowns, and run forward bare-chested into the fountain of sparks. They lower their heads into the sparks and inhale. After a</page><page sequence="52">7° KENNETH DEAN few seconds they hop on one leg backwards, and other mediums take their place. After this display of imperviousness to pain (or is it a recording by the eye of the inscription of pain on the body of the medium?) the procession disbands. Formerly, mediums would use needles to skewer their skin, or flail or club themselves as is still commonly done in festivals in the Minnan region and in Taiwan. The flowing of blood and perhaps too the leaping into the flames of the Roman Candle suggests a game played with death by the medium. A sacrifice of the self that plays with the blood of procreation and the fire of transformation. Surely this is a moment of power inverting the position of the lowly medium into a cosmic juggler of the forces of life and death.77 After witnessing this cosmic inversion, the individual members of the procession retrieve the hundreds of plates of offerings set out on long tables within the temple and return home to con- sume them. Others remain at the temple to consume theatrical performances. These highly charged village festivals generate a level of experience that transcends the individual and generates a multitude of new planes of experience among the as- sembled crowd. A proliferation of multiplicities that can be analyzed as new sets of relations, new collective bodies undergoing innumerable transformations, new collec- tive subjectivities constructing themselves. If we consider the forms of community and subject positions produced through ritual events in these terms, we discover a mode of production of alternative temporalities, different forms of "worlding," arising out of participation in a ritual tradition which works within complex communities to create new collectivities. For the individual participant, ritual merges with everyday practice, transforming time and the realm of experience. The complexity and contradictory nature of the competing stimuli result in a fragmenting of the unity of the individual that then is swept up in multiple trajectories of sound, sight, taste, touch, and smell. Different equations are developed between different senses along these distinct and multiple trajectories. It is precisely this sheer sensory excess, intensified within highly coded symbolic fields, that ensures the transformative potential of even so fundamental an element of Chinese religion as the altar of the soil. CONCLUSIONS This paper has examined the mutations of the she altar in the Putian plains. We have seen how this altar gradually merged with temples to local gods, and slowly became the fundamental unit of ritual space in the local temple system. In this process, the s/ie-altar and the local temple system gradually replaced lineage centered domination of local space. This is not to say that lineages were ever insignificant in the Putian area. On the contrary, we have abundant materials, from genealogies to literati eulogies to stone inscriptions, all demonstrating the extraordinary importance of the major lineages in Putian. Putian was a major center of Confucian learning, with many academies and private libraries. Lineages supported schools and academies, and promoted Confucian 77 James Wilkerson, "The 'ritual master' and his 'temple corporation' rituals," Proceedings of the international conference on popular beliefs and Chinese culture , Taipei: Center for Chinese Studies, 1994.</page><page sequence="53">TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SHE 7 I learning. Some ninety inscriptions on ancestral halls have been gathered in Putian, with a high concentration ranging from the thirteenth to the eighteenth centuries.78 The materials examined in this paper trace the transformations of the she altar from the mid-sixteenth century in the Xinghua region. Mention was made of the long gap in inscriptions relating to the period of pirate invasions and forced coastal evacuations in the late sixteenth to mid-seventeenth centuries. The decline of the dominant form of the major Putian lineages in the wake of these disruptions has been noted by E. Vermeer.79 It is clear nonetheless that these lineages continued to transform and mutate throughout the Qing and Republican periods, and that they continue to play powerful roles today in local society in Putian. While an adequate description, much less a convincing explanation, of the apparent decline (or should one say complex transformations) of the lineage form in Putian in the Ming and Qing is beyond the scope of this paper, I have tried to indicate certain cultural resources that were mobilized in the concurrent rise of the local temple system. These include the ability to co-opt official forms and institutions such as the she altar, the long history of struggles for official recognition of local cults in Putian, and the strong local traditions of shamanism, which can perhaps be traced back to the pre-Han inhabitants of the Fujian area (the Bai Yue and Ming peoples, as well as the She and the Yao ^).80 The flowing together of these ethnic groups, ritual traditions and cultural potentialities reworked the elements of ritual performance noted above - sound, sensation, movement - into new currents that irrigated social space in Ming and Qing Putian. Chinese rituals and periodic processions thus involve a complex and variegated relationship with time. One can point to many vectors of change, or sheets of time, underlying rituals and processions. These include the slow transformation of institu- tions such as the she. Originally understood as an altar or a local temple to the gods of the earth, the she altars in the Putian area slowly expanded over the Song dynasty to include other local deities. These she altars were later "reformed" to some extent by the imposition of official altars to the soil and the grains in each sub-canton in the Ming period. Over the course of several centuries, the she altar/shrines created in this early Ming effort at official systematization gradually transformed from a determined set of temples within an administrative framework to an underlying unit of popular religious spatial self-organization. These changes were in part due to shifts in the population and modes of registration of that population. Meanwhile, the popular she altar/shrine was 78 Dean and Zheng, Epigraphical materials , 1995, include 442 inscriptions. Of these, over 70 inscriptions are on lineage halls, with another seventeen on academies. This represents almost a quarter of all inscriptions located, surpassed only by the 107 or so popular cult temple inscriptions from the region. In the fifteenth and sixteenth century ancestral hall inscriptions significantly outnumber those of any other category. 79 E.

Currently, in the Jiangkou area, a ritual procession of the gods of the village temple can take place only if a village has a she, whether or not that she is an independent shrine, or has been absorbed into a larger miao (temple) or gong (palatial temple) or dian (grand temple). However, if a village has one of these forms of temples, but no she , no procession can take place, and the members of that village have to join in the proces- sions centered around a nearby she. This is to say that the spatial levels marked out by the hierarchy of processions within a particular ritual sphere also have a temporal trajectory underlying their current spatial extension. Individuals participating in, and thereby creating these circuits, are also swept along by the slow sedimentation of institutional transformations. These transformations suggest that the lishe altar/temple was a highly contested site for the performance of power and the negotiation of meaning and levels of identifica- tion, not just between the village and the imperial center, but also within the village, and between villages. There was no eternal kyodotai underlying its changes. The lishe altar developed into a central organizing node of local organization in the Xinghua region not out of a dialectical relationship with the court or the State, nor out of any conscious effort to deconstruct official meanings, but instead out of a continuous process of deformation and the emergence of new social assemblages in a constantly transforming topology of local power.</page><page sequence="55">Landholdings of the Three (Goddess) Temple of the Upper Ascending to Sagehood Spiritual Territory DATE COST AMOUNT OF LAND QING REPUBLICAN tiang,qian tnu, fen RENT RENT shi, dou (wet) silver dollar 1. 1810 11.6 8 f.
