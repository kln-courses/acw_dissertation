Clisicos Caste- llanos, 161. Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, 1966. Paper. xcviii + 272 pp. To the admirable selection of eighteenth- century texts in the Clisicos Castellanos series this latest effort by Prof. Russell P. Sebold is a welcome addition, doubly so as a companion vol- ume to Federico de Onis' edition of Torres' Vida. The scholarly introduction properly leaves the bulk of biographical material to this pre- ceding edition and text, and provides instead an evaluation of the Piscator de Salamanca which demonstrates both erudition and affection on the part of the editor. As is stated in note 13 on pp. xviii-xix, "Torres casi siempre ha tenido la mala suerte de ser juzgado por quienes no se han tomado el trabajo de leerse mas que la Vida, y ni siquiera esta con tranquilidad y meditaci6n." As with Padre Isla's Fray Gerundio, recently edited by Prof. Sebold in four volumes of this series, anthological acquaintanceship may justify idle conversation and a hasty perusal of the text may satisfy curiosity, but neither can presume to supplant a studied and studious approach to an author and his work. The introduction is, in fact, an essay of appre- ciation and explication. The "contradictorio per- fil" (p. xiii) of Torres' character, the casticismo and hibridismo of his autobiographical style in Vida and Visiones, his backwardness in matters scientific, the pseudomysticism of the Visiones, these elements are clearly and' amply studied. But more important, Prof. Sebold logically de- fines Torres' position before his world, as seen in his descriptions, an anthropomorphic bestiary of evils and ills in the manner of Hieronymus Bosch, and in his explanations to Quevedo. As Torres' finely wrought and carefully honed phrases dissect the disease-wracked status quo, it is not his intent to search for cures, but to demonstrate the degree of decay. He neither dili- gently seeks a future which improves upon the present, nor fallaciously presumes a present which improves upon the past: "Ni reformador, ni decadente en el sentido usual de esta voz, Torres es, por decirlo asi, restaurador" (p. xlix). Restating the matter later, Prof. Sebold writes: "afioranza de la patria, se puede decir que tal sentimiento u otro muy antilogo es uno de los principales elementos y encantos del estilo de Torres: nostalgia de una patria espiritual, que para Torres es el Siglo de Oro-tu mejor edad- segin la llama a cada paso hablando con Que- vedo en las Visiones" (p. lix). And the orig- inality of Tores' technique, as opposed to the oft-postulated servile imitation of a model, is herein proven and substantiated. Quevedo is a springboard, not a mold. Criticisms of this edition are minor. In the introduction certain quotations are made with- out disclosing the source (p. lxi, and note 18 on p. xxxv), perhaps out of kindness. Typo- graphical errors are happily few, and seem to be limited to accent marks, deviations in align- ment and spacing, and a missing hyphen on p. xvi. The orthography has been modernized and, where necessary, Prof. Sebold has listed impor- tant variants in the texts employed. Rather than produce a variorum edition, he has annotated the text to provide the information most desired by the general reader, to wit, explanations of allu- sions and lexical difficulties, the latter primarily by reference to the contemporary Diccionario de Autoridades. In short, a jewel of a text has received a setting of rewarding clarity. Colgate Univ. ROBERT L. HATHAWAY</page></plain_text>
