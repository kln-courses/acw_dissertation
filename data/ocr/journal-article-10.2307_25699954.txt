Departing from previous semio logical and aesthetic approaches, this theory takes it that art is a form of instrumental action, the canonical efficacy of which lies in its power to function as a cognitive trap and to captivate the spectator's mind. In this article it is argued that Gell's theory is not as novel as it is claimed; that it fails to define the specific field of art; and that by excluding the aesthetic properties of art objects, it discards ethnographical data nonetheless necessary for understanding the agency of art in Melanesian local cultures. At a meta-level, Gell assigned to his theory the same cap tivating purpose as he did to art, and this probably explains the seductive fascination that his work continues to exert. Key words : agency, Alfred Gell, beauty, Melanesia, theory of art. 1998 saw the posthumous publication of a book entitled Art and Agency that aimed to articulate the first anthropological theory of art - i.e. a theory applicable to all forms of art, across all periods and societies, and capable of explaining the role of the production and circulation of art in social interactions. Art and Agency, by Alfred Gell (who died before finishing and proof reading the manuscript), provides a novel theoretical definition of art in a challenging text that uses sophisticated terminology and a sometimes confused argument, and borrows from a wide range of intellectual currents: Peircean semiotics, pragmatism, interactionism, philosophy of mind, cognitive anthropology and Husserlian phenomenology, among others. Oceania 80,2010 129</page><page sequence="2">The Art of Alfred Gell How might art be defined? For Arthur Danto (1981), two objects that are indistinguishable at a perceptual level may in fact be radically different when considered aesthetically: one may be an artwork (Fountain, by Duchamp), while the other may merely be a trivial artefact (a urinal). To this extent, the essence of art does not reside in any visual properties. Rather, an artwork exists merely insofar as it is interpreted as such within a historically determined artworld on the basis of the intentional structure attributed to it by the artist. Recontextualizing Danto's thought, which he greatly admired,1 Gell argued that the sole factor determining the range of objects that anthropologists ought to refer to as art is the context of social relations in which objects are embedded. Such objects cannot therefore be defined a priori. From this theoretical perspective, anything may be seen to constitute an artwork. The realm of art encompasses objects apprehended as products or instruments of the agency of the subjects who inspire, make, use or contemplate them, and includes objects that operate as extensions of people insofar as they manifest and realize their intentions and capacities for action. One of the major ambiguities of the book is that, in spite of the novelty and boldness of Gell's concept of art, Art and Agency relies exclusively on the analysis of artworks in the conventional sense of the term. Gell justifies this approach in the opening pages of the book: In as much as we recognize a pre-theoretical category of art objects?split into the two major subcategories of 'Western' art objects and 'Indigenous' or 'Ethnographic' art objects?I conduct the discussion in terms of 'prototypical' members of these categories, for convenience's sake (1998 : 7). Using an hypothesis articulated in 1992 in The Technology of Enchantment and the Enchantment of Technology, Gell also argued that the 'primordial' or 'canonical' efficacy of art objects resides in their power of fascination (1998: 68-69). Claiming that art objects are 'difficult to make, difficult to "think"', Gell contended that 'they fascinate, compel, and entrap as well as delight the spectator' (ibid: 23). He then observes: Captivation or fascination?the demoralization produced by the spectacle of unimaginable virtuosity?ensues from the spectator becoming trapped within the index because the index embodies agency which is essentially indecipherable. Partly this comes from the spectator's inability mentally to rehearse the origination of the index from the point of view of the originator, the artist (1998: 71). In other words, art objects generally captivate their audience because their technical excellence is such that they appear to exceed the limits of human possibility and are thus deemed to fall within the magical province of prodigies. According to cultural contexts, the inequality or incommensurable gap experienced by spectators between their own creative capacities and those of the creator of the artwork incite the audience to see in the object a manifestation of magic or the expression of artistic genius (ibid: 71). This article will therefore focus on what shall be referred to as the 'enchantment thesis' and its role in Gell's general theory (Derlon 2007). OF THEORY AS ARTISTIC PERFORMANCE Before addressing this issue, it is important to emphasize what Gell's scientific method owes ? consciously and quite openly?to his personality and to his ambition to please and seduce. Responding to Hirsch, Gell made the following observation about the delivery of his first conference papers: My aim was to seduce my audience, to make them admire me just as if I had been a debutante dancer going on stage. My presentation of self had to captivate just as much as my words (Gell 1999a: 5). 130</page><page sequence="3">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini Even more significantly, Gell made a claim for an approach that aims not to advance the cause of anthropology so much as fascinate and trouble readers by going against the grain of their expectations: Overall, what I'm interested in is producing something which is counter-intuitive ? all that I ever wanted to do was to produce articles and papers which would make people sit up ? and to do that the last thing that one wants really to be interested in is some Big Subject. [...] I wasn't really interested in actually, as it were, "advancing the subject" in any particular way. All that I was interested in doing was producing a certain frisson, a certain artistic effect which could be achieved by taking a random collection of objects which could be made to fit together in an interesting way. You know, like a bird decorating its nest with an arrangement of little pieces of tissue paper, a leaf, a flower (Gell 1999a: 23-24, emphasis ours). At a meta-level, Gell therefore assigned to his theory the same captivating purpose - in the strong sense of 'captivating'?as he did to art. This is indicative of the extent to which he conceived his work primarily as a means of acting upon his readers, as an object of seduction, or in some sense as an 'index4 of his own agency. On this account, Gell's power of fascination stemmed from his counter-intuitive thought, from the fact that his theory was based on a theoretical definition of art that was all the more striking because it was designed to work against the grain of common sense and to give its author 'the possibility of creating these conjunctions and unexpected connections that interest [him]' (1999a: 25).2 Rather than operating as an object of aesthetic contemplation, art functions as just one technique among others, a procedure in the service of action. Moreover, art is not confined to inert entities since a human being can be defined as art - for instance as the incarnation of a divinity. Finally, Gell claimed to have no interest in the semantic properties or the institutional dimensions of art, or indeed in ethno-aesthetics - in short, his theory deliberately eschewed all of the major themes of the anthropology of art. It is said that, with an 'impish grin and bedevilled glimmer in his eyes as his words would, he well knew, taunt those who have written on the subject of art', Gell rejoiced in his provocation, one of his final regrets probably being that he would be unable to take part in the heated debates to which his book would later give rise (Campbell 2001: 117). It seems reasonable to assume that the fascination exerted by Gell's theory is intimately connected with his actual ambition to exert fascination - an ambition that does not encourage nuance and that may account for the radicalism of his views. Of course, it goes without saying that this ambition in no way invalidates his theory. Simply, the conditions and motivations that account for the genesis of a piece of knowledge are never altogether indifferent to the content of this knowledge, in particular when the author himself indulges in demonstrating such knowledge in the introduction to a collected volume of his most important writings. In this respect, Gell's comments on his own work suggest a joyful iconoclastic anti-conformity that contrasts sharply with the seriousness of the academic realm, since he makes a strong claim to stand up for the cause of 'intellectual performance', 'to do a series of tricks' and 'to make [his] mark on the world' (1999a : 26). The reception of Gell's theory suggests that it has been partly successful in achieving its purpose. Except for a handful of detractors (Bowden 2004; Davis 2007; Layton 2003; Morphy &amp; Perkins 2006), and in spite of the weaknesses that even its most charitable readers have been prepared to acknowledge, the academic community, charmed by the work, has tended on the whole to see Art and Agency as a work of genius. Some observers have even credited the book with a transformative impact that has radically extended the reach of anthropology and caused the social sciences generally to operate a comprehensive renewal of their established ways of conceiving art.3 Roughly ten years after the publication of Art and Agency, one of the book's most widely accepted and cited arguments appears to be the claim at the 131</page><page sequence="4">The Art of Alfred Gell heart of the theory that likens art to a means of action, and more specifically to a 'technology of enchantment (see Pinney and Thomas, eds., 2001). THE SOURCES OF THE ENCHANTMENT THESIS But how did the enchantment thesis germinate in Gell's mind? Gell admitted that his emphasis on the fascination exerted by technical excellence was not altogether unrelated to the fact that he was himself a 'Sunday painter' (1998: 72). Gell also evoked the immense admiration he felt as a child for the match work model of Salisbury Cathedral, at an age when assembling games was one of his favourite activities and the model made a far deeper impression on him than its prestigious original (1992: 47). The core of Gell's theory is thus rooted in a relatively ordinary experience. This accounts by contrast for the common reaction of those who refuse to see certain innovative works as art on the grounds that they could achieve just as much. The ethnography of Melanesia certainly played a key role in the enchantment thesis, but it was clearly the publication of David Freedberg's The Power of Images in 1989 that served in all likelihood to reinforce Gell's rejection of aesthetics and his interest in the capacity of images to elicit from spectators 'specific acts and a specific behaviour' (Freedberg 1989). Yet Gell's greatest source of inspiration was the work of another art historian, Ernst Gombrich, the authority on the cognitive effects of art and the psychology of visual perception. Gell's students and colleagues recall the excitement that he felt on reading The Sense of Order (Hirsch, Kiichler, Pinney, Dunlop, 1997: 22) the same year (1984) he wrote The Technology of Enchantment.4 Though it made no reference to Gombrich, Gell referred in this article to various examples of the captivating power of art. The first such example was the case of the canoes on the Trobriand Islands, which he claimed dazzled and demoralized the exchange partners of the crew because they attributed the visual instability of their motifs, composed of inverted volutes, to magic. The second example was Old Papers, the trompe Vceil painting by the American artist John Peto. The 'technical miracle' of Peto's work relies, so the argument goes, on the impression it gives of a process of 'transubstantiation' between the pigmentary matter applied to the canvas and the different materials (cloth, metal, feather, paper) that appear to compose it. The third example was Picasso's sculpture of a monkey (Baboon and Young), which operates, according to Gell, as a 'transubstantiation' of the head of the baboon as a model car. Gell extended the notion of artistic 'alchemy' to the point of dissolving it altogether. 'No matter what avant-garde school of art one considers', Gell writes, 'it is always the case that materials, and the ideas associated with those materials, are taken up and transformed into something else, even if it is only, as in the case of Duchamp's notorious urinal, by putting them in an art exhibition and providing them with a title (Fountain) and an author' ('R. Mutt', alias M. Duchamp, 1917) (1992: 52-53). The works by Peto and Picasso cited by Gell also serve as illustrations in Gombrich's Art and Illusion (1996: fig. 70 and 165). The significance that Gombrich gave to illusionist devices is well known, whether such devices are designed to produce a troubling imitation of reality or particular optical phenomena such as the animation or visual transformation of particular motifs. In The Sense of Order, Gombrich praises the 'fantastic inventions' of the Dutch graphic artist Escher, which, according to him, 'dazzle the eye and the mind by their astounding complexities'. Consisting of repeated motifs that may be interpreted differently according to what the eye selects as figure or background, they serve as illustrations par excellence of the manifestation of virtuosity insofar as they are rooted in technique while triumphantly emancipating themselves from it (1979: 89). According to Gombrich, virtuosity may involve working at materials so skilfully that 'miraculous transformations' seem to occur that make wood resemble lace or needlework resemble painting (ibid. 66). In other words, the connection that Gell makes between technical virtuosity, the transformation or alchemy performed by the artist and the power of fascination exerted by the artwork is already present in Gombrich, though the latter never set out to use the connection as the foundation of art. 132</page><page sequence="5">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini Gell's enchantment thesis recalls to some extent the views of the earliest French art critics and theorists. In La Place du Spectateur, Michael Fried remarks that for 'Diderot and his colleagues' in the eighteenth century, a painting 'had to attract the beholder, to stop him in front of itself, and to hold him there in a perfect trance of involvement' (Fried 1980: 103). Roger de Piles, a chief source of inspiration for them, argued that a 'true painting' was a work capable of surprising the spectator by 'the great truth of its imitation' (1708: 6), not unlike the portrait of his servant by Rembrandt which, exhibited at the window, was capable of fooling passers-by. Svetlana Alpers infers from this that de Piles was defending 'an art which primarily does something other than narrate' (1976: 27).5 There is an obvious parallel here with Gell, for whom art is a matter of action more than signification, illusionist painting being a typical instance of forms of expression that fascinate spectators. But these ideas have an even longer history. Greek and Roman Antiquity has left penetrating accounts of art conceived as a means of action and as a power of enchantment based on virtuosity. Consider for instance the mermaids of mythology - those incomparable musicians who fed off sailors whom they attracted towards the rocky snores by their enchanting songs. Or Orpheus, who convinced masters of the underworld to return Eurydice to him through the sheer persuasive magic of his poetry and his lyre. Or Pygmalion, the sculptor who was able to imitate the woman of his dreams so perfectly that, dazzled by his own creation, he eventually forgot that she was a figment of his imagination and fell in love with her.6 'So art lies hid by its own artifice' (ars adeo latet arte sua), wrote Ovid. For the author of the Metamorphoses, perfection is attained when technical excellence makes technique disappear; when the spectator, and better still the artist, is so enthralled by the finished work that, incapable of seeing it as the product of a series of technical gestures, they come to identify the work as a miraculous presence. Gell said nothing different - and indeed nothing more7 - even if he would probably have written that Pygmalion, the victim of a 'blockage in cognition', is 'trapped within the index' (his ivory statue) and therefore unable to infer his own agency by abduction; which he would again express in the form of the following diagram: [[Artist-A] ? Index A] ? Artist-P. In short, neither the idea that art acts upon the world by enchanting its audience, nor the claim that its capacity to enchant is the product of artistic virtuosity, are novel concepts in the history of art and literature. It appears instead that such notions are positively the most ancient and common conceptions of art, and that they originate from the universal cognitive experience so perfectly described by Gell: the experience of imagining producing an artwork in lieu of the artist, thereby measuring the gap between one's own artistic talent and the artist's creative skill. CAPTIVATION: AN OBJECTIVE PROPERTY OR A WAY OF SEEING? Gell criticised anthropology for relying on an outworn, reactionary conception of art that remained blind to the innovations of Western art in the twentieth century (1999a: 18; 1999b: 209-210). Probably keen to do for anthropology what Danto did for philosophy, Gell's object was to devise a theory that was applicable to artworks such as those produced by Duchamp. Yet Gell went even further: art in the conventional sense of the term was for him merely a 'pre-theoretical category' of his own category of art (1998: 7). From his point of view, any object or person performing a function comparable to the role of artworks by mediating forms of agency in a context of social interactions can and must be likened to art (ibid.: 7). In an article published in 1996 sub-titled Traps as artworks and artworks as traps, Gell (1999b) argued that certain animal traps in Africa and Oceania ought to be classified as art from an anthropological perspective since they constitute material realizations of complex intentions (the intentions of the hunter and his prey) in the same way as a work of art by Damien Hirst or Judith Horn is the outcome of a complex intention realized by its creator. Yet it is only at the cost of significant shifts of meaning that Gell was able to apply the 133</page><page sequence="6">The Art of Alfred Gell enchantment thesis - the first cornerstone of his general theory - to artworks such as Duchamp's. Gell was well aware that the idea of technical excellence which he emphasized so much - where technique evokes action and is contrasted with aesthetics8 - would be sought in vain in readymades and many other kinds of contemporary art. His use of the notion of 'transubstantiation' in the 1992 article was largely inspired by some remarks made by Gombrich about classical artistic expressions (trompe Vceil, wrought iron art). Where Peto operated a 'transubstantiation' of pictorial matter, Duchamp performed a 'transubstantiation' of ideas connected with the industrial objects which he used. Virtuosity thus becomes a matter of technique and/or brilliant imagination. Duchamp was able to enchant spectators by making them realize that they would never have considered questioning the notion of art through the exhibition of trivial objects. Yet such a wide definition of virtuosity and the origins of fascination naturally encompasses all of the artworks included within the art world. After all, one would be hard put to think of any artworks exhibited in museums or galleries in which nobody perceived at some point the expression of a definite talent, a great technical ability or a highly developed imagination.9 In Art and Agency, it is not Duchamp's urinal but Vermeer's The Lacemaker that serves as an illustration of the fascination exerted by western art. The only artefacts that Gell evokes are those 'which announce themselves as miraculous creation'; or 'recognizably works of art, made with technical expertise and imagination of a high order, which exploit the intrinsic mechanisms of visual cognition with subtle psychological insight' (1998: 68).10 Compared to his 1992 article, Gell thus provided a more restricted account of enchantment that is not dissociated from particular visual properties. It is precisely in this way that his approach has been construed by some commentators, including Nicholas Thomas, according to whom 'the formal complexity, and indeed the technical virtuosity, exhibited in works of art is not incidental to the argument but absolutely central to it. It is crucial to the theory, in fact, that indexes display "a certain indecipherability'" (1998 : x). Commenting on this issue, Whitney Davis also notes that Gell 'sees [it] chiefly in terms of technical virtuosity and visual morphological intricacy' (2007 : 211). Perhaps even more so than anthropologists, art historians who have been receptive to Gell's work have sought to understand the criteria that distinguish art from non-art in the general theory. How does an artwork, indeed any artwork, differ from an animal trap? What distinguishes a work of art from the anti-personnel mines11 mentioned by Gell as examples of the capacity of objects to operate as extensions of people (1998: 20-21)? Addressing this last question, Matthew Rampley (2005: 542) and Jeremy Tanner and Robin Osborne (2007: 2-3, 12) have provided the following answer: art differs by virtue of its power of fascination. This is precisely what Gell suggests: Many indexes are crude and uninteresting artefacts, whose importance rests solely on their mediatory function in a particular social context?for instance, the figurines used in African divination?and while these certainly fall within the scope of the an thropology of art they have no significance as 'works of art', because nobody attends to their making as a particular salient feature of their agency (1998: 68). In other words, there is nothing in these artefacts that might suggest linking the existence of the objects to an expression of human genius or to some kind of supernatural realm. Gell's view also amounts implicitly to justifying the classic statutory hierarchisation according to which the proper place of a figurine used in African divination is in an ethnographic museum rather than in a museum of fine arts. In short, Gell conceives the power of fascination in the above passage as a criterion serving to discriminate not between the artistic realm and a strictly technical realm (mine, trap), but between 'artworks ' and artefacts within the artistic realm itself. As Lissant Bolton put it: 134</page><page sequence="7">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini This seems to be a case of having one's cake and eating it. The idea that some objects are more art-like than others is the root and foundation of the whole problem of the anthropology of art which Gell is attempting to overturn?the idea of the intrinsically 'art-like' character of art (Bolton 2001 MOO). One problem with the enchantment thesis is the identification of the properties of objects triggering the cognitive pathways which cause spectators to construe such objects as the manifestation of genius or of a supernatural power. If objects merely need to actualize their creator's technical excellence and/or brilliant imagination (Gell 1992), then it follows that a power of fascination is not the sole or inherent property of art. Apprehended intellectually, an animal trap might conceivably be a captivating object to contemplate (Gell 1999b). The same argument applies to anti-personnel mines, but is also equally applicable to a wheel, a telephone, air planes, satellites and indeed most human inventions that materialize no fewer complex intentions than The Lacemaker or an eel trap, which are all different kinds of 'technical miracles'. How can a man, indeed men, invent such objects? The technical skill and imagination displayed by Gutenberg or the Lumiere brothers are just as fascinating as the skill and imagination manifested by the artworks of Rodin and Ingres. And there is no reason to restrict the domain to material objects12 after all, the immaterial productions of Shakespeare, Mozart, Freud, Einstein and Gell are just as liable to fascinate their audience as the works of any painter or sculptor. Ethnologists are well aware of man's propensity to marvel at his own inventions and to attribute a mythical or divine origin to such creations. It is precisely this conception of fascination that we shall defend here. And we might say of enchantment precisely what Jean-Marie Schaeffer says of the aesthetic dimension, i.e. that it consists not in objective properties so much as in a specific mental attitude towards the real (1996,2004). What then happens if we adopt a more restricted perspective and consider that fascinating objects attest to technical excellence and a brilliant imagination while displaying specific visual properties (Gell 1998) ? Following Ross Bowden, we may first note that these three features 'are not limited to artworks and consequently do not distinguish this class of objects from a whole range of other entities, such as any well-designed product on a supermarket shelf, the best television advertisements, and any number of computer games' (2004: 323). But within the specific context of our argument, we will argue that if, on the basis of these three features, animal traps and anti-personnel mines are excluded from the realm of art, then so are readymades and indeed a large proportion of contemporary artworks. Duchamp's urinal, which Gell evoked in 1992 as an illustration of art's power of enchantement, can no longer exert fascination if this power is connected with strictly perceptual properties. As Davis writes it: At its first exhibition in 1915-17, Kasimir Malevich's Black Square was 'difficult' not in virtue of its painterly virtuosity (which was minimal) or its morphological com plexity (it was simple). Malevich's Black Square was 'difficult'?resistant to inter pretation, opaque to a contemporary observer's abduction of its generating causal agencies?because its recipients did not know what it could possibly mean in terms of any traditions of significance or agent-caused determination traditionally known to them (2007 : 211). In other words, Gell tends to hesitate between two different conceptions of enchantment ? one conception associating it with objective properties and the other not associating it with such properties - neither of which helps_to account for both Duchamp's and Vermeer's works and for what separates them from an anti-personnel mine or an animal trap. Therefore the same issue applies both to the enchantment thesis and to Gell's general theory: neither are specifically concerned with the artworks which provide the focus of the anthropology of art; both entail excluding mines while including both relatively unremarkable figurines of African origin and the works of contemporary artists. And this is in part what explains the reluctance 135</page><page sequence="8">The Art of Alfred Gell of experts in the field to judge his theory as a convincing instance of an anthropological theory of art. Furthermore, by extending the notion of art to the point where it becomes (potentially) coextensive with everything that exists, Gell tends to empty it of all meaning, and to render it superfluous and devoid of heuristic benefit. He might then have benefited from discarding it altogether by merely presenting his theory as a reflection on the agency and intentions invested in objects. Yet if this had been the case, it seems unlikely that the theory would have produced quite the same 'artistic' effect on Gell's readers. Whatever option we choose, the enchantment thesis fails to delimit and define the specific realm of art, i.e. the range of objects that Gell analysed in Art and Agency. This partly explains why experts in the anthropology of art have been so reluctant to view Gell's theory as a convincing account of the subject. The question that might therefore be addressed is if, instead of reassessing and extending his notion of art, Gell ought not rather to have discarded such concerns and presented his theory as a reflection on the agency and intentions invested in objects. GELL'S ETHNOGRAPHIC SHORT CUTS What then of the originality and relevance of the enchantment thesis in the context of the ethnographic examples upon which it is based? Gell's examples were drawn exclusively from the Melanesian world. Canoe prow-boards and shields serve as 'weapons in psychological warfare'. Deriving their efficacy from their bewildering or terrifying appearance, independently of their aesthetic and semantic properties, they enable their users to intimidate, demoralize and subsequently defeat exchange partners and enemies. Gell's account of the shields of New Guinea is restricted to a summary outline of the devices, construed as the support of terrifying motifs which serve, in the same way as 'false mirrors', to confront the enemy with a reflection of their own terror. Nothing is said of the form of these motifs except that 'they seem to have been composed in a mood of terror' and that, 'submitting to the fascination, we are obliged to share in the emotion which they objectify' (1998: 31). Although Gell makes no mention of any bibliographical sources on the subject, there are substantial ethnographic data that would have merited further consideration. Twenty five years before the publication of Art and Agency, Cherry Lowman had already offered an interpretation of the Maring shields that focused on their cognitive and psychological effects and thus provided a striking anticipation of Gell's own theoretical position. Before any battle, Lowman claims, opponents exhibit their weapons and their finery with a profusion of shouts and threatening gestures. Inspired by ethology, Lowman likened these practices to the persuasion displays used by different groups to gauge their respective strengths. These intimidation behaviours rely on what appears literally to be an 'extension of the body': the shields, mounted with feathers and decorated with motifs displaying optical effects that accentuate their size, amplify the apparent size and mass of the warriors. According to Lowman, the meaning of these geometrical designs, which are meant to represent the elements of the natural environment, plays no part in the power assigned to the weapons. Lowman writes that 'the purpose of the shield design was not then to communicate to the enemy a specific symbolic message, but to elicit fear in them' (Lowman 1973: 26). According to Michael O'Hanlon, in the case of the Waghi, the brightness of the shields is attributed to their ancestors, who thereby sanction the irreproachable moral condition of their warriors. The terrifying aspect of their weapons, designed to repel their enemies, is a function of their degree of brightness rather than the product of any strictly graphic elements (O'Hanlon 1995: 456-777). It would still be premature to infer from this that the meaning of the motifs is wholly irrelevant for the impression that the shields of New Guinea are designed to produce. According to the account given by Paul Sillitoe, the shields of the Wola owe their threatening aspect to the meaning attributed to their anthropomorphic designs: the representation of genital organs is intended as an insult and the inversion in the order of the colours signifies that the 136</page><page sequence="9">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini bearer of the shield, in mourning for a relative or friend killed in combat, is determined to seek revenge at any cost (Sillitoe 1980: 495-496). This is indicative of the extent to which the semantic dimension of the objects contributes to their effects at a distance, and it also explains why there was no need for Gell to exclude the issue of meaning from his enchantment thesis. As Morphy writes: 'in many cases the semantic component of art can be integral to its being a mode of acting in the world' (2009: 14). The case of the canoe prow-boards suggests a rehabilitation of the issue of the beautiful that Gell dismissed by claiming peremptorily that 'Melanesian aesthetics is about efficacy, the capacity to accomplish a task, not "beauty"' (1998: 94). Yet in addressing this issue, all of the ethnographers who have worked in the Trobriand Islands - Campbell (2002), Malinowski (1922), Munn (1986), Scoditti (1989), Weiner (1976), - agree that beauty constitutes a fundamental endogenous value. Beauty is conceived as an irresistible power of seduction; it is indissociable from a wide range of human activities and is invariably attained with the help of magic. It plays a crucial role in inter-insular exchanges, which are often construed in terms of sexual encounters: If a man is blessed with a beautiful face, he will be able to attract women and shell valuables. It is important for the face of the splashboard to be beautiful so that it, too, will attract the attention of kula partners who will want to 'throw' their shell valuables towards the canoe, bespelled by the beautiful 'face' of the [splashboard] (Campbell 2002: 94). It is not merely the sculptures of the freshly painted canoes that are competing to be acknowledged as the most beautiful of their kind; so too are the shell wreaths attached to the canoes, the gleaming finery of the crew, and the armbands and necklaces at the heart of the transactions. According to the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands, all of these elements pertain to a general mechanism of persuasion (which also includes gifts and oratory skills) designed to dazzle the exchange partners and to subjugate them in order that they divest themselves of their most precious belongings (Campbell 2002). According to Shirley Campbell, whose materials are used as a key case by Gell, the canoe prow-boards serve as the very first thing which visited groups are likely to see upon the arrival of the flotilla (2002: 130). However, Campbell also indicates that their exchange partners never greet the crews on the beach but remain instead in their villages or in their gardens. The crew members only join them once they have put the final touches to their beauty by 'anointing their skins with oil and perfume charmed to seduce those who await them' (ibid. 165-166). In this context of deeply ritualised interactions in which the arrival of the canoes on the shore does not trigger any movements or appears not to catch anybody's attention, the nature of their visual impact is subject to caution. Even from a distance the flotilla may conceivably make a strong impression. By contrast, it is difficult to imagine how the spiral motifs on the canoes could possibly produce the kinds of optical effects at a distance that Gell attributes to them - assuming they even preserved their shining brilliance at the end of a long sea crossing (Bowden 2004: 312). Recall that it is the visual instability caused by the inverted volutes, attributed to a superior magical power by the spectators, which is said to demoralize them and to cause them to give away their coveted goods more readily. It is in fact possible that the effect prow boards have when seen close up are thought of when seen in the distance or when the designs look dulled by the impact of the voyage, the original close up vision of the design being present in the imagination and being part of the power of the object. But the point is undecidable without data enabling a reconstruction of the entire context of viewing.13 The inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands are also known to have a particular fondness for spirals, which they reproduce on objects such as spatulas or lime gourds - objects that are not designed to act upon other people's morale. In short, there is no ethnographic data to justify or corroborate Gell's interpretation, which focuses solely on the hypothetical optical illusions of the canoes 137</page><page sequence="10">The Art of Alfred Gell and ignores the other aspects of ritual strategies of seduction (relating in our view primarily to forms of psychological reassurance) because of a refusal to acknowledge the relevance of the dimension of the beautiful. Because he reduced aesthetics to beauty and associated it with disinterestedness, Gell was unable to conceive that beauty could be efficient and constitute a form of power. Yet the issue had been noted as early as 1967 by Anthony Forge (Gell's own doctoral supervisor), who had also shown that the Melanesians construed the beauty of their creations as 'a sense of the presence of the supranormal, or more power than humans alone can achieve' (1979: 284). In other words, Forge saw in beauty what Gell saw in technical virtuosity: namely the expression of a human talent exceeding understanding and perceived as a mark of transcendence. BEYOND GELL, BEAUTY AS ENCHANTMENT The case of the Sulka's masks in New Britain fits Forge's argument since the contemplation of these ritual artefacts designed to represent supernatural entities effectively generates an emotion whose exceptional intensity gives access to the sacred present in the very dimension of the beautiful. These masks are built by men for initiation ceremonies and, as is usual in Melanesia, non-initiates (females and children) are supposed to believe that what they see dancing on the village place are spirits that have sprung out from stones after the men have performed a specific form of magic. For the Sulka, the beauty of the masks is a condition of their ritual efficacy. The definition of beauty, by local standards, is linked to several formal attributes. To start with, it is connected with visual qualities such as brilliance or a glossy appearance. Beauty is light, brightness.14 Beauty is also linked to a particular arrangement of the different colours so that the red pigment tends to stand out. If a man happens to make a mistake during the building of a mask (for instance if he uses the wrong paint, or if he uses the appropriate paint in the wrong spot), he is said to have 'extinguished' or 'spoiled the light'. The mask is then considered definitively damaged, and is destroyed as it is no longer possible for it to dance on the village grounds. The beauty of the masks does not depend on the ritual objects alone but is also linked to the modalities of their advent: the masks must be seen at a distance, and always in movement; they have to respect specific choreographical conventions?for instance to choose a certain exposure when dancing in order that the sun beams upon and illuminates their colours, making them gleam intensely. But most of all, the aesthetic quality and efficacy of the masks results from their freshness, for freshness alone is able to preserve the shining aspect of their paints, the brilliance and the aromatic power of the vegetal materials they are made of. Everything thus attests to the importance given to the quest for beauty conceived as an operator of efficacy: the beauty of the magic accompanying their fabrication, the contrast and the flamboyance of their colours, the staging of their sudden appearance, the sought-after correspondences with their sound, visual and olfactory environment, the exegeses proffered by craftsmen, critical appreciations of the quality of objects, the affective reactions of the spectators. Beauty is an accomplishment grounded both in human technical competence and in the help of the spirits. Through the magic they perform, the men building the masks can benefit from the assistance of ancestral spirits. When achieved, beauty can thus be seen as an expression of a cosmological agreement. The sudden and intense performance of beauty operates as a 'presentification' of what may loosely be called the divine. The very excess of rapture which it is designed to elicit from the on-lookers authenticates the advent and momentary presence of the ancestral spirits. Beauty is conceived of by the Sulka in terms of its power to arouse emotion?whether it be affliction, love, exaltation, nostalgia, etc. Such a power is seen as something very intrusive, since the personal affects and inner mental life of an individual are held to be ordinarily out of reach. The shock experienced by the spectator sanctions this efficacy. Destabilising and experienced as a paralysing grip, aesthetic experience overwhelms a person to such an extent that it may even be likened at times to an aggression, 138</page><page sequence="11">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini a violation, a wrong that requires compensation. For this reason, any individual impressed by the beauty of a mask in the course of a ceremony and who makes his turmoil manifest must be given a present (cloth, money, string bag, knife, etc.) by the man organizing the ceremony (the 'father of the feast4). This gift is explicitly assimilated to a compensation. It is called enkim ka svil or srim ka svih 4to pay-redeem-compensate desire'. Note that the notion of esthetic impact as an attack on the person has other occurrences in the ethnography of New Guinea (see Dark 1983; Harrison 1993; Maschio 1995; Read 1955; Roscoe 1995; Schieffelin 1977; Strathern 1971; Weiner 1976). In Melanesia, spectators are not required to pay; they are compensated if what they have seen has moved them to the point of threatening their psychological autonomy (Jeudy-Ballini 2004a, 2004b). Seldom distinguished in Sulka vernacular terminology, beauty and efficacy are bound by a relation of absolute solidarity. Besides rituals, they inform areas as diverse as horticultural activities and conceptions of the body. The shimmering beauty of ornamental vegetables planted on cultivated lands conditions and attests to the fertility of the soil. A plot of land is only fertile insofar as it is beautiful and is only beautiful insofar as it is fertile. Likewise, a person's physical beauty serves to reveal, authenticate and potentialize their vitality or their moral qualities. What appeals to the senses, to eyesight, but also to the sense of hearing and the sense of smell - a song, a perfume - acts upon the body by encouraging growth and good health. Conversely, anything that weakens a person, such as an illness, a failure or a transgression, is mirrored physically by an increased ugliness which no external finery could possibly serve to attenuate (Jeudy-Ballini 2004b). The Sulka ethnography gives an illustration of how, by excluding beauty, Gell neglects data that are nonetheless necessary for understanding local cultures. First of all, he overlooks something which he himself admits as being a good anthropological object. Indeed, whereas in 1992 he had encouraged enthnologists to adopt4 an attitude of resolute indifference towards the aesthetic value of works of art?the aesthetic value that they have, either indigenously, or from the standpoint of universal aestheticism' (1992: 42), in 1998 he acknowledges incidentally that 4the anthropology of art can be the study of the mobilization of aesthetic principles (or something like them) in the course of social interaction' (1998: 4). Once again, he paradoxically denies himself the use of an argument that might have served the purposes of his thesis of art as enchantment?at least in the ethnographic cases where it applies. As such, the beauty of ritual effigies functions as a 'psychological weapon', in the same way that the ugliness of certain masks designed to frighten the uninitiated, or the disturbing quality of the motifs painted on the shields, aim to scare off the enemy. The aim is invariably to impress or destabilize the spectator. Note that we readily concede that tribal objects may be intentionally ugly to generate fear but not that they are intentionally beautiful in order to elicit an emotional response, since there is a long tradition of thought which sees beauty as being merely a Western value. CONCLUSION To renew the anthropological view of art by virtually extending its theoretical definition to any object independently of its intrinsic nature: such is Gell's ambition, and it has an unmistakably 'Duchampian' ring to it. His object is essentially to achieve with an anti personnel mine what Duchamp achieved with a urinal: i.e. to attribute an artistic status to a trivial object 'generically marked as being excluded from the realm of art' and to abolish 'the so-called ontological specificity of the artwork' (translated from Schaeffer 1996: 32). Both aim to subvert the aesthetic and semantic values commonly associated with art. While Gell situates his work within the domain of anthropological theory rather than grounding it in artistic practice, he nonetheless has a distinct taste for conceiving his intellectual work as an artwork; a founding work designed to mark the break between a before and an after in the anthropology of art, just as there was 'a before and an after' Duchamp in inquiries into the definition of art. As for his ambition to elaborate the first anthropological theory of art worthy of the name, 139</page><page sequence="12">The Art of Alfred Gell Gell appears to have failed since Art and Agency articulates a theory of agency more than a theory of art. However, his ambition to surprise and captivate his readership appears to all intents and purposes to have been successful. As noted above, Gell's propensity for cut-and dried arguments can be attributed to his tendency to conceive of his theory in terms of a disturbing work of art. The mistakes, the imprecision, the shifts of meaning and the short cuts in Gell's thesis give it the opacity and the 'cognitive indecipherability' (1998: 95) which Gell is so fond of associating with art's power of enchantment. 'Using a deliberately provocative tone befitting the cult surrounding him, we would like to suggest that, far from being the somewhat weak counterpart of a remarkably powerful text, a text incapable of preventing its many qualities from ensuring a much-deserved success, these mistakes are in fact the chief reason for the fascination which it has tended to exert, and which it continues to exert.' We would like to extend these comments made by Antoine Hennion and Bruno Latour (1996: 235) on Walter Benjamin's celebrated text The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction to Gell's own writings, just as we might have borrowed the title of their critical article: 'How to Make Mistakes on So Many Things at Once and Become Famous for it...' Theory of enchantment or enchantment of the theory? We need to remain wary of any over-simplifying thesis and to resist the disabling hold of contemplative fascination. Because of the large number of critical responses which it has elicited, Art and Agency has produced an unusual dynamics in the anthropology of art. It has helped to underline the importance of the acting and active dimension of art objects and of their capacity to function as 'social agents' existing in relationships with other agentive beings. Like many theories, however, we can only wish that it will eventually become obsolete. Indeed, rather than postulating mutually exclusive possibilities by denying, as Gell does, the anthropological pertinence of the aesthetic and the symbolic, it might be preferable to do full justice to art and to the plurality of its dimensions in the study of social interactions. We argue that the very art of anthropology should precisely be to think of the multiple dimensions of art in conjunction rather than seeking to oppose them. Let us postulate indeed that art may simultaneously communicate, move, dazzle, and foster thought and action. NOTES 1. Gell outlines his position in relation to Danto's theory in ' Vogel's Net'_( 1999b). 2. 'What I want to be able to do is to produce an essay which allows me to combine Danto, the extraordinarily metropolitan New York Philosophy of Art Professor, with the Pygmy theory of why chimpanzees are too clever for their own good' (Gell 1999a : 25). 3. See the observations made by Maurice Bloch and Marilyn Strathern about the back cover of Art and Agency, as Ross Bowden (2004) suggests. 4. Referring to the 1992 article, Gell remarked that 'the paper took five days to write and eight years to publish' (1999a: 16), which suggests it was written in 1984. 5. Emphasis ours. 6. Oddly enough, though Gombrich (1996) and Freedberg (1989) both referred to Pygmalion, Gell made no such reference. 7. Indeed, by refuting that there could be a possible connection between enchantment and beauty, Gell said even less (see infra). 8. There are two different uses of 'technique' that are worth noting here: 'That which, in the realm of art, relates to processes of work and expression more than inspiration (as opposed to aesthetics)'; 'That which relates to objects, the devices required for an action to occur' (translated from Le Petit Robert). 9. However, artistic genius may not always be the sole factor at work in the fascination exerted by some artworks. Are the people who gather around the Mona Lisa not also fascinated, perhaps enthralled above all, by the extraordinary fame of the painting, i.e. a factor that extends well beyond both the artist and the artwork? 10. Emphasis ours. 11. As Robert Layton remarks (2005:45): 'If Pol Pot's soldiers had spent their time burying pictures of Pol Pot rather than land mines, there would not be so many Cambodians whose lives today have been ruined by shattered limbs.' 12. Gell acknowledged that the verbal and musical arts cannot be isolated from the visual arts and that the distinction is only designed to simplify the issues at hand (1998: 13). 13. The authors would like to express their gratitude to the anonymous referee of Oceania for having suggested the addition of this remark. Note however that we do not know if the visited partners have ever seen the freshly made designs. 140</page><page sequence="13">Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini 14.
