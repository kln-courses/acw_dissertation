Vol 69. 2010 ANTIQUITIES FROM THE RIVER BLACKWATER IV, EARLY MEDIEVAL NON-FERROUS METALWORK1 CORMAC BOURKE 21 Osborne Drive, Belfast BT9 6LG cormacbourke @ btinternet.com with illustrations by DEIRDRE CRONE A study and illustrated catalogue of some 430 pieces of early medieval non-ferrous metalwork dredged from the River Blackwater in Co Armagh and Co Tyrone. INTRODUCTION This paper, the fourth in a series,2 describes early medieval non-ferrous metalwork dredged from the River Blackwater between Blackwatertown and Lough Neagh (Fig I) and now housed for the most part in the Ulster Museum. The first pieces were recognized by independent metal-detectorists c 1990 in the final stages of the most recent dredging campaign. Discoveries were made intermittently thereafter, both by the original finders and in excavations directed by the writer on behalf of the Ulster Museum. The material catalogued here dates to between the 7th and the 11th century and is illustrated sequentially (with some omissions) in Figs 1-47 and Pis 1-5. The catalogue is comprehensive but for two exclusions: the 7th-century Clonmore, Co Armagh, shrine, and an imported 12th-century bowl from Corr and Dunavally in the same county. Both have been published in varying degrees of outline and call for separate and detailed consideration.3 THE SHANMULLAGH ASSEMBLAGE The metalwork described in this paper includes a concentration of finds - many with common characteristics -from Shanmullagh or Ballycullen (hereafter Shanmullagh), Co Armagh, which have been referred to collectively in earlier publications as the Shanmullagh hoard.4 The distribution of this material extends westwards, across the Blackwater, into the townland of Derryoghill, Co Tyrone, and discontinuously northwards or downstream - on both sides of the river - into the townlands of Corr and Dunavally, Co Armagh, and Moy, Co Tyrone. The discontinuous nature of the distribution is explained, at least partly, by a discontinuous pattern of dredging and/or spreading and by discontinuous coverage by searchers. Licensed excavations in this area in 1992 and 1993 were confined to Shanmullagh itself. Most of the material from the four named townlands is taken to belong to the Shanmullagh assemblage, and it is a major purpose of this paper to defend this interpretation by identifying, describing and illustrating its constituents. In doing so, I will use the term 'assemblage' in preference to 'hoard' since the combination of the pieces was almost certainly adventitious. Hoards, unlike assemblages, show consistency of selection within a limited range of variables and their parts must have been consciously combined, even if not always with a view to deposition or secretion. Hiberno-Scandinavian metalwork For the purposes of dating and characterization, the core material of the Shanmullagh assemblage is Hiberno-Scandinavian metalwork. This includes silver arm-rings and ingots, many fragmented by cutting (turning them into 'hack- sii ver'), part of a copper- alloy bracelet, two gold finger-rings and numerous lead weights. Arm-rings are represented by three varieties - broad-band, coiled and rod; all three types were in circulation contemporaneously between the mid-9th and early 10th century (Sheehan 1992a, 47; 1992b, 214; 2011, 100; John Sheehan, pers comm) and then- representation in the assemblage broadly mirrors their incidence overall. Thus the broad-band type is represented by at least four fragments (catalogue 3, 7-9), the coiled type by one fragment (12), and the rod type by one complete example (13). All three varieties occur together in the Cuerdale, Lancashire, hoard, deposited c 905-10 (Graham-Campbell 2011, 7), a connection reinforced by the discovery at Shanmullagh of part of a ribbon bracelet (40); this is a unique copper- alloy version of a type represented in silver in the Cuerdale hoard (ibid, 92; cf 195, no 1:418).5 The bracelet fragment, and another unique piece (3 1 8) - a heavy, pin-like object of copper-alloy - bear varieties of stamped ornament in Hiberno-Scandinavian style. 24</page><page sequence="2">Fig I The River Blackwater with places and sites mentioned in the text. Two gold finger-rings (1,2) belong to different types, one a round-sectioned rod, the other a flat- sectioned band. The former is paralleled by a ring from a 10th-century Viking boat burial on the Ile de Groix, Brittany, which also yielded a mount that appears to be of insular origin (Bj0rn &amp; Shetelig 1940, fig 74; Roesdahl et al 1992, no 360), the latter by a ring with stamped decoration from the River Liffey at Islandbridge, in the vicinity of the 9th- century cemeteries of Scandinavian Dublin (Graham-Campbell 2011, 160). A date for the Shanmullagh assemblage in the second half of the 9th century or in the early 10th century is suggested by this evidence and is further suggested by the presence of lead weights set with pieces of insular metalwork of broadly 8th- to 9th- century type. Such weights are a hallmark of provincial Scandinavian taste and are to be compared with those from the 9th-century cemeteries at Kilmainham/Islandbridge, from a 9th- century burial at Kiloran Bay, Colonsay (Graham-Campbell 1980, nos 308, 307), 6 and from contemporary settlements at Coolure Demesne, Co Westmeath (a crannog in Lough Derravaragh) (O' Sullivan et al 2005, fig 42), at Woodstown, Co Waterford (Russell &amp; Harrison 201 1 , illus 49), and at Llanbedrgoch, Anglesey (Redknap 2000, ill 82; 2004, fig 9). A single balance pan (37) from Shanmullagh derives from the kind of beam balance represented in a complete state at Kilmainham/Islandbridge (B0e 1940, fig 32); an unfinished (fixed) beam (36) is also included, apparently an enlarged version of a type with integral pointer found in a 10th-century context at Coppergate, York (Mainman &amp; Rogers 2000, 2560- 61, 2645, fig 1258.10409); and a fragment (272) engraved with a diagonal lozenge pattern could be part of a box for a folding beam and pans, since comparable decoration occurs on the lid of such a container from a 9th-century Norwegian female grave at 0stborg, Nord-Tr0ndelag (Petersen 1940, 165, fig 135). A buckle from Derryoghill (97) compares with an example from Dublin (perhaps from College Green), and both can be compared with an insular buckle from Huseby, near Kaupang, Vestfold, Norway (Warners 2011, 88, fig 4.22. 1,2). Another buckle (100), from Shanmullagh, compares in outline and in the treatment of the tongue-stop with an example from Kilmainham/Islandbridge (B0e 1940, fig 24). Further parallels for strap fittings in the Shanmullagh 25</page><page sequence="3">assemblage form part of the 9th- or 10th-century Viking boat burial from Balladoole in the Isle of Man (see below). The Shanmullagh ingots and ingot fragments are typical of 9th- and 10th-century silver hoards with two exceptions. One is an irregular sub-cruciform ingot (20) that was perhaps intended to be an equal-armed cross. Although its distortion suggests manufacture in a clay or sand mould, the object may be distantly connected with the smaller kind of cross or cross pendant (perhaps with Christian significance) for which a matrix is provided on one face of a stone ingot mould (no 5190) from Knowth, Co Meath (Barton-Murray &amp; Bailey 2012, 531 , 533, fig 7.4:8; pi 7.4: VII).7 The other face of the same mould (ibid) has an oblong matrix with an equal-armed cross incised in the base and will have produced a slightly thinner version of the kind of 'mark' ingot with relief cross that is distinctive of the Cuerdale hoard (Graham- Campbell 2011 , 80-81 , fig 4.6).8 The second exceptional ingot in the Shanmullagh assemblage (22) is identified by John Sheehan (pers comm) as 'of standard Scandinavian type' and appears (at 379.5 grams) to be the heaviest such ingot from Ireland (and probably Britain). The Shanmullagh weights make up the most numerous Irish concentration of such pieces outside Dublin and Woodstown, Co Waterford. Eight weights (375, 377, 383 , 384, 390, 419, 421 , 422) are set with copper-alloy mounts of insular origin and conform to the familiar Viking age type; a further weight (423) set with a coin of Alfred of Wessex is unlocalized but is probably a Shanmullagh find.9 Three other weights show signs of having once carried mounts and have formal counterparts among the decorated examples; the squat sub-pyramid 386 recalls the decorated weight 383 (the taller sub- pyramid 410 with recessed top is also comparable); 398 is round-sectioned with vertical faceting and compares with the decorated weight 375; and 379 is conical and compares, broadly, with the heavier sub- conical decorated weight 384. Three intact decorated weights from Shanmullagh (377, 375, 383) have weights of 6.2, 7.6 and 17.9 grams and probably relate to a standard weight unit or ounce. The unit proposed for the broad-band arm-rings is 26.15 grams (Sheehan 201 1 , 99); that for weights from Woodstown is 22-24 grams (Wallace 2012, 731), and that for weights from Scandinavian Dublin 26.6 grams (ibid). The first of the three Shanmullagh weights approximates to a quarter of the arm-ring and Dublin unit, and the others respectively to a third and to three quarters of the Woodstown unit. Of the plain weights from Shanmullagh three categories are taken to be part of the assemblage, although counterparts remain to be identified in dated contexts. Four (372, 392, 371, 374) are of square section with rounded ends and have weights of 27.2, 27.7, 28.1 and 28.8 grams, perhaps with reference to the Dublin unit. Two domed or bun- shaped examples with basal concavities (400, 402) weigh 17.3 and 17.6 grams, and two others (388, 389) weigh 18.6 and 18.8 grams, perhaps with target weights, respectively, of three quarters of the Woodstown and Dublin units, and three of these weights are almost identical in form. A fifth example of the same shape (391) weighs 80.8 grams, perhaps in approximation to three Dublin units, and compares ostensibly in size and appearance with a weight from Woodstown (O'Brien 2005, pi 24). A further three weights from Shanmullagh (411, 420, 373) are flat-based and square-sectioned and taper slightly to a flat or slightly rounded top. They have weights of 13.2, 13.4 and 15.3 grams, the first two perhaps aiming at half of the Dublin unit, and a similar weight is illustrated among the Woodstown finds (O'Brien 2005, pi 24). The latter has faceted angles, as does a square- sectioned weight (406) in the Shanmullagh group. A total of 27 weights, including a quarter- sphere (380), are taken to belong to the Shanmullagh assemblage in addition to those already referred to. Students of metrology may in time establish other grounds for ascribing them to the Viking age. But their non-ascription, should it be demonstrated, will not take significantly from our characterization of the assemblage overall. All the weights attributed to the Shanmullagh assemblage are listed for ease of reference in Table 1 , together with 423 and the four other weights catalogued here. At least two silver arm-ring fragments (3, 7) and one gold finger-ring (1) from the Shanmullagh assemblage may conform to the weight systems described. The arm-ring fragments, weighing 12 and 11.1 grams respectively, equate to halves of the Woodstown unit of 22-24 grams, and the finger- ring, at 7.4 grams, equates to a third; a silver ingot fragment (18), at 7 grams, falls just short of the same proportion. Viking age silver (and gold) artefacts were characteristically subject to nicking and pecking 'for the purpose of exposing plated forgeries and/or assessing their fineness by a rule-of-thumb hardness tesť (Graham-Campbell 2011, 79). There is clear evidence for the practice on two pieces from the Shanmullagh assemblage. An incomplete ingot (17) is heavily nicked, comparing in this respect with a lighter but comparable ingot from the Cuerdale hoard (ibid, 78-9, 182, no 1:51 , fig 4.5), and the sub- cruciform ingot 20 is nicked in at least two places on its smooth surface. The incomplete ingot weighs 26</page><page sequence="4">63.8 grams, perhaps conforming to the unit of 22-24 grams and representing a 3-unit value. A small boss of silver has been cast on to one end. The total weight of silver ingots and ingot fragments in the assemblage is 862.1 grams, that of silver ornaments and ornament fragments 56.9 grams, and that of other pieces (excluding 24) 21 .4 grams; this amounts to 940.4 grams of silver overall. Insular metalwork ( i) Because, like the Hiberno-Scandinavian silver, the native or insular mounts on the Shanmullagh weights have been fragmented by cutting, the assemblage can be taken to embrace all similar fragments of insular metalwork from this location (some perhaps destined for adaptation as weights) and, by extension, all examples of such metalwork in an unmodified state. The insular material is predominantly of ecclesiastical origin and, as set out below, is further characterized by its similarity to insular metalwork from Norwegian Viking graves. These considerations justify the attribution to the assemblage of a strainer (334) and a hanging-bowl (113). The first is akin to ladles from several burials, including those from Skei, Nord-Tr0ndelag (grave 40), and Steinvik, S0r-Tr0ndelag (Bruce-Mitford 2005, fig 645; Petersen 1940, fig 113a, b),10 the second to bowls from burials at Hoppers tad, Sogn og Fjordane, and Skomrak, Vest-Agder (Bruce- Mitford 2005 , figs 583 , 584, 604). A burial from Trâ, Hordaland, yielded a ladle in combination with a fragmentary bowl that has suspension mounts immediately comparable with those of the Shanmullagh bowl (ibid, figs 538, 539). Parts of tomb- shaped shrines are prominent among the ecclesiastical material, and two shrines are represented by one complete (though distorted) ridge mount (237) and by part of another (220), both of them enamelled. These derive from metal- mounted wooden shrines like that formerly in the Co Limerick collection of Lord Emly (Cone 1977, no 31) and are to be associated with a ring enamelled in the same palette (215); this corresponds to the outer component of the circular mounts of the Emly shrine, and two tapered lengths of C-sectioned moulding from Shanmullagh (174, 190) derive from the hips of the roofs of the same, or similar, shrines. A further fragment (141) is gilt and chip-carved and corresponds in its shape and decoration to the mid- section of the ridge of the all-metal reliquary of insular manufacture in Bologna (Youngs 1989, no 132). Two mounts from further shrines (244, 245) are of undeclared provenance but are probably Shanmullagh finds. A tinned copper-alloy plate from Shanmullagh with incised spiral decoration (282) is best interpreted as one of four derived from a book-shrine or book-cover. The original four evidently fitted around a disc or boss in a pattern reminiscent of a carpet-page of the early 8th-century Lindisfarne Gospels (folio 94v), and the decoration compares with that on the Chi Rho page of the Book of Kells (Alexander 1978, ills 35, 244). Minimum overall dimensions of c 220 x 240mm are implied and those of the lost manuscript can be estimated accordingly. A C-sectioned mount with closed ends (182) is probably too short to have been associated with the same object but compares with those on the vertical angles of the book-shrine from Lough Kinale, Co Longford (Kelly 1993, fig 20.9). Further C-sectioned mounts or mouldings in both cast and sheet copper alloy probably also derive from shrines or book- covers; one piece (172) (now broken and distorted) is 200mm long and mitred at the ends; another (183) has projections at the ends to allow interlocking like some of the mouldings of the Moy lough, Co Sligo, belt-shrine (O'Kelly 1965, 153); two others (180, 186) have an animal head at one end and must derive from the same parent object.11 Two matching L- shaped plates (127, 130; cf 128), are also appropriate to a book-cover or book- shrine. An exceptional cast fragment with birds in high relief (134) was evidently part of a cylinder or cone with a flanged upper edge and flared tabs at the base and might have united the bowl and foot of a chalice like those from Ardagh, Co Limerick, and Derrynaflan, Co Tipperary (Youngs 1989, 160). The birds are reminiscent of that on an insular mount (adapted as a weight) from Kaupang, Vestfold, and their wings forming roll-ended keeled crescents recall the tails of the animals on the better-known mount from Romfojellen, M0re og Romsdal (Pedersen 2008, fig 6.37a; Youngs 1989, no 139). A liturgical dimension is explicitly represented by the strainer from Shanmullagh, already mentioned, which displays an equal-armed cross. The same can be said of a U-shaped mount (277) with an incised frieze of stylized birds, their heads marked by crosses that identify them as peacocks. The peacock is a eucharistie symbol - represented equally schematically in Ireland in some early carvings (Sheehan 2009, 200-03) - and the mount is appropriate to the flap of a satchel some 150mm wide that probably housed a paten of similar diameter. The horns (or 'chalices') from which the birds drink are hatched, curved-sided triangles reminiscent of a repeated detail on one of the engraved, sheet copper- alloy mounts of an insular bucket from the Viking burial already cited from Skei, Nord-Tr0ndelag (Bruce-Mitford 2005, fig 646). A strap-end (347) and openwork encircled cross (269) were found at Shanmullagh in close 27</page><page sequence="5">association with the U-shaped mount and may have belonged to the same satchel. A further piece found separately (140), a curved mount presupposing an external diameter of some 230mm, may have been attached to a paten rim; the tinned mount 258 presupposes an equivalent internal diameter and may derive from the same parent object. The range of ecclesiastical metalwork is further enlarged by a C-shaped and C-sectioned plate of sheet copper alloy (108). This is best interpreted as one of an original pair from the crook of a crozier, although its out-turned edges are unparalleled in complete examples. Also identifiable as part of a crozier is half of a cast, biconical knop (109); this compares in its relative simplicity with those of the intact crozier from the River Bann at Toome, Co Antrim (Henry 1967, pi 52). Plausibly part of the same crozier is a cast ferrule (111) that matches the knop in diameter. Two further exceptional pieces are a miniature quadrangular bell of cast copper alloy (39) and an inscribed cross-arm (107). The bell, which matches closely its full-size counterparts, may have been attached to an animal and/or may have had a talismanic function. The cross-arm, a heavy bar of solid section bearing the inscription SCS PAULUS and an incised image of St Paul, appears to have been treated as an ingot in the context of the Shanmullagh assemblage. It will be clear from the foregoing that the ecclesiastical metalwork from Shanmullagh derives in the main from larger pieces with a multiplicity of component parts. Further detached parts, less easily ascribed to identifiable parent objects, are present in large numbers and equal in quality to those already described. Insular metalwork (ii) The range of enamelled patterns includes angular C- (or U-), L-, S-, T- and Z- shaped cells; there are several versions of the cruciform including, in two cases (240, 241), a swastika, and some curved elements are incorporated. A round boss from Shanmullagh (247) is 50mm in diameter and appropriate in scale to ( inter alia ) a book-shrine like the 8th-century example, already mentioned, from Lough Kinale (Kelly 1993, fig 20.1). Two pieces can be considered in tandem - one (229) with an angular, reversed S-shaped cell, the other (225) with the remains of a row of lozenges between triangles. S-shaped cells and a comparable lozenge pattern recur on the insular terminal - perhaps from a drinking-horn rather than a crozier - from Helgö, Uppland (Sweden) (Youngs 1989, no 147). The knop of the Helgö terminal is also recalled by the patterns on two mounts, one oblong (227) and the other trapezoidal (236). Two further pieces from Shanmullagh (208, 242) differ in shape but share the same palette and patination and must be from the same parent object. Enamelled zoomorphic ornament is rare in insular metalwork but is represented by a single piece from Shanmullagh (214) showing the hindquarters of a profile animal. Whole animals, which differ in their essentials, are otherwise represented in enamel only on the Co Antrim cross, on a brooch fragment from Co Westmeath, and on a mount from Aberdour Castle, Fife (Bourke &amp; Close- Brooks 1989). Non-representational curvilinear patterns, likewise rare overall in 8th-century enamels, are found on several pieces - three with simple interlace (206, 209, 243), one with a diagonal cross (211), one with a scroll (228), and one with a variant of a Z-based key pattern (207). Two further pieces form a pair and must be from the same parent object; one (216) has a reserved pattern of fine-line interlace, the other (219) an S-scroll made up of two spirals joined by trumpet curves. Although neither is paralleled in insular enamelling, such patterns are well represented in other media; three variants of the second pattern appear on the paten and stand from Derrynaflan in die-stamped gilt silver, gold filigree and polychrome glass (Ryan 1983a, colour pis 8, 10, 14). The palette of enamels consists largely of yellow and red (typically decolourized), but there is blue enamel on 234 and 247 and green enamel on 214 and 220; a black material on 141 and 202 has all the appearance of niello, although it remains to be analyzed. The yellow varies in superficial appearance; for the most part a dull matt, it is glassy and lustrous on 21 1 , itself a piece that stands out for its dark patination. The limited range of millefiori patterns is typical of insular metalwork conventionally dated to the 8th century. The nine-unit chequer appears in a variety of combinations; the colours are dark blue and white, and in one instance (224) dark blue and light green. Quatrefoils are well represented in dark blue and white; a further pattern, represented only by 210, consists of four white triangles in a matrix of dark blue. Millefiori is confined within cells on 213 and 239; it floats in red enamel on 208 and in yellow enamel on 232. An enamelled stud (212) compares with studs on the back of the 'Tara' brooch, although the latter differ in the manner of their manufacture and their colours are differently arranged (Haseloff 1990, Abb 129b). However, the relevance of the comparison is borne out by the discovery at Shanmullagh of a chip- carved, spiral-decorated boss (158) that compares in 28</page><page sequence="6">both motif and treatment with the cast ornament on the back of the 'Tara' brooch and is of equally high quality. Another cut, chip-carved fragment (142) bears a profile animal akin to those on the 'Tara' brooch and part of another apparently in mirror symmetry; the whole can be reconstructed as a mount appropriate to a corner position resembling the well-known example that probably formed part of a 9th- or 10th-century Viking burial from the Phoenix Park, Dublin (Hall 1974, fig 1). Another chip-carved piece (160) has an accomplished key- pattern and is further embellished by hatched triangles on the face of the original edge. A round, chip-carved boss from Moy (138) is 63mm in diameter and thus the largest of its kind among the Blackwater finds. Though recovered downstream of the Shanmullagh concentration, it is appropriate to the assemblage in terms of form and decoration and, significantly, in terms of comparanda from Norwegian Viking age graves; robust mounts from 9th-century women's burials at Eide, M0re og Romsdal, and Spildra, Nordland, incorporate roundels that are essentially the same (Warners 1985, Taf 25.2, 26.2). Metal-mounted wooden buckets are represented in the Shanmullagh assemblage by numerous pieces of thin, undecorated sheet binding (59-73), by several handles (75-80) and by several mounts to which handles were attached (83, 85-94). All are attributed to the assemblage because one of the handles from Corr and Dunavally (78) has been treated characteristically as scrap, being bent double and cut through the grip, and because of the incidence of similar buckets in Norwegian Viking age graves. Three suspension mounts from Shanmullagh (89-91) were initially understood to derive from hanging-bowls (Bourke 1993b, 33), and were so interpreted by Bruce-Mitford (2005, nos 166-68). But they are best identified (together with 93 and 94) as bucket mounts, since they depart from the rectangular, sub-circular and sub-triangular forms typical of bowls and tend towards an equal-armed, cruciform shape, like the mounts of a bucket from a female burial at Halsan, Nord Tr0ndelag (Petersen 1940, fig 114), and of a bucket from the River Glyde near Annagassan, Co Louth (Raftery 1956, 396), and like detached mounts from Gull Island crannog in Lough Derravaragh (O' Sullivan et al 2007, fig 30. 1984: 143), 12 and from Crossreagh East, Co Derry (May &amp; Batty 1948, fig 7.17). Unlike hanging-bowl mounts, the hooks of these mounts form an inverted U, and the incomplete or lost hooks of the five Blackwater pieces were presumably similar. The latter are, besides, matched in form by those that unambiguously belonged to buckets, eg 88, having pierced projections at the top to attach the handle.13 A second form of bucket mount, unlike the cruciform type, is sub-triangular (see 74 below) and directly comparable with the mounts of several bowls (eg Bruce-Mitford 2005, figs 525, 534, 543, 568 etc); only the profile of the hook and perhaps the overall degree of curvature permit differentiation between the two series. A third form of bucket mount is exemplified by 83, which is strip-like and parallel-sided but for an expansion at the base of the hook.14 Two other pieces (85, 87) are identified as bucket mounts by analogy since the form seems to be unattested on bowls. Insular metalwork (iii) That brooches form part of the Shanmullagh assemblage is evidenced by three fragments - a pin-head (51), a terminal (50), and what is probably the leading edge of another terminal (44). The pin- head is crushed and may have been detached by cutting, and the other two pieces were certainly so detached. Their presence supports the attribution to the assemblage of one complete brooch (48) and of part of another of related type (45), both of them from Shanmullagh, and the attribution is further supported by the recovery of a comparable brooch from a 9th-century Norwegian female grave at Smulan, Nord-Tr0ndelag (Warners 1985, Taf 36.3). The detached pin-head 5 1 is of some interest in that it derives from a Group D zoomorphic penannular brooch of probable 7th-century date and is thus the earliest identifiable piece in the whole assemblage. The detached terminal 50 compares with the terminals of a brooch found downstream at Borough of Charlemont, Co Armagh (42); two other brooches from Cos Cavan and Antrim (the latter pseudo- penannular) are related (Youngs 1989, nos 191, 192). The common characteristics of all four pieces define a regional type that contributed to the development of the bossed penannular brooch in the late 9th century. The pseudo-penannular brooch 53 from Shanmullagh and three other brooch fragments (47, 49, 52) are appropriate to the assemblage in date and type and are probably to be associated with it. A further brooch of 9th-century type (46) is one of a small number of pieces from Moy and among the farthest removed from the Shanmullagh concentration. However, while its exclusion does not change the character of the assemblage, its inclusion is justified in view of its date and its recovery in relatively close proximity both to the large boss 138, already referred to, and to a distinctively cut fragment (139), both of which are independently attributable to the Shanmullagh assemblage. Indeed, given that the overall distribution is discontinuous, 29</page><page sequence="7">the Moy pieces can be taken to represent a secondary concentration. The chip-carved fragment 132, reportedly from Borough of Charlemont, was found even further downstream from Shanmullagh but is equally appropriate to the asemblage; the piece has been cut and shows a profile animal resembling those on the 9th-century brooch from Killamery, Co Kilkenny (Youngs 1989, no 80). Ringed pins and brooch-pins are represented by several examples, including a ringed pin from Derryoghill (298) of the spiral-ringed, baluster- headed type that appears to have been in use between the 7th and 9th centuries. That if formed part of the assemblage - although not demonstrable - is not unlikely, given the identification as such of the early pin-head already referred to. Another pin (300) from the same townland, perhaps part of the assemblage, is of the loop-headed type typical of the Viking age but seemingly unique in that the ring has a flattened and expanded facet and looks like a finger-ring. The attribution to the assemblage of some other brooch-pins and detached rings (287-89, 292) is justified by the recovery at Shanmullagh of 291 , a ring that appears to be unworn and may even be unfinished, since a flat projection is unpierced and non-functional (but cf 285); unworn or unfinished pieces are apparently characteristic of the Shanmullagh assemblage (see below). Perhaps also to be included is part of a distinctive pin (311), consisting of a disc conjoined with an animal head and now broken across a hole that probably held a ring; parallels are a series of disc- and spatulate- headed ringed pins (the latter probably styli) (Armstrong 1922, pis xiv: fig 1.1, 2; xii: fig 1.3, 5, 7). Workshop practice Evidence for workshop practice is most conspicuous in the multiplicity of small fragments created by cutting and breaking, in ingots of lead, silver and copper alloy, and in a copper-alloy object (35) perhaps to be identified as an anvil. Cut surfaces are clean and suggest the use either of axes or of hammers and chisels; marks in the lead ingot 369 look like axe cuts and there is no evidence for sawing. A C-sectioned mount or moulding (172) has been in part flattened by hammering, and gilding has been scraped from the chip-carved fragment 153. Three pieces of run and solidified silver (32-4), two silver droplets (25, 26), and a piece of slag (331) (source yet to be identified) are further evidence for metal working. Two non-metallic pieces catalogued here because essential to the assemblage are a cupel (429) and a crucible fragment (428). Comparando 15 Comparanda for the Shanmullagh hanging-bowl 113 and wine-strainer 334, for the high-relief fragment 134, and for the brooches 45 and 48, have been identified in Viking age graves in Norway, and the Helg0 (Sweden) terminal has been advanced as a parallel for several of the enamel patterns in the assemblage. The Norwegian evidence is further recalled by several other pieces. The openwork mount 266 compares with an example from the early 9th-century grave already referred to at Skei, Nord- Tr0ndelag (although the latter piece, unlike the former, has integral lugs) (Graham-Campbell 2001 , 32, fig 3.5); the grave was richly furnished with a variety of insular material. The enamelled plaque 232 compares in motif and treatment with the bodies of the anthropomorphic mounts on the well-known Oseberg bucket, deposited in the 830s (Henry 1965, pi 91), and the heads on the same mounts compare with a human mask on one of the Shanmullagh weights (421); common features include the treatment of the mouth and hair (which is represented on the flat upper surfaces of the Oseberg mounts) and the continuous nose and eyebrows. The Shanmullagh weight is separately to be compared with a weight from Woodstown that likewise incorporates a face (Russell &amp; Harrison 20 1 1 , illus 49). Another Shanmullagh piece, the disc- shaped, lugged mount 241, bears an enamelled key pattern incorporating a swastika (as does the smaller and lighter pierced disc 240) in an arrangement that occurs in mirror image and in the same palette on two insular mounts from Norway, one from the market site of Kaupang, Vestfold (Haseloff 1990, Abb 159), the other (adapted as a weight) from a 9th- century male burial at Kvistad, M0re og Romsdal (Warners 1985, Taf 9). 16 Yet more striking is the comparison between the chip-carved mount 157 and a piece from a 9th-century burial at Sande, Sogn og Fjordane (Warners 1985, Taf 26 .4);17 the two share the same distinctive shape and bear comparable interlace patterns. The condition of 157 is so fine as to suggest that it was never used, a suggestion borne out by the absence of gilding and of any trace of residue in the central setting, as well as by the presence of a pilot pit for a perforation in the lug. The pieces are probably harness fittings, given their general similarity to the mounts in the Norwegian grave assemblages from Gausel and Soma, Rogaland, and to those in the group from Navan, Co Meath, which may also have furnished a Viking grave (Warners 1985, Taf 20; Youngs 1989, nos 114, 113). The Shanmullagh piece was evidently new when lost or deposited c 900, and that such mounts were being made in the late 9th century is thus 30</page><page sequence="8">beyond reasonable doubt. In view of their insular workmanship, the presence of a newly manufactured example in the Shanmullagh assemblage raises the possibility that the bearer made the object himself and was a practitioner in both the 'insular' and the 'Hiberno- Scandinavian' traditions. This accords with the similarity pointed out by Raghnall Ó Floinn (1986, 107) between insular ladles (and strainers) made of sheet copper alloy and boss-ended shield grips made of the same material, one of which - together with a ladle - is among the finds from a late 9th- or early 10th-century Viking burial at Ballinaby, Islay (see also Graham-Campbell &amp; Batey 1998, 124). It accords equally with the evidence of bossed brooches of Johansen 's subgroup F (Johansen 1973, 105, 109-12; Graham-Campbell 1975, 45-6; Bourke 2012), which are the outcome of 'contact and interaction between the Hiberno- Scandinavian and native Irish silver-working traditions' (Graham-Campbell &amp; Sheehan 2009, 85). There is further evidence that work in progress was interrupted with the loss or deposition of the Shanmullagh metalwork in the condition of one of the two gold finger-rings (2); the ring is a plain and unworn band and was perhaps designed to take stamped ornament like its Islandbridge counterpart. There is another pointer to the overlapping or elision of styles in the presence of the weathered enamelled mount 234. Despite the loss of its edge, this is of a distinctive type that matches an example from the late 9th- or early 10th-century Viking burial at Balladoole in the Isle of Man, as well as an unstratified find from a crannog at Newtownlow, Co Westmeath (Graham-Campbell 1986, illus 4,5). The Balladoole mount was associated with and probably belonged to a set of harness mounts, some of which have counterparts in the Shanmullagh material. Strap-distributors from Balladoole made up of parallel bars and terminals on the same alignment allow the Shanmullagh fragment 339 to be identified; retaining one round terminal and the stub of one bar, the piece is especially close to one of the three from Balladoole (Bersu &amp; Wilson 1966, pi vi .A). The Balladoole group also includes an openwork pendant (ibid, pi vi.B), and an analogous piece (336) from Shanmullagh probably served the same function. This is an openwork casting with the stubs of a bar between twin terminals with which a strap-end originally engaged; that the piece is correctly identified is confirmed by the presence of a variant among a set of unprovenanced harness- mounts in the Ulster Museum.18 A further Shanmullagh piece, the copper- alloy belt-buckle 101, is paralleled by a fragmentary iron example from Balladoole (ibid, fig 12.c). Unenamelled harness mounts from Balladoole and Kiloran Bay (Bersu &amp; Wilson 1966, pis v-vii) can be associated on stylistic grounds with a group of buckles and other belt fittings from Scandinavian graves in Scotland that have been attributed to Hiberno-Scandinavian production centres, Dublin included (Paterson 2001, 130-31). The enamelled mount from Balladoole, and its counterparts from Shanmullagh and elsewhere, may well have been made in a similar milieu of mixed stylistic ancestry. The Shanmullagh assemblage thus marks a point on the axis of communication between Ireland and Scandinavia and simultaneously straddles the division between the insular and the Hiberno- Scandinavian. Worth noting in this connection is a buckle plate from Shanmullagh (103) made from a folded copper-alloy sheet and decorated with dot- and-circle motifs arranged (reading transversely) in irregular lines of three. Despite its simplicity, comparison is possible with a silver strip from an unstratified context associated with a Norse house of late 9th- or early 10th-century date at Drimore, South Uist (MacLaren 1974, fig 2; pi 2). The strip is unfolded and thinner than the Shanmullagh piece but is almost exactly the same size and similarly decorated. Weapons Viking weapons from the Blackwater, although not catalogued here, are listed in an appendix and are essential to the interpretation of the non-ferrous metalwork. An armed Viking presence is demonstrated by discoveries at a minimum of six locations, including the adjoining townlands of Shanmullagh and Corr and Dunavally. The two have been considered as one for present purposes, and weapons from both townlands could be construed on this basis as part of the Shanmullagh assemblage; they could, alternatively, be seen as separate losses in the context of contemporary Viking activity in the Blackwater corridor. The pieces are parts of sword- hilts of Petersen Type H and Type X, two axe-heads (Bourke 2001a, nos 13, 19), as well as a chape that is catalogued here (106). Weapons are absent from Viking silver hoards, but the Shanmullagh assemblage, as we have seen, differs in character from such hoards and there can be no certainty that weapons are not included. One or both of the axe- heads might be admitted, since many constituents of the assemblage have been cleanly cut. An iron manacle from Corr and Dunavally - closed by a barrel padlock and with part of a chain attached (UM A5165) - is likely to be connected with weapons from the same place if not with the Shanmullagh assemblage. 31</page><page sequence="9">Conclusions The insular metalwork in the Shanmullagh assemblage compares in quality with the best that has survived and reference has been made both to the Tara' brooch and to the paten and chalice from Derrynaflan. The range of enamels includes motifs not otherwise known in this medium and enlarges our understanding of 8th-century Irish metal working. Patronage is implicit in such production and that this was largely ecclesiastical is a necessary conclusion. The styles and techniques are those of the wider insular world and there is little evidence for local emphasis, although one 9th- century brooch terminal (50) belongs, it seems, to a northern type ancestral to the bossed penannular series. Viking age silver hoards fall into three basic categories: coin hoards, coinless hoards and mixed hoards.19 The Shanmullagh assemblage is allied in type and, like many coinless and mixed hoards, it includes a 'hack-silver' component. Coins are lacking from the assemblage, but individual pieces are paralleled in several hoards and in grave-groups from Kilmainham/Islandbridge, the Isle of Man, Colonsay, Norway and Brittany. However, the Shanmullagh assemblage is exceptional in combining silver and gold with insular ecclesiastical metalwork. The unfinished finger-ring 2 is evidence for gold- working; unfinished copper- alloy pieces (36, 157, 291) are indicative of casting; and plain and decorated lead weights, lead ingots, and cut and broken insular pieces are evidence for weight making. Such evidence is not combined in any other single assemblage, although there are many parallels among broadly contemporary finds from Woodstown, Co Waterford, a Viking settlement on the south bank of the River Suir, and from Torksey, Lincolnshire, where the Viking 'Great Army' spent the winter of 872/873. 20 Silver ingots and ornaments are represented at Woodstown by cut fragments, and there is evidence for metalworking and specifically for weight making in the presence of finished weights and of cut and broken insular pieces used in their embellishment (O'Brien 2005; Russell &amp; Harrison 2011, 63-64; Wallace forthcoming). The Woodstown material was deposited over time in a Viking settlement on dry land, whereas the Shanmullagh finds, as verified by excavation, derive exclusively from drainage spoil and had been deposited, presumably in one event, in the River Blackwater. Nevertheless a common cultural background is indicated. The non-association of the Shanmullagh material with any recognizable Viking settlement (indeed any settlement) does not mean that such sites are absent from the Blackwater corridor, and they may coincide with the sites of later fortifications. The Mullan Fort in Tullydowey, Co Tyrone, a hilltop platform on the edge of the river just 2km upstream from Shanmullagh (SMR TYR 062:001; IGR H83950 51740), was described c 1602 by the Elizabethan map-maker Richard Bartlett as 'the new fort' (Hayes-McCoy 1964, 5, 14). However, the site might have been refortified rather than built by Lord Mountjoy the previous year; that it is immediately adjacent to the early church of Clonfeacle, Co Tyrone - a possible source for some of the Shanmullagh metalwork - recalls the conjunction of a Viking longphort and an ecclesiastical site at Annagassan, or Linn Duachaill, Co Louth.21 Equally close to Clonfeacle, in Drumderg, Co Tyrone, lay a riverside fort built by Hugh O'Neill c 1595 (SMR TYR 062:012; IGR H83990 52420) which, Hayes- McCoy suggests (1964, 14, n 7), is designated by the term 'hälfe moone' on a contemporary plan. This might refer to the kind of D- shaped enclosure characteristic of Viking longphuirt , including Annagassan and Woodstown, if it is allowed that O'Neill refortified an older site. The riverside position of both Blackwater forts compares with that of a mound (Dunhin) at Shane's Castle Park, Co Antrim (SMR ANT 049:034; IGR J09630 87500); the latter monument abuts the River Main immediately above its junction with Lough Neagh and may be connected with the site named in the Annals of Ulster in 930 as Ruba Mena ('the point of the Main'), a base used by Vikings on Lough Neagh.22 A Viking presence beside the Blackwater is certainly indicated by the discovery before 1908 of a typical sword at Legar Hill, a hilltop graveyard overlooking the river in Corr and Dunavally (Neill 2009, no 29 1)^ It is suggested by Stephen Harrison and Raghnall Ó Floinn (forthcoming) that the sword derives from a male grave and that Legar Hill is the site of an early medieval church or burial ground. Additional potentially relevant evidence consists of iron boat rivets and human bones. Rivets have been found in concentration both in the vicinity of the Callan/Blackwater confluence and at Derryloughan near the junction of the Blackwater with Lough Neagh. Most are fitted with the diamond- shaped roves that are typical of (though not unique to) Viking boat building. Human remains (though of unknown date) are represented by a skull from Shanmullagh and by part of a skull and a concentration of bones from Derrycaw.23 Setting aside the issue of settlements, which only future excavation will resolve, the loss or deposition of the Shanmullagh assemblage remains to be explained. It seems certain, at least, that the material was not ritually deposited, an explanation that James 32</page><page sequence="10">Graham-Campbell and John Sheehan (2009) have recently suggested might apply to some hoards from wetland locations. The known assemblage must be less - perhaps a lot less - than what was originally lost, which was conceivably the entire contents of a temporary workshop that was swept away by a flash flood. The analogy of the Cuerdale hoard, buried beside the River Ribble, allows for the further possibility that the original Shanmullagh assemblage, if imagined as the contents of one container, was hidden (perhaps buried) beside the Blackwater, was never recovered and was ultimately washed into the river. However, the simplest and best explanation is that the material was in transit and that the bearer had an accident either while travelling on the Blackwater or while crossing it. He may have misjudged the conditions at a ford that lay immediately upstream of Shanmullagh and Derryoghill; this was defended by Hugh O'Neill c 1600, as Richard Bartlett further recorded, and a concentration of Bronze Age finds in the immediate area vouches for its antiquity (Ramsey et al 1992, 148-49). Although the exact circumstances are beyond recovery, there is a potential context for the deposition of the Shanmullagh assemblage in the record of events preserved in the Annals of Ulster. Armagh, which lies just 9km south-east of Shanmullagh, was raided by Vikings from Dublin in 895 and 921; others maintained a fleet on Lough Neagh in 928 and 930 and their base was at Ruba Mena in the latter year. Two silver hoards found close to the Blackwater point to a wider Viking involvement in the area. One, from Emy, Co Monaghan, consists of broad-band arm-rings and might be contemporary with the Shanmullagh assemblage (Sheehan 1998, 201). The other, discovered near Tynan, Co Armagh, includes such arm-rings as well as examples of the 'ring-money' characteristic of Scandinavian Scotland and might be of mid- 10th-century date (ibid, 198). A third hoard consisting of two 'ring monies' was found by turf-cutters 'near to Armagh' in 1832 but is today unaccounted for (ibid; Sotheby et al 1913, 67, lot 460). I described the Shanmullagh assemblage in 1993 as 'the stock-in-trade of a Hiberno- Viking metalworker who met with misadventure on the river [Blackwater] towards the end of the ninth century' (Bourke 1993b, 24). The description holds good, although a slightly earlier or later date would be equally appropriate, and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries. Whether, as originally suggested, the ecclesiastical elements were obtained largely in Armagh is a moot point but remains a possibility. THE NON-SHANMULLAGH MATERIAL An early and important piece in this category, from Maghery, Co Armagh, is a copper- alloy brooch-pin (286) with tinned ring with openwork pseudo- terminals; these incorporate trumpets with dot-punched outlines and with triangular recesses marked by hatching in two directions.24 The trumpets recall details of the Clonmore shrine, specifically the trumpets flanking the roundel on the upper front plate, and the hatched triangles are duplicated on the front plates of its Bobbio counterpart, where they touch the ends of the central oblong frames (Bourke 2002, pis 1,4). Thus, in stylistic terms, the pin is pivotal between the two shrines; all three pieces can be attributed to a single 'ornament horizon' that flourished in the 7th century and probably under Armagh patronage. Further pieces relate in date or character to the Shanmullagh assemblage. The remains of a bucket (74) from Borough of Charlemont, Co Armagh, include sub-triangular mounts and fragments of copper-alloy binding that exhibit small but characteristic elements of the kind of bird or animal ornament seen on buckets conventionally taken to be Northumbrian. Strands set radially to a spiral on the Charlemont fragments match equivalent details of the bucket already mentioned from Skei, Nord- Tr0ndelag, and of that from Birka, Uppland (Sweden) (Graham-Campbell 2001, figs 3.3, 3.4). This reopens the question of the origin of insular buckets found in Scandinavia and establishes for the first time that examples with inhabited vine scroll (or its derivatives) were used and presumably made in Ireland. However, given the small size of the Charlemont fragments, it is impossible to say whether they derive from a classic or a provincial version of the type. Also potentially contemporary with the deposition of the assemblage is a mount (253) from Derry mago wan, Co Armagh, which derives from the mouth of a horn, presumably a drinking-horn, given that one or other of two terminals (250, 251) might have been associated with it. The mount is unique in Ireland and its decoration of bosses and incised interlace recalls the bossed penannular brooches of the late 9th and early 10th centuries. An undecorated horn mount from a 7th-century burial at Little Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire (Kennett 1971 , fig 3. a), is comparable in formal terms, as is an 11th-century mount decorated in the Ringerike style from Ârhus, Jutland, which has bosses on projections from the lower edge and, like the Derry mago wan mount, has a beaded fillet below the rim (Fuglesang 1980, no 36, pi 19.B, C). Bosses also adorn the otherwise dissimilar 9th-century silver horn mount from Burghead, Morayshire (Graham-Campbell 1973). 33</page><page sequence="11">All three pieces are smaller in diameter than the Derry mago wan mount. Although their scale cannot be judged, mounts that are at least comparable in outline are shown on two horns depicted on a 10th- century cross-slab from Kilmorie on Loch Ryan, Wigtownshire (now at Kirkcolm); these have diagonal cross-hatching denoting all-over decoration (Allen &amp; Anderson 1903, 482-83, fìg 514.B; see also Graham-Campbell &amp; Batey 1998, 251-52). Several pieces appropriate to the Shanmullagh assemblage were found some 8km away near Lough Neagh and must be contemporary losses. These include a miniature rod arm-ring of silver (14) and two pieces of broad-band arm-rings (5, 6). The weight of the rod arm-ring is 8.7 grams and that of the larger fragment (6) is 13.2 grams (the latter weight matching that of the Shanmullagh weight 411); the two pieces could refer, respectively, to a third and to a half of the Dublin weight unit. Two fittings from tomb-shaped shrines, both with hinge loops (135, 203), come from the same area. Perhaps of the mid- 10th century is a polygonal, copper-alloy pendant bell (38) from Derrycaw, Co Armagh, a provincial Viking type represented in graves at Peel Castle in the Isle of Man and in Iceland. The type is well known in Britain, and examples from Ireland (other than Derrycaw) have recently been cited by Johnson and Barton-Murray (2012) in discussing an example from the eastern tomb at Knowth, Co Meath, which was probably part of a necklace.25 Ringed pins are represented inter alia by an outstanding example (296) from Clonmore, Co Tyrone, which is 324mm long and one of the longest ringed pins in the Irish record. The only certainly identified stick pin in the catalogue (317), from Borough of Charlemont, has a head in the form of an animal head that compares with those on some 10th- and 11th-century kite brooches (Whitfield 1997, pis 40 .a, 41 .b, 43 .a, b). Two variants from the same townland and from Derryoghill take the form of snakes and are here termed spiral pins (315,316); scales are suggested by the conjunction of two zigzag grooves and their pointed ends are appropriate to dress-fasteners.26 Their spiral form recalls the spiral wires with similarly pointed ends attached, apparently for security, to some 7th- century latchets and brooches, and they may have been fastened by turning. The incised zigzag or 'rocked graver' ornament, in which each constituent line is slightly curved, compares with that on some 11th-century stick pins, including an example from the coastal sandhills at Ballyness, Co Donegal (PI 3)27 (cf Raftery et al 1968, nos 328, 340; Raftery 1970, no 61); the Blackwater pieces are likely to be contemporary, as is a belt buckle from Ballyness that bears similar decoration (Knowles 1891 , pi xxiv.l).28 CONCLUSIONS The material presented in this paper illuminates the story of early medieval metalworking in the north- east of Ireland and specifically in Armagh and its hinterland. There is evidence throughout for ecclesiastical patronage and for the proliferation of shrines, book-covers, vessels and other accessories in some 8th- and 9th-century churches. The Shanmullagh assemblage embodies much of this evidence, as well as evidence for the processing of insular metal work for Scandinavian consumption. Comparable insular material, as we have seen, is known from 9th- and 10th-century contexts in several southern and western counties of Norway. The evidence of the assemblage is amplified by that of Viking weapons from the Blackwater, including several spear-heads (unpublished), several axe-heads (previously published) and at least a dozen swords (see appendix). The latter, although all but one are represented by fragments, make up the largest Irish group outside the cemeteries of Viking Dublin. It may be possible in the future to relate these discoveries to a Viking settlement, as yet unidentified, either in the Blackwater corridor or the Lough Neagh basin. 34</page><page sequence="12">CATALOGUE The catalogue is divided by material and by class. Classes are arranged alphabetically, and objects are listed alphabetically by provenance (ie townland)29 and then in the order of their Ulster Museum accession (A) or recorded specimen (RS) number, other than four un-numbered specimens described as in private possession. Asterisks attached to RS numbers denote specimens housed in the Ulster Museum at the time of writing (October 2012). Catalogue numbers in square brackets are those of objects known to me from photographs only; townland names in square brackets are attributions supplied by me for objects of undeclared provenance on the basis of my own understanding and of information received from third parties. A minority of pieces are unlocalized other than to the broad catchment of the localized material. Objects are assigned to class according to their dominant characteristics for convenience and ease of reference, and alternative classifications might easily be applied in many cases. With important exceptions, unless they are described as cast, objects should be understood to have been produced by cold-working in combination with annealing and quenching. The exceptions are chip-carved mounts, enamelled mounts, buckle frames, and the rings of ring-brooches and (with some identified exceptions) ringed pins, together with most if not all of the lead weights, all of which were cast, and the manner of their production is therefore not specified in individual entries. Buckle tongues and the pins of brooches, together with ringed pins (except their rings), are to be understood to have been made by cold- working unless otherwise stated. Comparative material additional to that already mentioned is cited in the catalogue in a few cases, as are published references to individual pieces.30 Dimensions are given in millimetres and weights are given in grams. Figures in square brackets are estimates. The term 'lug' refers exclusively to projections from basal or obverse surfaces.

The two survive to their original height and have an internal groove to receive the base; the rim is flat-topped and defined by a horizontal groove externally. The external surface is divided into four horizontal zones by differential weathering or patination; the width of the upper three is 40-50mm and that of the lowermost 11mm. The zones reflect the former presence of two copper-alloy bindings of approximately equal width that left a central zone and the basal edge exposed. Part of the upper binding is trapped under a hooked mount that remains in situ on the smaller piece, and a projecting fragment (now detached) bears an incised pattern consisting of a spiral crossed and overlapped alternately by divergent pairs of radial strands that spring from a central roundel. A similar pattern survives on one of two detached ends of what is presumably the same binding; the other preserves elements of a spiral (in part detached) with single radii in the angles and is prolonged by a plain strip that formed an original edge. The nature of the first pattern determines the orientation of both pieces, given the presence of differential coloration which suggests that they overlapped; a lack of correspondence between nail-holes can be attributed to the two having sprung apart. The hooked mount is a sub-triangular casting with a hollow boss at each angle, the lowermost prolonged by a wedge-shaped tail. The hook grips the rim and traps a fragment of a sheet that 40</page><page sequence="18">lined the upper edge internally, presumably (by analogy) part of a hollow binding enclosing the rim rather than a strip that left the rim exposed (although the rim is now exposed within the hook). The mount is secured by two nails on the long axis with slightly expanded heads internally. The hook engages a hole in the rounded and flattened end of a handle of rectangular section, now broken at the point of expansion for the grip; fine grooves outline the long edges. A second, loose mount (A59.1990) matches the first. The upper nail is in situ and the piece is broken in two above the lowermost boss. The original hook is lost and has been replaced with a strip inserted behind the stub of the original; this projects for only 5.8mm, lacks a hook and must itself be truncated. The strip is held by a nail that penetrated the bucket wall and served additionally to secure the mount itself. The bindings 55 and 56 (A6499 and A6500) were found in the same area but are seemingly unconnected with the present specimen.

The grip is marked with two outline Xs and by a framing line on one edge. There are groups of transverse grooves at each end of the grip, above the ring terminal and midway between. Such grooves are barely perceptible centrally on the shorter arm; their vestigial presence is consistent with this arm, which is wider and thinner than the other, having been drawn out by hammering and finished in a loop following the loss of the original terminal ring.

The neck is defined by two holes and the tail is partly lost with the adjacent edge. An incision furrows the brow of the human mask and another forms the mouth, but the prominence of the nose, and the prominent cell walls, indicate manufacture by casting.

An inner pair encloses pairs of arcs that form vesicae stippled with fine pits. The inner field is quartered by an incised cross; its centre is the compass pit and there is a pit at the end of each arm. An overlap reveals that the arcs were incised after the cross, and the cross itself cuts the inner circles.

Cf the tongue of the buckle 97 (A5777). 97 BUCKLE Derryoghill A5777; Fig 11 The frame is D-shaped and roughly D- sectioned. An abraded projection from the tongue-stop has a raised rim and central pit and appears to be a stud setting; there is a smaller, more boss-like projection from each angle, each with a central pit. The tongue is cast; the distal half, the tongue proper tapers to a differentiated and up-turned tip, now truncated, and springs from between the ears of a rudimentary animal head that is continuous with a rounded expansion at the other end. A hooked projection from the back engages the frame. L frame 47.0; L tongue 35.3.

A pierced bridge engages the tongue and a slight waist is marked by two lateral projections. The plate is a square field with a cross-of-arcs in yellow enamel; there are traces of contrasting enamel in a central cell and in the cells of the defining quadrilobe. A pierced lug springs from the back of the bridge and presumably served to secure a strap. Longer perpendicular projections from the plate with stepped outlines and pierced ends have been interpreted as 'an arrangement probably designed to hold a second strap' (Youngs 1997, 205). The tongue is a short strip with a pointed, up-turned tip. L33.0; W 12.4.

The legend SCS PAULUS ( Sanctus Paulus', St Paul) is incised on one face together with a bust-length image of the saint. The letters are irregular serifed capitals arranged in two lines; the serifs are either relatively straight or V-shaped, and the final U resembles an O through the coalescence of its serifs with that on the descender of the P. The bust, looking to the left, is an impressionistic sketch in three-quarter perspective. The eyes are stamped circles, a pointed chin suggests a beard and an arc around the head may be a halo. An open, square necked garment is depicted and paired lines on the shoulders are suggestive of straps or bands; further lines above the sinister shoulder suggest long hair. It is consistent with the identification of the piece as a cross-arm that the figure looks left or towards the centre of the cross; the name and image of St Peter were presumably incised on the corresponding arm.

HANGING-BOWLS 113 HANGING-BOWL Shanmullagh (one fragment Derryoghill) A50.1990; Fig 14 Now reconstructed, the bowl was acquired in the form of eleven unequal fragments, together with two cast mounts, each broken in two; the third mount was in situ on one of the larger pieces. Parts of the vessel are unaccounted for, but RS2010.8.57* (which is not catalogued separately) is probably one of them. The bowl was raised from a single sheet. There is a slight omphalos in the base and either lathe- finishing or laying-out from the centre is attested by a central hole; the rim is in-turned above a shallow concavity. The three mounts were attached by pairs of rivets, the surviving pair being dome-headed internally. Best described as ornithomorphic, each mount consists of a sub-circular plate with a hooked projection that suggests a head with differentiated neck and beak. The springing of the hook is C-sectioned and the head is offset from the neck in an inverted V. The beak has a flat underside and overlies, or oversails, the rim. The upper surface is softly keeled. Two small projections flanked by two larger at the base of each plate suggest the tail and/or the tips of folded wings. In one case the beak is lost and the head is pierced by a secondary rivet, while the broken edge is notched as though from a failed drilling or a previous repair. There is a corresponding hole in the rim. The rim is pierced elsewhere by a pair of holes that flank a crack and suggest an ancient repair. At another point the rim is indented. That the bowl was complete when lost is suggested by a horizontal line of weakness immediately below the mounts, a line that might equate with the level above which the vessel was exposed in the river bed, whether upright or inverted.33 The bowl is perhaps to be associated with the mount 115 (A7073).

There are traces of gilding. The back is recessed; a lug appears to have been broken across an original hole. L 19.8; W 30.0; T excl lug 6.0. 134 MOUNT [Corr and Dunavally] RS1990.6*; Fig 16 A distorted fragment with two original edges and broken at both ends. Birds in high relief evidently formed part of a frieze and are set back to back in pairs with overlapping wings and tails. One complete pair survives; a third bird survives in part, its wing and tail overlapping those of a fourth on the left-hand edge. The adjacent birds that face each other flank a jagged indentation, and the bird on the right faces a similar notch on the right-hand edge. Both voids can be attributed to the deliberate removal of a boss or equivalent decorative feature. A V-sectioned groove crossing the wings and tails of the complete birds was produced with a punch or chisel. The birds have raptor-like heads with large eyes, spiral wing-joints, smooth legs and three- toed claws; feathers are indicated by billeting and the wings are roll-ended ridges with beaded arrises. The fields between their bodies are filled with interlace, and median-incised eight- strand interlace within beaded mouldings forms the upper margin. Projecting from the lower edge and placed asymmetrically between the intact pair of birds is a triangular tab bearing an inverted, backward-facing quadruped with raised foreleg; the body is hatched and a pellet is enclosed in the loop of the neck. The back of the tab has a pierced round-sectioned lug and is offset from the adjacent surface. Now pressed inwards and partially cut through, the tab originally had a flaring profile. A vestige of a similar tab can be seen below the left-hand bird. An internal flange returned at right angles from the uppermost beaded moulding has a jagged broken edge but preserves part of a scheme of interlace. Stubs in the angle of the flange may be vestiges of integral supports. Apparently part of a conical ring with a continuous high-relief frieze, a series of projecting basal tabs and an internal flange on the upper edge. There are some gold-coloured areas but no apparent traces of gilding.

The piece is gilt and of sub-triangular outline; it has three hinge-loops on the upper edge and two perforated lugs. The long edges are formed by the heads and necks of two animals with gaping jaws, the upper jaws roll-ended and flanking a semicircular recess, the lower meeting in a flat 47</page><page sequence="25">boss. The necks are obliquely hatched in a cable pattern and their junction, marked by a spiral, forms a projection from the lower edge. The recess is hatched in three zones, presumably a key for inlay or adhesive. The boss consists of four slight convexities that define a cross by their conjunction.

Two features between them on the broken edge might be conjoined ball-and-claw feet from a contiguous zoomorphic scheme. There are traces of gilding. The ends of the raised edge are returned and run into the broken edges, but their survival suggests that the original outline has been largely preserved on three sides.

Each arm of the triskele is a pair of hatched trumpets with a central lentoid boss; the arms run into spiral bosses, each made up of a further triskele. Each of the latter has arms of two trumpets with lentoid voids and with crescentic voids between, and each throws a keeled strand to the perimeter. The strands run into a junction of three lentoids (one missing from one junction), the outermost separating two hatched trumpets, one of which is prolonged into an S-shaped tail. The edge is raised and bevelled internally and pierced by three holes, one enlarged as though by wear. There is no trace of gilding and the piece is badly abraded, although one arm of the main triskele and one outer pair of hatched trumpets are well preserved.

Roughly V-sectioned, now distorted and cracked and cut at each end. Each face consists of three recessed rectangular fields on the long axis. The apex above the terminal fields is flat and bears a sunken running swastika with a black inlay, possibly niello. A solid sub-pyramid surmounts the central fields and their combination suggests the elevation of a miniature hip-roofed building. The flat top is recessed and keyed at the base for an inlay. Each hip bears a gilt and chip-carved six-strand knot. The other slopes are recessed like the lower fields and all have gilt borders, some with a median rope moulding and others V-sectioned. More prominent V-sectioned borders on the short axis define the central feature. The fields are devoid of gilding and must originally have been filled. The borders of the lower fields have 'jeweller's stitches' on their inner sides, indicating the former presence of filigree panels or foils; such stitches are not certainly present on the fields of the miniature roof. At one end 48</page><page sequence="26">the full extent of the apex and of one lower field survives. These are continuous with a truncated vertical feature, apparently a vestige of the original terminal of the ridge. This bears a tiny gilt roll that might be interpreted by analogy as a zoomorphic detail, perhaps the tip of an animal's snout.

A backward-facing, profile animal biting its own body is enmeshed in interlace, apparently in part continuous with the lappet and tail. The body is diagonally hatched, the upper jaw is roll-ended and the hips are spirals. The fore-leg, truncated on the broken edge, is crossed by a limb ending in a ball-and-claw foot within the loop of the neck. This can be understood as the fore-leg of a second animal in mirror symmetry. There are traces of gilding. The apparent use of mirror symmetry allows conjectural reconstruction (Fig 18) by analogy with a chip-carved, sub-triangular mount from the Phoenix Park, Dublin (Hall 1974, fig 1).

A finer moulding at the original end defines a D- shaped field and a sinuous animal in profile is accommodated to its outer curve. The hind-leg, torso and fore-quarters are vertically aligned, and the torso and neck are diagonally hatched. The tail is looped in the upper left angle of the field and ends in an expansion at the head; the lower left angle holds a triquetra. A lobed spiral marks the front hip and pits denote the hind-hip and eye. The fore-leg, with ball-and-claw foot, is raised against the rump of a seemingly more robust animal, now truncated; the hip is a lobed spiral, the body bears traces of diagonal hatching and the tail ends in a lobe. A break in the profile of the leg suggests a hock and the hind foot is an ill-defined, angular hook interlocking with another similar feature. The D- shaped field is filled with interlace and pierced by a drilled hole. There are traces of gilding.

From the inner side of the longer wall the stub of a thicker division projects in low relief, a notch on its outer side perhaps part of an original hole; the shorter wall forms the only original edge. A profile animal on the long axis has open jaws, an extended tongue and hatched torso. The legs are plain and spring from hooked hips to lie close beneath the body. Behind the front hip the body of a second animal crosses at right angles, and the hind-quarters of the two animals are symmetrical. On the edge outside the longer wall there are further traces of decoration. Perhaps part of a brooch-terminal, if the shorter wall be identified as the returned edge at the junction with the hoop (cf the Snâsa, Nord- Tr0ndelag, brooch: Petersen 1940, fig 73). But the apparent presence of an original hole is more in keeping with the nature of an appliqué mount.

An axe-head- shaped projection has a lower profile and contains a recessed triquetra-based figure. The detail is sharp and well preserved but shows no trace of gilding, and the central cell appears never to have been filled. The implication that the piece is unfinished is borne out by the condition of the lug, which is unpierced but keyed for drilling on one face. D 28.6; W incl projection 43.0; T edge 4.7; L lug 9.7.

The surface is quadranted and each quadrant is subdivided by a continuous narrow band of yellow enamel. The subdivisions, filled with red enamel, consist of pairs of opposed cells forming the outer angles of each quadrant and four arrow-shaped cells aligned on the centre of the field. The latter four can be read in combination as a round-centred, equal-armed cross interlocking diagonally with that formed by the yellow enamel radii. An irregular median groove in the vertical edge may have given purchase to a collar or frame. D 25.5; H 5.4. 202 MOUNT Corr and Dunavally A5670; Fig 21 An oblong plaque with decoration in five zones. Those at each end are rectangles made up of L- shaped cells about a central reserved and perforated rectangle; the three others are angular relief spirals that spring from alternate sides. The central spiral is perforated. A black material fills the L-shaped cells and to some extent forms their ground. The fill of the L- shaped cells is bluer and more glassy and is modified to red where it adjoins the cell walls. It may be that the only surviving inlay - perhaps blue enamel - is in the L-shaped cells; what is ostensibly their ground may be a product of weathering or of surface reaction to the depositional context. L83.0; W 15.0; T 0.3. 203 MOUNT Derryloughan A24389; Fig 22 The articulated component of a two-part suspension mount from the end of a tomb- shaped shrine. The piece is a rectangular frame with two hinge loops at one end. The front has Z- and T-shaped cells enamelled in yellow and light green, the shapes modified at their junction with pointed ovals in the angles enamelled in yellow. The distal edge has been filed smooth but bears traces of further cells from a lost terminal. The stepped back accommodates its replacement - a plain, perforated plate secured by a rivet piercing a T-shaped cell. The inner recess of the back might have held a decorative foil. One of the two hinge loops is incomplete; the other is cracked (or, more probably, was closed after casting) and is in part obliquely hatched within raised edges.

All but the sub-triangular cells incorporate broken-back curves. A pointed oval is reserved in copper alloy in each of four lateral spandrels and a drop-shaped area with an original hole is reserved between two cells near one terminal edge; its counterpart is a small pointed-oval cell filled with yellow enamel near one of the sub-rectangular cells at the other end. The scheme as a whole is in approximate reversed symmetry. 54</page><page sequence="32">The sub-rectangular cells are separated by a reserved area of metal of similar outline on the opposite alignment.

A cell with yellow enamel conforms to this outline, although there is a central expansion on the long axis and the terminals have returned ends. The ground of off-white enamel, probably originally red, holds four pieces of blue-and- white chequered millefiori, three on one side of the central axis and one on the other. But some vestiges of glass and two evident scars suggest a symmetrical scheme, and it seems that four pieces of millefiori were originally set on each side. The oblong mount 242 (RS 1990.17) bears two elongated versions of the axial motif; although it lacks millefiori, the piece is identical to 208 in both palette and patination and must come from the same parent object.

The outer walls of the terminals are lost but an encircling zone presumably existed, as in analogous mounts (Graham-Campbell 1986, illus 4, 5).

Stylized animal-head terminals and a central architectural element are linked by a C-sectioned moulding and all three are enamelled on one face. Yellow enamel fills a tear-shaped eye and two rectangular cells on each terminal; the ground is white and round cells below the eyes are inlaid in black. The central element consists of a rectangle with three square cells and a pedimented top with a triangular cell. The latter and the central cell below are inlaid in black, the other two in yellow; the white ground, like that on the terminals, was probably originally red and the black material is probably niello. The ridge- moulding is pierced by two holes and there are further holes in two oblique projections from the terminals. The back is plain.

Four groups of rectangular cells are arranged alternately, each group made up of four enamelled cells and two larger cells with blue and white millefiori. Each set of four consists of two yellow and two green cells in diagonal pairs. Reading from the incomplete end, the millefiori consists of (i) a 'complex' nine-unit chequer in which the 'white' squares are themselves nine-unit chequers, conjoined with a 'simple' nine-unit chequer; (ii) a four-fold pattern of white quatrefoils in a blue matrix, conjoined with what may be another similar; (iii) a simple chequer, trimmed and set diagonally, conjoined with part of what may be a complex chequer; (iv) a white quatrefoil in a blue matrix, almost filling the cell and seemingly unaccompanied; (v) a simple chequer now flanked by a void; (vi) what may be part of a complex chequer, conjoined with another similar; (vii) (vestigial) what may be complex chequers; (viii) what may be a complex chequer, conjoined with a simple chequer.

The piece is triangular and much abraded; it has three pierced lugs, two of them broken, and a pair of hinge loops at the wider end. The upper part has indented edges, bevelled to the front; its recessed surface is keyed with diagonal hatching and holds traces of an off-white material which, if enamel, was probably originally red. The lower part consists of three cells. Two, now empty, are oval; the third is a larger circular cell containing the remains of a lustrous yellow glass inlay, and the exposed metal surface is unkeyed. The terminal is a blunt point. The conjunction of the terminal with the cluster of three cells suggests an animal head in plan. The back is slightly recessed and the lugs are of such short projection as to presuppose attachment to a metal plate. The hinge loops interlock with the central loop detached from a lost companion piece, and the upper angles are undercut to accommodate the originally flanking pair. The hinge pin remains in situ but does not project at either side and is presumably truncated. The stub on the detached loop has a flat upper surface with diagonal hatching, evidently part of the base of a cell on the companion piece and formerly enamelled.

The light brown ground was probably originally red. The edge is bevelled to the back, the back is concave and a broken, flat- sectioned lug springs from a central hollow. The clean interior of the central cell is consistent with the former presence of a prefabricated stud; a duplicate piece is said to exist in which an amber stud survives (B Bradshaw, pers comm).

Of oval section and conical profile, a single sheet has been folded so that two edges overlap in a vertical joint forming a plain zone in an overall scheme of decoration. Five rivets close the joint; two corresponding lower holes are misaligned and unused, and a further hole at the top in the outer edge lacks an inner counterpart. A further two holes were drilled after the joint was closed and presumably secured an attachment with which the joint was hidden. The ghost of this attachment rounds the rim and has a tongue-shaped end that frames the upper rivet-hole internally. The upper edge is rolled externally over an iron rod to form the rim; horizontal scoring internally marks the base of the roll and must have facilitated its creation. A D-sectioned fillet under the rim is superficially beaded and stops short of the joint at both ends. The ends are snake heads, each secured by a rivet between the eyes. The ornament consists of engraved Stafford knots in opposed pairs forming interlinked roundels in three tiers and is bounded by an incised chevron below the rim. The pattern follows a diagonal grid and the centres correspond to the centres of the roundels and to the intersections of the connecting strands. These points are marked by dome-headed rivets, together with corresponding points on the upper edge. That the roundels were laid out by compass-drawing is confirmed by over-run on the lower edge. The background is hatched, although some spandrels frame rudimentary key motifs and, in two cases, zoomorphs. One of the latter is a well drawn, backward-facing animal that bites its own tail. The lower edge is plain and is pierced asymmetrically by three holes, in one of which a rivet remains. The piece is asymmetrical, due to the divergent axes of the rim and basal edge, and is appropriate to the mouth of a horn; the smooth internal finish of the rivets, both decorative and functional, is consistent with this interpretation. A zone some 20mm deep is set apart internally by differential patination and perhaps projected clear (but see alternatively below); the internal ghost of the lost attachment (see above) lies within it. Presumably secured by friction, the rivets in the lower edge will have served only to prevent the piece from either slipping down or turning on the horn. The lost attachment, if not designed simply to cover the joint, may have had an integral suspension loop. A loop in this position is equally appropriate to a blast-horn or drinking-horn. Associated with the above and reportedly found within it is a thin strip forming a ring of 60</page><page sequence="38">cylindrical profile. The ends overlap in a vertical joint, now open but originally closed by three rivets, one of which survives. There are five holes in the lower edge (additional to those in the joint), and two others respectively in and below the upper edge. The 'outer' surface bears traces of a horizontal series of S-shaped plant scrolls that are truncated on the upper edge; the stems are of double outline and voids are hatched. The 'inner' surface bears a pair of incised lines around the upper edge, apparently secondary to dense diagonal striations or file marks. The width of the strip, c 20mm, corresponds to the zone of differential patination below the rim on the interior of the larger piece; its diameter is appropriate to this position if it is allowed that something else, such as the wall of the horn, was interposed. The differential patination might thus have come about following the loss of the organic horn and after the strip had opened to fill the available aperture. The strip appears to have been cut down and adapted from another context, its original foliate ornament being turned inwards and rendered invisible in its position as here reconstructed.

Tinning of the long edges (including the projection) identifies the obverse face. The rivets are flush at the back but project 5mm and can only have secured studs or some other form of mount. The undistorted rivet is ringed by what might be the ghost of a stud, and there are similar traces around the empty hole.

A central rivet on the axis of the curve has a prominent head on the frontal surface; its reverse projection of 3.4mm has an expanded head and retains a loose rectangular tab. The ends of the mount are slightly expanded and each is occupied by a further rivet around which an incised ring can be discerned. The frontal surface is otherwise filled by an incised frieze, now greatly worn and largely vestigial. The most legible portion, on the right-hand arm, shows a profile bird-like creature (but without evident wings); the beak, body and tail describe a reversed S and a triangular projection suggests a leg and foot. The head and body are hatched and narrow to fine lines, one forming the beak and the other expanding into a hatched, curved- sided, triangular tail. A stamped dot-and-circle denotes the eye. An equal-armed cross springs from the top of the head and the beak is inserted into a hatched, curved-sided triangle. Individual elements can be seen to be matched in the same relative positions elsewhere and evidently formed part of a repeat pattern. Ten birds, facing left, appear to have occupied the right- hand arm; those on the left-hand arm were similarly orientated and presumably equal in number. The frieze is interrupted on the axis of the curve by a discrete motif pierced by the central rivet and consisting of a diagonal cross with a vesica in each angle. The decoration is bounded on the inner curve by an incised line and there are possible traces of another on the outer curve. Given that they drink from horns or stylized chalices and have crosses as rudimentary crests, 63</page><page sequence="41">the birds can be identified as peacocks.

The decoration is interrupted on the other three edges; all three are slightly bevelled to the back, although the two edges meeting in a projection from one angle are less cleanly cut than the third. What appears to be the ghost of a nail- head 7mm in diameter is preserved around the central hole. The ornament consists of encircled interlace reserved in stippling. The roundels and linking knots, as reconstructed (Fig 33), approximate to Encircled D (Cramp 1984, fig 19). L46.0; W 33.4; T 1.2. 282 MOUNT Shanmullagh A 17259; Fig 33 A plate with two indented angles and with one curved and one broken edge. One surface, now badly abraded, is tinned and decorated with a partially compass-drawn scheme of trumpet spirals in which several compass pits are visible. The pattern is dominated by two large roundels enclosing triskeles. The upper triskele (as illustrated) has a central circle and arms ending in crested animal heads with pendant crescents; the lower has a central, triple- interlock spiral and arms ending in triple, club-shaped expansions. There are two small roundels between, each with three animal heads, the better-preserved trio being 'blind' . Three further small roundels on the lower margin contain, respectively, a triskele, an asymmetrical trumpet spiral and an animal head with pricked ears and pendant crescent. An intermediate roundel on the left contains a crested animal head with pendant crescent and with two further crescents symmetrically disposed; a triple-interlock spiral forms the eye. Lentoids linked by swags frame this roundel on its outer aspect and might be secondary. Two spiral-decorated projections and part of a third form the right-hand margin. There is a hole near the right-hand edge of the plate and another pair in the lower right-hand angle, one of figure-of- eight outline. Indentations in the edge of the same angle may incorporate parts of holes. That the complete holes have slightly raised edges at the back is consistent with drilling from the front. The plate is to be interpreted as one of an original four set around a cross with a central roundel and squared terminals (Fig 33). L 92.4; W 92.1; T 0.6. Bourke 1998.

The tri- angles are linked by two pairs of conjoined roundels and the lowermost are joined to roundels at the trumpet ends. The roundels on the triangles have inner rings and each triangle frames a recessed field consisting of two zones of hatching at right angles. The trumpets are outlined by crescentic grooves, margined on the tinned surface of the left-hand trumpet by lines of punched dotting. Vestiges of tinning and dotting survive on the right-hand trumpet and on the edges of the triangles and their roundels. The back preserves tinning in greater degree and the triangles have recessed, or outlined, fields that appear to be hatched internally. The roundel ending the right-hand trumpet is outlined by an inner groove. The head has a median-incised axial rib that bifurcates at each end.

The hinged ring, seized when recorded, is round- sectioned and the constriction is framed by median-incised expansions. A triangular expansion opposite the constriction has a stepped projection ending in a double notch, perhaps an animal head with slightly projecting tongue. A degree of asymmetry in this feature together with differential wear on the surfaces of the ring identify the present front as the original back, ie that subject to greater contact with clothing. The expansion coalesces with the ring in two groups of three interlocking, keeled triangles bounded by mouldings. The triangles have bosses suggestive of eyes and can be interpreted as stylized bird heads (cf Ryan 1983b, no 65). The pin-head is outlined by an incised rectangle.

An equal-armed cross and the perimeter groove hold traces of off-white enamel, probably originally red; the centre of the cross contains a white inclusion that might be a fragment of millefiori. There are traces of yellow enamel in the quadrants. The square has clean edges and appears to be unmodified; it may, by analogy, have a lug on the underside or back. H 11.0; W 15.8; Weight 17.9. 384 WEIGHT Shanmullagh A5989; Fig 47 An irregular cone, the apex enclosed by and partially enclosing an openwork copper-alloy mount. Two arms springing from a basal ring consist of paired curved bars with internal links and each pair culminates in a flat expansion of waisted outline. The expansions, now truncated, appear to have finished in a loop and there is an evident seam at their junction. The arms bear punched pits within an outer groove that ends in a roll above and below, and the expansions are grooved transversely. The expansions and contiguous rolls resemble animal heads in plan and the paired arms might be construed as their horns. The arms were cast as pairs and soldered to the basal ring. The latter has a moulded profile imparted by two unequal grooves. Although the object is classified as a weight, the mount might derive from a gaming piece made otherwise of organic material, as does a broadly comparable copper-alloy mount from Lagore (Hencken 1950, fig 12.17).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS In publishing this collection of Blackwater metalwork I acknowledge first and foremost the contribution of its many finders, in particular Brendan Bradshaw, the late Glenn Crawford, the late Jack McCaldin, Eamon McCurry, Owen McKenna and Dominic Quinn, and the contribution of the many landowners who co-operated in its recovery, in particular Benny Martin, who facilitated my licensed excavation on his property in 1992 and 1993. Support received in both years from the then Environment and Heritage Service (DoE), the licensing authority, and from the then Drainage Division of the Department of Agriculture is also gratefully acknowledged. For advice on specific points I am grateful to Marian Archibald, Justine Bayley, James Graham-Campbell, Andy Halpin, Eamonn Kelly, the late Ian Mclntyre, Heiko Steuer, Pat Wallace and Egon Warners. I have had the benefit of discussing the Blackwater metalwork over many years with Raghnall Ó Floinn, Richard Warner, Niamh Whitfield and Susan Youngs and am grateful to them all for their comments. Niamh Whitfield also read this paper in draft and contributed to its improvement, as did John Sheehan, in addition to responding generously to my several enquiries and advising me specifically on the silver and gold. I gratefully acknowledge the unstinting help of Greer Ramsey at several levels in bringing the paper to publication and that of Claire Foley in the final stages. Deirdre Crone's illustrations are essential to the utility of this paper; her contribution is obvious and is gratefully acknowledged. Less obvious but likewise deserving of recognition is the contribution of Paul Campbell of December Publications, who undertook the presentation of the illustrations in the course of typesetting the whole journal. I am indebted to Seán Barden, Michael McKeown and Bryan Rutledge for most of the images reproduced in Pis 1-5; the exceptions are 112, 147, 156 and 343, scanned from 35mm slides taken by Moira Concannon, 132, 166, 167, 248, 249, 264, 283, 284, 421 and 422, scanned from slides taken by the late Glenn Crawford (which are the only record in the public domain of these unreported pieces), and 170, which is a digital image supplied by the finder and reproduced by permission. Exclusive of the latter and of Glenn Crawford's images, which are reproduced by permission of his brother, Tom Crawford, all photographs and all illustrations are reproduced by permission of the trustees of National Museums Northern Ireland (© National Museums Northern Ireland: Collection Ulster Museum). NOTES 1 The catalogue includes only material for which an early medieval date is either evident or probable; a large number of pieces are accordingly excluded. 2 See Ramsey et al 1992; Bourke 1993a; 2001. 3 For the shrine see Bourke 2002; 2009; Quast 2012, 125; for the bowl see Bourke 1991; Bruce-Mitford 2005, no 165; there is reference to both pieces in Ramsey 2001, 27,30-31. 4 Eg Bourke 1993b, 24-39; Ramsey 2001 , 31-2. 5 Cf the unique coiled arm-ring of copper alloy from Edenvale, Co Clare (Sheehan 2000, 35). 6 Following Br0gger (1921), the Kilmainham/ Islandbridge weights have been attributed in error to the burial from Ballyholme, Co Down, by Marstrander (1965, 25) and most recently by Pedersen (2008, 176). The suggestion often repeated, most recently by Kilger (2008, 285), that the motifs on the enamelled mounts on two of the Kiloran Bay weights are based on Arabic 129</page><page sequence="107">lettering must finally be set aside. The pieces (which were probably originally one) are wholly insular and their design is a version of a Z-based key-pattern, as on the Market Cross at Kells and Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice (Crawford 1926, fig 7.i, j; cf infra 207). 7 A lead cross cast in such a matrix is among the finds from Llanbedrgoch (Redknap 2004, 160, fig 13. f). 8 Barton-Murray &amp; Bailey also refer (20 1 2, 533) to a mould from Christchurch Place, Dublin, with a cross-shaped matrix and to another with an ingot matrix that has an incised cross in the base; see also Wallace 2012, 730. 9 The piece is unique in the present catalogue in that it was acquired through a London dealer and that the identity of the finder remains unknown. However, it was the understanding of the late Jack McCaldin of Banbridge that it had been consigned for sale by a Co Down metal-detectorist who had spent some time on the Blackwater. 10 Cf also a copper-alloy ladle in the National Museum of Ireland (W.29); this was found in the Blackwater in the 19th century 'a mile below Charlemonť, Co Armagh (Wilde 1861 , 542; Ó Ríordáin 1947, 62, pi v.2). 1 1 Finds of detached, C-sectioned, copper-alloy mouldings of early medieval date are otherwise rare; cf a long, sheet piece from a ringfort at Garranes, Co Cork (Ó Ríordáin 1942, 96-8, fig 4.341); a short, tapered, sheet piece from a church interior at Ardwall Isle, Kirkcudbrightshire (Thomas 1967, 1 45-46 , fig 28.56), which, Thomas suggests (ibid), may be from the hip of a tomb-shaped shrine; and a cast, tapered piece, certainly appropriate to such a position, from outside the palisade of Llangorse crannog, Breconshire (Redknap 1995, 67, fig 4.d). Curiously, both the Garranes and Ardwall Isle pieces bear stamped decoration comparable with that on Hiberno- Scandinavian broad-band arm-rings; on the former linear impressions are arranged transversely and in fours as diagonal crosses, on the latter minute triangular impressions form parallel rows. 12 The Gull Island piece is composite and seems (in illustration) to have been made from two originally independent parts, one of them a cruciform mount that had lost its hook. 13 It follows that the poorly preserved mount from Ballynee (Spiddal), Co Meath (Bruce-Mitford 2005, no 172), also derives from a bucket not a bowl. Some cruciform mounts (eg 86) have a pair of perpendicular tabs flanking the lug that were designed to rest on the bucket rim, and rectangular enamelled bucket mounts from Breedon-on-the-Hill, Leicestershire, and from Kaupang, Vestfold, are similarly provided (Youngs 1989, no 50; Haseloff 1990, Abb 159 left). On metal mounts and bindings from stave-built vessels see also Comey 2010, 76-8. 14 Cf the longer and originally separate component of the composite Gull Island mount; a similar piece from Clonmacnoise has been identified as a bowl mount (Bruce-Mitford 2005, no 170) but is probably from a bucket. 15 Comparanda are in some cases separately noted in the individual catalogue entries. 16 Note that images of the Kaupang piece are reversed in Blindheim 1976, fig 13, and Warners 1985, Taf 27.10. The latter, a line drawing, is juxtaposed with a drawing of the Kvistad piece, Taf 27.9; this, if also reversed, is in fact a match for the mount from the Blackwater. A clay mould for a mount with a related pattern forms part of the 7 th- to 8th-century metal working debris from the ecclesiastical site of Portmahomack, Easter Ross (Spall 2009, fig 17.6). Its positive is represented by an enamelled mount (adapted as a weight) from the richly furnished 10th-century female boat burial from Setnes, M0re 02 Romsdal (Marstrander 1965, fíe 10). 17 Cf an earlier, probably 7th-century, enamelled appliqué from Kemsing, Kent, which has the same outline (Youngs 2003, 160, fig 17.2; Bruce-Mitford 2005, figs 624,625). 18 UM A6162; unpublished. There is a related piece from a Late Norse context at Freswick Links, Caithness (Batey 1987, 108, 137-38, no 4.1.1, pi 21. C); see also Graham-Campbell 1992, 87, figs 7-9. 19 For a refined classification of hoards based on their non- numismatic components see Graham-Campbell &amp; Sheehan 2009, 87. 20 For Torksey see http://wwwfitzwilliam.cam.ac.uk/ gallery /normans/ chapters/ Normans _3_5 .htm#c5 1 . The Torksey finds include polyhedral (copper-alloy) weights, a type current in the second half of the 9th century. I owe to John Sheehan the suggestion that an early 10th-century date might be indicated for the Shanmullagh assemblage by the fact that no such weights are included. 21 Two enamelled mounts found in this vicinity compare with those from the Blackwater; Raghnall O Floinn suggests that they 'represent broken up pieces of ecclesiastical metalwork' and were being recycled in Viking hands (Ó Floinn 2001 , 87-8, fig 1). 22 An insular copper-alloy mount adapted as a weight (UM A5779) was found at Dunhin in the 1990s and suggests a 9th- or 10th-century Viking presence. I am grateful to Richard Warner for his comments on the significance of the site. 23 Several of the nails as well as the skull from Shanmullagh are in the Ulster Museum. 24 The Maghery brooch-pin is related to at least two others. One is a well-known but unprovenanced specimen in the National Museum of Ireland on which the 'ring' is a sub-circular openwork plate (Armstrong 1922, fig 2.1); the other is represented by a detached penannular 'ring' , found in north Leinster c 2005 in advance of road building, which has terminals formed by conjoined trumpets. The latter piece was brought to my attention by Richard Warner and is as yet unpublished. 25 Several such bells have been the subject of recent record in England in the context of the Portable Antiquities Scheme; see Griffiths 2010, 150-51. 26 One of the snakes incorporated in a composite copper- alloy ornament from Lough Enagh, Co Derry (NMI PI 003.1; brought to my attention by Raghnall Ó Floinn), compares in general with the Blackwater snakes and specifically in the details of the head. The body forms an omega-shaped loop and bears an engraved diagonal lozenge pattern. The piece consisted originally of three snakes, one now largely lost. 27 For the Ballyness pin (UM A259.1966) see Flanagan et al 1968, 49; the pin is illustrated in Anon 1858, pi opposite 351 (extreme left). 28 For the Ballyness buckle (UM A 196. 1966) see Flanagan et al 1968, 45. Knowles fails to caption his illustration or to itemise the buckle in his text; but he illustrates it with Ballyness material and refers to 'shoe buckles' that were found there (1891, 615); see also Ó Floinn 1995, 86, pi 4.3. 130</page><page sequence="108">29 More exact locations are noted for many pieces in Ulster Museum records. 30 I make an exception of references and illustrations in my own preliminary account (Bourke 1993b), which are cited only to record corrections. 31 The size of the piece accords with that of a T-shaped matrix on a mould from Bally true, Co Armagh (Weatherup 1978, fig 12.3), although the projection is somewhat shorter than the stem of the T. However, a similar mould from Co Derry (NMI R2025; see http://cats.ria.ie) bears a comparable but more robust T- shaped matrix that is inappropriately big for casting a balance beam of early medieval type, and both moulds may have been used, as Eamonn Kelly has suggested (pers comm), to cast roughouts for Iron Age Y-shaped pieces. Both moulds also bear disc-shaped matrices. 32 Two penannular brooches omitted from the catalogue belong to Fowler Class C and appear to be of Romano- British origin. They are A5676 and A6488, from Maghery and Derryloughan respectively. 33 1 owe this interpretation to the late Ian Mclntyre, who restored the bowl in the British Museum in 2000. 34 Following Ó Floinn (2012, 271; cf Bourke 2011, 269) the term 'brooch-pin' is used here for a category that goes by many names. I note, with regard to the differentiation of ringed pins and brooch-pins, that for Fanning (1994, 3, 7) the 'swivelling' action of the ring refers to movement in one plane, whereas for Ó Floinn (ibid) it refers to movement in two. 35 Incorrectly grouped with Shanmullagh material in Bourke 1993b, frontispiece. 36 The disc-headed pin from Cathedral Hill, Armagh, is pierced front to back below the head but was probably never ringed (Gaskell Brown &amp; Harper 1984, fig 10.34). The suggestion (ibid, 130) that its incised birds (viewed upside down) represent 'an angel with outstretched wings and blank face' is to be discounted. 37 These spiral pins were associated in error with the Hiberno-Scandinavian component of the Shanmullagh assemblage in Bourke 1993b, 25; the provenance of 315 is correctly Borough of Charlemont. 38 Determination carried out in the British Museum Research Laboratory in November 1996. 1 am indebted to Justine Bayley for arranging the analysis and for contributing this catalogue entry. 39 Note also the discovery before 1908 of a Petersen Type H sword (NMI S A 1908: 11) at Legar Hill, a hilltop graveyard overlooking the Blackwater in Corr and Dunavally (Harrison &amp; Ó Floinn forthcoming).
