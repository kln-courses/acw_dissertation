   <page sequence="1"> Foreword  — Dieter Roelstraete When Hal Foster first published his acclaimed collection of essays The Return  of the Real back in 1996, he was among the first to signal (or at the very least  theorise) the advent of ‘abject’ art — an art of trauma (‘traumatic realism’) and  infantile perversions, gross sexual imagery and bodily secretions.1 Thus the ‘real’  referred to in the title of this book was to be understood in the capital-R Lacanian  sense first and foremost, as that which exists outside the realm of language and  resists all attempts at symbolic mediation or assimilation. The real, in abject  art’s contentious case, was there to remind us of the crude, irreducible facts  of ‘real’ embodiment amid the rising tide of ‘derealisation’. Indeed, it is worth  noting that The Return of the Real came out when the first waves of techno- optimism engendered by the various digital revolutions of the early-to-mid-1990s  were ebbing away, and a certain measure of anxiety (as well as sheer fatigue)  was starting to accompany any casual mention of the salutary effects of ‘virtual  reality’ and the Internet-driven ‘dematerialisation’ — a tactic pioneered in  the Conceptual art of the late 1960s, incidentally — of the world economy.  Looking at the work of Robert Gober, Mike Kelley, John Miller, Cindy Sherman  and Kiki Smith, among others, Foster observed both the unruly return of real  bodies and the essential irrepressibility of trauma, and rightly identified the  critical impetus that informed much of the work in this vein, some of which  had been shaped by the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. A decade and a half on from the  publication of The Return of the Real, however, it is tempting to conjecture that  what happened subsequently was not so much a continuation of the real’s gradual  return among our midst as its accelerated disappearance. Only in the second half  of the 90s did the dotcom boom really take off, to be perfunctorily interrupted  by the Y2K panic, after which the first decade of the twenty-first century saw  unprecedented economic growth thanks to the progressive deregulation of global  financial markets. (The inner workings of which increasingly lost touch with  all conventional notions of economic ‘reality’, let alone economic realism.) The  effects that this loss of reality (and the concomitant depreciation of ‘realism’,  of whatever kind, as a viable mode of representing this loss-of-reality as a reality  in its own right) has had upon art is well-known, as the traditional concept  of the art world was increasingly supplanted by that of the art market — by the  proliferation of art fairs, the explosive growth of gallery circuits, the stellar rise  of the twin figures of the collector and the superstar dealer as the era’s defining  cultural icons (themselves replacements for the curatoriat of the 90s), and by  both the diamond-studded skull of Damien Hirst (For the Love of God, 2007) and  Hirst himself grinning at us from the gleaming covers of art magazines bloated  with advertising.  It is probably still too early to say whether this whole complex belongs to the  past, as the effects of the current global economic crisis upon the contemporary  art context are increasingly difficult to determine, let alone define — in fact,  it is becoming more difficult by the day to define the nature of the crisis’s  progress (what crisis?) as such: is it already over, is it in full swing or is it yet to  make itself felt? However this may be, there is no denying that the reality check  1 See Hal Foster, The Return of the Real: The Avant-Garde at the end of the Century, Cambridge, MA and    London: The MIT Press, 1996. 2 | Afterall  Foreword | 3 </page>
