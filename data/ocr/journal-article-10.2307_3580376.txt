Previous surveys of radiation therapy among the Life Span Study (LSS) population at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) revealed that 1,670 (1.4%) of the LSS participants received radiation treatments before 1984. The data on therapeutic radiation doses are indispensable for studying the relationship between radiation treatments and subsequent cancer occurrences. In this study, the radiation treatments were reproduced experimentally to determine the scattered radiation doses. The experiments were conducted using a female human phantom and various radiation sources, including a medium-voltage X-ray machine and a 6oCo y-ray source. Doses were measured using thermoluminescence do- simetry and ionization chambers. Radiation doses were deter- mined for the salivary glands, thyroid gland, breast, lung, stomach, colon, ovary and active bone marrow. The results have been used for documenting the organ doses received by patients in previous surveys. The contribution of therapeutic irradiation to the occurrence of chromosome aberrations was studied using data on doses to active bone marrow from both radiation treatments and atomic bomb exposures in 26 RERF Adult Health Study participants. The results suggest that ra- diation treatments contributed to a large part of their frequen- cies of stable-type chromosome aberrations. The therapeutic radiation doses determined in the present study are available for investigating the effects of therapeutic irradiation on the subsequent primary cancers among atomic bomb survivors who received radiation treatments. ? 2001 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION The study of the medical radiation exposures of atomic bomb survivors is important in evaluating the effects of radiation on the human body, and the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) has conducted such studies since 1961. Our radiation treatment surveys (1-3) show that only 1,670 participants among the 120,128 RERF Life Span Study (LSS) participants have received radiation therapy, i.e. only 1.4% of the LSS participants. However, the high therapeutic radiation doses they received may have contrib- uted to the subsequent occurrence of cancers in these 1,670 people. Boice et al. (4) demonstrated that the relative risks of second primary cancers in or near radiation treatment sites are higher than in patients without radiation treatment. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, radiation treatments were giv- en for benign diseases, such as tuberculosis and dermato- phytosis, as well as for malignant neoplasia (1-3). Such radiation treatments for benign diseases may have induced primary cancers. The cancers may have been a very small percentage of the cancers found among the whole LSS pop- ulation but a considerable percentage of the cancers in the 1,670 who received radiation therapy. The data on radiation treatments of these 1,670 LSS participants are useful in investigating how the radiation treatments are related to the first or second primary cancers among the people exposed to both A-bomb radiation and therapeutic radiation. To ex- amine whether there is a relationship between radiation treatments and primary cancers after therapy, data on scat- tered radiation doses are essential. However, most previous dosimetry studies for radiation therapy concentrated on de- termining dose distributions in the treatment sites. There- fore, the present study has been performed to estimate the scattered radiation doses received by the LSS participants from radiation treatments for benign and malignant diseas- es. In the previous RERF surveys, hospital medical records on radiation therapy were transcribed (1-3). Based on these data, the radiation treatments were reproduced using a hu- man phantom and various radiation sources, and organ dos- es were measured. The LSS population includes the 20,000- member RERF Adult Health Study (AHS) population.

The purpose of this paper is two- fold: to describe our procedures for determining the organ doses from the radiation treatments identified in the previ- ous surveys and to apply the results to the problem of ab- normally high frequencies of stable chromosome aberra- tions found in the AHS population. The organ doses deter- mined in this study will be used to evaluate the contribution of radiation treatment to subsequent cancers among the 1,670 LSS participants who received radiation therapy. This study is part of the medical dosimetry program at RERF (5). MATERIALS AND METHODS Medical Records on Radiation Therapy Reviewed in Previous Surveys Radiation treatment data for 1,670 LSS participants were obtained from three previous surveys, in which hospital and clinic medical records were reviewed to confirm and document radiation therapy. Survey data includ- ed information on diagnosis, radiation source, treatment dose, treatment site, and teletherapy exposure field size, the data available for estimating organ doses for the radiation treatments identified in the surveys. Each of the 1,670 LSS participants received radiation treatments for benign disease, for first primary cancer, or for both. The subsequent primary cancers, including second primary cancers, have been followed at the RERF (6). In the first two surveys, the first conducted from 1961 to 1969 (except 1962 and 1963) and the second conducted from 1970 to 1979, all AHS participants were interviewed regarding all past radiation treatments. Based on reports generated by those surveys, radiation treatments were documented for 187 AHS participants (1, 2). A third survey, conducted from 1981 to 1984, identified all treatments received by LSS participants. In that survey, all medical records of radiation treatments retained in 11 hospitals were reviewed, and treatments were newly documented for 1,483 LSS participants, including 304 AHS participants (3). Dosimetry For dosimetry, simulations of the radiation treatments were performed by exposing an Alderson Rando adult human phantom (7). This facili- tated measurements of doses to the salivary and thyroid glands, lungs, female breasts, stomach, colon, ovaries and active bone marrow. In pre- vious site-specific cancer incidence studies, the irradiations of these or- gans suggested the induction of malignant neoplasms (6, 8). Various sizes of Mix-DP block phantoms were also used to construct phantom human extremities for simulations of hand and foot treatments. Each radiation therapy exposure had its own characteristics and technical conditions, so various simulated treatments were required. Different exposure field sizes had been used in teletherapy for malignant diseases among the LSS pop- ulation. In addition, each radiation source has a characteristic source-to- surface distance (SSD). Therefore, a typical field size and SSD were selected for each radiation source and disease and used in the experi- ments. The radiation sources used were 6Co needles, a 111-TBq (3000- Ci) 60Co y-ray therapy apparatus (Shimadzu Isotron-21), and an X-ray machine for radiation therapy (Shimadzu SH-250M-3) at the Research Institute for Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Hiroshima University, and the 4 MeV linear electron accelerator (LINAC; Toshiba Mevatron 6300) and 8 MeV LINAC (NEC NELAC-1018) at Hiroshima University Hos- pital. The doses were measured using Mg2SiO4(Tb) thermoluminescent do- simeters (TLDs, Kasei Optonix MSO-S) and ionization chambers (JARP HU5, Capintec PM-30 and Shonka-Wyckoff). Thermoluminescences were measured by a thermoluminescence readout system (Harshaw 2000A) and an integrating picoammeter (Harshaw 2000B). The human phantom and the TLD were the same as those used in our dosimetry of organ doses from diagnostic X-ray exposures to the atomic bomb sur- vivors (9-11). If an organ was distant from the treatment site, the ab- sorbed dose was very small. The TLDs used in the present experiment are relatively sensitive, and it was possible to maintain intensities more than 100 times the background intensities (9). In our present experiments, the TLD responses inside and outside the exposure fields were determined by simultaneous irradiation of the TLDs and the ionization chambers (JARP HU5, Capintec PM-30 and Shonka-Wyckoff chamber). The ex- posures measured by the TLDs were converted into absorbed doses using the conversion factors given in ICRU Report 30 (12). Doses to active bone marrow were measured at 17 locations, and the mean dose was calculated using the active bone marrow distribution determined by Rus- sell et al. (13). Chromosome Aberrations after Radiation Therapy The listing of the master file numbers of the atomic bomb survivors who had received radiation treatments was reviewed to locate the AHS participants were examined for chromosome aberrations. The records used in this report were compiled by one of the authors (AAA). Preston et al. (14) studied the relationship between the frequencies of stable chro- mosome aberrations in the 1,245 AHS participants and their active bone marrow doses from the A-bomb. They used 80% of the RERF data on chromosome aberration until 1988, excluding the data from the AHS participants who were not exposed to the A-bomb or who received doses to the active bone marrow larger than 4 Gy from the bomb. Their results showed that the active bone marrow dose served as the variant for linear or quadratic functions of the frequency of stable chromosome aberrations. The present analysis was also performed using active bone marrow doses. Those from the A-bomb were estimated by the Dosimetry System 1986 (DS86). The total bone marrow doses were calculated assuming that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was 10 for the A-bomb neutron radiation and 1 for the A-bomb y radiation and for the therapeutic radi- ations. A linear response function was used to describe the relationships be- tween the active bone marrow dose and the frequency of stable chro- mosome aberrations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The generalized linear model was fitted to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki data sets. The variance of the frequency of stable chromosome aberrations was assumed to be np(1 - p) for the number of cells examined, n, and the proportion of stable chromosome aberrations, p. Using the GLM-B program, calcula- tions were performed to estimate the parameters by the maximum like- lihood method (15). RESULTS Dosimetry Technical factors transcribed from hospital medical re- cords were body site treated, treatment dose, radiation source, source-to-surface distance, and the size of the ex- posed field (1-3). Except for radiation treatments for can- cers of the cervix or the body of the uterus, various com- binations of modality, treatment site and field size were used in each treatment practice. Organ doses were estimat- ed experimentally for 90 selected treatments. Table 1 shows examples of technical factors and organ doses estimated in the present study. Most therapeutic exposures for cervical cancer were performed with a total treatment dose of 50</page><page sequence="3">DOSES FROM RADIATION THERAPY IN A-BOMB SURVIVORS 787 TABLE 1 Organ Doses in Grays from Radiation Therapy Field sizea Distance from Salivary Thyroid Bone Treatment Body site Radiation (filtration/mm) (cm) source (cm)b Directionc glands gland Breast Lung Stomach Colon Ovary marrow dose Pelvis 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 15 x 15 35 FSD AP + PA 0.01 0.01 0.09 0.07 0.70 16 32 11 33 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Pelvis 6wCo y rays 15 x 15 80 SSD AP + PA 0.06 0.07 0.17 0.18 0.77 19 50 18 50 Pelvis (with shielde) 6Co y rays 15 X 15 80 SSD AP + PA 0.09 0.10 0.24 0.23 0.95 24 55 14 50 Pelvis 8 MV linear accelerator 15 x 15 100 STD AP + PA 0.03 0.03 0.06 0.07 0.23 19 50 18 50 X rays Pelvis Radium needlesf - - - 0.01 0.02 0.06 0.06 0.21 1.9 5.0 0.94 3.36g Prostate 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 13 x 13 30 FSD AP 0.002 0.002 - 0.005 0.05 1.4 - 3.4 14 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Scrotum 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 17 x 17 40 FSD AP 0.001 0.002 - 0.004 0.04 0.57 - 1.1 4.6 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Stomach 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 13 x 13 30 FSD AP 0.01 0.01 0.17 0.29 4.9 0.84 0.06 0.64 4.9 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Middle abdomen 6?Co y rays 14 x 14 100 SSD AP + PA 0.11 0.16 0.43 0.54 17 20 0.92 4.5 54 Right liver 6Co -y rays 4.5 x 4.5 85 SSD AP 0.001 0.001 0.005 0.005 0.009 0.005 0.002 0.023 2.5 Middle waist "Co y rays 7.0 x 4.5 80 SSD PA 0.01 0.01 0.05 0.06 0.65 0.27 0.07 2.9 36 Left breast 6?Co y rays 15 x 15 80 SSD AP 0.25 0.40 22 11 0.75 0.22 0.07 2.9 44 Left breast 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 10 x 10 40 FSD AP 0.01 0.02 0.71 0.14 0.01 0.01 0.001 0.05 1.4 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Left breast (after 8 MV linear accelerator 20 x 20 100 STD AP 0.05 0.14 0.04 1.02 0.02 0.005 0.002 0.13 6.0 surgery) electrons Left axilla 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 10 x 10 40 FSD LAT 0.05 0.009 0.22 1.33 0.06 0.01 0.002 0.25 18 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Left shoulder 6?Co y rays 10 x 15 65 SSD AP 0.23 0.34 0.23 3.78 0.10 0.03 0.01 0.27 21 Middle back 6?Co y rays 10 x 7 65 SSD PA 0.15 0.33 0.30 0.49 0.06 0.03 0.01 0.98 35 Sternum 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 13 x 13 30 FSD AP 0.25 0.41 1.6 2.5 0.06 0.03 0.01 0.95 18 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Right lower lung 6?Co y rays 7 X 9 80 SSD PA 0.02 0.03 0.12 0.14 0.61 0.21 0.06 1.8 32 Both thyroid 6?Co y rays 4 X 4(2) 70 FSD AP 2.2 60 0.72 0.96 0.40 0.18 0.10 1.3 60 Right thyroid 8 MV linear accelerator 8 X 8 100 STD LAT 3.5 30 0.10 0.25 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.38 56 X rays Right thyroid 8 MV linear accelerator 5 x 5 100 STD LAT 2.6 47 0.11 0.14 0.02 0.01 0.002 0.42 80 electrons Tongue 8 MV linear accelerator 5 x 5 100 STD AP 1.6 0.66 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.01 4.8 30 X rays Mouth 4 MV linear accelerator 5 x 5 100 STD AP 1.4 0.88 0.03 0.05 0.01 0.01 0.01 4.8 40 X rays Palate 6?Co needles - - - 12 5.6 0.42 0.56 0.09 0.04 0.01 5.5 3.698 Right cheek 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 15 x 15 34 FSD AP 10 9.2 0.14 0.24 0.01 0.01 0.002 2.7 21 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Head skin 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 13 x 13 30 FSD Oblique 0.36 0.21 0.01 0.02 0.001 0.0004 0.0002 0.16 2.5 aluminum, 0.3 copper fil- ter)d Right parotid 6wCo y rays 7 X 7 65 SSD LAT 12 0.69 0.05 0.09 0.01 0.01 0.005 5.7 40 Right knee 8 MV linear accelerator 5 x 5 100 STD AP + PA 0.05 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.05 0.12 0.28 0.13 90 X rays Both feet 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 15 x 15 35 FSD AP 0.0002 0.0003 0.0005 0.0003 0.0004 0.001 0.002 0.0003 4.0 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d Both hands 200 kV X rays (1.0-mm 13 x 13 30 FSD AP 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.08 0.03 0.03 0.01 1.2 aluminum, 0.3-mm cop- per filter)d a The number of fields is indicated in parentheses in the case of dual exposure fields. b FSD: focus-to-surface distance; SSD: source-to-surface distance; STD: source-to-target distance. c AP: anterior; PA: posterior; LAT: lateral; Oblique: at angle of 45' to the cnetral axis of the skull. d 1.25 mm copper half-value layer.

Approximately 7% of the 60Co y-ray treatments for cervical cancer were conducted with a lead block placed on a mid-lower part of the exposed field. The thickness of the lead plate was frequently 5 cm. The bone marrow dose decreases with the lead shielding, but the scattered radiation increases.

The doses measured in the active bone marrow are excluded. The figure shows data for three experiments: 60Co y rays ([-]), high-energy X rays from an 8 MV electron linear accelerator (A), and medium-voltage X rays (0) with a 2.1-mm copper half-value layer. in organs outside the exposure field were 1.5 to 2.1 times larger than those without lead shielding. As shown in Table 1, the organ doses depend strongly on the treatment site. The 1,670 LSS participants received radiation treatments to the pelvis and its periphery (27%), the thoracic region (18%), the neck or thyroid (11%), the cranial region (7%), the extremities (7%), and the abdominal region (6%). The remainder were treated to complicated or multiple regions or to unknown sites. The wide distribution of the treatment sites required simulations of radiation exposures to numer- ous treatment sites, as shown in Table 1. Several 60Co y- ray treatments were conducted with short source-to-surface distances, such as 65 cm. This suggests that the 60Co irra- diators with low activities were frequently used before 1984. Figure 1 shows the organ doses from cervical cancer treatments delivered using several radiation sources. As shown, the scattered X-ray dose from the 8 MV LINAC was lower than that from 250 kV X rays near the exposure field. However, the dose from the LINAC decreased so slowly with distance from the field that the dose was higher than that from 250 kV X rays at distant sites (thyroid and salivary glands). The scattered y-ray dose from 60Co was relatively large for the organs in the thoracic and cranial regions. Scattered radiation doses to the thyroid and sali- vary glands were smaller in the order of 250 kV X rays, 8 MV LINAC X rays, and 60Co external y rays. The medium- energy X-ray exposures to the pelvis were simulated with tube voltages of 150, 200 and 250 kVp. The maximum standard deviation of the measured organ doses was 22% for the stomach. Organ doses did not depend strongly on the tube voltage, which allows easier organ dose estimation. 50 40 - S30 - * 20 - OThyroid (x20) 0A Lung 0 I00oOvary (x100) 0 200 400 600 Field size (cm2) FIG. 2. Organ doses from 60Co teletherapy for breast cancer with dif- ferent-sized exposure fields. The thyroid and ovary doses indicated are multiplied by factors of 20 and 100, respectively. The curve for the thy- roid doses was drawn to guide the eye. Radiation treatments to the thoracic region were per- formed using exposure fields of various sizes. Scattered ra- diation doses far from the exposure field are expected to increase as the exposure field widens. For example, in the case of 60Co teletherapy for breast cancer, scattered radia- tion doses outside the exposure field increase approximately in proportion to the area of the exposure field, as shown in Fig. 2. Organ doses incurred from radiation treatments with other field sizes can be estimated using the data obtained in the present experiments. In the treatment of the thyroid gland, doses to sublingual or submandibular glands were relatively large. As shown in Table 1, the mean dose to the salivary glands was not as large. However, the dose varied across each gland. In treatments to the extremities, the ratios of organ doses to treatment dose were low, as shown in Table 1. Treatments to the hands were performed for benign diseases, such as chilblain and eczema; hence the doses were also relatively low (3). Throughout the experiments, each TLD was calibrated and the uncertainties caused by TLD variations were min- imized. The thermoluminescence readout system was ad- justed uniformly, and adequate reproducibility was ob- tained. For example, the experiments involving 60Co y-ray treatment for cervical cancer were repeated three times, and the largest relative standard error was 6.4% for breast dose, as shown in Table 2. Individual Organ Doses The results of the present dosimetry were used to esti- mate organ doses for 1,501 (90%) of the 1,670 patients. For each estimation, the most suitable dosimetry result for each radiation treatment was selected. Therapeutic radiation doses for the remaining patients (10%) were not estimated because information relating to the dose or treatment site was incomplete or because an appropriate radiation source for dosimetry was unavailable.

Females received large dos- es to the pelvis, breast, thyroid and active bone marrow because of the high treatment doses for cancer of the cer- vix, breast and thyroid, as shown in Table 3. In males, treatments to the thyroid or stomach were frequent, and the mean doses to these organs were large. Since treatments to the pelvis were infrequent in males, bone marrow doses were lower than in the females. Chromosome Aberrations after Radiation Therapy Data on both therapeutic and A-bomb radiation doses were available for the 29 AHS participants who were ex- amined for chromosome aberrations after radiation therapy. The mean time from radiation therapy to examination for chromosome aberrations was 17 years, and the standard deviation was 10 years. The active bone marrow doses from the A-bomb for these individuals were less than 4 Sv. Among the 29, three who received treatments to the pelvic regions received extremely large (&gt;10 Sv) doses to the active bone marrow from therapeutic radiation. Their fre- quencies of stable chromosome aberrations and active bone marrow doses are shown in Table 4. The remaining 26 cas- es (10 cases from Nagasaki and 16 from Hiroshima) are shown in Fig. 3A-D. Preston et al. (14) estimated the re- lationship between frequency of stable chromosome aber- rations and active bone marrow dose from the A-bomb in the 1,245 AHS participants (788 in Hiroshima and 457 in Nagasaki). The estimated dose-response functions are also shown in Fig. 3A-D. The study revealed a steeper dose- response curve in Hiroshima than in Nagasaki. The present study also shows this tendency. The intercepts of the dose- response curves were large when the doses from the A- bomb were not included, reflecting underestimated doses. Adding A-bomb doses to therapeutic doses, the parameters could be estimated with relative certainty. However, the in- tercept for Nagasaki was still larger than that estimated by Preston et al (14). The frequencies of stable chromosome aberrations in high-dose region shown in Table 4 were much lower than those estimated from the dose-response curves shown in Fig. 3A-D. Examination of one Hiroshima AHS participant showed that her frequency of stable chromosome aberrations in- creased from 0.13 to 0.30 after 60Co y-radiation treatment that resulted in an active bone marrow dose of 2.6 Sv. The increase in the frequency of stable chromosome aberrations per sievert and per 100 cells was 6.7 (1/Sv), roughly co- inciding with the slope estimated by Preston et al. (14). DISCUSSION Radiation Therapy of A-bomb Survivors Among treatments received by 187 AHS participants in the first and second surveys (1, 2), those for 114 were not confirmed in the third survey (3). At the time of the third survey, ten large hospitals retained few medical records of treatments conducted before 1966. It is important to retain records of radiation treatments for patient follow-up. The data from the three surveys showed that an estimated 4,500 LSS participants received radiation therapy between 1945 and 1980 (3). The 1,670 LSS participants identified in the three surveys are only a portion of those who received ra- diation therapy. The data from the previous three surveys suggest that 66% of the radiation treatments given during 1945-1965 were for benign diseases (3). In those days, many atomic bomb survivors suffered not only from ma- lignant diseases but also from benign diseases, such as ke- loid or tuberculosis. Radiation therapy appears to have been a possible treatment method for such benign diseases. From the results for benign diseases shown in Table 3, the av- erage active bone marrow dose of these LSS participants was estimated to have been 1.3 Gy. It is difficult to evaluate the contributions of theses doses to occurrences of primary cancers among the LSS population because of the large number of missing records. On the other hand, most of the missing records were concerned with the radiation treat- ments before 1966, and few patients have received radiation therapy for benign diseases since 1966 (3). The cancers among the LSS population have been documented contin- uously at the RERF tumor registry (6). Therefore, the 1,670 LSS participants are not expected to have additional miss- ing records of radiation therapy conducted before the doc- umented cancer incidences.

Comparison with Results of Other Dose Estimations Some of the results are compared with the organ doses measured by the other investigators, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Kase et al. (17) measured secondary radiation doses in a water-filled phantom exposed to 300 kV X rays with 3.0-mm copper half-value layer (HVL). The results were used to estimate the doses from treatment for cervical can- cer, as shown in Fig. 4A. The dose estimated for the thyroid was approximately 2.5 times the present thyroid dose ob- tained for exposure to 200 kV X rays with a 1.25-mm cop- per HVL. Russell and Antoku (1) reported that for 20 me- dium-voltage X-ray machines in the respective institutions, the tube voltage varied from 80 kV to 250 kV. The maxi- mum tube voltage of the X-ray machine used in the present experiments was 250 kV (2.1-mm copper HVL). Thus we measured the organ doses during the exposures with 150, 200 and 250 kV to 15 X 15 cm2 anterior and posterior pelvic fields.

This suggests that the organ doses may have varied only slightly with tube voltage. Therefore, some of the variation in organ doses among different mea- surements may have been caused by variations in the leak- age of radiation from different machines rather than by var- iations in the tube voltage. Although the uncertainties of the present distant organ doses (lung, breast, thyroid gland and salivary glands) are 13-15% for 250 kV X rays, the doses may vary by a factor of 2.5 for some past medium- voltage X-ray machines in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Stovall et al. (18, 19) estimated the secondary radiation doses by various methods including experiments using a phantom. There are discrepancies in the doses to the thyroid and sal- ivary glands during three kinds of teletherapy for cervical cancer, as shown in Fig. 4A-C.

Among the radiation sources used in the present study, 60Co teletherapy resulted in the largest scattered radiation doses to the lung, breast, thyroid gland and salivary glands. Stovall et al. (18) also observed this tendency, though the active bone marrow doses were less than those found in the present study. For example, their active bone marrow dose from 60Co teletherapy was 16 Gy/100 Gy of tumor dose (18), and ours was 35 Gy/100 Gy of tumor dose. The present dose was obtained using the active bone marrow distribution of Russell et al. (13), while Stovall et al. (18) used the active bone marrow distribution of Cristy (20). In the active bone marrow distribution of Russell et al. (13), a large fraction (31%) of the active bone marrow is in a 15 X 15-cm2 exposure field, which is nearly equal to the weight of the active bone marrow in the pelvis determined by Cristy (20). Such a large fraction of active bone marrow in the exposure field can be considered appropriate for eval- uating the mean active bone marrow doses from the treat- ments of the female atomic bomb survivors, because their pelvises were frequently small.

(17) (A). Panel A, medium-voltage X rays; panel B, 60Co y rays; panel C, linear electron accelerator (LINAC) X rays; panel D, radium needle. The mean doses to cervix, ovary, colon, stomach, breast, lung, thyroid glands and salivary glands are indicated in the order of distance from the center of the cervix. The distances are measured from the center of the cervix to the center of the organs in the human phantom used in the present study. The doses of Stovall (19) and Kase (17) were estimated from the secondary radia- tion doses measured along a 10-cm depth line in a water tank. The sec- ondary radiation doses were renormalized to the tumor dose using the previous data on percentage depth doses (21-23). The half-value layers (HVLs) of X rays in panel B are 2.1 mm copper in the present study, 3.0 mm copper in Stovall et al. (18), and 3.2 mm copper in Kase et al. (17). The present radium needle doses were determined using the organ doses for a 60Co needle and radium and 60Co exposure rate constants (12). its decay products is similar to that of 60Co y rays. There- fore, organ doses incurred from radiation therapy by radium needles could be determined using radium and 60Co expo- sure rate constants (12) and the organ doses measured using 60Co needles. The results are shown in Fig. 4D. As shown, the present organ doses resulting from the radium needles approximately coincide with those determined by Stovall et al. (18). The active bone marrow dose for radium needles was estimated to be 28 mGy per 100 mg h, while that reported by Stovall et al. (18) was 35 mGy per 100 mg h. Secondary radiation doses measured by Kase et al. (17) are also available for estimating the organ doses during treatment to the mid-abdomen. Their results for treatment with 60Co y radiation were compared with our results. In spite of the simplicity of the estimation, their doses agree with the present doses within a factor of 2, as shown in Fig. 5. The present experiments were performed using only one human phantom. Although the scattered radiation doses to organs distant from the treatment site depend strongly on the size of the patient, this was not considered in our study. Few atomic bomb survivors are physically as large as Eu- ropeans.

The exposure fields are parallel-opposed, anterior and posterior fields 14 X 14 cm2 in size. The source-to-surface distance is 100 cm. The mean doses to ovary, colon, pancreas, stomach, breast, lung, thyroid gland and sali- vary glands are indicated. The ovary and colon doses are indicated at a negative distance from the pancreas. Doses are normalized so that the treatment dose to the pancreas is 100 Gy. The present data (i-I) are com- pared with the doses estimated from the secondary radiation doses mea- sured in a water tank by Kase et al. (17) (0), where the field size was 15 x 15 cm2. The method of evaluation is described in the legend to Fig. 4. The organ doses outside the exposure field were adjusted to those for a 14 x 14-cm2 field by multiplying the ratio of the field area (see Fig. 2). er than 1% were taller than 177.8 cm (24). Relatively large uncertainties should be considered for small female LSS participants. Among the Hiroshima adult female AHS par- ticipants, approximately 11% are shorter than 139.7 cm (24). Based on the measured dose distribution in the human phantom, the organ doses outside the exposure field were estimated for a female 130 cm in height in the case of 60Co y-ray exposure to the 15 x 15-cm2 pelvic exposure field, assuming the same body thickness as our human phantom. Estimated doses were roughly 38% larger than doses to the human phantom. However, the uncertainty for a 130-cm female is expected to be less than 38% for a short, generally thin human. Doses to short LSS participants should be as- certained in a future study. The location and size of each organ were probably different in these patients, but infor- mation regarding individual organ sizes and locations could not be considered in the dose estimations. Consequently, the uncertainties are from individual differences from the sizes assumed in the dosimetry calculations. Another un- certainty arose from the correction factor for field size. From the results shown in Fig. 2, we can infer an estimated 14% uncertainty for these correction factors. Organs inside the exposure field receive large doses, which were esti- mated precisely from the treatment dose. Careful review of treatment dose data in hospital medical records ensures the accuracy of those large organ doses. Chromosome Aberrations after Radiation Therapy The frequencies of stable chromosome aberrations in 26 LSS participants examined after radiation therapy showed</page><page sequence="10">794 KATO ET AL. smooth dose responses in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the A-bomb doses and therapeutic doses were summed. However, neither dose response was as steep as those of the 1,245 AHS participants reported by Preston et al. (14). Stram et al. (25) also estimated dose-response functions using the data on frequencies of stable chromo- some aberrations for 1,703 AHS participants, assuming a neutron RBE of 10, and their results also suggest that the Hiroshima dose response was not as steep. The present dose responses shown in Fig. 3C and D were obtained assuming that the therapeutic radiation contributes as much to frequencies of stable chromosome aberrations as does A-bomb radiation. Kleinerman et al. (26) investi- gated the relationship between frequencies of stable chro- mosome aberrations among patients with cervical cancer and their active bone marrow doses from radiation therapy. The results showed that therapeutic radiation was less ef- fective than A-bomb radiation (26). The frequency of stable chromosome aberrations at 6 Gy was less than 2%. This is not consistent with the present results. These investigators also observed relatively low frequency of stable chromo- some aberrations in a high-dose range (3.75% at 9.36 Gy and 2.8% at 11.33 Gy). As shown in Table 3, the mean active bone marrow dose from treatments for cancer of the cervix was 16 Gy. For the present dose-response analysis, mean doses to active bone marrow were used. The bulk of the active bone marrow is concentrated in the pelvis. The treatment dose for cervical cancer was delivered in multiple daily fractions. Therefore, in the case of treatment for cer- vical cancer, the dose to lymphocytes should have been much lower than the mean active bone marrow dose (27), The results shown in Fig, 3A-D do not include data from the patients who received radiation treatments for cervical less steep than that of the curves for the 1,245 AHS par- ticipants, the difference was small. This probably indicates that their mean active bone marrow doses were close to the doses to lymphocytes. CONCLUSION The scattered radiation doses to organs and tissues have rarely been quoted in the literature, as mentioned in the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (28). In particular, few previ- ous studies refer to radiation treatments for benign diseases. In the present study, the critical organ doses resulting from such treatments were determined. The mean organ doses from radiation therapy were very large for every critical organ, and they increased the frequency of stable chromo- some aberrations. This suggests that the cancer incidences after radiation therapy have been increased by the radiation treatment. The cancer incidences among the LSS popula- tion have been followed at RERF (8). These data will be useful for examining how the radiation treatments are re- lated to the subsequent cancer occurrences. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to the late Dr. Walter J.
