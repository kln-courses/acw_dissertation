<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rochester's Philo- sophical Premises: A Case for Consistency REBA WILCOXON XVHETHER THE POETRY of Rochester reveals, on the one hand, a "poet of unbelief,"' an "explorer through the 'Perplexity of endless Thought'";2 or, on the other, an early Augustan whose "innermost values were as conservative as Pope's"3 is an ongoing debate among his critics. This critical debate has turned upon the meanings of "un- belief," "explorer," and "Augustan," with appropriate focus on the question of values. A sharper focus on the philosophical premises which seem to shape Rochester's thought and to undergird his satire seems to be called for. Although Rochester's thought cannot be systematized in any rig- orous sense, still his metaphysical and epistemological persuasions seem to me consistent with each other and with his ethical values. This can be illustrated in five poems, of varying importance in the canon and differing in type. Two are translations, a passage from De Rerum Natura of Lucretius and a passage from "Troades" by Seneca; two are the poems which have elicited the greatest volume of criticism, "Upon Nothing" and "A Satyr Against Mankind"; and the last is a widely admired song, "Love and Life" ("All my past life is mine no more"). The translation from De Rerum Natura (I. 44-49) epitomizes the Epicurean position on religion: 1 Vivian de Sola Pinto, Enthusiast in Wit: A Portrait of John Wilmot Earl of Rochester 1647-1680 (Lincoln, Nebraska, 1962), p. 114. 2Howard Erskine-Hill, "Rochester: Augustan or Explorer?"

Although the nouns "Epicure" and "libertine" were used interchangeably by most writers of the Restoration, each word had philosophic origins that did not entail a morality of unrestrained self-indulgence. In its original form, the philosophy bordered on the ascetic in the denial of pleasures which disrupt tranquillity. Among the disruptions to tranquillity was the fear that proceeded from the superstitions of religion-an idea not only reflected in the rejection of Providence in the passage from Lucretius but also explicitly expressed by Rochester, as we shall see, in a translation from Seneca and in the "Satyr Against Mankind." From Rochester's choice of this passage for translation, we cannot, however, with certainty ascribe to him "belief." The teachings of Epicureanism were widely disseminated after 1660, especially through De Rerum Natura and Diogenes Laertius' Lives of the Phi- losophers. Rochester may have been participating in a literary fad, a playful sporting with orthodoxy. Yet we cannot discount Burnet's report; nor should we fail to weigh the implications of another trans- lation, that from Seneca's "Troades" (II. 397-408), which begins "After death nothing is, and nothing, death." Probably a late work, the translation is an expansion of the Stoic Seneca's twelve lines to eighteen, in which the tone of acceptance is 4 David M.

Rochester is explicitly materialistic, whereas Seneca is only implicitly so. For Seneca's "quaeris quo iaceas post obitum loco?/quo non nata iacent,"6 Rochester writes: Dead, we become the lumber of the world, And to that great mass of matter shall be swept Where things destroyed with things unborn are kept. (8-10) This idea recurs in the poem "Upon Nothing." The entire version is consonant with Epicurean metaphysics; however, it goes beyond a purely pagan declaration in its specific hostilities to Christianity: Let the ambitious zealot lay aside His hopes of heaven, whose faith is but his pride; Let slavish souls lay by their fear, Nor be concerned which way nor where After this life they shall be hurled. (3-7) The "ambitious zealot" would seem to extend to all who believe in a personal immortality and the possibility of damnation. "Whose faith is but his pride" is an ironic reversal of the traditional sin of pride, the same treatment of pride appears in the "Satyr Against Man- kind." Seneca's image of the classical abode of all the dead is changed into the Christian hell. Rochester does retain Seneca's reference to Cerberus as a "grim, grisly dog," a detail that shores up ridicule of both myths: For Hell and the foul fiend that rules God's everlasting fiery jails (Devised by rogues, dreaded by fools), With his grim, grisly dog that keeps the door, Are senseless stories, idle tales, Dreams, whimseys, and no more. (13-18) Erskine-Hill says that the "Troades" is among those poems that fail to display an "Augustan assurance" in a "stable and satisfying pattern of values."7 It is one thing to assert that all metaphysical 6 Seneca, "Troades," Tragedies, tr.

Imbedded in the poem are value-laden words that we shall encounter again, such as "pride," "slavish," "rogues," "fools." These imply a standard for ap- prehending reality and for judging human relations, and, in terms of the context, one that does not rest on a scale of other-worldly or God- directed standards. If the translations from Lucretius and Seneca indicate Rochester's rejection of Christian mythology and a probable sympathy with Epi- curean ontology, the poem "Upon Nothing" would seem by its mock- ery of speculative philosophy to be a complete denial of metaphysics. Here, however, the problem of interpretation is complicated by the tradition of paradox in which Rochester was working. "Upon Noth- ing" is an example of the paradoxical encomium, praise of a subject in fact ridiculous. The equivocation intrinsic to the genre is a major reason for the wildly variable interpretations of the poem. It has been judged all the way from trivial to profound; from grim parody, pure fun, nihilistic, to the "archetypal expression" of the "inverted world of Augustan satire."8 The paradox of "Upon Nothing" leaves open all of these possibilities-but I think they can be placed in a context that tempers value judgments and makes the metaphysical implica- tions clearer. Since Rochester was always willing to resist hard and fast tradi- tional categories, the word "nothing" would hold a natural attrac- tion. However, the long history of nihils, beginning with the pre- Socratics, makes Rochester traditional rather than revolutionary. Henry Knight Miller has demonstrated the popularity of "nothings" in England between 1600 and 1800.9 Especially important to the tradition was Jean Passerat's sixteenth-century Latin poem on "noth- ing," which was widely disseminated and translated, and which Dr. Johnson pointed to as a possible influence on Rochester. Such liter- ary and rhetorical performances did not necessarily imply the impiety that contemporary readers are prone to discover. From ancient times logicians have recognized that affirming Noth- ing transforms it into a positive entity.

Nothing is "elder brother to Shade"; he can beget and embrace; he is a ruler of a formerly "peaceful realm." In short, Nothing is Brother, Creator, Father, and Ruler-no different from the conventional anthropomorphic God of Christianity. (Nothing also takes an unconventional turn in the course of the poem by changing sex-acquiring a bosom and a womb.) The mock-heroic treatment ridicules the usual personifica- tion of a Supreme Being, although it does not represent a denial of His existence. As already noted, Rochester did not reject the idea of God; but, like Hobbes, he did not believe His attributes knowable.10 More central than the challenge to Christian orthodoxy is the irony turned upon abstractions in general, the apparatus of systematic phi- losophy from the time of Plato and Aristotle: Something versus Nothing, Time, Place, Body, What (probably for Quiddity), Form, Matter, Is and Is Not, True or False. Rochester reduces all the Ideas to one, Nothing. John Harold Wilson is correct, I think, in seeing the poem as a "blast at rationalism,"" but the kind of rationalism needs defining. Rationalism and rational processes should be distinguished. Rochester is not antirationalistic or against reason as a faculty of man; he is, however, antirationalism or opposed to a priori knowl- edge, independent of experience. In Platonic thought, for example, universals such as "Time" or "Form" had eternal and unchanging reality, apart from any concrete manifestation. Rochester is impelled by the same distrust of these words, of hypostatized fictions, that is found in the philosophies of Bacon and Hobbes. Surely Vivian de Sola Pinto missed the mark when he saw Rochester overcoming the "horror" of a "world from which spirit has been banished by the new science and the new philosophy."'12 Rather, the poem is in the spirit of the new science and the new empirical philosophy. The satire on scholastic argument has also led Ronald Berman to overstate the case for a basic materialism in the poem. From the stanza, 10 Thomas Hobbes, The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, ed. Sir William Molesworth (London, 1845), III, 351-52.

(4-6) he reasons as follows: The premise that follows is that form is merely a contingency of matter. The conclusion is that matter imposes its character on form. Nothingness or chaos first characterizes matter and then such derivative things as morality. In Milton, as in Genesis, form had sanctified matter, but in Rochester it only subserves it.13 From this particular triplet we cannot determine whether "Some- thing" is equivalent to matter or form. If we were forced to decide, the next line "Something, the general attribute of all" would incline the scale toward form rather than matter, since form traditionally determined attributes. Neither contingency nor priority is spelled so neatly as Berman finds, for in stanza five Rochester writes: Matter, the wicked'st offspring of thy race, By Form assisted, flew from thy embrace. (13-14) Ironically, Berman's argument utilizes the very abstract entities, such as form and matter, that Rochester denigrates. They are the "blind philosophies" of stanza ten, philosophies manufactured in the mind without recourse to seeing or perceptual evidence: Great Negative, how vainly would the wise Inquire, define, distinguish, teach, devise, Didst thou not stand to point their blind philosophies! (28-30) In the same class as the "wise" are the "divines," or priests (of what- ever persuasion): Though mysteries are barred from laic eyes, And the divine alone with warrant pries Into thy bosom, where the truth in private lies. (22-24) These two stanzas not only support Rochester's attack on metaphysi- cal speculation but also represent the ethical turn in the last half of 13 Ronald Berman, "Rochester and the Defeat of the Senses," Kenyon Review, 26 (1964), 359.</page><page sequence="7">ROCHESTER'S PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES 189 the poem. When man is destroyed by "Turncoat time" (19-21), the destruction is beyond his control-just as "Devouring time swallows us whole" in the "Troades" translation. But the satire on philosophers and divines seems to imply their intellectual corruption is not a nec- essary condition. Tlle same is true of the depreciation of leaders of the state: politicians and statesmen, monarchs and princes. The impeachment then moves from the heads of state to the na- tions themselves: French truth, Dutch prowess, British policy, Hibemian learning, Scotch civility, Spaniards' dispatch, Danes' wit are mainly seen in thee. (46-48) Like philosophic abstractions, such nationalistic qualities have no real referents. The poem culminates in a value statement through the meiotic conjunction of "whores' vows," in which no one is likely to have faith, with "The great man's gratitude to his best friend" and "kings' promises." For all their wit, the last stanzas of "Upon Nothing" are clearly in the gloomy vein of the Tory satirists. Rochester disdains man's capa- city for self-delusion and his incapacity for fidelity to the duties of office and friendship. The ethical dimension is separable from the epistemological and metaphysical: in "Upon Nothing" he plays the libertin, in the tradition of a "free thinker," but he does not play the libertine, who acknowledges no obligations beyond personal gratifi- cation. Otherwise, he could scarcely mock infidelity. In a sense the poem breaks in two, although the ethical meaning in the second half draws its fire from the paradox and satirical tone established in the first. The weight of the tradition of paradox makes it difficult to certify what part of the initial argument Rochester "be- lieves." We see, however, a willingness to discredit Christian cos- mology and a distrust of realism (as opposed to nominalism) in spec- ulative philosophy. The ethical position, on the other hand, is not relativistic. There is a right way of human behavior, which "ought" to be. Whether moral progress is in fact possible is another question. "A Satyr against Reason and Mankind," as Vieth titles it, stands as a complement to "Upon Nothing" and as an extension of the phi- losophical position discovered up to this point. The denial of immor- tality recurs: man is left to "eternal night," and at death "Huddled in dirt the reasoning engine lies." As in "Upon Nothing," we find scorn</page><page sequence="8">190 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES for misled divines and philosophers and for mankind's inability to live up to his commitments of office and friendship. And the diatribe against reason is essentially the same rejection of abstractions and the philosophy of rationalism found in "Upon Nothing" and in the translation from "Troades." What the "Satyr" adds is a fuller com- prehension of Rochester's epistemology and psychology. Before we look at the epistemological argument, two interrelated problems should be mentioned: the role of the persona and the "bor- rowing" from Boileau's Satire VIII. The "Satyr," like Boileau's VIII, is a descendant of classical for- mal verse satire, embodying a quasi-dramatic situation in which the satirist advances his argument against an adversarius. In Boileau's Satire, "le docteur," presumably a theologian, is an implied presence whose objections are reported or anticipated at intervals. In the "Satyr Against Mankind" the adversary, described as "some formal band and beard," is announced in line 46, speaks his piece, and then is heard no more. Rochester's imitation-if it is an imitation, critics not having arrived at unanimity on the question-begins and ends with the same kind of "happy beast" paradox found in Satire VIII.14 In both Boileau and Rochester man's ability to reason is not denied, but his misuse of reason makes him, if not below the animals, cer- tainly the most foolish. Rochester's persona would be "a dog, a monkey, or a bear/ Or anything but that vain animal/ Who is so proud of being rational" (5-7). He ends on the same note as Boileau: "Man differs more from man, than man from beast," although the line seems to be a transla- tion of Montaigne's "plus le diff6rence de tel homme a tel homme que de tel animal a tel homme."'1' In Rochester misapplied reason takes a course similar to Boileau's: Stumbling from thought to thought, falls headlong down Into doubt's boundless sea, where, like to drown, Books bear him up awhile and make him try To swim with bladders of philosophy. (18-2 1) 14 See George Boas, The Happy Beast: in French Thought of the Seventeenth Century (Baltimore, 1933). 15 This relationship is surmised by S. F. Crocker, "Rochester's Satire Against Mankind: A Study of Certain Aspects of the Background," West Virginia Univer- sity Studies: III, Philological Papers, 2 (1937), 71. Paul C. Davies in "Rochester and Boileau: A Reconsideration," Comparative Literature, 21 (1969), 348-55, builds a stronger case for Boileau's direct influence.</page><page sequence="9">ROCHESTER'S PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES 191 The echoes of Boileau continue in Rochester's development of the superior wisdom of beasts who attain "By surest means, the ends at which they aim" (1 18), the ends being survival under the press of in- stinct and natural law. Where Boileau's indictment of man ranges over the various passions that corrupt reason, Rochester focuses on the source of all vices, fear. What I would contend is that the technique of formal verse satire and the parallels with Boileau do not make the persona's role in "A Satyr Against Mankind" merely a literary performance in a seventeenth-century genre. The poem conveys a strong impression of Rochester as speaker, especially in view of its philosophical con- sistency with other works and with Bishop Burnet's report of Roches- ter's professed beliefs. The similarities to Boileau and a simultaneous compatibility with Montaigne suggest that Rochester's thought was strongly influenced by philosophical skepticism. Cultivated readers of England knew Montaigne and his successors, and scholars knew Sextus Empiricus, through whom the ancient Greek skepticism of Pyrrho was transmitted. The word "skepticism" has been applied so loosely that it is worth examining in the context of sixteenth and seventeenth-century thought. Philosophical skepticism is not to be equated with religious "unbelief"; Christianity and skepticism are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many sixteenth and seventeenth-century skeptics asserted their sincere belief in the Christian religion. Skepticism is a method of inquiry coupled with an epistemology based on the question: Is it possible to know with certainty the truth of any proposition about the real nature of things? The Academic or the dogmatic skeptic an- swers no, since the evidence of the senses is contradictory and any rational argument can be contradicted. The Pyrrhonist skeptic, on the other hand, suspends judgment, since to him the evidence per- mits neither a yes nor a no. The true Pyrrhonist is anticonceptual (that is, antirationalistic insofar as he doubts intellectual abstrac- tions); he may hold that all of man's information or "knowledge" is derived from the senses, even though such information cannot be established as either universally true or untrue.16' 16 The summary is drawn from Richard H. Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Descartes, rev. ed. (Assen, The Netherlands, 1964) and also from Arne Naess, Scepticism (New York, 1968).</page><page sequence="10">192 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES This brand of skepticism became an important influence in West- ern Europe after the writings of Sextus Empiricus (c. A.D. 200) were published in the sixteenth century, and especially in France because of Montaigne and his disciples. "Nouveau Pyrrhonisme" became in- extricably mixed with the French libertin movement, which evolved from "free thinking" into "free behavior," although one does not necessarily lead to the other. The terms "skeptic" and "libertine," when applied to Rochester, have a tendency in the critical literature to get out of hand: "skeptic" often seems to imply "atheist," or, more tolerantly, a man of indecision or confusion; "libertine" almost al- ways appears in a context that connotes vicious action or at best an unbridled sexual appetite. When stripped of their negative connota- tions, both terms can with justice point up Rochester's continuity with a literary movement and his sympathy with contemporary intel- lectual currents. An investigation of the basic premises of the "Satyr Against Man- kind" within this historical frame will show that the poem is neither, as has been claimed, "a terrible indictment of human reason,"'17 nor an example of "nihilism."'8 It is skeptical in the philosophical sense; it is a meld of Epicurean and British empiricism, as will become ap- parent; but reason, properly used, and ethical standards are both affirmed. The movement of the poem parallels exactly that of "Upon Nothing," beginning with a poetic protest against speculative reason, or the unverifiable concepts of religion and philosophy, and proceed- ing to ethical questions. The "Satyr," of course, is far more explicit, and less open to the charge of wit for wit's sake. The basic epistemological premise is that there are two kinds of reason (reasoning or ratiocination is not denied), one wrong, one right. The two are distinguished by the nature of the evidence on which any proposition rests, and for Rochester the only admissible source of knowledge is the senses: Thus, whilst against false reasoning I inveigh, I own right reason, which I would obey: That reason which distinguishes by sense. (98-100) The definition of "right reason" is an ironic inversion of the con- 17 Crocker, "Rochester's Satire Against Mankind," p. 57. 18 Vivian de Sola Pinto, "John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester," in From Dryden to Johnson, ed.

Right reason in these contexts denoted a conjunction of logically derived metaphysics and morality, which seventeenth- century science was in the process of separating. Rochester's trans- formation of "right reason" into that "which distinguishes by sense" is a revolt against that tradition but not a one-man rebellion: he was following the drift of seventeenth-century science and empirical phi- losophy, along with the earlier patterns of skepticism and classical Epicureanism. Rochester's affinity with empirical epistemology is indicated more than once in the "Satyr Against Mankind." He castigates the kind of reasoning represented by the divines Ingelo, Patrick, and Sibbes with the pejorative adjective "supernatural" (73-76); he satirizes the Band and Beard who boasts "We take a flight beyond material sense" (67). The examples are consistent with the generalization: The senses are too gross, and he'll contrive A sixth, to contradict the other five. (8-9) Out of a nonexistent "sixth sense" are multiplied equally nonexistent conceptual entities, the "nonsense and impossibilities" (89) of both the religious and the academic philosopher. Their rationalism, their a priori reasoning cut loose from the senses, is a vain desire to pierce the limits of the universe (the idea appears twice: 68-69 and 84-85). Theirs are the "bladders of philosophy" gained from books not ex- perience (20-21). The attack on this kind of knowledge occurs again in the famous ignis fatuus metaphor: Reason, an ignis fatuus in the mind, Which, leaving light of nature, sense, behind. (12-13) The senses, the natural equipment of the body, are the true "light." Like Rochester's juggling of the words "pride" and "right reason," his metaphor of light overturns conventional usage. The association of light and reason goes back to Plato and was being reiterated by the Cambridge Platonists; Rochester turns their light into illusion. The Puritans' "inner light" is an additional target, since it offered cer- tainty through a transcendence of the senses. The substitution of the true light of the senses for the false light of Platonists and Puritans alike is a way of satirizing a hackneyed comparison while arguing his own position.</page><page sequence="12">194 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Whether Rochester in "Satyr Against Mankind" means that the senses yield certainty is unclear and may be a philosophical point too precise for his purpose, although the question is crucial to any attempt to classify him as a Pyrrhonist. Rochester's reference to man's "certain instinct" (10) does not necessarily mean that instinct and perception are the same; however, the position of the term in lines 8-11 leaves open the possibility that "certain instinct" is syn- onymous with the senses. A second influence, which is not congenial with the epistemologi- cal relativism of the skeptics, is that of classical Epicureanism. In Epicurean philosophy sensation is the only source of truth, and it is certain truth. We have already seen Rochester's translation of the passage about the gods from Lucretius. An oblique relationship to Epicurean epistemology can also be seen in the translation from "Troades" ("After death, nothing is"). Epicurus wrote, "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."'"1 A kindred epistemology is that of Hobbes, whose probable influ- ence on Rochester's "Satyr Against Mankind" has been argued by Thomas J. Fujimura.20 There is general agreement that Rochester was exposed to both Hobbes's presence and his work. Although the source is not entirely reliable, we learn from Parsons' funeral sermon that Rochester after his conversion is supposed to have said "that that absurd and foolish philosophy, which the world so much ad- mired, propagated by the late Mr. Hobbes and others, had undone him and many more of the best parts in the nation."'2' Hobbes's metaphysical materialism, however, receives no explicit statement in the "Satyr Against Mankind." (It is possible to adopt an epistemology of sense perception and still be a metaphysical idealist, as Bishop Berkeley demonstrates.) Where the "Satyr" is most Hobbesian, as Fujimura has seen,22 is the reliance on the senses and the rejection of hypostatized entities that are corruptions of language. At the opening of the Leviathan (and elsewhere), Hobbes writes, "there is no conception in a man's mind, which hath not at first, 19 Quoted by Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (New York, 1945), p. 247. 20 Thomas J.

Thus, Rochester's epistemology is congruent with that of Hobbes on at least two scores: knowledge is derivative from the senses, and words for which there is no correspondent in perception have no reality. And following Hobbes's contention that the function of right reasoning or thought is utilitarian, for the "benefit of mankind,"27 we can now consider the ethical premises that Rochester builds on this epistemology. Right reason by these terms is to govern one's actions, and actions should result in happiness in this life: But thoughts are given for action's government; Where action ceases, thought's impertinent. Our sphere of action is life's happiness, And he who thinks beyond, thinks like an ass. (94-97) So far, this is not necessarily the ethics of a hedonist. Subsequent amplification complicates the issue: That reason which distinguishes by sense And gives us rules of good and ill from thence, That bounds desires with a refomling will To keep 'em more in vigor, not to kill. 23 Hobbes, Works, III, 1. 24 Ibid., 71, 35-36. 25 Ibid., 23. 26 Ibid., 17. 2' Ibid., 36-37.</page><page sequence="14">196 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Your reason hinders, mine helps to enjoy, Renewing appetites yours would destroy. (100-105) At first glance Rochester seems to be restating the psychological hedonism of Hobbes, who writes that "continual success in obtaining those things which a man from time to time desireth, that is to say, continual prospering, is that men call FELICITY; I mean the felicity of this life."28 And again: For there is no such finis ultimus, utmost aim, nor summum bonum, greatest good, as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philosophers.... Felicity is a continual progress of the desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being still but the way to the latter. The cause whereof is, that the object of man's desire, is not to enjoy once only, and for one instant of time; but to assure for ever, the way of his future desire.29 The passage explicates Rochester's "renewing appetites" and at the same time advocates a thoroughgoing psychological hedonism. Val- ues are ipso facto relative to the individual. But the "reforming will" of Rochester shows a divergence from Hobbes and provides an open- ing wedge against relativism or complete libertinism (in the popular sense). As a determinist, Hobbes made no allowance for a will that could reform or control. In his words: In deliberation, the last appetite, or aversion, immediately adhering to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that we call the WILL; the act, not the faculty, or willing. And beasts that have deliberation, must necessarily also have Will.30 This is behaviorism, and I submit that Rochester's ethical argument moves in another direction in the "Satyr." The beasts are "wise" in that they fulfill their ends according to nature's laws. They are "pressed by necessity" (131); whereas "Man undoes himself to do himself no good" (132). In short, "external nature" is morally neutral, but man is not, for he "With voluntary pains works his distress, / Not through necessity, but wantonness" (137-38). Allowance for voluntarism, a "reforming will," is allow- ance for choice. Man can choose among pleasures; some are better, and some are worse. The position points away from Hobbes and 28Ibid., 51. 29 Ibid., 85. 80 Ibid., 48.</page><page sequence="15">ROCHESTER'S PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES 197 toward the kind of self-determinism found in Epicurus. Epicurus, no less than Hobbes, pays obeisance to the demands of nature, but his differentiation among pleasures makes him an ethical hedonist rather than a psychological one. I think that this is the category in which Rochester properly belongs. Otherwise, the cata- logue of vices in "A Satyr Against Mankind" would make no logical sense. Rochester's indignation at hypocrisy, pride, vanity, "false free- doms, holy cheats, formal lies" (177) must be grounded on a choice of values that are not merely relative to individual pleasure. He clearly postulates an "ought" against what is: the just man of the court, the upright statesman, the "meek, humble man of honest sense" (212) of the church. If the disparagement of man does not seem to follow from the earlier defense of desires and appetites, it is well to keep in view the traditional separation in ethics between the good and the right. That Rochester seems to advance pleasure as the summum bonum in no way requires him to say that each individual's pursuit of pleasure is right. What is right can involve standards for the great- est pleasure for a man in the long run or for mankind in general. Nor is there any logical contradiction in Rochester's personal failure or his cynicism about society. The ills of a man or a society are attrib- utable to faulty functioning of right reason, as defined by Rochester. Much has been made of the passage on fear (139-56) as proof of a Hobbesian psychology that nullifies any moral idealism. Fujimura holds that Rochester's basic motivation of man, fear, is a departure from Hobbes, who emphasizes the desire for power.-" Yet Hobbes pictures a state of nature in which the equality of abilities among men give rise to "diffidence"; from this diffidence proceeds the de- sire for mastery that results in a state of war. The Hobbesian shadow hovers over Rochester's lines: "Whilst wretched man is still in arms for fear./For fear he arms, and is of arms afraid" (138-40). They suggest that man has not left Hobbes's state of nature-and by ex- tension what passes for civilization is a hollow sham. As we have seen, Rochester does not say this is a necessary state of affairs (137- 38). In effect, he preserves the dichotomy between what is and what ought to be, even though in fact he finds men motivated by fear. A second shadow hovers over the lines on fear, that of Epicurus. Classical Epicureanism has been called a "gospel of liberation from the burden of fear."32 The fear engendered by religion is a note com- 31 Fujimura, "Rochester's 'Satyr Against Mankind,"' pp. 385-86. 32 Russell, History of Western Philosophy, p. 250.</page><page sequence="16">198 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES mon to Rochester's translation of Seneca and to the "Satyr," although in the latter the evils resulting from fear embrace all of man's activi- ties. The elimination of fear in Epicurus is, of course, part of the program for achieving imperturbability, or ataraxia, a state similarly desired by the Pyrrhonist skeptics. In Rochester's work, the "veine of satyr" that runs through all but a few lyrics is concrete testimony that he was psychologically unable to attain that state of imperturbability toward which his philosophical sympathies, both metaphysical and ethical, should have led. The absence of ataraxia in Rochester is, I would argue, the source of his art, and, paradoxically, the reason that some commentators see him as a poet in search of belief or of identity. He was aware of the contradictions in the human condition, including his own, but he was not intellectually confused. The persistent tracks of classical Epicureanism, of skepticism and its offspring libertinism, and of British empiricism in the translations from Lucretius and Seneca, "Upon Nothing," and "A Satyr against Reason and Mankind" attest to a mind turned in a single direction. If the nature of the sample seems loaded in the cause of a hypoth- esis, I answer that the same intellectual predispositions can be traced in most of the poems on love and sex. Let us take as an example a short song, "Love and Life," which on the surface is a conventional poem in the Cavalier tradition on the worn theme of constancy. Here is a deceptively simple poem in a genre that was enormously popular in the Restoration: All my past life is mine no more; The flying hours are gone, Like transitory dreams given o'er Whose images are kept in store By memory alone. Whatever is to come is not: How can it then be mine? The present moment's all my lot, And that, as fast as it is got, Phyllis, is wholly thine. Then talk not of inconstancy, False hearts, and broken vows; If I, by miracle, can be This livelong minute true to thee, 'Tis all that heaven allows.</page><page sequence="17">ROCHESTER'S PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES 199 The argument of the poem once more brings us up against Epi- curus, Montaigne, and Hobbes. To Pinto the poem is an "expression of the Epicurean ideal of a life lived for momentary pleasure. This ideal, however, is seen not from the viewpoint of the greedy sensual- ist, but from that of the spiritual explorer who wants to escape from time and to find an experience that will transcend all ordinary ex- periences."33 Less mystically than Pinto, I find the poem, for all its poignancy, a witty exercise in logic and epistemology. In the light of Rochester's definition of "right reason" in the "Satyr Against Mankind," we can infer an application of Epicureanism in this poem different from that seen by Pinto. Rochester's definition, we have seen, is compatible with the Epicurean notion that all ideas are traceable to sense impressions. The sense impression per se is true. Such a theory creates a serious problem about the nature of Time, a problem to which Rochester is sensitive. When he says his past life is "mine no more," he means that there is no criterion of truth for the past in the context of "real time" in an external world; all he can vouch for are the true images of sense impressions in the context of psychological time. Further, in a theory of knowledge in which sense impressions are true, it is impossible to make any pre- diction about the future with certainty; any prediction is mere opin- ion until the event does in fact occur. Hence, he says, "Whatever is to come is not:/ How can it then be mine?" Now, concepts such as "constancy," which are themselves mere combinations of sense im- pressions stored in the memory, make an unwarranted extrapolation to future events and are inherently uncertain. Therefore, the poet can be "true" only this "livelong minute" because only the immediate perception is certain knowledge. The argument is a clever expression of Epicurean epistemology to counter the demands of love. At the same tlme, "Love and Life" points to a continuity of skep- tical influence, since the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century skeptics also believed the senses were the source of knowledge (albeit an un- trustworthy source). Their identity with Rochester's thinking in "Love and Life" can be detected in a passage from Montaigne, quoted by Rosalie Colie in her discussion of him as "one of the earliest writers to force the illusion of immediacy on his readers": I describe not the essence, but the passage; not a passage from age to age, 33 Pinto, Enthusiast in Wit, p. 58.</page><page sequence="18">200 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES or as people reckon, from seaven yeares to seaven, but from day to day, from minute to minute. My history must be fitted to the present.34 The poem can also be related to Hobbes, who, as we have seen, places no credence in knowledge not originating in the senses. To buttress the interpretation of "Love and Life," I offer these lines from the Leviathan: The present only has a being in nature; things past have a being in the mem- ory only, but things to come have no being at all; the future being but a fiction of the mind, applying the sequels of actions past, to the actions that are present.35 The not-so-simple song is no less than a poetic application of this statement. Although I think we cannot hold Rochester to the rigor of a con- sistent body of beliefs, I do think we can adduce from these constants -the Epicurean, the skeptical, and the empirical-some general premises that underlie most of his work. First, he rejects Christian eschatology. That there is no immor- tality, no place of rewards and punishments other than this life, is enunciated in the translation of Lucretius and Seneca, and deducible from the anticonceptualism in "Upon Nothing" and "A Satyr Against Mankind." The rejection of Christian orthodoxy is conjoined with a contempt for a society whose intellectual life is constrained by that authority. Second, Rochester draws from skepticism and empiricism a dis- trust of a priori reasoning and favors a theory of knowledge based on evidence of the senses or perception. Whether he shares the Pyrrhonist doubt in the certainty of such evidence is not clear. I am inclined to believe, however, that with Hobbes and Epicurus he feels that perception is infallible. Third, although Rochester uses the word "happiness" (and in some poems "felicity"), his ethic is based on pleasure as the summum bonum, and, concomitantly, pain as "evil" or "bad." This does not, and need not, commit him to relativism. Some pleasures are patently superior to others. The assessment of better or worse pleasures and the problem of an immediate end versus one remote in time are cen- 84 Rosalie Colie, Paradoxia Epidemica: The Renaissance Tradition of Paradox (Princeton, 1966), pp. 377, 376. 35 Hobbes, Works, III, 15.</page><page sequence="19">ROCHESTER'S PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES 201 tral to the value judgments in the last part of "Upon Nothing," to the so-called misanthropy in "A Satyr Against Mankind," and to tlhe negativism toward eros in "Love and Life." These philosophical assumptions can be held without contradic- tion. They are coherent with one another, and they are coherent with some poetic characteristics that on the surface may seem to indicate perplexity, unbelief, or just plain contrariness. For one thing, the prevalence of obscenities and sex follows from an episte- mology of sense perception and an opposition to Christian ortho- doxy. Obscenity affirms concreteness as against lofty abstractions- the "nonsense and impossibilities" of divines and philosophers, and the inflated language of romantic lovers. Sex symbolizes the intensity and immediacy of sense experience and supports hedonism, even though, as I have said, the quality of sex or any other experience is judged by a scale of pleasures. For another, the frequent use of par- ody and paradox is a logical consequence of Rochester's empirical and ethical positions, because they are techniques that mock delu- sions about love and life.
