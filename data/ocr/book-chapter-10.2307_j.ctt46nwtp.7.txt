His alcohol level was about 1.9 when they tested it,  probably about 2.4 when he went over. Broke the fi fth vertebrae in his neck,  couldn’t hold his head up. He should have been dead or at least paralyzed.  He fought the paramedics the whole time.” Further on, where the road curves sharply to the right: “A guy driving a dump truck, doing construction . . . this other guy says  he passed him on this curve doing about seventy. He hit the wall here head- on, crushed his cab down to about two feet.” And a little further, above Calf Creek: “A motorcyclist hit the cement barrier here and went over.” I examine the drop, keeping one eye on the road. The rider must have  been pitched a hundred feet through the air, must have fallen at least as far.  There’s no way he could have lived. The Heap wobbles a little as we come  around. “Don’t worry,” I say, “I won’t get you killed.” “If you do, my wife will kill you,” says Davis. Davis, the retired director of Anasazi State Park in Boulder, is shorter  than me, and he’s got two prosthetic knees, but when we get to the point  where Highway 12 crosses the Escalante River, he takes the lead scrambling  up the sandstone slope. We reach a shelf of rock and hike back to a wall  of Fremont petroglyphs; a wedge fi gure with wavy lines radiating from its  forehead, and bighorn sheep. Sheep are the most commonly depicted big game animal in Fremont  petroglyphs, he tells me. Second to deer, they were also the most important  big game animal in their diet. “Here’s a funny fi gure,” says Davis. “It’s almost like he’s upside down— Interesting [panel] here. Don’t know if it symbolizes a tree or it could be a  dragonfl y. And then it looks like an antenna or something on top. I don’t  know what it is.” There are lines chiseled in the rock around one of the sheep where some- one has tried to wedge it out.  “I can’t lose sleep over it,” Davis says of the vandalism, but he still seems  irked. </page> <page sequence="4"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     213 Further on, he points me to a recess high in the rock, beneath which 120  positive, white Fremont handprints are arranged in four rows. The climb  is steep and I use my binoculars to get a closer view, but I can’t tell if they  belong to more than one individual. I wonder if I could discern fi ngerprints,  or how large the artist’s or artists’ hands would be compared to mine. We move up to a dwelling site underneath an overhang. I would never  have recognized it as such, but Larry points out the raised foundation, the  cisterns in the fl oor, the groves in the wall where the Fremont sharpened  their spear points. There’s a pinyon log nearby that Davis believes is con- nected to the site. It would be “fun,” he tells me, to analyze a core sample  from it to come up with an approximate date for the site’s occupation. Da- vis also shows me hammer stones, egg-shaped rocks with distinctive radial  fractures which developed from being knocked against the sandstone several  hundred years ago. The site has been picked over, dug up, looted. Larry’s pragmatism, his  congeniality, seem to fade. He tells me, “This is as much a part of our cul- tural heritage as anything else. We need to teach respect and we didn’t. I  reviewed a history text a few years ago and it had a whole chapter on the  political climate in Spain prior to the voyage of Columbus but only a para- graph or two about what Columbus found here—the people—but after that  it was just about European history and they just ignored the Indians. You  know, we look at Indians as less important and that’s how we treat these  things.” Across the canyon, there are kids rappelling off Boynton Overlook, down  to the sand dune at the cliff base. Their shouting and laughter reverberates  off the stone walls.  Davis tells me about a helicopter ride he took some years back. The pilot  told him, “I’m going to take you to this ruin nobody’s been in. And we just  hovered in front of this overhang. Nice little ruin and the doorway was still  sealed. And it’s so sheer that you couldn’t come in from below, and it over- hangs so far you couldn’t rope in from the top. So it’s just there. And it’s kind  of neat. . . . “And then, twenty-fi ve years ago a friend of mine had a fl ying service over  in Canyonlands. His name was Dick Smith. He fl ew me into an area, told  me ‘I’m going to show you some ruins nobody’s been in before, Larry.’ Flew  me right past these ruins in the cliff and I’ll bet you fi fty percent of them still  had the doorway sealed. We were going to go see if we could work our way  into that canyon and a year or so later, he was killed in a plane crash.” “You know, the vandals now are using helicopters, so they can get  into any place. Earl Shumway over in Blanding, he’s probably the king of </page> <page sequence="5"> 214     H i g hw ay  12 vandals. He served time in federal prison and he said, ‘I carry a .44 magnum.  The next person that catches me isn’t going to leave in the same position he  found me in.’” Here’s an article about Shumway from High Country News, September 4,  1995. A Pothunter is nailed at last By Shea Anderson Earl Shumway, the notorious pillager of Anasazi burial sites in Utah, has been  convicted of looting. Shumway had built a record of illegal pillaging of historic  sites since 1984, bragging that he was untouchable (HCN, 12/26/94). When asked by the Salt Lake Tribune to describe Shumway, Utah state ar- cheologist Dave Madsen was brief: “Pothunter. Looter. Or just scumbag. You  probably can’t print any of the other words I’d use.” Shumway barely escaped a conviction in 1986 by testifying against his  friend Buddy Black in the high-profi le Basket Case, in which the two looters  excavated a collection of Anasazi baskets. That strategy kept him free for a  while—Shumway got away with probation. Now, a Moab helicopter pilot has  testifi ed in federal court that Shumway offered him thousands of dollars worth  of Anasazi baskets to pinpoint certain sites from the air, including one within  Canyonlands National Park. But pilot Michael Miller said he realized Shumway wasn’t going to split the  proceeds from artifact sales with him, much less pay for any of the helicopter’s  gas. Law enforcement offi cials expect Shumway’s Nov. 13 sentencing to be  stiff: he was convicted of four violations of the Archaeological Resources Act.  Shumway’s offenses could net him up to 15 years in prison. According to Davis, the helicopter pilot brought his mechanic along with  them and it was he who fi nally turned the two in, after Shumway unwrapped  a child’s body from an Anasazi grave and “chucked” it. Shumway got fi ve  years and now he’s free again. “They make so much money,” Davis tells me, “There’s a collection . . .  they call it the ‘Shumway Collection.’ They wanted to sell it to the state one  time so myself and another guy went over to appraise it and we had to go  to three different houses and the family rooms would be covered with pots.  None of the utilitarian pottery. I asked this guy what’s in the boxes along the  wall and he said that’s the crudware, the corrugated stuff. The other stuff was  all black-on-white, red-on-orange, black-on-red, some of the most wonder- ful pots, something like 320 pieces in there. We, of course, recommended  that the state not buy them because all you’re doing is subsidizing an illegal  activity. I asked him where’d that stuff come from and he says, ‘came from  </page> <page sequence="6"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     215 patent property.’ A lot of times they’d go out and stake a mineral claim on an  archaeological site and then go in and dig it. It’s still illegal.” “I’ve said it a lot of times, what they ought to do is stick the IRS on these  guys. They sold that collection for seventy thousand dollars, to the Navajo  Development Council. It’s probably one of the best type collections of Ana- sazi pottery, there’s a value to it, but there would have been more of a value  if you could have seen where it came from, what the pots were associated  with, what kind of site it was.” We hike out on a thin ledge to another panel of petroglyphs: horned,  limbless anthropomorphs, dots and other abstract symbols and one hour- glass-shaped hunter pointing a diminutive bow and arrow at a nearby moun- tain sheep. Yesterday’s dark clouds with their virga trails, what Davis calls  “teasers,” moved on in the night and it’s a clear, sunny day, and Larry takes  in the view; the shallow “river,” the scraggly cottonwoods on its banks, the  cliffs on the far side. It would have been an ideal place to watch for game, but  that aspect of the view doesn’t interest him right now. “Very peaceful here,” he says. Davis will be talking to you  and he’ll develop this shifty  half-smile; he might reveal  what he’s thinking and he  might keep it his own private  joke. He’s contemplative, de- liberate, not a fast talker, and  he’ll drift out of a conversation  into his own thoughts. I spoke  with him in his house in Boul- der the day before our hike and  that smile crossed his lips as he  described a trip over Highway  12 where it rose across the east  side of the Aquarius Plateau. “One of the real pretty  times I remember on that  mountain, and there’s been a  Right and next two pages: Petroglyphs near the confluence of the Escalante River and Calf Creek </page> <page sequence="7"> 216     H i g hw ay  12 lot of them, but I was coming over, it was late at night, it was in the winter- time and there was a lot of snow. The pine trees were covered. I was on the  other side and I could look out toward the Henry Mountains. There was a  full moon and the whole country was just silver, and there was an inversion  and there were a lot of clouds down in that valley between the Henrys and  me, and I just sat there, in my parked truck. It’s just one of those moments.” As we walk back down to the river, I pass through a scattering of rocks  and burnt sticks in the sand, nothing spectacular, but out of place. Davis  confi rms my suspicions. “You’re walking through a site,” he tells me. This meager collection of stones and sticks is what archaeologists call a  “lithic scatter,” and according to Davis, it describes the majority of sites in  the national monument. “Usually, when someone  looks for a site, they’re think- ing of a granary or a structure of  some kind, but most sites aren’t  like that.” Earlier, I asked for Davis’s  opinion on the migration of the  Fremont’s neighbors, the Ana- sazi, out of southern Utah and  he attributed it to a combination  of drought and friction between  various Anasazi factions. There  is a large and growing body of  scientifi c evidence to back up  Larry’s belief in internecine con- fl ict as a causative element in the  withdrawal of puebloan Indians  from much of the Four Corners  in the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries, but such views have  characteristically been met with  hostility from the archaeologi- cal community. Jonathan Haas  and Winifred Creamer are two  of a handful of experts who aren’t  afraid to use “warfare” in the  same sentence as “Anasazi,” but  </page> <page sequence="8"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     217 they appear to have paid a price for it. Their paper, “The Role of Warfare in  the Pueblo III Period,” begins: Because we have already succeeded in irritating most archaeologists in the  Southwest with the seemingly preposterous idea that warfare played a cen- tral role in the Kayenta area during the Pueblo III period (Haas and Cre- maer, 1993), we thought it would be interesting to take the idea even further.  Basically we argue in this chapter that warfare was endemic throughout the  northern Southwest in the thirteenth century, and that any explanations of  settlement, political relations, and abandonment must incorporate warfare as  a central causal variable (Haas, Creamer, 205). And they cite a lot of analagous historical evidence to support their thesis:  the historical puebloans tendency to retreat to higher ground when threat- ened; the conquistadores’ eyewitness accounts of pueblos destroyed in the  </page> <page sequence="9"> 218     H i g hw ay  12 course of tribal warfare; the revolt of 1680, in which the puebloans rose up  in unison and killed or exiled the Spanish priests who had enslaved them  and tried to beat their religion out of them; and the vestigial war societies of  the modern pueblos. They also cite the coalescing of smaller, more isolated  communities into larger villages, as with the later aggregation of Mormon  settlements during the Black Hawk War, and the siting of pueblos in the val- leys around Long House Valley during the thirteenth century. These surrounding valleys were not abandoned, nor did they witness popula- tion declines. If anything the population in these valleys increased in the latter  half of the thirteenth century. The reason these valleys looked abandoned is  that the sites were almost all large pueblos of 50 to 200 rooms, perched up on  top of inaccessible rocks and mesa tops. . . . You might look for shrines on these  hilltops, but habitation did not seem likely. It got so that one of the best indica- tors of site location was when the survey crews were unable to fi nd an access  route to the top of a particular topographic feature. In each such case, a second  effort revealed a skinny crack in the rock or steep trail up the cliff side, and a  pueblo on top invariably dating to A.D. 1250 to 1300. (Haas, Creamer, 208) There are enough skeletons in the Southwest with shattered skulls or  arrowheads or even fossil shark’s teeth in their ribcages and enough burnt  pueblos to make continual low-level confl icts (such as ambushes and raid- ing) a possibility, maybe even a probability, and there doesn’t seem to be any  practical reason for the Anasazi to build their dwellings in such extremely  remote locations as Haas and Creamer found in Long House Valley other  than for defensive purposes. And it wouldn’t have taken much to drive a  neighboring community out of their territory; a few late-season raids on  their fi elds, a few of their granaries looted, and they’re facing starvation, and  there’s a lot of evidence of starvation during this period. But if warfare was a formative element of Anasazi society, its effects are  rather faint here, as was their presence eight hundred years ago when they  had a settlement over in Boulder. The Escalante River was Fremont terri- tory.  From the shoulder of Highway 12, with my binoculars, we examine a  granary in a sandstone pocket a few hundred feet above us. The Fremont  might have reached it through a narrow crack to the right of the alcove, but  even thinking about that climb, the horrendous exposure, makes my palms  sweat. There seems to be a Darwinian process occurring here. The Fremont  may have built some of their structures in more easily-accessible locations,  but those buildings probably succumbed to looters and vandals, both ancient  and modern.  </page> <page sequence="10"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     219 Petroglyph near Fence Canyon Beyond the granary, the teenagers are still rappelling two hundred feet  down from the overlook. We can still hear their shouts. I suppose when  they’re all down they’ll hike to the road to be picked up, or maybe there’s a  way back to the overlook from the cliff base. Larry directs my attention back to the granary, the extreme overhang.  “A kid tried to rope down to that thing a few years back,” he says, “and  he died trying.”   There are children splashing through the Escalante River below the  bridge. We walk across the road and down a shady, sandy path to a clear- ing in the cottonwoods and he points out a jacal granary or dwelling in the  cliffside thirty-fi ve feet above the ground. A thirty-foot log forms part of its  base, and I wonder what apparatus they used to get it up there. Even now,  there appears to be no way to access the granary, other than a fairly technical  climb. The Fremont were obviously an agile people. The clumsy probably  died young. I mention this to him. </page> <page sequence="11"> Petroglyph, Capitol Reef </page> <page sequence="12"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 21 “I visited this Hopi family once, lived right next to a cliff,” he says, “cou- ple hundred foot fall, and their children used to play near the edge and I  asked their mother if it made her nervous. She said she’d never thought  about it before I asked.” The Puebloans This used to be the farm of Ephraim Coombs (rhymes with ”dooms”) and  now it’s a state park. In the visitor’s center, there are exhibits of spear and  arrow points, moccasins and snares and other relics, and there’s a mock-up  of an Anasazi dwelling with a ladder through the ceiling, which is symbolic  to the modern Hopi of the sipapu, the entrance they used to get to this world  from the one below, and there’s pottery: Garfi eld black-on-white, Ivie Creek  black-on-white, Black Mesa black-on-white, Middleton black-on-red and  Citadel polychrome, which is the latest style you fi nd here, because after  that, the Anasazi left, and nobody knows why. The Coombs site out back consists of foundations of an L-shaped pueb- lo and a U-shaped pueblo and a pit house and some more structures that  haven’t been excavated yet. According to Mike Nelson, the director, and  Lisa Westwood, chief curator and an expert on human osteology, about sixty  percent of the site was burned, but it wasn’t all burned at once. When I asked  these two what the Kayenta Anasazi were doing this far north, as far north as  they ever came, they can’t tell me, and they almost seem afraid to speculate.  The Anasazi were trading with the Fremont, but the Coombs site didn’t  appear to be a trading outpost. It seems an entire Anasazi village or some  other large group of people moved up here as an intact social unit, possibly  as refugees from some kind of social strife in northern Arizona or as farmers  looking for greener pastures, and they “bumped” the Fremont out of the  way in the process. Nevertheless, there’s no evidence of a prolonged confl ict  between the two cultures. Quite the opposite: the Anasazi built pit struc- tures like the Fremont, and the Coombs site is unique in that they didn’t  create a kiva, just as the Fremont didn’t dig kivas, and the Fremont adopted  black-on-white pottery from the Anasazi. Lisa shows me the pottery collection in the climate-controlled back room.  She points out an example of the Fremont black-on-white and I study the  motifs very closely; black widow markings, pawl-tooth edges and involutes,  interlocking spirals.  “Interlocking spirals,” I say. “What do you think that means?” “Ceramics,” says Lisa, “are like fi ne art. They’re hard to interpret. It’s  hard to fi nd a system that can positively categorize every style. It’s like any  discipline: there are lumpers and splitters.” </page> <page sequence="13"> 2 2 2   H i g hw ay  12 Spirals interlock and unfold. Cultures trade and learn from each other  and clash. Opposition rises up from the other end of the earth, beyond the  boundaries of the People, as most native cultures identifi ed themselves, or  within the ranks of the People, or within the mind itself. “Pottery,” she says, “does not equal people.” “What’s your favorite style?” I ask, and she answers without hesitation:  “Miniatures.” She’s got them lined up on one shelf: tiny, decorated ladles and bowls,  jars and cups.  “They might be children’s toys,” she says, “Or they might have been used  for ceremonies. Sometimes you fi nd them in child burial sites.” I ask Mike and Lisa what forced the Anasazi retreat. “The modern puebloans,” says Mike, “call it the ‘migration,’ and nobody  knows for sure.” “But you must have theories,” I say. “Did they go to war? Coombs is out  in the open, it’s indefensible.” “There’s been an overemphasis on the warfare issue,” says Lisa. “There  were severe droughts about the time they left. There was a change in rainfall  patterns. The water sources were drying up. The Anasazi might have lost  faith in their religious leaders.” There’s little doubt they were living in a time of need. Lisa has studied  the bones. “We see a lot of enamel hypoplasia, interruptions in the growth of new  layers in young teeth, in the Anasazi around 1150 to 1175, when they left,”  says Lisa, “and we can put that together with other lines of evidence of defi - ciency like stature and we know they were suffering from malnutrition.”  Lisa thinks the Anasazi might have been motivated to move into cliff  dwellings out of a necessity to cultivate every available inch of arable land,  and others speculate that the Anasazi moved up there for aesthetic or reli- gious purposes. The only thing that would get me to move up into a niche  high on a cliff wall, however, and haul my food and water and everything I  would need to live up there and raise my children on the brink of a drop-off,  where every day we would have the opportunity to fall to our deaths, would  be a marauding enemy.  I walk through the exhibits and I meditate on the patterns of pottery, the  whorls and checkerboards, stripes, diamonds, the cross-hatching like you  see in the sandstone around town and what I see is point and counterpoint. The Cowboy Dell LeFevre, whose brand is 7X, is a laconic old cowboy. He’s almost curt  sometimes. He’s a busy man, doesn’t like to sleep, doesn’t like to waste time  </page> <page sequence="14"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 2 3 talking when he’s got something to do, and as a rancher and commissioner  for Garfi eld County, he’s always got something to do. He likes to get straight  to the point. I learned this when I fi rst met him at his two-story ranch house on the  north end of Boulder, which had a dozen bicycles spread over the yard and  cats prowling about and some of Dell’s big-eyed East-Indian munchkin chil- dren staring out the windows at me. Dell isn’t home when I get there and I  speak to his wife Gladys for a while until he pulls up and climbs out of his  pickup and gets in my face, this middle-aged, hook-nosed, leather-skinned  man who probably outweighs me by thirty pounds of ropy muscle, whose  sloppy cowboy hat makes him six inches taller than me, wanting to know  who I was and what I want with his family and so on, until I convince him  I am a writer and then it is “Who are you writing for? What’s your angle?  Who have you talked to?” Finally he settles down enough that I can put  some questions to him, specifi cally about the Burr Trail. But Dell is in a  hurry now, and once he’s convinced himself I’m not a threat, he loads a few  things on an ATV and hops on himself, with one of his tiny boys jumping on  behind him and grabbing tight. All I get are a few sound bites: About the Burr Trail controversy: “It’s a war, it’s not about the environ- ment. It’s about control, plain and simple. Who controls the land.” About the environmental movement: “They won. They got what they  wanted. We took this place from the Indians, they’re taking it from us and  somebody will probably take it from them someday.”  “They [developers] want to turn this place into a Vail, a Moab.” “There’s no young ranchers anymore, no young farmers.” And then he paused for just one moment and looked over his spread and  laughed and said, “I bought this place straight out for forty thousand dollars  a few decades ago and I’m still paying for it.” Then he was off in a cloud of gray dust, into the midst of a four-year  drought to try and save some of his cattle. Next time we chat, I set up an appointment in the evening, and Dell  sits me in his living room and he and his wife, but mostly Dell, answer my  questions when they’re not being distracted about homework or some emer- gency on the ranch by one of their adopted children. Dell tells me about his  relationship with the Forest Service and the BLM. “I try to keep a good working relationship. You have to work with the govern- ment; they’re your landlord. You have to get along with them or they can make  it rough on you. And it’s hard sometimes. There’s other ranchers who wouldn’t  work with them and their attitude was that it was just somebody putting regula- tions and regulations and regulations on them and they just fought back.” </page> <page sequence="15"> 2 2 4   H i g hw ay  12 I ask him about the current and former BLM management. Kate Can- non used to be in charge of the monument and she wasn’t very diplomatic,  rubbed a lot of locals the wrong way, especially ranchers whose cattle she  was impounding, and she was fi nally forced out. But Dell liked her. “She’d spit in your eye. She stood up and told you where to go,” he says.  “Said she was going to impound the cattle on the Fifty and then she did it.” And the natural resources around Escalante and Boulder: would these  towns ever have access to them? “That will never happen. The coal deposit out there on the Kaiparowits  is the largest known coal reserve in the world and it’s clean-burning coal  and Clinton buttoned all that up so we can get Asian coal. When I fi rst got  on the commission, we redrew all the monument’s boundaries so we could  get to the coal, but Bush hasn’t got the—I shouldn’t say this—the balls to  change those boundaries. It’s a small issue and Utah is a Republican state, so  he’s already got the votes locked up.” And the economics of the situation? “Calves are selling for the same price now as when I got into the business  in 1973,” he says, pausing to let that sink in. “The United States is buying  beef from Australia, Argentina, Canada, and that keeps the price of beef  down because they can ship it here cheaper than we can raise it. To make  it in the ranching business you need two dollars a pound and we can’t get  that. The economics are killing the ranchers more than all the government  regulations.” And more than environmentalists, he’s said elsewhere, though  he believes it all plays into the demise of ranching in southern Utah. This  year the income for Dell’s ranch will just break even with his operating ex- penses. Dell grew up in these parts, in a shack with no running water and he  wanted to be a cattleman from the time he was ten years old (Jay Haymond,  “LeFevre,” 1). He was dyslexic, but he says he “had a good memory on me”  (2). He got into bull and bronc riding when he was young and “took some  hits” but couldn’t afford the lifestyle in the end. “I didn’t have the money to do it. That was a rich man’s game back then.  I’d have to work and get a little money and then I could go rodeo for a while  and then I wasn’t good enough to go where the money was at. There’s a lot  of cowboys out there. They fi nally got it up to where the top fi fteen are mak- ing money, but back then it was just a sport.” “That’s funny,” I say, “You have to pay money to get on a bull and get  the—” “That’s right, to get on a bull. You might get some money back but back  then the entrance fee was fi fteen, twenty, thirty—a big rodeo was fi fty dol- lars, and a fi fteen-dollar rodeo would have a seventy dollar purse for fi rst  </page> <page sequence="16"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 2 5 place, and you’re competing against fi fteen to twenty people. And they paid  three places or four, and fourth place, you were back to your entrance fee  again. So by the time you drive down the road one hundred and fi fty or two  hundred miles to a rodeo, by the time you fi gure gas and the motel and your  meals, it was a losing situation.” So he joined the army, and he and a Navajo friend went AWOL for a  while from basic training so Dell could get busted up and win seven hundred  dollars riding bulls in Reno, Nevada, and then he came back and was given  fourteen days hard labor, breaking rocks with a sledge hammer, and stationed  in Alaska on a security detail attached to a group of scientists monitoring the  Russian nuclear tests, and they somehow ended up lost in Siberia at one  point, for four or fi ve days. Dell got pneumonia from the cold during this  stint and surgeons had to remove the lower half of his left lung, and when  he’d recovered from that, a Russian Eskimo prisoner who was handcuffed  to him bailed out of an airborne helicopter and wrenched Dell’s shoulder,  which had already been damaged by bull riding, until the muscle and nerves  were completely destroyed (Haymond, “LeFevre,” 12). Discharged from the service, Dell roughnecked with a drilling operation  in Casper, Wyoming, and became a “pusher” or straw boss, and then he  bought into the company and saved his pennies, moved back to Boulder and  bought a ranch. He also married his one true love, Gladys Lyman, daughter of cattleman  Ivan Lyman, who once employed Dell, and a descendent of the Lymans  who’d settled Boulder Valley. They spent fourteen childless years together  while Dell drilled in New Mexico and Missouri, Wyoming, Michigan and  Colorado and while Dell bought the ranch and began buying out smaller  operations whenever he got the chance, and then they adopted a couple of  Mexican boys, Sean and Keith, and an infant named Jonathan.  Dell became county commissioner and they put off adopting children  for a few years, but then they got into it in a big way, fl ying down to Bolivia  with a suitcase of cash and coming back with two children and then adopting  kids in bulk, two or three at a time. They now have fourteen children, “And  that,” says Dell, “is it.” Dell’s children probably won’t have much of a future in Boulder unless  they can adapt to the new economy of tourism and development. “That’s the way it’s going to go,” says LeFevre. “I won’t say it’s a good  thing, but that’s the way Boulder’s going to go; it’s going to turn into ranch- ettes. It’s already gone. If you’ve got money that’s a good thing, but you’re  taking it away from the working-class guy who can’t afford a place in Boul- der. It’s going to become a Sedona, Arizona, a second-home place, because  there’s just no way you can make a living here, other than tourism.” </page> <page sequence="17"> 2 2 6   H i g hw ay  12 “That’s too bad,” I say, “because I’ve worked in Sedona and Park City and  you’ve got two classes of people, the wealthy and—“ “Seven dollars an hour.” I ask him how the atmosphere has changed. “It used to be all ranching, it was a ranching community, everyone worked  together and now there are hardly any ranchers left. And the new people are  not bad people, they’re just different, they don’t have the ranching back- ground and most of them don’t care about ranching.” “That’s also too bad,” I say, “because I think that’s why they moved to  Boulder.” “Right. But when they come here, a lot of them want to change it like it  was where they come from. They come here for the open space, and then  they buy a lot and chop it up into little tiny pieces.” Back in the eighties, “eco-terrorists” shot twenty-six of Dell’s cattle and  burned two of his line shacks.  “About that time,” he says, “I picked up this backpacker, a kid. Threw his  backpack in the bed of the pickup. I had my little girl in the truck with me  at the time. We rode along for a while and I told him about my cows get- ting shot and I started interrogating him about what he knew and he fi nally  told me, ‘I’m glad the cattle got shot. Maybe they should start shooting  ranchers too.’ So I pulled out my forty-fi ve while I’m driving, and I cocked  it and poked it in his rib cage—there was no bullet in the fi rst chamber but  he didn’t know that—and I said, ‘Mister, you just went over the line.’ Man,  his eyes got big. “Now remember, my little girl was in the truck and about a week earlier  I’d picked up another backpacker about the same place and my daughter had  been along with me then as well, and after a minute or so with me holding  the gun on this kid, my daughter asks, ‘Dad, are you going to leave him in  the same place you left the other guy?’ And that’s when he just fl ew out of  that truck.” Dell is laughing so hard he has to catch his breath.  “He disappeared,” he says. “I had to throw his backpack after him.” Not too long ago, Dell was approached by Grand Canyon Trust, which  wanted to buy up his permits for rangeland along the Escalante River and  retire them. The BLM had been cutting back the time of use so the banks  were overgrown. “There used to be some pretty meadows down there,” he  says, “and the vegetation in the river grew up so bad, those willows and  tamarisk, you couldn’t get to the river.” Then Dell’s horse tripped on a beaver hole down by the river and fl ipped  over on him and pinned him for a day, and while he was under that horse, he  thought, “what am I getting out of this, really?” and he decided to sell. He’s  </page> <page sequence="18"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 2 7 gotten no end of fl ak from his fellow ranchers for that decision but he was  still reelected county commissioner. Dell worked with the Forest Service, still smarting from the huge fi res  all over the West, to get some of the woodlands on the Aquarius Plateau  opened up for Stephen Steed’s operation. “The timber from the Arizona fi res would have run every mill in the  United States for one year,” Dell tells me. I ask him if he ever gets discouraged and he tells me about a friend of his,  Buck Shaw, who was captured in the Vietnam War and held captive in tiny  bamboo cage and fed nothing but rice for fi ve years. Buck told him, “As long  as I was breathing, there was hope.” “Why,” I ask, “would somebody stay in the cattle business when the eco- nomics are so poor?” “We’re too dumb to get out. I don’t know, but ranchers aren’t staying in  the business, they’re selling out.” “Why do you stay in the business?” “That’s a tough one. I guess you marry the land. I don’t know, a dream,  maybe. We’ve all got to have a dream.”  The Developer I decide to pay an unscheduled visit to the development Mark Austin is  building on Black Mesa, on the outskirts of Boulder.  Austin is an interesting character. He studied architecture at the Univer- sity of Utah, my alma mater, and he moved away from Utah and moved back  again and built the Boulder Mountain Lodge before Clinton’s proclamation,  and so he took a chance on Boulder, but the town didn’t seem very willing to  return the favor. Austin beat his head against a wall for years trying to secure  the privilege of serving alcohol in his restaurant, and Boulder only relented  when a couple of Buddhist women took over the restaurant and couched the  problem to the town board in economic terms.  I call Austin’s house and somebody tells me he’s at the work site, and he  gives me directions to meet him and those take me up the Burr Trail to a side  road and up the mesa, past numerous “no trespassing” signs, to the frame  of a house on a cut in the mesa where Austin is directing the construction. I  park at the end of a line of enormous, shiny, new black and gray pickups and  just walk up and shake hands with him. Austin looks to be in his late forties or early fi fties. He doesn’t look like  a developer. He’s slim and a little sun worn and he wears a canvas jacket  and jeans. He’s looking at me in a skeptical manner and maybe he’s won- dering if he should throw me out. His contractors are trying to size me  up as well, probably trying to decide if I’m an environmentalist. He tells  </page> <page sequence="19"> 2 2 8   H i g hw ay  12 me he can spare a few minutes, but only that, and I ask how he ended up  here. “Everybody would like to fi nd a Shangri-La, and this was mine,” he says.  “Some friends of mine owned a ranch here and I liked it here so much I  moved. This was the end of the road, at least until the seventies. There was  talk about paving Highway 12 over the mountain and when it fi nally came to  that, I fought it. It was a twelve-million-dollar invitation to the world. And I  fought the paving of the Burr Trail. I regret we didn’t prevail in preventing  that destruction.” I ask him about the design concept of the community he’s building. “We bought this property in ’96,” he says. “It was going to be subdivided  like the trailer park at the end of town.” I seem to remember passing it by, but I haven’t been in there. “We had our own vision and we went to the county to get it approved and  they wanted the streets paved and they seemed to have the attitude of ‘don’t  make us have to fi ght you,’ but when they saw what we wanted to do, the  aesthetics, the ‘less-is-more’ approach, they were blown away, and we helped  the county put together a new method of development. We divided the land  into ten- to twenty-acre parcels instead of one acre lots. We wanted to build  affordable housing—” “What do you mean by ‘affordable’?” I break in, “How much does one of  these units sell for?” There’s a completed house down the hill and the Ana- sazi design, the custom brickwork, the heavy vigas, the tiled roofs all look  pretty expensive to me. Austin’s answer: “I assume you’re writing about the aesthetic aspects of  the highway.” I know what he means. “I’m talking to environmentalists,” I say, “and I’m  talking to people on the other side.” This makes him angry and he points at me. “You know, when they paved that road, I told them there was going to  be development, and here it is. ‘If you build it, they will come,’ and it’s not  a question of if but how, and you’re either going to have nice, quality de- velopment or it’s going to be bad, and the ranchers don’t understand that.  What do you hear when you talk to the cowboys? They say, ‘we don’t want  change.’” Austin talks about how he helped get the Southern Utah Forest Products  Organization together and how he helped change Forest Service policy so  the parcels they were putting bids out on weren’t so large as to exclude local  operations, but I’m thinking about where he was pointing. Austin’s obvi- ously not a rude person and he wasn’t really pointing at me as much as he  was pointing at those cowboys in the valley—that’s where his eyes were,  </page> <page sequence="20"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 2 9 anyway—but that gesture has given me pause, and I’m thinking that Pat- rick Diehl, Tori Woodard and I and much of the world all did come in and  continue to come in on the same road he didn’t want paved. Mark might  just as well have said, “write a book about it, tell people about it, and they  will come,” or “build a road and people like you will come,” or “how is what  I’m doing that different from what you’re doing, except that it’s a lot more  profi table?” And he would have a point. I snap out of it. Austin is talking about the Dry Hollow Reservoir in Es- calante.  “I thought it was a big mistake for SUWA to oppose that,” he says. “I  told them ‘you are just fueling the fi re.’ I’ve lived in southern Utah for thirty  years and I understand the situation really well and I try to avoid drawing  lines in the sand. And what about the jobs I’m providing?” “What about Dell LeFevre?” I ask. “Is he one of the cowboys who doesn’t  want change?” He takes a few seconds to think that over. “No,” he says, “Dell sold his  permits on the Escalante to Grand Canyon Trust and he caught a lot of  fl ack for that and I think it was because some of the locals were jealous and  a lot of them were more interested in a fi ght than actually accomplishing  something.” So be it. I see a similarity between him and Dell LeFevre, which is a will- ingness to try something unconventional when the usual approach doesn’t  work. And Austin makes a point of buying and hiring locally, so he cer- tainly couldn’t be accused of harming Boulder’s economy, even if he wants  to change it. And if I were a developer in southern Utah, the fi rst thing I  would do would be to join SUWA. In fact, I don’t see why the residents of  Escalante and Boulder don’t join en masse; their input and their votes would  more than offset any benefi ts SUWA would accrue from the paltry member- ship fees. What’s more, the other members of SUWA would actually get to  meet the people they’re fi ghting, and they might just decide ranchers are  human after all.  Getting back to Austin, though, I think Boulder’s future, for good or  ill, belongs to him—to him and people like Dell LeFevre. Some locals call  LeFevre a “sell-out,” but I doubt they do it to his face, and soon after he did  sell his permits, the cattleman’s association sued the BLM to halt the prac- tice of retiring permits, and so the Grand Canyon Trust has stopped buying.  I would call that pretty good timing on LeFevre’s part.  I excuse myself and drive back down the road and I drive around the  southern half of Boulder for a while, past the isolated farm and ranch houses,  where horses and cattle graze in the fi elds out by the white sandstone domes  with the red light of the low sun shining on them almost straight on, and  </page> <page sequence="21"> 2 3 0   H i g hw ay  12 then I come back to the middle of town and park the Heap and walk by the  old farmhouses with sheep in their backyards and the rotted fences and the  old gray barns, the leaning telephone poles, the orchards, the cottonwoods,  the rabbitbrush crowding the roadside. It is a perfect day, temperature in the high-sixties, no clouds, no wind, no  traffi c, so still I can hear people talking in their houses. I drive towards Boulder Mountain, past Austin’s Boulder Lodge, with its  rusted roof and its rip-gut fence and its stucco walls, past a sign advising me  to “use your forest resources wisely,” to the development on the north end of  town, where everybody has done his own thing, and it’s pre-fab houses and  log cabins, double-wides, red fi replugs, green and brown aluminum siding,  chain-link fence, two-hundred-gallon propane tanks, bulky air conditioning  units, shacks painted aquamarine, chained lots, none of it very tasteful. But  I used to live in a trailer lot and I know the kind of residents who live here  and they’re mostly working-class people. Some of them are retired, some of  them are on their way up, some have fallen down and some just like things  the way they are. That last category would have included me when I lived  Petroglyph near Fence Canyon </page> <page sequence="22"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 31 Burr Trail at Boulder in a trailer down in Arizona, and it would include me now because I admit, I  would rather not see Boulder change. But it will. The Burr Trail A: With the increase, we just kept getting more and more complaints. More and  more, that we had to put a shed in Boulder to try to maintain that road. Q: What do you mean? What complaints? A: Tourists. They’d call you up. Q: Say, “What a nice dirt road you’ve got here”? A: Right. Q: “We’ve had a wonderful experience”? A: And “When are you going to grade the ‘blank, blank’ thing.” Q: Isn’t the appeal—maybe not the entire appeal, but isn’t there a strong ap- peal for that road—the fact that it’s a dirt road? A: No. That is absolutely asinine. (Deposition of H. Dell LeFevre, Sierra Club vs. Hodel, 20) The confl ict began in 1987 when the Sierra Club fi led suit against the  BLM, charging that the changes Garfi eld County wanted to make would  </page> <page sequence="23"> 2 3 2   H i g hw ay  12 constitute a trespass on federal land, that the county needed to get permis- sion from the government before making such changes, that the “improve- ments” would impair the wilderness qualities of the adjacent lands and that  the BLM hadn’t fully studied such impacts. It took six years for the Sierra  Club to lose on all counts and for the judge to decide that the county did  hold title to the road, but the Sierra Club appealed the ruling while the Park  Service sued the county in 1996 for bulldozing away a blind curve east of the  Waterpocket Fold, near a spot known as the Post. This time the county was  in trouble for not consulting the Park Service before beginning its repairs.  The county felt it had absolutely no obligation to obtain permission from  the Park Service, the BLM or any other government agency before upgrad- ing or repairing a road it held title to. Garfi eld County’s argument, and the argument of every county to owner- ship of the roads in its boundaries, is based on the 1866 statute known as RS  (Revised Statute) 2477, which states: “the right of way for the construction  of highways across public lands not otherwise reserved for public purposes  is hereby granted.” The exact meaning of “construction” is still being con- tended, but “highways,” at the time meant any throughway from a cattle  trail to a major road. By “reserved for public purposes,” the statute meant  already reserved; when the government declared a monument or park, the  counties retained ownership of their roads, and when there was a dispute  between the federal government and an individual or a county over RS 2477  roads, the courts invariably deferred to state law in their decisions. That was how things stood up until 1976 when the Federal Land Man- agement and Policy Act (FLPMA, pronounced “fl ip-ma”) was implemented.  FLPMA repealed RS 2477 but recognized all preexisting RS 2477 grants.  Environmentalists refer to these self-actuating grants as claims and contend  that the counties bear the burden of proving their roads were constructed  before 1976. Under Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, practically any line in the dust  could be considered a “highway.” Bruce Babbitt nixed Hodel’s criteria but  was blocked by Congress from imposing his own standards, and now the  defi nition is being fought over in court. Garfi eld County is still claiming  river beds and cow trails as highways (but not necessarily roads) but SUWA’s  defi nition of a highway appears to be strictly modern, though the term was  fi rst employed back in the late nineteenth century, and they defi ne a road  as something that “looks like a ‘road’ to a hypothetical typical American”  (SUWA, 14).  Why all the wrangling over roads and highways? Because highway grants  could theoretically be developed into roads. An overgrown, century-old cow  trail, for example, could theoretically be developed by the county into a six- </page> <page sequence="24"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 3 3 lane highway under the present law. And SUWA and the Sierra Club are  worried about how such roads, developing from practically nowhere, could  affect potential wilderness areas. According to Section 4c of the Wilderness  Act: Except as specifi cally provided for in this Act, and subject to existing private  rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent roads within  any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet  minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of  this Act (including measures required in emergencies involving the health  and safety of persons within the area), there shall be no temporary road, no  use of motor vehicles or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of  mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area.  (Powell, 187) If Garfi eld County didn’t have title to the Burr Trail, it might not have  title to any of its highways, and by extension, no other county in the Unit- ed States and certainly in Utah, could securely claim title to the highways  within its borders. Q: Were there trees taken out besides what was necessary for the road itself? A: Not if their plans was to change the road, no. But back then, you just pushed  trees. We just loved to knock them down. Nothing better than a dead tree.  Unless it was a dead hippie. Q: There aren’t any of those anymore, are there? Either hippies or dead  ones? A: I’m going to fi nd one. Yes. I’m going to fi nd a hard-core backpacker with  his belly up, died of starvation on the Escalante River because the cows  messed in the streams.  (Deposition of H. Dell LeFevre, Sierra Club vs. Hodel, 64) A: I got too many cow numbers in my head to be worrying about what some- body wants to know about this Burr Trail. Especially the environmentalists.  Or when they’re going to sue me, or whatever you’re going to do to me. Q: Did you give her (a woman from Garfi eld County Attorney Ron Thomp- son’s offi ce) any other information of value? A: No. What’s value? How do you place value? Q: What else did you tell her? A: I don’t even know if I told her she was good looking or not. Q: Do you want that on the record? A: Yes. I don’t know her. I don’t know. That’s been three weeks ago. I mean it’s  kind of like asking you what you had for breakfast three weeks ago. Q: Maybe. Have you prior to today talked with anybody about your testimony  today—what your testimony would be today about any of these matters? </page> <page sequence="25"> 2 3 4   H i g hw ay  12 A: No. . . . Hell, I’m over there where they don’t care what you guys do. Lis- ten, just let us build that road. (Deposition of H. Dell LeFevre, Sierra Club vs. Hodel, 86-87) So far, the county has succeeded in double chip-sealing the road from  Boulder to the boundary of Capitol Reef. Driving down the Burr Trail towards Capitol Reef, it’s hard to believe  you’re in a war zone; there are no signs decrying the paving of the road,  there are no protestors laying in front of bulldozers, no saboteurs pouring  molasses into the crank-cases of bladers, no road construction equipment  visible at all and in fact, very few humans visible in the off months, just a  smooth and winding road, and a beautiful one at that. On the fi rst leg out of Boulder, the road skirts Durffey Mesa and cuts  down a harrowing, hair-pin dugway. A few days before I drove through  here a man tried to commit suicide by running his car at full speed off the  Hogback near Boulder, and his airbag deployed and he survived with just  scratches, and had he applied the same determination here, at the dugway,  he probably would have succeeded in his primary aim. From the bottom  of that dugway, you can park your car and follow The Gulch upstream or  down, but the road enters Long Canyon, which is bordered on each side by  high Wingate cliffs, so it’s like a long red slot, and the Circle Cliffs beyond  it are one of Dutton’s centers of erosion; they’re eaten back from the middle  of an anticline where used to stand a Wingate dome. The cliffs, tilted to- wards where the apex isn’t, and the plains, so vast they’re simply known as  the Flats, and the blue Henry Mountains just past the reef will draw the  borders of the earth violently outward in every direction when you emerge  from the red crevice of Long Canyon, and when the road drops you may feel  you’ve been launched into the void, but the road is just making its way to the  bottom of the Flats where the Wolverine Loop cuts south, and it will cross  through White Canyon Flat, past the Studhorse Peaks, out past Wagon Box  Mesa to Capitol Reef, where the Burr Trail, which now lends its name to the  whole road, switchbacks down the face of the Waterpocket Fold.  Just out of Boulder, on an October night, I can turn off the Heap’s lights  and still see everything plain as an overcast day; the moon is that bright. I  drive slowly, watching for deer, and pull onto a side road beneath a blue dome  of sandstone. There are other domes up the road. It’s cold and I build a fi re  and cook some chili on the grate, then let the fi re die down and walk away  from it, let my eyes adjust to the spectral light, and then I start climbing. Night rock climbing, I think, sport of geniuses. </page> <page sequence="26"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 3 5 Long Canyon The face is not so steep that if I lost my balance I would be in serious trou- ble, and the only times I do stumble are when I cross through shadows. When  I reach the top I fi nd there’s a cliff behind the dome, maybe three-quarters of  a mile away, and beneath it is a rock canyon fl at littered with volcanic boulders  about as wide as the Heap’s tires, which drops off a steep incline to the east  and narrows into a gulch that empties west of the dome. I walk into the canyon  and back through the wash, shadowed by ponderosas, and back to my camp- ground, and when I see the road again, I know that it is part of a ghost world. In the morning, I hike down The Gulch towards the Escalante River. I  have no intention of going the whole nine miles, but I want to get a feel for  the canyon, and what I feel is a gnat attack. The little monsters envelop me  whenever I stop to adjust my pack or get a drink or take a picture, so I stay  on the move. There’s a well-trod path along the creek and the brush isn’t  overgrown enough to be a bother, but the streambed grows monotonous  after a few miles. I’ve been hiking the bottoms of canyons for months and  </page> <page sequence="27"> 2 3 6   H i g hw ay  12 I’m tired of it and I want to get above the rim, and as I leave the trail and  huff up the talus slope I realize that’s what I’ve always wanted: to get on top  of the walls so I can see where I’m headed and maybe choose my own course  rather than have it dictated to me. No more meandering, no more wonder- ing whether a side canyon is worth exploring, because now I can reconnoiter  that canyon from above.  The problem with this approach is that you’ve got to head all those side- canyons, and just like Wallace Ott’s jalopy, you end up doing a great deal of  vertical traveling. But this time it’s all right because I just want to get some  idea of what I would be in for if I followed The Gulch all the way down to its  confl uence with the Escalante, and that turns out to be the massive, ancient,  austere whitecap and table knoll terrain out by what the locals call the V,  where Harris Wash meets the Escalante River. I am instantly drawn in that  direction and I study the ridgeline for some shortcut and try to estimate the  time it would take to get there, but with my present provisions, I would die  out there unless I ate prickly pear cactus like Domínguez and Escalante or  ambushed a backpacker and stole his gorp. I study the map but it’s no help; no old roads go out that way but the ones  I’ve already followed through Big Spencer Flat. I start to search the terrain  for a mining road, but I’m just fooling myself because it’s not even a remote  possibility. The only old roads which come through here follow the beds of  the gulches, and they’ve been closed off. So I turn back, and every step is weighted with remorse and every future  step will also be so weighted to some degree until I get back to that canyon. I  don’t know why I fi nd it so hard to turn my back on an opportunity to get my- self exhausted and sunburned. I certainly don’t do it because I like that kind of  physical exertion, because I’ll drive the Heap as close as I can to any particular  destination before I start hiking. It’s just that I have to know; I can’t turn my  back on the landscape when there might be an arch or a garden of pedestals or  a stone form which has no name or Indian art or ruins right around the next  corner. Call it greed if you want, this desire to see every bend of every canyon,  every bridge and arch and slickrock dome—I’m guilty as charged. I Die Laughing Horse Canyon meets the Escalante two miles south of where The Gulch  runs into it and you can drive to within three miles of this point, a fact the  1:100,000 map doesn’t convey. One day I do just that—cut off the Wolverine  Loop and drive south between the high Wingate walls with their salt-fret- ted hollows and long, vertical streaks of desert varnish and a few horizontal  streaks, as if the rock had been turned ninety degrees after it was painted,  </page> <page sequence="28"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 3 7 Desert varnish in Horse Canyon craning my neck for petroglyphs, a pursuit that will drive any person crazy  in time, but fi nding only cryptic technical messages uranium prospectors  left for each other when they scoured this canyon in the sixties. The gas  gauge reads a sliver above one quarter tank and there’s no more gas in the  can and I’m thinking Bingo . . . Bingo, like a helicopter pilot who has reached  the point where he has to turn back, but I keep going until I get to the  prefab-tin linecamp at the end of the road and I can walk in from there. I  fi nd many young cottonwoods that way and some spotted lizards and a few  pale evening primroses along the path and also a variety of barbed wire that  I haven’t encountered before, with four barbs and four wraps around two  tight-wound strands. For a while I kept an eye out for different brands of  barbed wire in and around Highway 12, but I’ve been disappointed in this  pursuit in that I’ve only come across two other types: the standard two wraps  and two barbs tied around one strand and the older, fl at, two-barbed kind,  wrapped once around the strand. Further downstream are gigantic amphitheaters of alveolar rock, which  contain no Indian art, and beyond them, the sickly trickle of a stream I’ve  been following empties into the Escalante, which is running waist-high, carrying cutworms to the Colorado, and which is choked with thistle, reeds,  various weeds and tamarisk. Getting upstream to the mouth of The Gulch  would be diffi cult without a machete or a shallow-draft power-boat. I do  </page> <page sequence="29"> 2 3 8   H i g hw ay  12 Moody Canyon Road manage to stomp through the brush to the splay of talus beneath the bluff,  and from the top of the talus, I spot some seeps which must still be seeping  because maidenhair ferns and monkey fl owers and purple primroses have  taken root in them and seem to be doing well. I also fi nd dots pecked into  the wall in the shape of a cricket bat, more cryptic messages, but I choose  to believe these dots represent the number of times a Fremont Indian or a  traveler from a more ancient tribe came this way. You can walk up the mouth of Wolverine Canyon from Horse Canyon  but I decide to come at it the other way. After a trip back to Boulder to fi ll  up the Heap and get provisioned, I walk down that canyon from the head  and come to a black forest. I’ve been fi nding petrifi ed wood here and there at  the edge of the Circle Cliffs, in the Chinle Formation. Up in Horse Canyon  there are big, Jeep-crippling chunks of it right in the road, and it looks like  some joker went after it in the hills there with a backhoe, but here you can  fi nd whole fallen trees in the paleosols and siltstones and conglomerates of  the Chinle charnel, giant carbonized specimens six feet thick and sixty feet  long.  In the evening I drive down to the badlands at the far end of Moody  Canyon hoping to circle back on the Fourmile Bench Road, which turns out  not to be there. On the way out to this nonroad, I meet Sioux Cochran of  </page> <page sequence="30"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 3 9 Boulder Mountain Ranch, who has a permit for the Moody and Wagon Box  allotment, and who’s on the back of a horse that has fi ve wild and ornery- looking cows cornered, and when I try to approach to ask some questions,  the cows spook and the horse instantly puts them in check again and gives  me a disgusted look, so I don’t get the chance to say much and Sioux only  gives me some directions and asks me to tell her husband Bob, who should  be up the road, what she’s up to. Further on I fi nd Bob herding some cattle  of his own, but he only sticks around long enough to let me take some pic- tures of him on his horse, which snorts and turns away every time I point my  camera his way, and to ask me if I see any cattle with his brand, the “rocking  C,” to please give him a call. I fi nd a cairn about fi ve feet tall, stacked up by the Purple Hills, and way  out in the boondocks I turn off to a place I didn’t really want to go, a short  road to a water trough. When I step out of the Heap to take a picture any- way, I hear rustling in the brush nearby, like something struggling to get  away, which turns out to be a silver Powerpuff Girls birthday balloon. While I’m traveling, I watch the ridge tops of the prison walls of Wingate  Sandstone that block me off from the sloping chaos just above the Escalante,  hoping to see a break, but with the exception of Horse Canyon, you have to  hike in all the way. Moody Canyon and Choprock Canyon are the portals to  that wicked sandstone wasteland running by the river, and you must approach  Bob Cochran </page> <page sequence="31"> 2 4 0   H i g hw ay  12 them under your own power. And as much as those canyons are drawing me  in, I’ve got my own agenda. I drive down Silver Falls Creek as far as the road  will take me, spot a coyote’s fl ash of gray fur in the headlights and chase down  a kangaroo rat hopping like a wind-up toy. I believe I could keep going all the  way down to the river on this pioneer road but one sign after another warns  me of the dire consequences should I be caught trying to do so, and I park the  Heap right in front of the last “fl ipper” and make camp there. There’s petrifi ed wood here, too; one upright old stump that I initially  mistook for the real thing just down the riverbed. The Chinle is a weird mix  of purple and brown, perse and uranium green molded into high, macilent  pedestals for Wingate boulders and a billion tiny rain pillars for pebbles.  There are a great number of desert trumpet pods looking fairly comfort- able in this environment, which must be much like their home planet, and  they’re ready to snatch my body away when I fall asleep, but if that’s what it  takes to build a more just and sustainable society, without need or greed or  violence, where we can all work together for the common good, I guess I’ll  have to make that sacrifi ce. But the alien pods fail that night and I awake with an evil plan. Not to  drive down Silver Falls Creek, though I’m tempted, but something more  sinister. I’ve been aching to explore the hoodooland on top of the Wing- ate cliffs but I didn’t know how to get up there until I passed a vertical slot  fi lled with landslide debris yesterday, and I drive back there this morning  and climb up the talus fan and then start on that slide, which is damned loose  and vertical, in fact probably the most vertical face I’ve ever gone up, and  when I start dislodging boulders as big as myself, I have to laugh and wonder  what I’m doing here, but by then it’s too late to turn back. Some advice for those who would duplicate my feat, besides fi lling out a  will beforehand, which should be second nature to every experienced hiker:  make sure you note the backtrail, the point where you came in, because the  path you take towards the center of the bluff is going to look very different  from the path you take back, and it’s not as easy as it looks to get back to the  edge and once you’re at that edge, you’re not going to be able to spot a chute  recessed into the cliff wall unless you’re practically on top of it. The top of  this bluff is like a spine and you must follow a rib to reach the end, and if it’s  not the rib you wanted, you have to return to that central axis and try again  because these ridges are disconnected and discreet.  Just how discreet I will fi nd out in the next few hours. I climb across the  top of the butte so I’m overlooking Silver Fall’s Dry and North Forks, and  then I make my way towards the end of the butte on the spine and it looks  like an easy hike over tilted red fl apjack stacks but it turns out not to be so  </page> <page sequence="32"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 41 because when I’m crossing the butte lengthwise there are usually no saddles  between the lumps. So the hike goes like this.  1) Decide where I want to go and visualize how to get there. 2) Discover a deep crevice between the ridge I am on and the one I’m trying to  reach. 3) Discover a diffi cult route down to the intercolline sand gully. This route will  involve technical climbing skills. 4) Reject this route as too dangerous. Look for another. 5) Find a much easier path which descends to the sand gully without any obvious  route up the next ridge. Assume I can fi nd a route once I get down there. As- sume that anything has to be better than the route I’ve rejected as too danger- ous. Descend. 6) Discover after much exploration that there is absolutely no way to gain the  next ridge from my present position short of fl ying up to it. 7) Attempt to return the way I came and when this fails, due to steepness, lack of  handholds, etc., fi nd another way back. Or die. This new route will invariably  be far more life-threatening than the route I fi rst considered.  8) When I gain the ridge, take the route I rejected earlier as too dangerous. By cycling through these eight steps, I am able to travel about a mile to- wards the end of the ridge in three hours and it’s easier to travel in this direc- tion because the tops of the stacks are tilted towards me, and occasionally I  can leap from the top of one down to another. But when I reverse direction,  I fi nd it’s much harder to leap across that horizontal distance and also up four  feet to the top of the next pedestal, and it’s also usually much harder to crawl  back up steep inclines that I ran down coming the other way (see step 7), and  so I’m going against the grain and the return trip takes twice as long. Towards the end, I’m discovering how to jam my hands/feet/knees/arms/ body into cracks to serve as holds on rock faces and I’m making deals with  the devil, stemming above forty-foot drops and leaping across even deeper  chasms where I would die or be seriously injured (and, since I wouldn’t be  able to climb when I’m seriously injured, die) if I fell short, just to save my- self twenty minutes backtracking. When I stumble on the chute again, I’m  spent, and this is the most dangerous part. More than once I fi nd myself dangling off a tailing of rock while I try to  spot the white scuff-marks from my shoes so I can see where the footholds  were coming up. More than once I set some big rocks free, and I have to  watch each of them skip down and bounce and spin out from the face and  land somewhere very remote, and more than once I have to test the stability  of an entire crumbly slope, several tons of rock, by kicking it and shoving it  </page> <page sequence="33"> 2 4 2   H i g hw ay  12 and then carefully setting half of my weight on it and then trusting it utterly  to stay still while I cross over it and trusting it further when I crawl beneath  it. I worry more about having a slide come down on me than I do about fall- ing. More than once I question my own sanity. As I slide down through the Chinle, I notice a storm cloud front sweep- ing in from the Aquarius with rain trailing down from it like fi ngers just  brushing the tips of the buttes. I fi nd a passageway blasted through the hol- low purple slope by fl oodwaters, thirty feet long and about as tall as I could  crouch. When I get back to the Heap and I’m gulping down water and  shoveling corn chips in my mouth, I notice that the dust gathered on the  back window, which came from my off-highway adventures near Boulder,  has formed itself into the pentagonal hadrosaur-skin pattern of the Navajo  Sandstone outcroppings.  If I’d died back on that butte, my spirit wouldn’t have far to go to join  the Great Western Trail. There’s a ghost town named Hinesville at the  head of Silver Falls Canyon, which is itself criss-crossed with prospect- ing roads and cairns, from the uranium boom, or at least there should be.  The Wolverine Loop Road cuts over one of Hinesville’s airstrips. I park  the Heap just off that road, beneath another butte with a Wingate tower closed up like a red fl ower with one petal ready to unfold and I kick around  the dead town where all the plants, the prickly pear, dandelions and thistle,  Indian paintbrush and yucca  are in full bloom, looking for  signs of prospectors, and I do  fi nd some: boards scattered pas- sim, a roadbed going nowhere,  earth ramps, the usual rusted  cans, a half-buried fi fty-fi ve-gal- lon drum, chips of porcelain, a  bucket of grease, an intact bell  jar, but no structure except an  earthen dugout still upright, and  in fact no walls or roof beams or  shingles from any structure that  might have collapsed.  A side road takes me up to a  mining camp where one large  The Burr Trail where it breaks  through the Circle Cliffs past Long  Canyon </page> <page sequence="34"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 4 3 Ripple rock in South Draw shack does still stand, though  its windows are busted out,  its outer walls are gone and  its fl oor is covered with ten- penny nails and its frame  creaks in the wind. Nearby  are scattered Caterpillar  parts and below the shack is  a washed-out track not fi t for  man nor mule, and there’s  another, better track up the  side of the hill, no doubt to  a mine up there, and I would  take it if the light wasn’t slip- ping away and that front  wasn’t moving in on me like  an ancient white fury. Road to Nowhere Ray Freeze and Carol Geor- gopoulos of the Utah Rock  Art Association were going  to lead a group to the petro- glyphs past Lower Bowns Reservoir but they cancelled because the roads  were supposed to be muddy and rutted and all but impassable. I didn’t have  the luxury of rescheduling so they gave me some directions and sent me on  my way, and I’m fi nding the roads dry but very rough, ungraded, certainly  impassable to anything with low clearance, but not the Heap.  It’s a beautiful April day, the temperature in the mid-sixties, and there’s  a light wind blowing and shadows of cumulus clouds drifting by in no particular hurry, and to make things perfect, there’s a controlled burn just  above the reservoir, so I have the rich scent of ponderosa wafting over me,  and it occurs to me that maybe the Indians used to burn forests just for  the aroma. Soon I’m out of the woods, into scrubland past what’s left of  the reservoir, and then I’m headed for a big orange holy rock but the road  turns, drops down a dugway to a low-fl owing creek and climbs the other  side, and at that point I have to walk. I fi nd the petroglyphs, reted antelope  and deer and anthropomorphs faint as old memories, pecked into a lonely  outlier of rope sandstone, along with some more modern artwork and a few signatures, including multiple signs from one cowboy with too much time  </page> <page sequence="35"> 2 4 4   H i g hw ay  12 on his hands and a hankering for immortality but no plan on how to get it  other than to chisel his name into every nook in Pleasant Creek: Walter  Goodwin, Walter Goodwin, Walter Goodwin. I sleep beneath the petroglyphs, at the base of the sandstone scarp where  the brush has scratched off the desert patina, and I get an early start the next  day while the Aquarius draws the morning clouds to it. Pleasant Creek Road  turns onto Sheets Draw at Tantalus Flats and follows it through blow-sand  drifts past a formation known as the Salmon for its shape, maybe, or more  likely for its color, which is almost a match, and then it creeps around a set of  fl atirons and up through the benches of a ripple-rock catastrophe known as  the South Draw, turning northwest and 180 degrees to its former course, to a  valley that runs into the Waterpocket Fold beneath a Wingate Sandstone slab- wall, the back of Capitol Reef, beyond which four canyons cut through that  fold as narrows. From my tape player, the Talking Heads narrate the journey: We’re on a road to nowhere Come on inside Taking that road to nowhere We’ll take that ride. The signs that would tell me  where I am have been knocked  off their posts and hidden  and David Byrne is no help  to me here, singing “Maybe  you wonder where you are/I  don’t care,” so I have to guess  that windgap in the wall above  me is Burro Creek. I park the  Heap there and climb up the  talus above the Chinle, over  big blocks of Wingate, which  the nameless ephemeral stream  on this side has bored right  through like they were sugar  cubes and carved into legions  of wedge-headed alien preda- tors, and over the lip, and then  I hike down into the canyon  Pleasant Creek </page> <page sequence="36"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 4 5 Detail of monster, Deer Creek Canyon head, where its soul resides, on about a thirty percent grade, the angle of  the reef. Right off, I come to a catacomb-rock channel at the end of which is a red  monster head a hundred feet high and it has a thousand eyes and mouths  within mouths within mouths. All the rock in this canyon is cancellate, looks  like the inside of organs, and some of it oozes calcite. Further down I can  see white Navajo Sandstone on top of the Wingate but I don’t get that far. I  come to what I think is an abandoned meander but it’s not; it’s just a low ridge  hiding a couple passageways that curve back up towards the top of the reef.  One of them is a narrows just above a pour-off that’s maybe four feet high,  so I stem up to the mouth and try to squeeze through. But the opening is so  tight, my equipment isn’t going to fi t, so the water bottle, camera bag and  notebook go to the fl oor, and even then it’s diffi cult. This is the narrowest </page> <page sequence="37"> 2 4 6   H i g hw ay  12 slot I’ve ever been in, just a little wider than my rib cage. I get to a point  where I have to turn my head to get through, and then the passage twists  right and opens up just a little before it comes to another pour-off thirty  feet high. There’s a chamber up there, a loxotic light, and I manage to stem  up to it and it opens up into a hallway running perpendicular to the crack- in-the-rock. Call the slot the transept and this hallway would be the nave;  it’s walls are maybe two hundred feet long, and two hundred feet high, with  fi fteen feet between them the whole way and a dead wall at the far end, just  past a cottonwood sapling. Otherwise, the level fl oor is covered with grass  and deep, dried mud, which must swallow up the debris which falls down  here, as there’s no rock at the base of the walls. There’s no other outlet and  I expect when it rains this hidden chamber fi lls up, and the only place it can  go when it overfl ows is back the way I came, which, when I look at it now, is  just a hole in the fl oor.  I’ve got to let my eyes adjust when I peer down into that well. Going back  down isn’t as easy as coming up because I’m looking down, thinking what  would happen if I slipped, how the walls might crush me or snap my neck  or at the least beat the hell out of me and break one or both of my legs. But  sooner or later, like a cat in a tree, my stomach, the great motivator, is going  to override my senses and I’m going to come down, so it might as well be  sooner. The second canyon is nothing like the fi rst. It just runs up another pas- sageway as wide as my outstretched arms, to a rock fi n that curves up from  a horizontal foot to meet the wall vertically about two hundred feet above  me, but below the point where they meet, there’s a lateral joint I might be  able to utilize to get across the head of the canyon and up on top of all this.  I decide to see how far up I can get, and that’s not far, maybe sixty feet,  before my shoes lose their grip. From there I spot an arch, or perhaps I’ve  even discovered it because I don’t remember seeing one on my map. It is,  at last, a pothole that has weathered all the way through the rock fl oor, a  portal down, or in this case up. The opening is about twenty-fi ve feet long  and maybe fi fteen feet high and the truss is about six feet thick, so it’s re- spectable.  However, a problem is overshadowing my sense of accomplishment, and  that is that the topside of the fi n, which is about ten feet wide here, curves  gently away from the cusp and then the surface drops in an intimidatingly  vertical manner off either side for about forty feet, and I had to snake over  to some footholds on the steep side to get as far as I did, and now that I don’t  see any handholds to pull myself up, I’m stuck, and not stuck in a place I can  rest, either. The tips of my toes are jammed into the merest ledges and my  legs are going to start shaking soon and then they’re going to cramp up.  </page> <page sequence="38"> Near Tantalus Flats </page> <page sequence="39"> 2 4 8   H i g hw ay  12 The only thing I can do is try to put my leg up over the edge and start to  slide and hope my clothes have enough friction and I’ve distributed my weight  well enough that I can control that slide and direct it along the top of the fi n.  Otherwise I’m going to slide off the fi n and I’ll get wedged between the rock  faces about thirty or forty feet down. I seem to have been here before, I think. I  make a mental note about how tired I am of this routine and I swing my leg  up, at which point, for an instant, I am only held in place by the tip of my shoe  on a beveled ledge less than one centimeter wide, and then I let go and slide.  The fi rst thing I do when I’ve got enough momentum is fl ip over so I’m  sitting on the rock and I can bring my shoe soles in contact with it, but I gain  speed fast, which, because this is sandstone and it has about the highest fric- tional coeffi cient of any rock on the planet, says something dramatic about  how steep the fi n is, and in very little time I’m going so fast I can hear the  wind and my shoes are just scuffi ng the surface like runners and I can feel a  hole being torn in the seat of my jeans.  Thirty feet down there’s a ledge which is thankfully covered with dirt and  brush and I crash into it and spin off in a pirouette into a stiff, spiky fremont  barberry bush, which to me, with my mind on how the rock could crack my  head open like an egg, feels soft as a feather bed. No more. I want to get to the top of the ridge but I’m not going to en- gage in any more life-threatening behavior today. Near the outcropping I mistook for an abandoned meander, I fi nd a fi fty-degree slope, which is  nothing, and I go straight up it, gain the top, where there are dozens of small  windows blown through the rock by the wind. This is portentous. Far ahead  of me there’s a ventifact shaped exactly like an elephant’s head and I make for  it but it turns out there’s a few chasms in the way and I have to head them all,  including the canyon I was just in. Most of the walls of the slots I’m bypass- ing curve down and I can’t see over that curve, so I really don’t get a sense  of how deep they are, but the walls of the canyon with the arch, and the fi n  in its center, both of which I am now looking down on, drop two hundred  perfectly vertical feet, so with my toes on the edge, my eyes are directly over  the seam where the wall meets the base. It is a hideous verticality, but the  dimensions, I realize, are exaggerated by the narrowness of the canyon. Out near the edge of Capitol Reef the wind picks up to a steady F1 veloc- ity. If I didn’t hold my notebook closed, the wind would tear pages out of  it. I have encountered this kind of wind twice before—the fi rst time about  twenty years ago, in Indiana, when I was eating cornfl akes on our family’s  screened porch and it was overcast and there was a heavy wind which picked  up so rapidly that I didn’t even have time to get up from my chair, to the  point where small trees were tumbling past, and then died just as quickly—  this turned out to be a small tornado.  And the second time was at the edge  </page> <page sequence="40"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 4 9 Emblem on farming equipment near Rainbow Ranch of SP Crater down in Arizona, and that wind actually knocked the glasses  off my face and carried them up into the sky and down into the caldera and  I never did fi nd them, which is why I have a band around my present pair  of glasses. Fortunately, deep waterpockets have been ground into the sandstone.  From inside one I can hear and feel the wind rumbling against the rock. I lift  my head up like a soldier looking out of a foxhole and I can see the Henry  Mountains and the Aquarius Plateau and the smaller fi ns out west beneath  the fold and a vast, tilted, howling wilderness plain. I rest for a while and then I get out of there but I don’t go back down  Burro Canyon, I fi nd a short-cut chute next to it and follow it down to the  Chinle, breaking my vow because it gets steep and even the largest stones  pop loose when I put my weight on them, and tear down the chute and start  their own slides, so my path is fairly limited to the stunted pines I can grab at  when the earth rolls out from underneath me, which it often does, and even  some of those pines are loose. The purple Chinle isn’t safe either. I take an unplanned ride on my butt  down a badland spur and fi nd that it’s compacted like stone and sharp as  well. When I get to the Heap, I’m a mess, but the rest is driving. The tape  cycles back to the beginning. </page> <page sequence="41"> 2 5 0   H i g hw ay  12 Some things can never be spoken Some things cannot be pronounced That word does not exist in any language It will never be uttered by a human mouth. A few miles north I come to the isolated Sleeping Rainbow Ranch, an old  dude ranch the Park Service, which had considered condemning the prop- erty to acquire it, ended up buying from Lurton Knee in 1978. The ranch  ceased operations sometime around then and the Park Service has let the  place go to seed, but Utah Valley State College is planning to fi x up some  of the buildings and put in another well and some solar panels to provide  electricity and use it as a paleontological and archaeological research center,  though as I drive through it, it’s obvious from the rotting corrals and leaning  shacks, the rusting farm machinery and dead cottonwoods, that the ranch is  still sleeping. Still further north, I’m on the scenic drive. Here I am viewing all this  beauty, the reef and Capitol Dome and Fern’s Nipple and Cassidy Arch,  and I didn’t pay a cent for it. Some people will go to extremes to avoid the  entrance fee.  I start encountering traffi c and I start seeing tourists, real humans, taking  pictures by the roadside. I stop to take a few photos myself and waste some  time beneath the red walls of Grand Wash, so when I fi nally get to Fruita at  the north end of the scenic road, it’s dark and the grassy campground there is  packed with RVs, trailers, tents, VW vans with their tops popped. The only  way I can see all this and all the people who are out in the cool evening air is  by the light of a hundred fl ashlights and kerosene and propane lanterns and  grills, and though I spend my time trying to get away from the crowds and  I need to be miles away from here by morning, I feel this curious desire to  pull in there and join them. Voyage of the Damned I kept Jerry Wyrick and Marianne Richardson—friends of mine who have  come up from Arizona on their vacation in March of 2003—waiting for  two hours in Panguitch when the Heap’s battery died in my driveway, and  now I’m going to keep them waiting again. We’re in Capitol Gorge and  they’ve started walking back from the Tanks to the car, but I had decided to  keep going downcanyon because I had to see where it ended up and there  was another reason—beyond the fact that the Tanks, mere oblong potholes,  weren’t that exciting—which was that the offi cial trail ended there. A friend  of mine once related to me the tale of a petroglyph panel he and a few friends  </page> <page sequence="42"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 51 Jerry Wyrick had spotted out by the Dark  Angel obelisk in Arches Na- tional Park. There was a sign  before the panel chastising  them for leaving the trail but  acknowledging they had dis- covered something priceless  they never would have known  about had they not been so  adventurous, and they were  expected to sign a register  book, which, of course, they  didn’t, and they fi gured the  Park Service wouldn’t have  gone to the effort of setting  up the sign and the heavy  post for the register unless  there was something even  more dazzling even further  off the trail, and a little ways further there was an even larger panel with no  sign before it, no register, no nothing. This is what I expect again and I’m not disappointed. Down a few more  bends from where the trail ends, there’s a big overhanging brow of red rock  on the north side of the canyon painted with axle grease cowboyglyphs  which are high enough that the artist(s) must have used a rope or a ladder  to get up there, and at the base are petroglyphs and pictographs: deer and  antelope, stars and spirals, a waving hand on a wriggling line and a squatting  anthropomorph wearing what truly looks like a samurai helmet. I can see the end of the canyon from here and I have to follow it down  but I’d promised I’d turn back after fi fteen minutes, which have already ex- pired, so I run to the end, or at least that’s how I start out, but soon I’m just  walking fast.  This trail used to be a road, and a good one. The cuts and fi lls are still  there, as are three concrete check dams. I tell people you should never walk  when you can ride and I tell them I’ll hike as far as my Jeep will carry me but  the fact is if I think there’s something ahead worth seeing, like Indian art, an  Indian ruin, an old mine, an old road, a bizarre rock formation, I’m a com- plete sucker for it. I’ll walk twenty miles, I’ll walk at night, with or without  water, until I can’t walk any more, though I’ve never had to go quite that far. </page> <page sequence="43"> 2 5 2   H i g hw ay  12 At the end of the canyon, there’s an old cab sunk in the sand up to the  doors, on which is written “SCENIC ATTRACTION—ENTERING— CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL MONUMENT,” and there’s a Park Ser- vice sign, a fl ippie stuck down through the sunroof like Ahab’s lance in the  White Whale, which reads “NO MOTOR VEHICLES.” “It tasks me,” I tell Marianne later. “It heaps me.”  I’m talking about a society at odds with itself, and my inability to fi nd  root causes. Dealing with individuals, I’ve come to believe there are ranch- ers and loggers who actually tried to be good stewards of the land as they  understood the term and others who didn’t give a damn, though I haven’t  found any so far who ever rode out into the wild with the intention of do- ing grievous harm to it, and I believe there are environmentalists who are  informed and genuinely believe in what they’re doing and others who have  a score to settle. I’ve tried to apply Dutton’s premise that “Nature here is  more easily read than elsewhere” (High Plateaus, 15) to human interac- tions and the only answer I can come up with is a visual model: a strand  of barbed wire, a double-helix, a collection of ideas snapped to opposing  bases, the green myth and the cowboy myth twisted, snake like, around  each other. I spoke with A. J. Martine about this dilemma. A. J., an ecologist, is also  president of Entrada, an arts organization based in Torrey, and he owns a  house in Boulder. He grew up cowboying on a ranch in southern Colorado  and he also tried his hand at mining before he became a BLM area man- ager. He was among the fi rst managers, or perhaps he was the fi rst, to cut  back grazing on the lower Escalante, and this was working with ranchers  who wanted it cut back. Like Gayle Pollock, he sees both sides of local  issues. “We’ve had over a hundred years of grazing and a lot of that was over- grazing,” he told me at his home in Salt Lake City, “and we’ve had over a  hundred years of fi re exclusion. That’s on a delicate ecosystem that really  can’t take that kind of pressure. If we were just beginning to move cattle  onto the range today, the BLM would probably allow even less grazing than  it actually does. The BLM manages for multiple use but that doesn’t mean  every use on every acre. But the prevailing paradigm is that we’re trying to  get all the ranchers off the range. “Now some of the kids—twenty-fi ve to thirty year olds—who got into  the BLM during the supposedly ‘greener’ Clinton era—they’re a little more  outspoken and some of them do want to get rid of grazing on public lands.  But the BLM as a whole isn’t moving in that direction. They’ve been hun- kered down the last ten years. They keep getting sued by the tails of the  </page> <page sequence="44"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 5 3 curve of normal distribution. When I came in as area manager about 1991,  every single decision we made was appealed by one side or the other, and  with our small staff, we were frozen. And that’s the way it is now. Both ends  of the curve are in the business of confl ict and both ends, when they look at  the BLM, they see big government. One side says we want to lock it up for  just a few and the other says we want to open all the land up to industry. So  the range is being managed to satisfy these two extremes, which means that  true range management isn’t happening.” Martine believed the BLM lost “credible presence” when the Clinton  administration declared the national monument back in 1996. A. J. himself  was asked by the BLM’s acting associate state director to move up to the  state offi ce before the monument was created. “Turns out people I’d known and trusted in the environmental commu- nity saw me working with [Republican Senator] Bob Bennett, who trusted  me to be the token green and Democrat on his staff, and they thought I’d  gone to the other side. So the BLM moved me up north and then Clinton  rammed that monument down our throats. I thought the Clinton admin- istration was about collaboration and communication, and that’s what I’m  about. I’m a facilitator, a mediator. If they’d given us some time to work with  them on the monument, there might have been some cooperation, but that’s  when collaboration went down the toilet.” Before he was transferred to Salt Lake City, A. J. was working with Louise  Liston and SUWA on the counties’ RS 2477 claims, trying to avoid litiga- tion by fi nding compromises that would work for everybody involved, and  that all went down the toilet as well. Martine was transferred because he was  about fi nding those compromises, and no extreme political movements ever  have had much use for people in the middle.  Why is all of this important to me? Because it was more diffi cult to build  roads here than most other places on earth, and in the beginning the terrain  itself was the barrier, and now it’s other people in front of the bulldozer. Everything the road builders couldn’t push to the side got scraped up into a  ball before their blades and they have no idea now how to move it out of the  way and I don’t think they’re pushing up against facts or science anymore, or  that it’s as surfi cial as they’d like to believe; I think it is a full-blown myth; I  think it’s part of a deep structure, some elemental multitarian energy from out  of the earth itself, wearing a new mask but playing out some ancient role. Marianne is a schoolteacher nearing retirement and an ardent feminist,  a little to the left on most issues, so I think I can rely on her to have some  theory about why a bunch of cowboys woke up one day to fi nd their world  turned upside down, but her eyes just glaze over.  </page> <page sequence="45"> 2 5 4   H i g hw ay  12 Jerry Wyrick, the gray-bearded biker, master mechanic, AMC specialist,  freethinker, the guy to whom I owe all my mechanical knowledge, probably  has a straightforward opinion on the matter and he could probably render it  down to “bullshit.” We stopped at the plaque near the entrance to Capitol Reef which read,  “The best visibility in the lower 48 states is here on the Colorado Plateau.  The average summer visual range is 145 miles at Capitol Reef but a warning  has been sounded; degradation of air quality mars visitor enjoyment at the  nearby Grand Canyon. . . .” and at the bottom there was a photo of what we  would be seeing if the air quality here was the same as it is in the Ohio River  Valley, which has a visual range of nine miles. “Bullshit,” said Jerry, “pollution, my ass. The Ohio River Valley has more  humidity, that’s why you can’t see anything.” Jerry wasn’t impressed with the names, either. “Egyptian Temple, my ass.” And he had a straightforward explanation for the geological strata we  encountered: “shit happened, nothing happened, shit happened, nothing  happened.” The two of them aren’t as upset as I expect when I get back to the trail- head late and out of breath. They’re having lunch and they’re interested in  what I’ve found. Jerry is especially interested in the car. I get the feeling that  if I send them copies of the photos I took, everything will be copasetic. I  get no input on the genesis of myths from Marianne so I drop it. When we  fi nish lunch, we pack up the Mercury Sable rental car—the Heap only seats  two and this thing gets twice the gas mileage—and we head over to Notom  Road. The sun is setting beneath the clouds, so the Henry Mountains are black  and the shale badlands below them are bright-lit. The air is so thick with  light I can almost breath that light in. “Driving through Capitol Reef is like driving on the bottom of the ocean  or driving on the moon,” says Marianne. Jerry stops to let me get a picture and I scramble around trying to get the  best angle but the light shifts and fades and so it’s one of those times I just  have to get the scene fi xed in my memory: cantlands, fl atirons, hingelines,  white domes, an abandoned meander, two gray shelves, green fi elds below  me and the Unknown Mountains. The lines of the badlands are foreshortened by the light and the range  looks like fl at glass shards I could reach out and touch if I were willing to  walk across the valley. The axis of the Henrys is Dutton’s fourth center of  “maximum erosion” in the central Colorado Plateau. Almon H. Thompson  dropped Grove Karl Gilbert off here from his 1875 expedition to fl esh out  </page> <page sequence="46"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 5 5 a few nascent theories on what came to be known as “laccoliths,” buried  volcanic domes. In his introduction to the Report on the Geology of the Henry  Mountains, Gilbert says, At the time of their discovery by Professor Powell the mountains were in  the center of the largest unexplored district in the territory of the United  States—a district which by its peculiar ruggedness had turned aside all previ- ous travelers. Up to that time the greater part of the knowledge that had been  gained of the interior of the continent had been acquired in the search for  routes for transcontinental railways; and the canons of the Colorado Basin,  opposing, more serious obstacles to travel than the mountain ranges which  were met in other latitudes, were by common consent avoided by the engi- neers. (1) As the Henrys were an erosional center, then, they were also the epicen- ter of an unknown land. When Thompson was climbing the “Dirty Devil  Mountains” in 1872, he referred to the individual peaks as “First Mountain,”  “Second Mountain,” and so on, and when he reached the Dirty Devil River  soon afterward, Frederick Dellenbaugh, his young cartographer, recorded,  “We had at last traversed the unknown to the unknown” (205).  Gilbert seems to have solved the mystery of these mountains in most par- ticulars, and sometimes with mathematical precision. Dutton, Thompson,  Howell, and Powell’s geologist, John F. Steward, had all noted how the strata  curled up around the base of the Henrys and several other nearby mountain  ranges, and G.K. Gilbert spelled every detail out about how the mountains  came to reside in such strata. It is usual for igneous rocks to ascend to the surface of the earth, and there, is- sue forth and build up mountains or hills by successive eruptions. The molten  matter starting from some region of unknown depth passes through all super- incumbent rockbeds, and piles itself up on the uppermost bed. The lava of the  Henry Mountains behaved differently. Instead of rising through all the beds of  the earth’s crust, it stopped at a lower horizon, insinuated itself between two  strata, and opened for itself a chamber by lifting all the superior beds. In this  chamber it congealed, forming a massive body of trap. (19) The weight of the overlying rock kept the surrounding sandstone from  fracturing as it was lifted up on the shoulders of the buried mountains and  then erosion planed off over a mile of overburden to reveal them. Such was  the history of the La Sals and Abajos and Navajo Mountain as well, except  the last hasn’t yet freed itself from its sandstone cap. But Gilbert’s schemat- ics of how the rock above the Henry Mountains looked before they were  </page> <page sequence="47"> 2 5 6   H i g hw ay  12 exhumed closely match the dome structure of Navajo Mountain. As fast as the wind turns cold, I’m back in the car.  Notom is just a collection of ranches. We pass a grave enclosed in a six- foot-by-six-foot picket fence on a hill and some barns and bunk houses and  not much else. The road is gravel and clay, which hasn’t escaped Jerry’s at- tention. “If it was rainy, this road would be a mother,” he says. A sign tells us we’re on Route 1670, and there’s no hunting. “Always quick to say no, ain’t they?” he adds. We pass by a new, gray Dodge pickup with a horse trailer behind it and  then a cowboy in his fi fties on the horse, heading into the range and holding  down his gray hat while his cow dog tracks us with his bright eyes but makes  no move to intercept us. “You know you’re in the country,” I tell the two up front, “when you see  people hauling stuff with their pickups.” The Reef is like odd-shaped piled white plates tipped to the kitchen fl oor  but plunging through it. What’s beneath the fl oor? I wonder, What’s still down  there that the sky and the rain haven’t gotten to and when will it emerge? Looking  back at the Henrys, the machine generators of the unknown, I’m not sure  now that Gilbert has cleared everything up.  Capitol Reef turns red and we’re inside the fold, with nearly vertical  banks of shale on our left cutting off my view. On the right, the rock tilts up  from Gilbert, Geology of the Henry Mountains </page> <page sequence="48"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 5 7 until the sun slides behind the cusp and the niches and humps and clefts on  the hogsback become back-lit.  “Hope we don’t come up on a horse,” says Jerry. “They don’t have taillights on their asses,” says Marianne. We spot an arch in the ridgetop, a squinty white eye, and then the road  turns west and soon the car is laboring up switchbacks. This is the original  Burr Trail, these narrow doglegs up a sandstone wedge excavated by an an- cient rockslide, and it is so steep there’s almost no offset from the dugway  we’re on to the one we just navigated, so we can look almost straight down  at the shorter stretch of road we left behind three turns ago. “Whoever came up with the idea for this road had a lot of imagination,”  I say. Jerry is driving slow, taking in the view. “Please don’t look,” Marianne  tells him, “You scare the hell out of me.” “I’m looking at those mountains over there,” he says. “Yep, I see ‘em. I think it turns here.” “Then so will we.”  We camp at the top of the Burr Trail, near the Muley Twist Road Charles  Hall established after the San Juan Expedition had gone its way and he’d  decided there was no future in the Hole-in-the-Rock route. Having hiked  a portion of it, I’m not sure what the advantages were of this second road,  which came up from Silver Falls and ran beneath the crest of the Water- pocket Fold through a canyon named for the effect it had on your average  jackass, down Hall’s Creek and the Grand Gulch and out to what became  known as Hall’s Crossing. It avoids the steep grade at Hole-in-the-Rock and  the slickrock doom beyond it but it seems much lengthier on this side of the  Colorado. Perhaps Hall rerouted travelers through here because of the views. From  the end of the road into the Upper Muley Twist, you can walk out to the  Strike Valley Overlook. I met a short German tourist there once, a physicist  with a profi le like Charlton Heston’s, who had traveled all over the western  United States and believed the Overlook was one of the best views in the na- tion, on par with the Grand Canyon. I can only say that you will at least get  a great view of the curvature of the great reef’s spine and you may gain some  appreciation for the land that isn’t there, the missing fold above the jagged  edges of bent-up earth. Jerry and Marianne are experienced car campers. They cook some dinner  on their camp stove and they’re ready to call it a night and sleep on the car’s  comfortable front seats. They save the back seat for me but I’ve got to have  my fi re and I’ve got to see the stars. </page> <page sequence="49"> Strike Valley, view to the north Strike Valley, view to the south </page> <page sequence="50"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 5 9 In the morning we put together a plan. I convince them we should drive  down Moody Creek, and then we can ride over to Boulder and down to  Escalante and back up over the mountain and up to Fountain Green where  I’ve left the Heap, many miles north. As we travel, I explain the litigious  history of the Burr Trail. Jerry doesn’t understand what the fuss is about and  I tell him I think it’s about who owns the roads and whether we, as individu- als, have the right to travel as we see fi t. And I tell him that right isn’t in the  Constitution. He doubts me on this point. “The people that drew up the Constitution was smarter than the average  toad,” he tells me, but I maintain it isn’t there and travelling is a privilege.  “Bullshit,” he says, “It’s not a privilege, it’s a right. That’s self-evident. If  you don’t have the right to travel you’re a slave.” “Slaves” is how Jerry would classify most wage-earners, by the way. I think  of him as a wobblie when he goes on one of his tirades, no matter where he  starts, he always gets around to the unions, the grunts, the unskilled labor  and the living wage, etcetera. Hit any of these buttons and he goes off like  an unguided rocket. What was life like for the working man before unions?  If you worked construction and you fell off the scaffolding, “you were fi red  before you hit the ground.”  I should also point out that while we’ve been friends, I’ve never known  Jerry to have what most people would regard as a “real” job, that is, regular  hours, a boss, a wage, a steady paycheck and so on. But the older and further  in debt I get, the less “real” jobs—where I work hard to pay someone else’s  mortgage—seem to appeal to me. We philosophize on the law of unintended consequences. I don’t under- stand how mandating higher fuel effi ciency standards through regulations  is going to save gasoline in the long run because if the Heap got twice the  mileage from a tank of gas, I would drive it twice as far, and while Jerry fum- bles for the seatbelt and the car swerves to the edge of the road, he observes  how Utah’s mandatory seat-belt law will have the unintended consequence  of getting us all killed. “But they’ll say statistics show they shouldn’t be dead,’” he says. Again, if you want to get to the river, you have to hike down one of the  long canyons. This keeps the weak and the lazy and those who are short on  time, as we are, out of the watershed. So be it. We dine on Spam at Four  Mile Bench and head back, and by dint of my mistake, we end up taking  the Wolverine Loop west rather than backtracking to the Burr Trail, and  we only have a quarter-tank of gas left, which makes Jerry and Marianne  nervous, which puts me on edge. “This would be a hell of a place to walk out of,” says Jerry. I assure them we’ll have enough gas to make it to town. I point out the  red domes on the ridgetops and the monkey drifts of old uranium mines, but  </page> <page sequence="51"> 2 6 0   H i g hw ay  12 Last light on the Circle Cliffs their eyes are stuck on the gauge until we roll into town on more than an  eighth of a tank, which is cutting it pretty thick for my tastes. Then it’s south to Escalante and the ruins and Indian art at the river and  back north and coffee and more sandwiches on the fi rst turnoff on the Hog- back and talk about petroglyphs.  There are petroglyphs on the sandstone bluffs along the old Route 66  alignment just outside Winslow, where Marianne lives. “They’re always near a vantage point where you could look for game,”  she says. So a hunter is sitting on a ledge watching for game, Marianne’s theory  goes, and he gets bored and he sets to work on an image of what he’d like  to see on the plain below him. Time passes faster while he’s so occupied and  soon enough an antelope does appear, and he goes off and kills it. Maybe this  happens a few times. The hunter forgets the times he pecked an antelope in  the rock and nothing happened or he ascribes the antelope’s failure to appear  to his own transgressions against some other superstition, and pretty soon  he’s got a ritual going and he seems to have gotten some control over what  seemed like a random event.  </page> <page sequence="52"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 61 We drive up the side of the Aquarius Plateau and Marianne points out a  sign to me: “This highway maintained by ‘Freedom from Religion.’” I tell  them about the founder of that organization who lives in the valley we’re  leaving, an atheist who moved to Boulder long ago, when the town was  practically one hundred percent Mormon, and who antagonized one of the  locals to the point where the courts decided he was a terrorist and gave one  man he was persecuting a big settlement against him . . . blah, blah, blah . . .  “and did I tell you that the most outspoken defender of the ranchers in Es- calante and their most outspoken critic both come from Berkeley and they  both have environmentalist activists for girlfriends: Toni and Tori, and do  you think that’s a coincidence? . . . ” They’re not listening, they’re studying the landscape. The fl ank of the  Aquarius fl ows out from beneath the cap and down the mountain in the  form of ancient and not-so-ancient slides and mud spates and the highway  gains its summit right over the top of them and a series of scenic turnouts  take you to some of the best views you’ll fi nd anywhere in the world, guar- anteed. As the sun tips to Boulder Mountain, we turn off to the Homestead  Overlook and below us we have Capitol Reef and the red slash of the Circle  Cliffs and the Henrys and Navajo Mountain and every sinuous red cavity  in-between. The signs tell us about Clem Church, the father of Highway  12, the visionary who got the road put in between Grover and Boulder, and  about the rockscape below, how Connecticut or Luxemburg would fi t neatly  into the space between here and the Henrys and Navajo Mountain and how  nobody lives there and there are no houselights down there at night, which  is fast approaching. I usually manage to hit this stop in the last few hours of daylight, but  once I came through here when the sun had just set and the light was being  sapped off the Henrys and the full moon burned like the eye of a new deity,  and then I saw myself inside that eye, its inside curve the night sky, the moon  its pupil and I was looking through the moon at another, distant world. Marianne tells me about the confl agrations down in Arizona the previous  year, which left much of the northern portion of that state blackened and  just as dead as the landscape before us and I try to think of how to commu- nicate what I saw that night, long ago, but the words don’t come then. We  have miles to go, we three misfi ts, and we set out again, making for the end  of Highway 12 and beyond. The Crooked Road The Heap comes down the mountain at three centerline slashes per second.  Down past snake-arrow signs, through the aspen forest still fi lled with deep  </page> <page sequence="53"> 2 6 2   H i g hw ay  12 Petroglyph, Capitol Reef shadows from the night. Down  steep grades on Clem Church’s  road, through Bowery Flat  and 4WD Creek, past Pleas- ant Creek and Wildcat Ranger  Station, Chokecherry Creek  and Singletree Creek. Down  into Wayne County, while I’m  thinking about a road to a Na- vajo Sandstone nowhere, think- ing about still ripples in the rock  and still animals and a sleeping  land, watching for deer, think- ing about the toolbox in the bed  waiting for me to crash so it can  fl y forward and separate my skull  from my spinal column. I’m thinking how this road never would have been built if it hadn’t been  for the federal government and how that same government also helped  many people in the towns along Highway 12 make it through the Great  Depression. How the money has always fl owed in from the east, and I’m  wondering if the locals should be surprised that control is fl owing in from  the same direction.  Highway 12 twists to the toe of landslides, the bottom of the mountain.  It leaves Dixie National Forest and then comes into Grover, which is just  scattered ranches for sale and second homes, no center, with another Wide  Hollow Reservoir above it.  The Great Western Trail joins the Highway  from the south and another road cuts off for Teasdale past the ragged edge  of another Cockscomb built of Moenkopi and Navajo Sandstone. On that  road are more ruins of defunct ranching operations and more old farming  machinery and other junk which is pleasing to my eye but ugly to most oth- ers, and trailers and ranches on the edge of town with hoodoos in their back- yards. That road comes through the heart of Teasdale, right by the cultural  center with its weird, domical brown roof, by a pasture with one white and  one black horse in it, out towards Torrey, but it ends at a T at Highway 24  before the throne of Thousand Lakes Plateau. I turn off before I get to Teasdale and drive down a road of deep mud  from the spring thaw to Fish Creek with two white dogs and a black sheep- dog barking wildly and crossing in front of the Heap, and at a turnaround I  fi nd pictographs on the white Navajo Sandstone. There are several headless  </page> <page sequence="54"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 6 3 The Henry Mountains from Highway 12 on the slope of the Aquarius Plateau sheep, antelope or deer and there are wedge fi gures with sashes and jewelry  and a familiar totem, the same kind of horned fi gure that guards over Calf  Creek. All of this art is shot up badly and crisscrossed with cowboy-glyphs  from as far back as the 1880s, and a few brands: Beyond the Aquarius Plateau the land is turned outward and the magic  begins to dissipate. This is still remote country but it’s connected to the  outside world. It makes sense. Highway 12 itself Ts to Highway 24 short of  mile marker 124, about a mile east of Torrey. At its end are a gas station and  a cemetery. Mountain of Bones I’ve been on the chalky headland of Powell Point for about an hour, letting  the view soak in, pacing the rim of a thousand-foot drop, studying, through  binoculars, the totems of Bryce Canyon and the red wounds beneath me  where the forest cover and loose earth have been excoriated, the transition  in the aspen crowns from green to orange and yellow where death has crept  down the mountain, and the skyline, the lip of the Grand Canyon a distant,  </page> <page sequence="55"> 2 6 4   H i g hw ay  12 Fading and shot up wedge figures at Fish Creek cryptic blue, and the black mound of Navajo Mountain at the bottom of the  Straight Cliffs. Dutton, as I’ve said, describes the thirty-mile-wide basin of the Paria Am- phitheater, headwater of the Paria River, as a radially expanding wave of  disintegration and negative causality with its nexus at the Paunsaugunt fault  intersecting another such wave of erosion propagated from the center of the  Circle Cliffs, and that intersection lies right where I stand, on what he calls  the ”Parthenon” at the southern extreme of the Escalante Mountains (High  Plateaus, 253, 297).   Last night I slept at Griffi n Top, at ten thousand feet, next to piles of  lumber cut by Stephen Steed’s men and I watched Orion with his sword  of newborn suns spin on the hinges of the night into the western horizon,  where those stars were extinguished by the crowns of spruce. When I woke up this morning, the water I’d left in the frying pan had  frozen into a puck. I didn’t get up until about 11:00, when sunlight fi nally  crossed my sleeping bag and the wind snapped an icicle off the water jug  spout and it stuck into the ground like a needle.  I drove the ridge of Barney Top on a jarringly rough road, FS 143, past a  radio tower, over patches of snow and, later, mud, to the turnaround where  </page> <page sequence="56"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 6 5 I had to hike in to the Table Cliffs, setting one big old spruce, which had  toppled over the edge of a two-hundred-foot declivity but was still hitched  by two roots and a couple crumbly rock bosses, free to the caprices of grav- ity along the way. And here I am, confronted by a huge, silent blue block of  scenery. I don’t snap many photos because my camera’s lenses reduce jagged ho- rizons to wavy lines, and I drive back down Pine Canyon, past Pine Lake  where the ghosts of Widstoe still cross to the Great Western Trail, down to  John’s Valley and back up to town. There I pay a brief visit to Bruce Osojnak  and his brother Keith, who tell me why I’m getting A.M. broadcasts from  Portland and Los Angeles and the Navajo chants from the reservation in  Northern Arizona at night: because the ionosphere solidifi es in the evening  and the A.M. waves “skip” down off it. I take the old road out of Widstoe, up Sweetwater Canyon, from which  the blessings of spring water still fl ow to a few fi elds in John’s Valley, up the  switchbacks with the Heap growling in second, grinding gravel and spitting  out dust for purchase, over the saddle again—the intersection of FS 143 to  Barney Top and FS 140 to Griffi n Top.  A man named Heber Hall grew up near here and his family came through  this pass in a wagon back in 1927, when he was a child, and Hall asked his  mother if he was seeing the entire world from there. He records, “Until  Thousand Lakes Plateau </page> <page sequence="57"> 2 6 6   H i g hw ay  12 today, I had believed the winds, rain, snow, sleet, hail, all the weather had its  origin from the top of the Boulder Mountain” (Hall, 42).  More switchbacks and I come down through Main Canyon, where there’s  a line of old shacks, the remains of the McNelly Ranch, and a burnt-up  lumber mill, quite possibly the one owned by the Steeds. Whether there was  ever a roof over the blackened machinery and the rusted framework around  the saw blade, I can’t say, but I can say it was a fair-sized operation, employed  a few men. There are piles of refuse scattered about and fi fty-fi ve gallon  drums, and there’s a safety-yellow International Loadstar 1600 hood here  and a seized-up block of metal that was once an International tractor, with  the tires melted off the rims and a radiator grill of inch-high slats with fl ecks  of paint still adhering to the metal. There’s a hauling truck with its tires still  infl ated and there’s a bulldozer with gleaming hydraulic arms extended and  two rotting piles of lumber stacked taller than me. All this, I would argue,  once represented a sizeable business. I drive into Escalante, buy some provisions, some batteries and fi lm and  some canned corn. I’m on the Fremont diet now; my boss got his deer this  season and I got venison and I brought along a bag of pinyon nuts. I head up Hell’s Backbone Road to the bridge where, by coincidence, I  meet Reese Stein, writer for Utah Outdoors and anchorman for Channel Two  in Salt Lake City, and his wife and a couple of their friends who are on a  road trip over the Backbone from Escalante. They’re eating lunch off their  tailgate by the bridge and I’m out on a precipice, a knife-edged ridge with  hundred-foot drops off either side, taking pictures of cross-bedded ravines  and crystalline fractures and sheer verges, with my foot over the edge to  show scale, when they call me over to join them. We talk about Highway 12,  about the corners of this country which are still unexplored and the lack of  tourists. Stein and I are both put off by the crowds around Moab. He’s been  coming here for twenty years, to a place more familiar to Europeans and the  Japanese than most Utahns. He tells me, “When I visited Calf Creek once,  back in the eighties, fi ve of the ten campgrounds were occupied and four of  those were by people from outside the United States.” They feed me crackers and cheese and Stein gives me a few tips about  where I might fi nd petroglyphs around the Escalante River, and then some  parting advice: “Be careful. People make me nervous when they’re traveling  by themselves.” And I tell him “Sometimes I make myself nervous.” Stein and company head for Boulder and I drive back and catch Posey  Lake Road over the west shoulder of the Aquarius Plateau, the highest for- ested plateau in North America.  </page> <page sequence="58"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 6 7 Road to Boulder Top Dutton describes the lakes on the Aquarius’ summit as “broad sheets of  water a mile or two in length” (High Plateaus, 286). Today I see no such  bodies of water. Cyclone Lake, which I remember as a long, liquid swath of  mirrored sky, is a puddle in a marsh. Further on, other lakes which “never  dry up,” according to Dutton, are entirely missing, replaced by black ulcers  of dried mud. Roundy Reservoir is gone and Big Lake is neither big nor  even a lake. The shadows spread but I keep driving. I try to get to Boulder Top but it’s  too muddy on this side of the plateau, so I turn west, take FS 140, heading  for Griffi n Top, detouring on side roads when I get the opportunity. I search  for the “sinkholes” which are supposed to be around here somewhere and  don’t fi nd them, but I do fi nd an elk carcass in a fi eld of grass hummocks,  its head and upper spine broken free, the skin shrunk to the upper jaw so it  appears to be grimacing. Further on, I fi nd disarticulated cow bones: femurs  and scapulas and a complete cow skeleton not far from the road, with a bul- let-sized hole through its skull. Coyote Hollow, one of the headlands of Antimony Creek, is a short- grass steppe capped by a Montana sky. I fi nd a clearing in the woods at its </page> <page sequence="59"> 2 6 8   H i g hw ay  12 Cyclone lake on the Aquarius Plateau southeastern end and set up camp there and watch the sun sink into the hills,  watch the shadowline seep over the gentle folds like rising black water and  the light in the west fade in bands to darkness. I read the names on my map  by the fi re’s blue fl ame: two Mud Lakes, Bug Lake, Stink Flats, Five Lakes  and Four Lakes, Guddyback Lake, Twitchell Creek and Griffi n Creek, Au- ger Hole Lake, Barney Lake, Black Lake and the Black Stairs, Lightning  Lake, Lost Lake and Bone Flat. I plan the next day’s itinerary. The moon casts achromic light on the meadow and lampblack shadows  too. I walk away from the campfi re, to the edge of the woods, and study the  rounded knobs and the bluffs to the east. I listen for coyotes but I never hear  them on the Aquarius Plateau. Next day, on my way down from the plateau, heading for Bicknell, I’m  motioned to stop by the driver of a white pickup in the oncoming “lane.” He’s  middle-aged, wears an orange cap and vest. “Where’re they at?” he asks. I tell him what I’m up to. I’ve seen a few deer around, one buck, but no elk  at all, and that’s the season we’re in. He doesn’t seem disappointed; he’s been  up here about as long as I have and he’s caught sight of the Heap now and  then and he knew we probably weren’t after the same thing. I tell him where  </page> <page sequence="60"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 6 9 I’m going and he lets me know what I’m in for: washboard. And he asks me  to pass a message along to the Forest Service: “Please grade FS 154.”  I don’t want any special treatment, but if it’s up to a vote, I’ll second that  motion. The Heap gets hammered and the metal fatigued side-view mir- ror bracket, which I bought maybe two years ago, snaps. There’s one point  where the Heap continues, counter to all steering inputs, in the direction of  a roadside ditch, but it comes around just before taking the plunge. Today my way takes me over the Awapa Plateau, the lowest of the High  Plateaus. Dutton describes it as . . . a dreary place. Upon its broad expanse scarcely a tree lifts its welcome  green, save a few gnarled and twisted cedars. Its herbage consists only of the  ubiquitous artemisia and long nodding grasses. Not a spring or stream of wa- ter is known upon all its area, except at the lowest part. . . . A ride across it is  toilsome and monotonous in the extreme. It takes us over an endless succes- sion of hills and valleys, clad with a stony soil, usually just steep enough to  worry the animals, but not enough so to require us, or to even encourage us,  to dismount. (High Plateaus, 273) Except for the condition of the road, I enjoy traveling over the Awapa. It  is an endless succession of hills and valleys, and there’s still little vegetation  and there are no trees, but there are rocky bluffs spread over it—Timbered  Knoll and Smooth Knoll, Bald Knoll and Flossie Knoll—and there are old  cairns piled on top of some of them, and each rise brings into view the con- vergence of the snow-capped northern Sevier Plateau and the Wasatch Pla- teau and Thousand Lake Mountain and the bright red tear of sandstone  above Bicknell. The land here is sullen and restless at once and the hills are  like waves rolling from the storm of mountains on the horizon.  In the evening, I return from town and drive to the top of Boulder Moun- tain. The road cuts diagonally up the black eminence of Rock Spring Ridge,  gaining the top of a fl at in a sideways manner, then doglegging back around  Lookout Peak and up to Cook Pasture where a winter gate will close the  Mountain off to visitors from November 1 until June 15. That’s in about  three weeks. From there, the road chops up through another lava bulwark  right to the top of Boulder Mountain. Glaciers fl owed off the Aquarius’s peaks a few tens of thousands of years  ago and nearly leveled them. The surface of the Aquarius’s lava cap has been  scalloped into drumlins and kettles and the loose rock has been dredged up  and spread over the plateau and the surrounding country as erratics. Stands  of Engelmann spruce lean from kames over open country as if from islands,  and there are whole forests in the blue hollows.  </page> <page sequence="61"> 2 7 0   H i g hw ay  12 The clouds are fl at like ice sheets and the autumn sky is a jet blue. I can  almost feel the sun’s rays shifting south. I’d almost expect to see the brighter  stars during the day, and now night is falling.  I’ve got the summer top on the Heap, and it has no doors. I study the  map for a few minutes. The main road will take me all the way across the  top, to Bown’s Point, about sixteen miles away, where I can camp and watch  the sun rise out of the skelic rockscape to the east, out of what Dutton called  the Dreamland.  The road starts out level and smooth, and I make time. I pause at Bluebell  Knoll which is just another forested knob barely higher than its neighbors,  but is also, at 11,322 feet, the highest point on the plateau, and I go on, past  the barren depression which used to be Elbow Lake, through East Boulder  Draw and Stink Flats and Stink Draw, which thankfully don’t smell this eve- ning. The sunlight contracts into slivers and fades out, and then the rim of a  harvest moon, an airless, waterless skeleton world, breaks over the threshold  directly in line with the road. Its yellow skull face is looming, incandescent. I  can clearly make out Tycho Crater and the coastlines of the Ocean of Storms  and the Seas of Tranquility and Crisis.  The road deteriorates and the trip turns into a mud slog. The Heap is  starved for air. The vacuum gauge, which normally reads seventeen inches  at idle, is stuck at twelve. I spin the tires through snow fi elds and somewhere  around Pleasant Creek Meadow I come to a hundred-foot-long snow bank,  with tree lines extending out from either side. There are ATV tracks on top  of it but in three attempts I can only get the Heap up about a third of its  length. This is the end of the road. The Andrus Expedition made it further. They gained the plateau in early  October of 1866 and traversed Boulder Top, which Woolley described as  “comparatively fl at, (with) numerous Small lakelets, Groves of Pine timber,  growing less dense as we proceed,” and then they circled back to Bown’s  Point, where they saw the Colorado Plateau Stretching as far as the Eye can see a naked barren plain  of red and white Sandstone crossed in all directions by innumerable gorges . .  . Occasional high buttes rising above the general level, the country gradually  rising up to the ridges marking the “breakers” or rocky bluffs of the larger  streams. The sun shining down on this vast red plain almost dazzled our eyes  by the refl ection as it was thrown back from the fi ery surface. And, more to the point of their mission: To N of East and distant about 15 to 20 miles appear the breakers of two larger  streams one coming from the N.E. Supposed to be the Green River the other  </page> <page sequence="62"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 71 coming from the ESE Supposed to be Grand (Colorado) River. (Crampton,  156) Here, according to historian C. Gregory Crampton, the expedition mis- identifi ed the Fremont River as the Green River and upper Hall’s Creek  with the Colorado, while the actual confl uence of the Green and Colo- rado that they were looking for is about eighty miles away, in what’s now  Canyonlands National Park. Believing they’d completed their mission of  exploring the territory from the Kaibab Plateau to the mouth of the Green  River and accurately charting the only Indian trails to cross the Colorado  River, they reversed course and crossed back over Boulder Top and over  the Awapa Plateau, which Woolley described as “barren, destitute of water”  (Crampton, 158). From the Aquarius to the abandoned town of Circlev- ille they encountered no natives, only old trails and “rude breast works of  rock” and the remains of cattle stolen from nearby ranches. However, the  expedition did also fulfi ll its mission of “chastising” the hostile Indians, not  through violence but with a little dangerous knowledge—descriptions of  “green grassy meadows” and “extensive range for stock,” “level,” “fertile”  land that was “easy to irrigate” quickly drew settlers into the High Plateaus;  and they effectively separated the Utes and Paiutes from their own home- lands. The temperature has probably dropped into the thirties. I race back  through draws, over low hills with the moon over my shoulder lighting the  thin ice coating, the spruces, and the land. The frozen mud holes splinter  when I ride over them. I look around for a spot to camp, a sheltered place  where the ground is dry, but see nothing, and I fi nally decide to get off the  mountain. Coasting down the dugway with the canyon winds, I have the  Awapa Plateau spread before me to the mountains and the Parker Range,  where it falls off to Grass Valley. The plain shifts subtly in the moonlight,  shadowed crests pulsing and seething with the night’s energy. I set out my bag in a dell at the edge of that vast terrace, at an old hunting  camp with a log tied crossways between two trees. Deadwood is plentiful  and I’m not stingy with it; the logs pop in the heat and the fi re spits six feet  into the cold air. I walk out into the open for a fi nal look at the Milky Way,  rachis of the sky, and I fi nd another fi re pit with a charred rib cage in it. Again, in the morning I can’t force myself out of my sleeping bag until  I have sunlight on my face. Packing my outfi t takes about half-an-hour  and then I’m off for Dark Canyon, just over the fl ank of Boulder Top, at  the base of a shelf of volcanic rock. The road is rough and the Heap has  to crawl, but it’s worth the effort. I pass a line shack rotting from its earth  </page> <page sequence="63"> 2 7 2   H i g hw ay  12 Awapa Plateau foundation, descend to the fl oor on a narrow switchback and I come to a  hidden corner of paradise—a green meadow enclosed by volcanic cliffrock  and ponderosa and aspen—with cows grazing along its whole length and  old fenceline strung all over, shacks leaning away from the mountain with  their sagging wood walls bleached out and a two-story line camp at the  fi eld’s edge with a new roof, a swing set out back, a hose with a sprinkler  at its end and a still-functional Ford tractor from the fi fties or early sixties  parked in the yard. This, I imagine, is what Boulder must have been like a hundred years  earlier—a green swale hidden in a rock pocket. I knock on the door but  there’s nobody home, so I peek in the windows and poke around the col- lapsing shacks.  I drive back past aspens bowed over the road, up to the top of Boulder  Mountain, and I try to get out to its rim, to reach one of the promontories  from which Dutton surveyed the wasted immensities of rock beyond the  plateau, but the side roads have all been torn up to prevent the hillsides from  eroding into the empty lakes and killing the dead fi sh. I drive past fl ag trees  and scrags and the remnant of Raft Lake, past an elk jawbone and a femur,  over the still-frozen road, through brown fi elds of galleta grass laying on the  land like a shriveled deer hide, past the dead black beds of the Twin Lakes,  </page> <page sequence="64"> T h e  E a s t e r n  R im     2 7 3 past more scatterings of cattle bones, and I don’t seem to be coming any  nearer the edge. I park the Heap and walk east, over an old rock bar and then into a draw.  Beyond a lava plug and the plateau’s cap, there’s the vesticated red desert,  Tantalus Flat, the Waterpocket Fold, and above that are the Henrys, the  Unknown Mountains, bright gray now with the sun fi ltered through the  sky’s red edge, though in the morning, with the light behind them, they  become a fl at black plane of night, an open portal off the earth. Dutton was on the south edge of Boulder Mountain when he wrote the  following description, but he might as well have been where I am now: It is a sublime panorama. The heart of the inner Plateau country is spread  out before us in a bird’s-eye view. It is a maze of cliffs and terraces lined off  with stratifi cation, of crumbling buttes, red and white domes, rock plat- forms gashed with profound canons, burning plains barren even of sage—all glowing with bright color and fl ooded with blazing sunlight. Everything visible  Dark Canyon </page> <page sequence="65"> 2 74     H i g hw ay  12 tells of ruin and decay. It is the extreme of desolation, the blankest solitude, a superlative desert (High Plateaus 286-287). I rest at the edge of the pseudo-mountain, watch the desert burn, look  for Highway 12, the road which brought me to the side roads which carried  me here, but my view is blocked by lava breaks and spruces and the plateau’s  curve. My watch says it’s exactly three o’clock, but it actually stopped at that  time this morning. I don’t know what the hour is, but it’s late and I have to  work tomorrow, so I go back to the Heap and I drive down from the plateau,  watching for the roads which will carry me home. </page> </plain_text>
