HEFFNER, Editor University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Archaeological Bulletin.-In R. Et. Gr., xli, 190-191, pp. 197-295, CHARLES DUGAS presents an archaeological bulletin taken from the journals and books of Europe and America mainly for 1926 and 1927. For Numismatics the same is done by S. DAVID LE SUFFLEUR, pp. 296-303. Epigraphical Bulletin.-In R. Pt. Gr., xli, 192 (July-Sept., 1928), pp. 360-388, P. ROUSSEL furnishes an epigraphical bulletin, a digest of material in journals and of books on the subject appearing in Europe and America in 1927 and 1928. PRETORIA.-Representation of Rhinoceros by Stone Age Man.-In The Illus- trated London News, July 14, 1928 (fig.) is shown a picture of a white rhinoceros engraved upon basaltic rock. The illustration was furnished by Mr. Herbert Lang, of the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria, and shows the animal annoyed by a swarm of tick birds. This primitive work of art may be from 25,000 to 50,000 years old. At all events it shows some surprisingly developed features. The Illustrated London News, Oct. 6, 1928, p. 599 (fig.) quotes from a communica- tion received from Mr. HERBERT LANG, of the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria, in which the writer describes a petroglyphic representation of a black rhinoceros tossing a man. The work, which is a bas-relief cut in hard basaltic. rock, may be more than 50,000 years old. Its artistic qualities are remarkably good. Southern Africa is regarded as a center of great importance for Paleolithic art. NECROLOGY Walther Amelung, His Life and Work.-At the November (1927) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, F. NOACK gave an account, which was at the same time a eulogy, of W. Amelung, who had died at Bad Nauheim on September 12 (See A.J.A., xxxii, 66-67.). A gifted and trained actor and musician, he was a member of the Berlin Royal Theatre for several years after taking his Doctorate at Munich in 1888 with a thesis on Hellenistic vase painting; but he soon returned to the field of classical scholarship of his teacher Heinrich Brunn, and during the rest of his life, making his home in Rome, he devoted his great talents to the study and 1The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Archaeological Books are con- ducted by Professor HEFFNER, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor SAMUEL E.

He undertook the stupendous task of cataloguing the sculptures of the Vatican, nearly two thousand numbers, and published the first and second volumes in 1903 and 1908, but the third, and last, was never issued. In 1911 appeared his revision of Helbig's Fiihrer durch die Museen Roms, and in 1913 his own Einfiihrung in die antike Kunst. During all these years he had been contributing essays and articles of the highest value to encyclopedias and other collections and to archaeological journals, chiefly German and Italian, but including some French, English, and American. His knowledge of ancient art was excelled, if at all, only by Furtwaengler's, but his main interest was in Greek sculpture of the fifth and fourth centuries, and his greatest achieve- ments were in the perception and reconstruction of the original Greek conception in the fragments and inferior copies that exist in Italy and western Europe in general. The last of these was a statue of Myron, representing an athlete tying bands over his hair, which has been published posthumously with text by M. Bieber. (Jh. Arch. I., xlii, 1927, 152 ff.) After spending the years of the war in Berlin, active in the affairs of the Archaeologische Institut, he returned to Rome in 1921 as head of the Roman section. One of the great interests of these last years was the discovery and study of many rare treasures in the long undisturbed magazines of the Vatican, but this work too was cut short by his death. (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 426-439) Panagiotis Cavvadias.-Born at Cephallenia in 1850, Panagiotis Cavvadias died July 20, 1928, shortly after being brought back from Epidaurus, where he had been stricken by sudden illness. He studied at Athens, Paris, London, Munich, and Rome. In 1881 he began the excavations at Epidaurus, which occupied him, with intermissions, to the end of his life. He was ephor general from 1885 to 1909, and was in charge of the work on the acropolis at Athens, 1886-1889. His activity was remarkable, and many discoveries are due to him. He was in virtual exile from 1909 until 1916, a victim of undeserved accusations. He was the author of voluminous works on Greek prehistory and Greek art, a first volume of a work on Epidaurus, a volume on Lycosura, the first part of the Musdes d'Athenes, the Marbles of Greece, a collection of pictures for instruction in archaeology, a brief catalogue of the museums of Athens, and a great number of articles. He was honored by many foreign universities and academies. (S. REINACH, R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, pp. 129-131) Jane Ellen Harrison.-4)n April 16, 1928, Miss Jane Ellen Harrison died at the age of 77 years. In her girlhood she read the New Testament in Greek and studied Hebrew. In 1874 she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, where she attracted Gladstone's attention by her ability. Her first published work was The Myths of the Odyssey in Literature and Art, her second Studies in Greek Art (1885). Then followed the Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens (1890), and Greek Vase Paintings (1894). After this she devoted herself to the history of religion. She was Fellow and Lecturer at Newnham College. Her later works were Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1903), Primitive Athens (1906), Themis (1912), Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1921). She was perhaps too much influenced by the views of Doerpfeld, Gilbert Murray, Andiew Lang, J. G. Frazer, and others, but had also abundant ideas of her own. (S. R., R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, p. 131; cf. London Times, April 17, 1928) Th6ophile Homolle.-In R. Nt. Gr., xl, 1927, pp. 296-313, RENP CAGNAT reviews the life and works of Th6ophile Homolle, presenting in particular a valuable summary of the developments in carrying on the excavations made by Homolle in Delos and at Delphi. (See A.J.A., xxx, 339; xxxi, 357) Georges Musset.-The modest and diligent scholar, Georges Musset, librarian</page><page sequence="3">110 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 and archivist at La Rochelle, was born in 1844 and died in May, 1928. He was the author of books on L'Art en Saintonge et en Aunis (with Mgr. LaferriBre) and on La Charente-Inferieure avant l'histoire and several lesser works. :(X., R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, p. 132) Emile Senart.-The dean of French orientalists, emile Senart, died in Paris, February 21, 1928. He was born at Reims, March 26, 1847. Since 1882 he:had been a member of the Institut de France; he belonged to many academies and learned societies in France and other countries and had an honorary doctorate from Oxford. His writings on Indian beliefs, literature, customs, and languages are many and important. (PAUL PELLIOT, Journal des Dgbats, Feb. 23, 1928, R. Arch., xxvii, 1928, pp. 340-342) PREHISTORIC, ORIENTAL AND CLASSICAL EGYPT Egyptian Accessions.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 6 (June, 1928), pp. 158-160, AMBROSE LANSING reviews the recent accessions to the Egyptian Collection of the Museum, which are now on exhibition in the Third Egyptian Room. Egyptian Portrait Head.-The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has recently received a fragment in brown quartzite, of a head originally forming part of a statuette. The greater part of the face and the fore part of the headdress are preserved. The workmanship of the head is of the highest order. Comparison with similar heads in the Cairo Museum and in the Metropolitan Museum in New York led the author to the opinion that the present head is of the Twelfth Dynasty and should be grouped with the sculptures of Sesostris III and Amenemhat III, and more especially with those of the former king. (B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 156 (Aug., 1928), pp. 61-64 (8 figs.)) "Germinating" Figure of Osiris.--An illustration of the interesting "germinat- ing" figure of Osiris found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, and now in the Museum at Cairo, has been published for the first time (The Illustrated London News, Oct. 6, 1928, pp. 589-591 (5 figs.)). An image of the god in the form of wooden frame- work was covered with linen and then filled with silt from the Nile. Into this soil grain was placed, which was moistened so as to induce sprouting. The growth symbolized the resurrection of the god and of the king. THEBES.-Section II of the Bull. Metr. Mus., Dec., 1928, gives a report of the work of the Museum's Egyptian Expedition of 1927-1928. H. E. WINLOCK writes (pp. 1-28; 36 figs.) about the excavations at Thebes, where the stupendous task of moving over a million cubic feet of dirt deposited by Naville while excavat- ing in 1893 was executed. In the quarry hole, after the dumped material had been removed, were found fragments of sculpture consisting of a miscellaneous pile, thrown in when Hat-Shepsfit's portraits were demolished. While not everything has been put together as yet, nevertheless a colossal sphinx head of red granite has been assembled. There are also the lower halves of two small seated statues worked in black granite, head of statue in red granite, a sandstone group showing .Hat-Shepsit being nursed by a goddess. Many of the wilfully mutilated statues are very instructive, in that the destruction took place shortly after their comple- tion, before they had time to become weather-worn, and the paint left on them thus helps to clarify our ideas on the function of color on statues. Enough ma- terial has been assembled to give a fair idea of Deir el Bahri Temple, the general features of which are outlined in this report. C. K. WILKINSON writes (pp. 29-36; 8 figs.) about early Christian paintings in the oasis of Khargeh, which had not been studied since an interrupted investigation</page><page sequence="4">ASSYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 111 in 1910. The writer made a very careful examination of these monuments and to a considerable degree fills out our previous knowledge of them. He favors the late fourth or early fifth century as the proper date. N. DE G. DAVIES writes (pp. 37-48; 6 figs.) about the graphic work of the Ex- pedition. On the tomb of Rekh-mi-R?' is a picture hitherto insufficiently noticed. Its three features, women with children, men with linen, and men with cattle, indicate the assessment levied by the temple treasury. Interesting details about the nationality, style of dress, etc., of the slaves are furnished by these pictures. The several processes involved in brick-making are vividly portrayed. The whole picture is rich in human touches. An examination of the tomb of Sen-nuifer added important facts to our knowledge about the Egyptian home. Tomb of Hetep-Heres I.-In B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 157 (Oct., 1928), pp. 76-88 (14 figs.), G. A. REISNER completes the preliminary report of the Harvard-Boston Expedition into the tomb of Queen Hetep-Heres I at Giza. The alabaster sar- cophagus, which, it was hoped, would contain the mummy of the queen, was found to be empty. The alabaster canopic chest, found in a niche in the wall, contained the viscera of the queen and a liquid which proved to be a solution of Egyptian natron. The carrying chair and the toilet box were restored. Among other finds were alabaster jars, copper and gold implements, fragments of pottery, and offer- ings of food. The contents of the tomb are to enrich the national collection in the Cairo Museum. Tutankhamen's Bow-Case.-The Illustrated London News, Oct. 20, 1928, pp. 712-715 (7 figs.), shows pictures of Tutankhamen's bow-case, which have now been released for the first time. The case, which remarkably resembles the gun- case of a modern sportsman, is elaborately decorated with figures, one of them showing the king on the safari, and others a great variety of scenes from the chase, animals with arrows shot into their bodies, dogs, birds, and the like. Not only are the figures very artistically set forth, but the work is also most realistic. The zoblogy here represented adds considerably to our knowledge of animals in ancient Europe. Tutankhamen's Tomb.-In The Illustrated London News, July 7, 1928, pp. 3-7 (13 figs.), is a brief report of certain objects found during the clearing of the fourth chamber, or annex, of Tutankhamen's tomb. The annex contained a jumbled pile of objects which had been left behind by the ancient tomb robbers who were bent upon articles of gold, silver, or copper. However, among the articles left behind was a fine little casket veneered with ivory, the lid of which is skillfully carved in bas-relief figures, and beautifully colored. The central panel, measuring about 8 by 10 inches, is described as "perhaps the finest specimen of Theban art found among this hoard of art treasures." A nest of coffins contained heirlooms from the line of rulers which ended with Tutankhamen. In a wooden chest were found sixteen objects consisting of small pieces of iron fastened in hard wood, which are explained as being model tools, and are of particular importance, because they show that iron was known, but apparently as a very rare metal, to the Egyptians at this early date. ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA Minoan Faience in Mesopotamia.-In J.H.S., xlviii, 1928, pt. i (pp. 64-74; 9 figs.), H. R. HALL compares some small objects of highly glazed polychrome ware found on the site of Assyrian Ashur, on the Tigris, with some others now in the British Museum, from Enkomi and Maroni in Cyprus, which are of precisely the same type and in some cases appear to be the work of the same maker. In a sketch of the history of the making of glass and glazed ware in Babylonia, Persia, Egypt,</page><page sequence="5">112 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 and Crete, he says that Cretan faience of the M.M. III period is scarcely to be distinguished from that of Babylonia, but because of the presence in the Ashur- Enkomi group of one piece of a peculiarly Minoan type (the detachable upper part of a vase), he concludes that these objects are examples of the Minoan art of Cy- prus, two or three centuries later than the great faience age in Crete. SCHECHEM.-Excavations of the German Oriental Society.-In Z. D. Pal. V. 1 (1928), pp. 265-274, (1 plan; 8 plates), E. SELLIN describes the latest excavations on the site of ancient Schechem. The entire acropolis has now been laid bare, and the remains are established as belonging to two periods. The oldest, containing several houses, belong to the Middle Bronze Age. The later, to which belong a cyclopean retaining wall, a palace, and a temple, date from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (after 1600 B.C.). The excavations have also established the fact that there are two city-walls. The cyclopean wall in the north, with the north gate and the adjacent palace, belong to the first half of the Late Bronze Age (1600-1300 B.c.). One, or even two hundred years later, a second inner wall was built, to which the east gate belongs. Among the smaller objects discovered were pottery figures of birds and animals, bronze weapons and implements, jewelry, and scarabs of the Middle and New Egyptian Empires. UR.-Headdress of Queen Shub-ad.-In The Illustrated London News, June 30, 1928, p. 1207 (fig.), is shown a reconstruction of the elaborate headdress con- sisting of gold and beads found on the skull of Queen Shub-ad in the excavations conducted at Ur by C. Leonard Woolley. SYRIA AND PALESTINE BEISAN.--Some of the outstanding discoveries by the Palestine Expedition conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Museum during the earlier part of the 1928 season are briefly noted by ALAN ROWE, the Field Director (The Illus- trated London News, Dec. 8, 1928, pp. 1093-1095 and 1208 (12 figs.)). A Canaanite migdol, or fort tower, and a large silo for grain are mentioned as unique discoveries. The migdol apparently was intended as the final stronghold into which the Egyp- tian commandant and his troops, who held Beisan, might retire. A jug in the form of a pot-bellied man and a green jasper amulet of a cat were found in the migdol. Another important object is a small bronze figurine of a god with a conical cap and holding an axe in one raised hand. It is believed that the figure represents the Hittite storm deity, Teshub. The silo, as it remains, has a capacity of over nine thousand gallons. Most of what is left stands underground. The writer of this news item announces that other discoveries of importance have been found elsewhere on this site and that many more finds here are con- fidently anticipated. In Pal. Ex. Fund, lx (1928), pp. 73-90 (5 pls.), A. ROWE reports the latest finds in the mound of ancient Beth-Shan. In the level of Thothmes III (ca. 1500 B.C.) two temples were found, one containing a fine Egyptian stele stating that it was dedicated to "Mekal, the god of Beth-Shan." This deity is known from late Phoenician inscriptions from Cyprus where he is identified with Resheph, the lightning-god. In this temple was found also the primitive mass.bah, or fetish- stone; an inner sanctuary containing two altars, a stone libation-basin, and a fine libation-cup decorated with dark red-purple designs on a red background; also a sacrificial altar-room containing a great altar of brick. A very important object, new to Palestinian archaeology, is a portable Cretan altar-stand of basalt with a cross with knobbed ends in high-relief on its top. The northern temple in the level of Thothmes III was dedicated to his goddess consort. The most interesting object found here was a pottery bowl with an undulating serpent in high-relief on</page><page sequence="6">SYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 113 its exterior. This is the earliest evidence of the ophiolatry which was character- istic of Beth-Shan in all later periods of its history. The serpents are frequently represented with female breasts, from which it may be inferred that the goddess of the northern temple was worshiped under the form of a serpent. It is even pos- sible that Shan in Beth-Shan is the old Babylonian serpent-deity Sha-an, or Sha- han, who appears both in male and in female form. The level of Amenhotep III yielded another Canaanite temple with numerous images of serpents with female breasts and pottery figures of pigs, witnessing to the primitive sanctity of the pig among the Semites. In the same level was found a Babylonian cylinder seal bearing the inscription, "Ma-an-nu-um, the diviner, servant of the god En-ki (Ea)," also a fine Hittite seal representing two gods and an elephant. Other interesting objects were a bronze Hittite dagger and axe-head identical in design witththe&amp;azmaof Hittite kings depicted at Boghaz-keui. (See also the articles of A. ROWE in Mus. J., March, 1928, and L. H. VINCENT, R. Bibl., xxxvii (1928), pp. 123-138.) In Mus. J. (University of Pennsylvania), xix, 2 (June, 1928), pp. 145-169 (5 plates; plan; 10 figs.), ALAN ROWE makes the final report of the 1927 excavations at Beisan. The excavations were conducted only in the following levels: (1) Thothmes III; (2) Pre-Amenophis III; (3) Amenophis III; (4) Seti I; (5) Rameses II; (6) Byzantine. Of the first level, the most important find is the cult-stela of Mekal, god of Beth- Shan-an Egyptian dedication in the southern temple. In the second level, were found three two-handled pottery cylindrical drain pipes, two of them in situ, beneath the floor of a street. These pipes are similar to some of the Middle Minoan I (2100-1800 B.C.) found in Crete. In the Amenophis level many rich finds have been made: military weapons; various implements, notably a flint knife set in a plaster handle; pottery, many specimens showing Mediterranean influence; a very good collection of scarabs; cylinder seals of much importance; figurines; cult objects, notably uraeus serpents with the breasts of a woman and a cup below for milk. The article is summary, owing to the limits of space, but even thus it gives a picture of great industry in digging, and of the vast course of time that has passed over the old site of Beth-Shan. For the name, by the way, the etymology Beth- Shahan, or Shakhan (the Mesopotamian serpent deity) is suggested as a possi- bility. A plan of the temple of Thothmes III, with key, is added at the end of the article. Beth-Palet.-In The Illustrated London News, June 30, 1928, p. 1235 (5 figs.), Sir FLINDERS PETRIE writes briefly about recent discoveries at Beth-Palet and Ge- rar. At Tell Fara,-the ancient Beth-Palet, the wall built by Rameses III was examined. Tombs, though they had been plundered in antiquity, nevertheless yielded some important finds, such as a couch of bronze and iron, apparently the first of its type to be discovered, a silver bowl with decoration in leaf pattern, a silver dipper, very interesting because of its handle taking the form of a swimming girl, suggesting somewhat similar Egyptian ware. Much pottery was found, mostly of the age of Solomon. A curious object is a small bronze figure of a bear carrying a bundle of sticks. A calendar board with holes for pegs to mark the days of the month is included among the finds. Bronze Age Mounds in Galilee.-In B.A.S.O.R., xxix (1928), pp. 1-6 (4 figs.), W. D. ALBRIGHT describes a recent archaeological survey of Eastern Galilee. He shows that the archaeological evidence proves that Tell el-Qedah, is the site of Hazor, the capital of the Canaanite king Jabin, who headed a confederation against Joshua, according to Josh. 11. It is also mentioned in one of the Amarna</page><page sequence="7">114 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 letters. Here is a splendid acropolis mound, nearly half again as large as Megiddo. The pottery shows that the site was occupied throughout the entire Bronze Age, as well as during the Early Iron I and II. Another Bronze Age city on the summit of Qrfin Hattin, near Tiberias, is prob- ably to be identified with the Canaanite city of Madon, conquered by Joshua. A section of the cyclopean wall of this city is still standing. Still another Bronze Age site at Tell el-' Oreimeh is probably to be identified with the ancient Canaanite and Israelite town of Chinnereth. Excavations at Abraham's Well.-At the traditional site of the altar and well of Abraham, 3 km. north of Hebron, excavations carried out under German auspices in 1926 and 1927 have revealed five building periods. An enclosure or temenos with massive walls was built here by Herod the Great and was destroyed after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70. It was rebuilt by Hadrian, who sold in the great market that had been established here, the Jewish captives taken in the rebellion of 135. His structure, measuring 65 m. by 50 m., contained a temple in the eastern half and the well, sacred tree, etc. in the western. Two centuries later Constantine built a great Christian basilica in place of the Roman temple. This in turn was destroyed by the Persians in 614, restored by the patriarch Modestus, and finally, having fallen into the hands of the Arabs in 638, it became a quarry of material for their houses and other buildings. Only two stretches of low, massive wall have remained visible. The foundations of the basilica were constructed of reused material and the space within them was found filled in with a mass of broken sculpture, architectural fragments, tiles, mosaic, lamps, coins, ornaments, bones, etc. Over one thousand coins came to light, belonging to all the regents of Palestine for the first seven Christian centuries. (P. A. L. MADER, Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 452-458; 2 figs.) Greek Amulet.-In R. Et. Gr., xli, 189 (Jan.-March, 1928), pp. 73-83, PAUL PER- DRIZET publishes a golden Greek amulet of the petalon type found in Syria, (56 mm. x 30 mm., "no appreciable thickness"). The text is presented with an attempt at a partial restoration. A long list of 'divine names (commented upon in the study) of mystic and "horrific" force borrowed from Hebrew or imagined by Egyptians, all pointing to the sun-god, is followed by a prayer for a young woman who has just become a mother of a girl. The provenance is probably the ghetto of Alexandria. Such Judeo-Alexandrian magic charms penetrated not only the Mediterranean region, but have even been found beyond the Alps in Badenweiler (a silver petalon). JERUSALEM.-Excavations in the Tyropoeon Valley.-In Pal. Ex. Fund, lx (1928), pp. 9-27 (1 plan; 6 pls.), J. W. CROwFOoT summarizes the results of the excavations in the Tyropoeon valley which lies between the East and the West Hills of Jerusalem. Originally the Tyropoeon was a rocky fold between the two ridges with a clearly marked central channel containing natural boulders. The original settlement of the Jebusites was on the Eastern Hill. On the western side this descended in two rocky terraces. On the lower of these they built a wall about the beginning of the second millennium B.c. In this was a gate, flanked by two massive towers, which was perhaps the only entrance to the Canaanite stronghold and to the City of David. This gate was of the same type as that of the citadel of Tiryns. In the Iron Age much rubbish accumulated in the valley. A great renewal of activity came with the Maccabeans and Herodians, and to this age probably belongs the paved street that was found on the west side of the valley. Then came a period of desolation after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, and a revival of prosperity in the Byzantine period, to which belong a num- ber of houses in the upper levels. JOHN W. CROWFOOT reports (The Illustrated London News, Oct. 27, 1928, p.</page><page sequence="8">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 115 769 (5 figs.) ) on recent discoveries in Jerusalem. At Ophel a necropolis has been excavated. A Byzantine street has been uncovered, and also a large gate in the wall. Palestine about 2000 B.C.-In A bh. Berl. A kad., phil. hist. Klasse, 1926, No. 5, K. SETHE publishes a series of pottery jars dating from the close of the Eleventh Dynasty in Egypt, which are inscribed with lists of districts, towns, and peoples in Palestine. These are written with ink in old hieratic script on the jars while they were whole, and then the jars were apparently broken for magical purposes. Among these names is Iy'nk, which apparently is identical with 'Anab, mentioned in the Old Testament as one of the primitive peoples of Palestine. The texts speak of them as ruled by three princes, which corresponds with Josh. 11: 21, where their three cities are said to be Hebron, Debir, and Anab. In these texts the names of their princes are said to be 'Elem, 'Akram, and Abi-ma-'Ammu, while in Josh. 15: 13 the names of the three princes are Sheshai, Ahiman, and Tal- mai. This shows that the Anakim of the Old Testament are not mythical, as has long been supposed. Jerusalem is also mentioned in these texts in a form that corresponds to Ursallimu of the Amarna letters, and the names of two of its kings are given, Yakar-'Ammu and Set-'Anu. The name Iym'wr seems also to correspond to 'Amorite'. The evidence of the proper names is conclusive that the Semites (Amorites) were firmly established in Palestine by 2000 B.c. This is the earliest geographical information that has come down to us. (See also R. DUSSEAU, Syria, viii (1927), pp. 216 ff., and J. W. JACK, Exp. Times, xxxix (1928), pp. 329-331.) The Site of Bethel.-Practically all scholars agree, on topographical evidence, that the Biblical Bethel is to be identified with the modern Beitfn, but archaeologi- cal evidence has hitherto been lacking. A trial shaft has recently been sunk under the auspices of the American School in Jerusalem. The results of this investiga- tion are given by W. F. ALBRIGHT in B.A.S.O.R., xxix (1928), pp. 9-11. The excavators struck virgin rock at a depth of about 26 feet, and were lucky enough to strike the inside of the ancient city-wall, which they uncovered for a few feet. Early Bronze pottery was found in the lowest level which shows that the site was occupied before 1800 B.c. The city-wall belongs partly to the Late Bronze, and partly to the Early Iron Age. There is, therefore, no longer any doubt that Beitfn is Bethel. ASIA MINOR PERGAMON.-Renewed Excavations.-At the December (1927) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, T. WIEGAND reported on his new excavations at Pergamon made in April, May, June, and September of that year. The two earlier periods of work, under Humann and Conze for some ten years up to 1886, and again under Conze and Dorpfeld from 1900 to Conze's death in 1914, had left at least three unfinished tasks beside the preparation of the plan of the city, the excavation, namely, of a part of the acropolis, of the Asclepieum outside the walls, and of certain tumuli in the plain. Beginning on the highest part of the acropolis, in a place known as the Queens' Garden and conjectured to have been the site of a temple of Faustina, it was found that nearly the whole of the enclosed area of the acropolis was taken up by five huge arsenals, 36 m. to 50 m. long, with an elaborate system of ventilation by small slits in the walls, such as is known at some castella in England, at Corstopitum, and Gellygaer. These appear to belong to the time of Attalus I, about 200 B.c. Spear-heads, arrows, and shields, as well as the defensive machinery, were found here, and great piles of stone " cannon balls," weighing up to 76 kg. and measuring from 14 to 40 cm. They are roughly made</page><page sequence="9">116 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 out of the local trachyte rock. A second excavation, undertaken at the so-called Princesses' Palace, a large square Hellenistic building, disclosed a peristyle on two terraces, also of about 200 B.c., containing only one important room, on the north side. A niche in the wall opposite the entrance, later replaced by a projecting platform, suggests that this place was dedicated to the worship, first of an Attalid prince and afterwards of a Roman emperor. At the Asclepieum one of the early finds was a decree of the pro-consul P. Servilius Isauricus, of about 48 B.C., re- newing certain ancient rights of asylum. (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 466-469.) GREECE Archaeology in Greece in 1926-1927.-The usual very complete summary of archaeological discoveries in Greece, including the Dodecanese, in 1926 and 1927, by A. M6vius and W. WREDE, is published in Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 345-410; 22 figs. Casts of Greek Sculptures.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 7 (July, 192S), pp. 185- 186 (1 fig.), GISELA M. A. RICHTER announces that the Metropolitan Museum has recently acquired two casts of important Greek sculptures: the running maid found at Eleusis in 1924, and the Hermes from Olympia. The former presumably be- longed to the pediment of a small building inside the sacred precinct and it dates about 480 B.C. The subject, as suggested by the provenance, is perhaps the Rape of Persephone. The latter figure, the Hermes of Praxiteles, is shown with the missing parts of the legs restored. Several Greek frescoes of the Minoan period also have been acquired. CORINTH.-JIn The Illustrated London News, July 28, 1928, p. 168 (4 figs.), THEODORE LESLIE SHEAR writes about the most recent excavations at Corinth, where the stage of the theatre has been completely laid bare and the east parodos been excavated. Near the parodos wall was found a life-size marble statue of the type of a Roman senator. By means of a coin of Constantius II, found with the statue, the figure is assigned to a date near the close of the fourth century A.D. Remains of a Byzantine house contained 73 coins, many of which are of Oriental provenance. On another spot were found nearly 5,000 bronze coins, bone and ivory pins, and lamps. A marble statue of a young athlete, whose head, hands, and feet are broken off, was also found. This is described as a good Roman copy of a Greek bronze of the fifth century, belonging to the school of Polyclitus. Other smaller pieces of sculpture were also found. Among the Greek and Roman inscriptions, one, written on the base of a statue of a youth was by the youth's father in commemoration of athletic victories. Thirty-three graves were opened and in these were found about 300 objects, consisting of strigils, vases, lamps, etc. Many instructive Corinthian -vessels are included in the find. (Cf. A.J.A., 1928, pp. 474-495.) CYPRUIS.-In The Illustrated London News, Sept. 22, 1928, pp. 498-500 (16 figs.), EINAR GJERSTAD, head of the Swedish Expedition in Cyprus, makes a brief report of the recent and very significant finds in that island. After the work of last year at Lapithos and Soli, the excavations of the present year were conducted at Vouni and Dali. Among the objects discovered at Vouni are: fragments of a life-size terracotta head, and many pieces of statues most of which show Greek influence and belong to the cord type of the end of the archaic and the beginning of the classical period. The architecture is similarly impressive. Massive walls of regular blocks of stone belonging to a huge palace built about a square court, and dating between 700 and 450 B.c., remind one of the Minoan palaces of Crete. Here much excavation remains to be done. A temple, which has been identified</page><page sequence="10">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 117 as being in honor of Athena, has been excavated and many religious objects discovered. At Dali, the ancient Idalion, in the middle of the island the top of the acropolis was examined with good results. At the lowest level of culture here represented was found a settlement of the Late Cypriote III period (1200-1000 B.C.). The cult here established reached a high development in classical times. Votive offerings consist of bronze bowls, lamps, rings, etc. The Athena worshiped here was of a distinctly Cypriote type, i.e., not the Greek Athena of Vouni, but a god- dess of Cyprus identified with the acropolis goddess of Athens. (Cf. also R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, p. 137.) EUBOEA.-After the discovery on September 24, 1928, of the heroic bronze statue, 8 feet in height, believed to represent Poseidon, two additional pieces of sculpture, both of bronze and of Hellenistic times, were brought up from the sea bottom at Cape Artemision, near Zerochorion, the statue of a small boy and the head and foreleg of a horse. The sculptures have been placed in the Museum at Athens. It is suggested that they constituted part of a cargo of works of art which suffered shipwreck. (The Illustrated London News, Oct. 13, 1928, p. 675 (fig.); Dec. 15, 1928, p. 1129 (2 figs.).) Greek Pottery.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxii, 10 (Oct., 1927), pp. 251-252 (1 fig.), GISELA M. A. RICHTER writes about a consignment of pottery received by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a gift of the Greek Government, through the offices of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. The collection consists of six bowls, jars, and jugs of the Early Helladic III period (about 2200- 2000 B.c.) and eleven ladles, jars, and vases of the Late Helladic III period (about 1400-1150 B.C.). The pottery is from the excavation at Zygouries, near Corinth. The Museum at Leucas.-The contents of the new museum on the island of Leucas (Nidri) are described by P. GOESSLER in Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv (cols. 258-265; 5 figs.). To the Neolithic period belong implements of native stone, obsidian, bone, and horn, with pottery in a very great variety of shapes and orna- ment, some of which remained in use in the succeeding period. There are copper and bronze tools found on inhabited sites, and weapons and ornaments of bronze and precious metals from graves. To this time belong large pithoi used for burials in round stone graves. Two large family graves contained, among other things, many canthari like those of the shaft graves of Mycenae. Later articles include geometric bronzes, geometric, and proto-Corinthian vases, and many objects from graves of the sixth to the fourth centuries, as well as Roman remains both from Nidri and from the neighboring island of Meganisi,-lamps, coins, glass, a terra-sigillata plate with a graffito E R 0 S, and a denarius of Faustina the Elder. MALTA.-Bujibba.--In The Illustrated London News, Sept. 15, 1928, p. 446 (fig.), are shown specimens of Neolithic art recently discovered by Professor T. ZAMMIT in Malta. Limestone blocks show raised spiral patterns and also fishes in raised figures, the latter of which has never before been found on a Neolithic site in Malta. Maltese Rock-Tombs.--In Ant. J., viii (Oct., 1928), 4, pp. 478-484 (3 pls.; 1 fig.), T. ZAMMIT writes about the tombs cut in rocky ground in Malta. Four periods are represented by the tombs: (1) the Phoenician, (2) the Carthaginian, (3) the Roman, (4) the early Christian. The Phoenician tombs have yielded ceramic ware of a fawn-grey color and mostly undecorated. Vessels of the am- phora type were used as cinerary urns. The characteristic handles are small and circular. In the Carthaginian tombs inhumation was generally practiced, though traces of cremation also exist. The urns have a different shape from those in the earliest graves, being globular on top, constricted towards the bottom, and resting</page><page sequence="11">118 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 on a flat base. In these graves there were also found, in addition to the urns, cups, saucers, and copper ornaments in the form of rings, bracelets, and anklets. The graves of the Roman type contain much the same kind of remains as are found in those of the Carthaginian period, although there survives a much larger abun- dance of objects. The Roman influence is strong. Here are found glass and clay bottles, cups, saucers, ivory hairpins, bronze mirrors and other objects in abun- dance. Comparatively recently, in 1926, tombs were opened which by the distinctly different color of their pottery afford evidence of the use of some of these tombs in Neolithic times. The conclusion is therefore reached that some of the circular tombs of the so-called Phoenician period really date back to around 3000 B.C. ITALY Coinage of Carus.-The gold coinage of Carus and his sons has been analyzed by K. PINK in Mitth. der Num. Gesellschaft in Wien, 1928, with a study of the coins in the Vienna collection. Coins from Magna Graecia.-M. SALVATORE MIRONE has made a study of river-god types, in Rev. Num., xxxi (1928), pp. 1-19. Gallic Military Antiquities on Roman Coins.-The war equipment of ancient Gauls as portrayed on Roman coins has been treated in a study by P. COUIssIN in Rev. Num., xxxi (1928), p. 28 ff. Especially valuable is the list of all coins with representations of Gallic armor. Roman Cinerary Urn.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 8 (Aug., 1928), pp. 200-201 (2 figs.), CHRISTINE ALEXANDER briefly describes the Museum's newly acquired cinerary urn. It has a gabled lid and the front is decorated with a funerary banquet. It can be dated in the first half of the second century A.D. Roman Statue.-The Toledo Museum of Art has recently received the statue of a ram of fine workmanship executed in the time of Augustus or soon thereafter. (Toledo Museum of Art News, 52 (Sept., 1928)) ROME.-Epitaph of Marcellus and Octavia.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr., 1927, pp. 244-247, J. CARCOPINO reports and discusses the discovery at Rome, in the sub- structure of the Augusteum, of the double epitaph of Marcellus and Octavia, giving a restoration, of which there can be scarcely any doubt, as follows: m. MARCELLVS. CF OCTAVIA CF GENER SOROR auGVSTI CAESARIS AVGusti Caesaris After a few epigraphic remarks, the author states that the stone was engraved before the death of Augustus and that it clears up the question of the legal relation of Marcellus to Augustus: Marcellus at his death did not bear the name Caesar and was only gener Augusti Caesaris. M. Carcopino sees, in the agreement of this epitaph with the Monumentum Ancyranum in omitting the nomen Claudius, an intention of placing the Claudii in the background and attaching the dead more closely to the family of the Caesars, to which he did not regularly belong, but whose heir he would have been, had fate permitted. FRANCE LUCHON.-Archaeological Discoveries.-In the region of Luchon interesting discoveries have been made. At M6dan, 1,300 m. above Juzet, two cemeteries, one of incineration, the other of inhumation, have been discovered. In the former a number of vases came to light containing ashes and various objects, some of black clay dating from the end of the Bronze Age, others of red clay, of Gallo-</page><page sequence="12">FRANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 119 Roman fabrication. In the other cemetery several rude stone sarcophagi con- tained perfectly preserved skeletons. A little below Medan, at the "Mamelon d'Ayroles," foundations of a square signal tower have been discovered, and at Contres, above the hamlet of Frontes, various kinds of Gallo-Roman pottery have come to light. (Ddbats, April 11, 1928; R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, p. 144) Presles.-A Neolithic Chamber.-In R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, pp. 1-13 (4 pls.; 2 figs.), B. BOTTET describes a dolmen in the commune of Presles (Seine et Oise). Its total length is 13.63 m., that of the chamber 10.88 m., that of the vestibule 2.40 m., and the mean thickness of the slab which forms the door about 0.35 m. The maximum width is 2.40 m. The floor is carefully paved. Some of the blocks or slabs of the sides and roof are broken. The door is of trapezoidal shape, cut in a great slab of limestone. A hollow in the outside of this slab seems to have served as a lamp. On the inside are reliefs, well preserved, but difficult to interpret. In one place an axe may be represented. The vestibule was probably filled in- tentionally in the Neolithic period. In it were found tools of stone and of bone, fragments of vases, and some bones of animals, fourteen in all. In the chamber were some forty objects of stone and bone, besides flakes of flint, and remains of the skeletons of more than a hundred persons of all ages and both sexes. Several skulls show that they had been severely injured and healed. The long bones also showed various fractures. Bones of several animals (badger, deer, sheep, ox) were also found in the chamber. RHEIMS.-Gallo-Roman Potters' Stamps.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr., 1927, pp. 140-145, L. DEMAISON studies the Gallo-Roman potters' stamps found near Rheims. A list of stamps is added to those hitherto unpublished, or at least not appearing in C.I.L., xiii, 3, 1 (pp. 182-429), and of those of special interest, for which cor- rected readings are offered. SAINT-CHAPTES (GARD).-A Statue-Menhir.-In the region of Saint- Chaptes two busts of warriors were found in 1927; they are now in the museum at Nimes. In 1928 a large anthropomorphic slab similar to the stelae from Collogues was accidentally discovered. It seems to have served to close a small burial chamber. This is the largest statue-menhir found as yet in this region. It measures a little more than 1.90 m. (Dgbats, June 11, 1928; R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, p. 145) VALLEY OF THE ROC.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. (Oct.-Dec., 1927), pp. 291-294, HENRI MARTIN reports his discovery in the Valley of the Roc (Charente) of what may be called the atelier of a sculptor or sculptors of the "solutrean" period, of the Mongoloid race of Chancelade. The site is a platform 7 m. by 5.60 m., on the right slope of the river bank, and bordered by a half circle of somewhat smoothed great blocks, opening southward. In the enclosure so formed, in a layer of ar- chaeological debris 15 to 20 cm. deep, were found numerous ornaments, a dagger, pierced stones, and representations of laurel and willow leaves. Of the blocks themselves, when lifted from their bed, six were found to have sculptures that had been lying on the ground but that had formerly been in a vertical position. The original ground plan was doubtless similar to their state when found and exhibited a succession of animal sculptures facing into the semicircle; from right to left: a bear (?); a horse; on another stone another horse; fragments of ornaments; more horses; a bison. The figures are about the height of a medium-sized dog, and are sculptured in bold relief. The author thinks that perhaps these figures had a magic value for the workers in the "atelier." Several of the animals are females, evidently gravid. This work of the Reindeer Age rivals, says Dr. Martin, the best work of the Aurignacian and Magdalenian periods. The sculptures have been taken to the Museum of National Antiquities at Saint-Germain.</page><page sequence="13">120 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 SPAIN An Archaeological Tour of Spain in 1927.-After completing two more volumes of his great work on Numantia (III= Die Lager des Scipio; IV= Die Lager bei Renieblas), A. SCHULTEN began in August, 1927, a tour of exploration and study, starting at Renieblas in the Celtiberian country and extending to Cadiz and to the southeastern coast. In his account (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 197-235; 18 figs.), he notes how largely the success of excavations in the country districts of Spain depends on the character of the cultivators, the more industrious, and fortunately less numerous, peasants having removed all trace of ancient walls from their fields. The portable finds from Numantia are admirably housed and ar- ranged in a new museum at Soria. On the way south a small summer camp from the Celtiberian War, near Almazon, and a winter camp from some earlier period, perhaps Cato's campaign of 195 B.C., at Alpanseque, were examined. A similar small camp was explored at Santibanez de Viduales, at the foot of the Asturian mountains, on the Roman road from Asturica to Emerita, where it guarded the junction of this road with one from Braganza. This camp had been the home of a detachment of Legio VI Victrix, and a considerable civilian settlement had grown up around it, of which mosaics, inscriptions, etc., are evidence. Four weeks were spent in excavating Metellus's Castra Caecilia at Caceres, south of Salamanca, and mapping the environs. Further studies were made at Cadiz, this time on the fortified island of San Sebastian, the site of the Phoenician settlement, access to which was had by Royal permit. Here on the north, outside of the fort, traces of the Phoenician city were found in the shape of narrow roads cut into the rock and bordered in some places by rows of post-holes in which were even the remains of almost petrified pine wood, and on the northwestern side, a large grotto, now accessible only at low tide, owing to the sinking of the shore-line. This was evidently the famous grotto-sanctuary of the Phoenician goddess who became Aphrodite to the Greeks and to the Romans, Venus Marina, and whose places of worship are found wherever the Phoenicians planted a colony on the Spanish coast. On the island of Santipetri, south of Cadiz, once sacred to Heracles, where a bronze statue of an emperor in armor was recently found, and where tunny fishing is still an important industry, huge blocks of building stone are scattered about and a layer of sherds and bones, containing both Roman and Campanian ware, indicates that the site of the temple was probably the same as that of the now disused Spanish fort, while two ruined wells on the east side may be the "trick" wells mentioned by Strabo, 172. In the neighborhood are traces of the highroad connecting the place with Cadiz, and remains of ancient lead and silver mines. After a twenty-hour ride in an express train across the mountains to Alicante, work was resumed on the east coast with the help of a geologist, O. JESSEN, whose report follows the main account (cols. 236-244). The coast from Cartegena to Castillon, with its bays, lagoons, and headlands, was studied and the numerous sites, occupied often in succession by Iberians, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans, were examined and identified, with reference to Strabo and other ancient author- ities. These places included Alicante (Lucentum), the island Plana or Tabarda (Planasia), Elche (Ilici) with its harbor-town near Santo Palo and its suburb Alcudia, where the Lady of Elche and the torso of a warrior in Iberian armor were found; Villajoyosa; Altea; Bernidorn, to be identified with ancient Alonis; Calpe, with its promontory of Monte Ifach, a smaller copy of Calpe-Gibralar; Denia (Dianium, Hemeroscopium), a resort of Sertorius and his Cilician pirates; the delta of the Jucar (Sucro), Valentia; Almenara, with a Roman camp dating from the Second Punic War and a famous temple of Venus Marina; and finally, farther</page><page sequence="14">GERMANY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 121 north, at Borriol, the pass of the Lapides Atri of Livy 26.17, where the Romans caught Hasdrubal in 210 B.c. This whole tour was made possible by the cordial cooperation of leading Spanish archaeologists in the regions visited. GERMANY Prehistoric Fortification Near Lussow.-At the southern outskirts of the city of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where the bluffs which border the valley on the east and west come near together, there is a particularly good place for crossing the river which seems to have been in use from Neolithic times. Before the city of Frank- fort was built the crossing was guarded from a position on top of the western bluff which has precipitous descents on the east and south and was fortified in prehistoric times on the west and north by earthen ramparts which are still standing in parts to a height of six or seven meters above the level of the enclosed area. In con- sequence of the discovery in 1919, through the widening of a railway, of a number of deep round pits filled with bones, sherds, etc., systematic excavations were undertaken here in 1926 and 1927. Two trenches one meter wide and crossing at right angles, were dug down to the undisturbed earth or rock, and the northern branch was carried through the rampart. This was found to be an embankment of earth strengthened by massive framework of timber. The layer of cultural remains on the enclosed area was from a meter to a half-meter in depth, and in most places was clearly stratified into a prehistoric lower portion, of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages (the so-called Aurith and early CGritz cultures, about 1000 to 600 B.c.), and a later stratum belonging to the Wendish occupation of about 700 to 1100 A.D. Apparently this site, like most of the fortified positions on the March, was not occupied during the late Iron Age and the Roman period. Post-holes and hollows for the cellars of houses belonging to the earliest period were found showing dark against the white sand of the natural surface. About twenty more of the burial pits were found, making thirty-two in all, and two of them were thoroughly examined. They were from five to seven meters deep and appear to have been filled up again not long after being dug, with the same earth that had been taken out, but with layers of human and animal bones alternating with layers of earth, which was beaten very hard on the top. The position of the bones indicated that when buried the flesh was still adhering to them. These pits, which occur all over the area, were apparently burial places for the remains of victims sacrificed at some annual religious festival. They belong to the later of the two prehistoric cultures, the early G6ritz. A trial trench dug in the slightly elevated southwest corner uncovered some Slavic stone walls which may be remains of a castle within the fort or the foundations of a temple. More complete excava- tions were planned for the summer of 1928. A visit to the spot took the place of the regular October (1927) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. (W. UNVERZAGT, Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 420-424; 3 figs.) Typical Plan of a Roman Bath.-At a meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society in November, 1927, D. KRENCKER showed a model reconstruction on a scale of 1: 200, of the imperial Roman baths at Trier and explained the use of the rooms. There was a prescribed circuit from the apodyterium through rooms I, II, and III, in which the actual cleaning processes of sweating, hot bathing, oiling, and massage took place, to the warm, cool, and cold tank rooms, the calidarium, tepidarium, and frigidarium and then on (not back) to the apodyterium again and out into the open palaestra. In Trier and in most of the North African baths there are two such circuits symmetrically arranged, with the calidarium, tepida- rium, and frigidarium, as well as the palaestra, used in common and situated in a line on the axis of the plan. This principle of circulation is the same, however,</page><page sequence="15">122 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 in simpler establishments having only one series of rooms, and it gives the clue also to the very elaborate baths of the emperors at Rome, which have been very imperfectly understood. The so-called palaestras in these were not open courts, but great roofed halls or basilicas, such as are found also in the larger provincial establishments, and the real palaestras were merely the open grounds surrounding the buildings. Also, the rooms in rows to the right and left of the calidarium must have been enclosed with windows in some way, to maintain their tempera- ture. The same typical plan must be recognized in the buildings formerly called gymnasiums at Ephesus, Alexandria Troas, and Hierapolis, though further ex- cavation is needed to determine some points. Early forms of the symmetrical double bathing establishment are found in many places on French soil. (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv, cols. 458-462; 3 figs.) AUSTRIA GUNTRAMVSDORF.-In The Illustrated London News, Sept. 1, 1928, pp. 390- 391 and 396 (9 figs.), FRANCIS C. FUERST reports on the discoveries recently made in three Celtic graves at Guntramsdorf, near Vienna. The graves are assigned to the La Tene period, dating in the third and the second century B.c. All three of the graves were bordered with stone and nearly square in shape. Each con- tained the remains of one warrior. Of the skeletons, two were in "squatting" position. The armor consisted of spear, sword, and shield, of which some of the iron parts have survived. The jewelry includes a bronze finger-ring and two bracelets or arm-rings. Besides these objects there were also vessels intended to hold food and drink for the dead warriors, as well as instruments used in the pro- viding and preparing of food, a sickle, knives, and scissors. What, however, is of particular interest in this find are the trepannings of two of the skulls. Each skull has on one side a circular hole about 1.5 cm. in diameter and a much larger hole on the other side. This larger hole takes the form of a tre-foil leaf in one skull. The bones had healed around the smaller hole, so that we have evidence that the minor operation was performed while the person was alive; the major holes may have been made after death. BULGARIA Roman Coins.-The gold coins that emanated from the mint of Serdica (modern Sofia), in Thrace, under the successors of Diocletian are thoroughly discussed by GEORG ELMER in Num. Zeit., xxi (1928), pp. 12-19. Various Antiquities.-A number of ancient reliefs, altars, statuettes, grave monuments, inscriptions, and small objects, in marble, bronze, silver, or pottery, which have been found in Bulgaria and are either in museums there or in private possession of the finders, are published, with references to similar objects already known, by G. I. KAZAROW in Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. iii/iv (cols. 317-345; 26 figs.). Reliefs of the Thracian Horseman in considerable variety, of Artemis as the pro- tector of certain springs, and of other divinities, often disclose or suggest the sites of ancient sanctuaries. In at least one instance the tradition of sanctity still exists, at a spring to which fever patients are brought and coins and other small objects are offered. Inscriptions occur in both Greek and Latin and include one in Byzantine Greek, marking the site of a r-bpyos, which was probably the suc- cessor of one of the castella erected in Thrace by Antoninus Pius. ROUMANIA Ring Money.-An outline of the various locations of the finds of ancient ring money and their contents that have been turned up in Dacia has been made by KARL PINK in Num.

NORTHERN AFRICA HIPPO.-Excavations and Discoveries.-In R. Arch., xxviii, 1928, pp. 143-144, is a summary by E. D'A. (Courier de la Quinzaine, Algiers, March 15, 1928) of two reports by Erwan Marec on archaeological work at Hippo. Some property of archaeological importance has been secured and further acquisitions are in prospect. The great baths of Septimius Severus have been excavated and statues of Aesculapius, Hercules, and Minerva have been found, as well as an inscription recording the fact that the monument, dedicated to Septimius Severus, was erected in the reign of Caracalla. Discoveries at the foot of the mound of St. Augustine indicate the presence of important buildings. In the Chevillot prop- erty a Roman road with its sewer has been uncovered, and a curious building which may be one of the basilicas mentioned by St. Augustine. Among the objects found in the sewer are a magnificent head of a statue and a fragment of a bowl on which the trio of Adam, Eve, and the serpent is engraved. Terracotta "Eraser."-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr., 1927, pp. 225-230 (1 plate), M. ALBERTINI describes and studies an object of terracotta found at Rapidum (Al- geria). The object is egg-shaped, 0.093 m. long by 0.045 and 0.04; it has a long depression on one side of the top and a socket on the opposite side and is convex on the bottom. The depressions are evidently for the thumb and bent index finger. The material renders the article useless for polishing pottery, though it might have done for leather. An inscription in cursive letters reads pugil. roga- tiani. After some discussion, the author concludes that this object was used for the complete re-smoothing of a wax tablet to provide a clean new page, and that it was marked by the school boy Rogatianus in a prudent attempt to secure his property. RUSSIA Cemetery of Abashevo in the Chuvash Republic.-In Publications of the Society for the Study of the Chuvash Region, Vol. I, 1, Chebolsary, 1928, V. F. SMOLIN describes a group of 11 kurgans near the village of Abashevo, in district of Chebok- sary, three of which were excavated in 1925. They prove to be a cemetery of the second millennium B.C. The culture was developed under that of the Caucasus, and certain objects remind us of the pre-Hellenic Troy. Apparently agriculture was more or less developed, and the horse and perhaps the pig were domesticated animals. The methods of burial varied in the different graves, and perhaps the differences represent gradations in rank, as the grave of one woman contains a considerable number of objects and others, especially one group of headless skeletons, seem to have been buried hastily and carelessly. In several cases the body seems to have lain flat with the legs drawn up and bent to one side. The chief adornments of the body were of bronze, but some were of silver. On the</page><page sequence="17">124 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 whole, we cannot as yet speak positively about all the details of these, but the pottery seems to have been of fair quality, especially for a period so archaic. DISTRICT OF KYIV.-In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 107-118, MARIA MUSHKET describes explorations of prehistoric sites along the Teterev River. Some of the stations are interesting, especially at the village of Ivankiv. Little, and mostly undecorated, pottery was found. ISLAND OF LOKHAN.-In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 143-168, MIKHAILO RUDINSKY writes about the discovery of a large series of prehistoric remains on the island of Lokhan, in the Dnyper. They are largely depressions in the granite rocks near the river, holes varying in size and seemingly made by sand and water. In many ways these holes are similar to those which the French polissours make, but some are apparently made in furrows and others in pits. The depressions belong to the end of the Neolithic or the transitional period. Neolithic Times in the Valley of the Vorsklo.-In Bull. of the Laboratory of Anthropology and Ethnology Founded in Honor of Th. Volkov, Series II, MIKHAILO RUDINSKY writes about discoveries at the station of Bila Hora, near Poltava, on the left bank of the Kolomak, near where it enters the Vorsklo. Flint and Neo- lithic pottery have been found in three places near the site. These seem to come from an early period of Microlithic work, when the region was under the influence of Donets basin. The others come from the late Neolithic, when the region seems to have been under the influence of the Vorsklo culture, which was very similar to that found at Okhtyrka, in the government of Kharkiv. NOVGOROD-SIVERSKY.-In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 169-177, VASIL DANILEVICH reports the discovery of a copper sickle in 1926 at a site near Nov- gorod-Siversky. The instrument is interesting for the fact that it very closely imitates stone sickles. It seems to be older than the Tripolye culture, and, if so, is the oldest copper sickle known. Paleolithic Site at Zhuravka.-In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 65-72, MIKHAILO RUDINSKY and ANDRY VORONY report on an upper Paleolithic site at Zhuravka, near Pryluka, in the Ukraine. Five hundred and twenty-four flints have been discovered, some dark gray, others dark brown, the latter heavily patinized. Twenty-three bones have been discovered, chiefly of Marmota babac. Further excavations have been promised. UKRAINE.-Considerable work has been done within the last few years on the subject of Ukrainian Paleolithic and Neolithic cultures. (Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 185-189.) In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 1-30, FEDIR VOVK reports on excavations of a pre- Mycenaean type of Neolithic sites in the Ukraine. The report continues an earlier one (Materials for Rutheno-Ukrainian Ethnology, Lemberg, 1905). Three kinds of structures are described: huts for living, places for the manufacture of pottery, and cemeteries for the urns and the ashes of the dead. There is considerable dis- cussion of the excavation of M. Bilyashevsky, at Kolodyste, in 1900, which he, unlike Vovk, wished to consider as a part of a house and not a cemetery. The fauna in these sites are discussed. The commonest bones are those of Unio pictorum and Anodonta cygnaea, neither of which is found today in the Ukraine. Meat from horses was probably the favorite kind, but venison, beef, and boar meat were also eaten. The bone, stone, and metal objects are described. Recent Ukrainian Excavations.-Several sites were excavated in the Ukraine in 1925 at which important results were achieved in Neolithic archaeology. A careful enumeration of the objects discovered has been prepared. Among the important sites are some along the River Smyachka, near Novgorod-Siversky and at Khalepye. Some pottery and other remains of the Cossack period were found</page><page sequence="18">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 125 near the Cathedral of St. Sophia at Kiev. In 1926 the same kind of work on the Tripolye culture was continued. Explorations were made at Olbia, but without very much success. Some of the palaces on the right bank of the Dnyper have been studied and also the Bernardine Monastery in Zaslav, built in 1602. The structures reared by the Jewish people are also being examined. (Publications by the Ukrainian Academy of Science, Kiev, 1926) Ukrainian Tripolye Culture.-A series of volumes is beginning to appear on the general subject of the Tripolye culture in the Ukraine (Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev, 1926). The first volume contains about a dozen articles on this subject, of which some furnish very interesting material. Certain statuettes have been found in the Ukraine showing considerable skill in modelling. The life of these people seems to have been settled in agriculture and domestic animals. This culture is rich in points of similarity and contrast with the Caucasian and Aegean cultures. The articles in this group are very well written and it is a pity that the illustrations are not as good as the text. However, the Academy of Sciences is making an excellent start under very hard material conditions. GREAT BRITAIN GLOUCESTERSHIRE.- The Illustrated London News, Dec. 1, 1928, pp. 1014- 1015 (4 figs.) shows a reconstruction drawing and a brief descriptive article, written by ST. CLAIR BADDELEY, of a Roman temple near Chedworth Villa, in Gloucestershire, which has recently been excavated to a considerable extent. The temple measures 41 feet by 39.5 feet, inside measurements. The masonry is opus quadraturm. In addition to many of this larger type of block there have also been found oblong calcar bricks, as well as bricks of opus signinum, sandstone hexagonal tiles, square hypocaust tiles, some of which bear animal footprints, bones of animals and human beings, too. There is no evidence that would suggest a podium. Not much pottery has been found and only a few Roman coins ranging in date over the periods of Trajan, Hadrian, Commodus, Alexander Severus, Julia Domna, Julia Moesia, and Maximian. LYDNEY.-At Lydney, on the Severn (The Illustrated London News, Dec. 1, 1928, p. 1016 (7 figs.)), the Society of Antiquaries has recently excavated a Ro- mano-British temple built before the Roman conquest, perhaps around 365 A.D., in honor of a pagan god Nodens, apparently a god of hunting, if one may judge from the numerous figures of dogs found there. One of these figures is of high value artistically. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Ethiopian Coinage.-An important contribution to the history and coinage of Ethiopia is made by ARTURO ANZANI in the Riv. Ital. Num., 1926, in an analysis of the coinage of the kingdom of Axum, which flourished from the second to the tenth century after Christ. Starting from late Roman types, the art of the coin- age runs its peculiar course, and forms an interesting chapter of Christian iconog- raphy. Fourteenth-Century Marble Statue.-The Metropolitan Museum is exhibiting among its recent accessions a white marble statue of the Virgin and Child, which from the graceful pose of the Virgin and the refinement of the drapery can be attributed to the fourteenth century. (JOSEPH BRECK, in Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 5 (May 1928), pp. 123-134 (3 figs.))</page><page sequence="19">126 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 Iconography of St. Barbara.-The study of the iconography of St. Barbara on coins has been completed by the COMPTE DE LAPPARENT in Rev. Num., xxxi (1928), pp. 56-76. Numismatics.-In Num. Notes, 35, A. R. BELLINGER has made an important study of the anonymous coinage instituted by the Emperor John I. Zimisces (969-975) and continued by his successors until the time of Constantine X, almost a hundred years later. Bellinger has used the evidences of restriking, and various minor differences in ornamentation, to distinguish the coins in classes and assign them to the various emperors of the century on the basis of the numbers of coins of each sort found compared with the length of reign of the monarch. The figures used for his calculations are those of the 1925 excavations at Corinth, in which 198 of the anonymous coins were found out of a total of 693 Byzantine coins for the year. His conclusions must, therefore, be used with the greatest care, since the coins found may prove not to be representative of the contents of the entire exca- vation, but of only a part. A great service has been done in pointing the way, but there may be need of altering some of the conclusions later. Very important is Bellinger's attribution of some of the late classes of these coins to Alexius I, struck for the use of the Crusaders. The way is now open for scholars to make use of the large finds of Byzantine coins that have been turned up in Corinth to straighten out a very vexing problem in Byzantine chronology. SYRIA AND PALESTINE KUL AT EL-KUREIN.-Excavation of a Crusaders' Fortress.-In B. Metr. Mus., Sept., 1927, an account is given of the excavation of the castle of Montfort, which was built by the French at the beginning of the thirteenth century. It lies on an abrupt shoulder of a hill, jutting out between the arms of the Wady Kurn. It is an ideal location for a fortress, 600 feet higher than the stream, and sloping by easy stages toward the east. The excavations have disclosed the ground-plan of the castle, and show it to have been one of the largest and finest of the chain of Crusaders' strongholds in Palestine. It was hoped that valuable armor might be discovered, but unfortunately all the iron had disintegrated in the damp climate. The report is accompanied with plans and photographs. (See also Pal. Ex. Fund, lx (1928), pp. 91-97.) Mohammedan Bronze.-COL. ALLOTTE DE LA FUYiE describes a rare Moham- medan bronze coin found in the recent excavations at Susa (Rev. Num., xxxi, pp. 20-27), remarkable because it contains an inscription in Sassanian Pehlevi not associated with the usual fire-altar type and portrait of the Persian sovereign. On the reverse is an inscription in Arabic. The coin is evidently from the period of the late Ommeyiad or early Abbasid Caliphs, a fact that makes the Pehlevi inscription more remarkable. FRANCE Aix-en-Provence.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr., 1927, pp. 146-148, J. FORMIGF reports the results of his excavations and restorations in the baptistery of the Cathedral of Aix-en-Provence. The ancient floor has been uncovered, revealing the central piscina of cemented brickwork, originally faced on each of the sides and the bottom with a single marble slab, and still containing numerous fragments of small glass vases ("amulae "?). The walls, by the removal of altars, votive slabs, etc., have been restored to the simplicity of the twelfth century. This baptistery, the one at Riez, and the one formerly at Marseilles (on the site of the modern cathedral) were contemporary, thinks M. Formig6, having been built originally about the fifth century and having been remodelled in the twelfth, a change of form to meet the change of use.</page><page sequence="20">RENAISSANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 127 SPAIN Spanish Tomb.-The Metropolitan Museum has received the tomb of one of the Counts of Urgel-presumably Armengol VII. Its provenance is the Church of Santa Maria de Bellpuig de las Avellanas, near Balaguer. The tomb is a fine example of Spanish sculpture of the fourteenth century. (JOSEPH BRECK, in Btll. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 6 (June, 1928), pp. 142-147 (4 figs.)) GERMANY Thirteenth-Century Statue.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 5 (May, 1928), pp. 130-133 (2 figs.), JOSEPH BRECK calls attention to the hitherto unpublished wooden statue of the thirteenth century, probably representing St. James the Less. The statue is of heroic size and probably stood on a console against a pier. The origi- nal paint was covered by a new coat in the eighteenth century. The later paint has been partly removed. The reputed provenance of the statue is the vicinity of Strasbourg and the author proposes to attribute it to the Rhenish School of the second half of the thirteenth century. SWEDEN STOCKHOLM.-Ecclesiastical Textile Art.-The State Historical Museum of Sweden arranged a very important exhibition of ecclesiastical textile art to be dis- played in Stockholm for the period from January 5 to 27, 1929. Using partly objects from the Museum's own collection and partly loan pieces, those in charge of the exhibition brought together an unusually rich display. Mediaeval textiles -copes, chasubles, dalmatics, episcopal shoes, antependia, hangings, etc.-were represented in great numbers. Some of the objects date as far back as Roman times. The foreign materials were drawn from the different countries with which Sweden was in contact during the Middle Ages. Much knowledge on the history of textiles in Europe is to be derived from the exhibition. It was characteristic of the Swedes in later centuries to devote freely of their wealth to the decoration of churches. For this purpose much outside material was brought into the country. RUSSIA Byzantine Medallion.-The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has recently acquired a medallion of Byzantine cloisonne enamel believed to have been executed about the end of the eleventh century and to have come from a Georgian Monastery. This example has eight colors. The figure is that of St. Nicholas, the letters of whose name are deeply stamped on the medallion and are filled with black. (B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 156 (Aug., 1928), pp. 56-57 (1 fig.)) RENAISSANCE ITALY Bernardo Daddi.-In B. A. I. Chicago, xxii, 6 (Sept., 1928), pp. 74-75 (2 figs.), it is noted that Martin A. Ryerson has lent to the Art Institute of Chicago a paint- ing of a Crucifixion by Bernardo Daddi. The picture is a simple cross bearing the body of Christ, with the figures of St. John and the Magdalene kneeling below. At the foot of the cross the ground is broken and the half-length figure of a crowned prophet appears. Above are two winged angels pointing to a medallion on which appears the half-length figure of the risen Christ. All this is against a gold background. This Crucifixion resembles somewhat the triptych attributed to the same artist in the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University.</page><page sequence="21">128 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 MILAN.-A Painting by Giorgione.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K., lxii (1928), pp. 169- 173 (5 figs.), K. F. SUTER publishes a little painting of the bust of a boy in the Ambrosiana gallery which he identifies with "La pittura della testa del pastorello che tiene in man un frutto," mentioned by the Anonimo Morelliano. This picture, an original by Giorgione, was seen by the anonymous writer in the collection of Zuan Ram. The bust in the Ambrosiana represents a boy of about ten, who holds a round fruit and is dressed in a shepherd's costume almost identical with that worn by the shepherds in the Budapest fragment of Giorgione's Finding of the Infant Paris, and the style of the picture agrees throughout with that of Giorgione. It probably dates slightly later than the Budapest fragment, a little nearer the Castelfranco Madonna. Portrait by Moretto da Brescia.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 9 (Sept., 1928), p. 216-217 (1 fig.), BRYSON BURROUGHS briefly describes the Portrait of a Man, by Moretto da Brescia, lately purchased by the Museum. A "IResurrected " Pesellino.-The removing of a layer of paint applied over the original has resulted in the restoration of the Virgin and Child with Saints, by Francesco Pesellino (1422-1457) (The Illustrated London News, Nov. 3, 1928, p. 817 (fig., in colors)) Tintoretto.-In B. A. I. Chicago, xxii, 8 (Nov., 1928), pp. 102-103 (2 figs.), is described the mythological composition by Tintoretto, "Mars and Venus," recently lent to the Art Institute. The work, considered by Baron von Hadeln to be a significant example of the artist's later period, was painted about 1580. FRANCE Ingres' Graphic Work.-In the Art Institute of Chicago there is a collection which completely represents the work of Ingres. Notable among the examples are: a rare sheet on which are printed the portraits of Lord Glenbervic, Lady Glen- bervic, their son Frederic Sylvester Douglas, and the Earl of Guilford; a portrait of M. de Norvine; a seldom found portrait of Frederick Sylvester Douglas; and a version of the "Odalisque." The artist is further represented by a study of oil and a famous pencil drawing of M. Tardieu, "a particularly delicate and vigorous work, full of character and significance." (B. A. I. Chicago, xxii, 6 (Sept., 1928), p. 77 (2 figs.)) Portraits by Joos van Cleve.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K., lxii (1928), pp. 145-152 (10 figs.), L. BALDASS publishes several portraits that he has been able to attribute to Joos van Cleve since the appearance of his monograph on the artist three years ago. These portraits are important in characterizing the development and style of the painter. Further, four portrait drawings in the Louvre are here added to van Cleve's list of works. They represent the first attempt to identify the artist's drawings. Toulouse-Lautrec.-In B. A. I. Chicago xxii, 8 (Nov., 1928), p. 105 (1 fig.), is briefly described "Messalina at the Bordeaux Opera," a scene by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, which illustrates the artist's remarkable draughtsmanship and his unusual sense of movement. "Woman Reading in the Fields."-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 6 (June, 1928), pp. 154-156 (2 figs.), BRYSON BURROUGHS reports that the Museum has recently acquired, through a gift, Corot's painting "Woman Reading in the Fields." GERMANY German Armor.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 4 (April, 1928), pp. 100-103 (3 figs.), STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY reports on the recent acquisition by the Museum of a suit of Maximilian armor dating about 1535. It is a composed harness note-</page><page sequence="22">FAR EASTERN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 129 worthy for its size (being made for a man about six feet, four inches tall), and also as a splendid example of craftsmanship in metal. German Breastplate and Volante-Piece.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 7 (July, 1928), pp. 186-189 (3 figs.), STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY announces that the Metro- politan Museum has added to its armor exhibit an enriched breastplate and volante-piece belonging to the same suit and dating 1550-1560. These pieces are richly etched in bands enclosing hunting scenes, foliation, portrait medallions, and the horn of plenty. MUNICH.-Newly Discovered Engravings.-In Munch. Jb., v (1928), pp. 247-251 (2 pls.; fig.), 0. WEIGMANN publishes two hitherto unnoticed engravings which may be attributed to Israhel van Meckenem, and are evidently derived from prototypes by the Master E. S. The first is a half-length Madonna on the Crescent Moon, which must date about 1475; the second is a Madonna with the Praying St. Bernhard, of about 1470. OBERSTEIN A.D. NAHE.-A Mainz Painter.-In Z. f. Bild. K., lxii (1928), pp. 102-109 (8 figs.), F. BACK characterizes a Middle Rhenish painter of the early fifteenth century, starting from the altarpiece of the Passion in Oberstein a.d Nahe, which was brought to light by the recent Darmstadt Exhibition. The painter of this altarpiece had a remarkable gift for dramatic effect; his interpreta- tion of the Biblical story is highly original; his facial types are distinctive; and both his color schemes and his chiaroscuro are entirely arbitrary. That he was a native of Mainz appears from his use of the Mainz wheel on a panel now in the museum at Mainz. His activity may be dated in the first two decades of the fifteenth century, with the Schotten altarpiece as his earliest known work, and the Crucifixion in the Frankfurt Church of St. Peter as his latest. Shield-English or German?--[n Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 8 (Aug., 1928), pp. 198-200 (1 fig.), STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY writes to show that a shield in the Museum, ornamented with the armor of Sir John Smythe in the Tower of London, does not belong to the Greenwich school, to which it has been attributed, but to the Augs- burg school. HOLLAND Fifteenth-Century Engraving.-The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has recently acquired a fifteenth-century engraving produced in the Netherlands by the master F. V. B. The theme is the Judgment of Solomon, and the engraving is described as the masterpiece of the most remarkable engraver of the Low Countries during the fifteenth century. (B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 157 (Oct., 1928), pp. 74-75 (2 figs.)) GREAT BRITAIN William Blake.-The Metropolitan Museum of Art is displaying sixteen of the five hundred and thirty-seven water-colors made by William Blake in 1796 to accompany a handsome edition of Young's Night Thoughts. The edition was not heartily accepted by the public and only part of it was published. The de- signs by Blake remained unknown to students until 1874, when they were sold to a London bookseller. After this display they will be sent back to England as a gift to the British Museum. (LOUISE GUERBER, in Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 4 (April, 1928), pp. 103-107 (3 figs.))

One suit is a Turkish harness of the fifteenth century, two are of Indian workman- ship of the eighteenth century, and the fourth is Persian of the seventeenth cen- tury. (STEPEHN V. GRANCSAY, in Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 5 (May, 1928), pp. 127-129 (1 fig.)) AZERBAIJAN Monuments between Yevlakh and Shusha.-In Bull. of the Committee Charged with the Preservation of the Monuments of Archaeology, Art, and National Objects of Azerbaijan, iii, 1927 (Baku), J. ALEKSANDROVICH, I. AZIMBEKOv and V. M. SYSOYEV report on an archaeological survey of the route between Yevlakh and Shusha. Several Turkish and Persian inscriptions are given as having been noted along the road. These range in date from 1200 to the present time. Old ruined towers and mausolea are discussed. V. M. SYSOYEv (pp. 25-44) also describes some Armenian churches and other monuments between Shusha and Mirik. He also gives notes on the history of some sites, such as Shusha. Excavations were made (pp. 45-53) in 1925 at Lachin, and since then five gold coins of Constantine Ducas XIII (1059-1067) have been found. This was apparently the site of an Armenian settlement. Also some bronze bracelets and other objects were found. E. A. PAKHOMOV (pp. 55-58) writes about a find of 196 coins brought in from Sabir-abad in 1926. These coins were of the Shirvanshah Dynasty and repre- sented: Akhsitan I, on one coin; Feriburz II, on 26 coins; and Gershasp I, on 169 coins; i.e., the coins all belonged to the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century. The author gives a brief discussion of some of the types. Through a chemical analysis Pakhomov shows that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there was an increase of copper and a decrease in the silver used. In some cases lead was substituted. The same writer also describes (pp. 63-64) a local fortress tower near Baladjary, which is now in ruins. R. EFENDIEV (pp. 65-71) lists the fortifications, cemeteries, and bazaars in the neighborhood of Nukha, many of which deserve excavation. A. P. FITUNI (pp. 75-148) describes the settlements near Lagich, especially Fit-Dagh, the last capital of the khavate of Shirvan. Near this place many remains have been found, porcelain apparently from China and coins of the Sas- sanid Empire, etc. Here is rich material for research. Most of the remainder of the volume is given over to the description of the Virgin Tower in Baku. PERSIA HAMADAN.--In The Illustrated London News, July 21, 1928, p. 97, is a picture of a gold bust shown at the Exhibition of Antiques and Works of Art, at Olympia. The work is entirely of gold, measures 15 inches in height and weighs 89 ounces. It was found on an ancient site near Hamadan, Persia, and is believed to be genuine. The Muhammedan Period, Since 630 A.D.-In The Illustrated London News, Aug. 18, 1928, pp. 310-311 (10 figs.), ERNST HERZFELD writes his fourth and con- cluding article on Persia. The Muhammedan conquest was part of a vast move- ment which was in the nature of a reaction of Asia against Hellenism. The source of the fresh artistic ideas blossoming forth after about three centuries of Islam is believed to have been Sassanian. Hellenistic features are conquered by Asiatic influence. As early as 1225 the apogee of Muhammedan art has been reached; the absolute end of creative power is marked by the period of the Renaissance in southern Europe, the religious developments in northern Europe, the discovery of</page><page sequence="24">FAR EASTERN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 131 the Western World, and that of new routes to the Far East, in other words, the ascendancy of Europe over Asia. Persian Carpet.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxii, 10 (Oct., 1927), pp. 247-251 (3 figs.), M. S. DIMAND briefly describes the unique brocaded Persian velvet carpet, probably from the looms at Ispahan at the end of the sixteenth century, recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum. INDIA Indian Art at the Guimet Museum.-In Revue de l'art ancien et moderne, lii (1927), pp. 99-106 (figs.), R. GROUSSERT writes about recent acquisitions of Indian art at the Guimet Museum. The Greco-Buddhist sculptures, presented by Clemenceau, are studied and compared with others discovered in Afghanistan, leading to conclusions concerning the general evolution of Gandharan art. Other recent acquisitions, marble reliefs from the region of Amaravati, are to be dated in the second century and are exceedingly interesting because of their crowded but living rhythms, their lithe, expressive bodies, and the converging of all details toward the central figure or motif. The Guimet Museum has some of the finest of the second and third century Indian art. KIDRAPORE.-In The Illustrated London News, Aug. 11, 1928, p. 252 (figs.) is shown the temple of Siva, recently uncovered from the mud of the river, at Kidrapore, in the Bombay region. A great wealth of remarkably beautiful sculpture has been revealed. Sixth-Century Stone Stele.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 5 (May, 1928), pp. 133- 135 (2 figs.), ALAN PRIEST discusses the small Buddhist stone recently put on exhibition in the Museum. The stone seems to be a section of a miniature stele, and not a complete thing in itself. Comparisons with other stelae indicate that it was made close to the middle of the sixth century and that its provenance is probably North Honan or South Chihli. Three Indian Paintings.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 5 (May, 1928), pp. 124- 127 (2 figs.), M. S. DIMAND announces the Museum's recent acquisition of three Indian miniature paintings of the end of the sixteenth century. They are illus- trations from a manuscript of Razmnamah (the Persian translation of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata), rendered into Persian and illustrated in accordance with the order of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605). CHINA "Buried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan."-In The Illustrated London News, Dec. 1, 1928, p. 1012 (2 figs.) is a resum6 of Anna Barwell's English translation (London, George Allen and Unwin, 18 sh.) of Albert von Le Coq, Buried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan: An Account of the Activities and Adventures of the Second and Third German Turfan Expeditions. Chinese Paintings.-In B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 155 (June 1928), pp. 40-41 (5 figs.), KOJIRo TOMITA describes the group of four paintings recently added to the Ross collection in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The pictures are of the Sung Dynasty, but the name of the art remains a mystery. The theme of the group is "Wen-chi's captivity in Mongolia and her return to China." The great artistic merit of these paintings is attested by the references to them made by many great artist-critics and connoisseurs, and by the seals of celebrated collectors who once owned them and affixed their stamps on them. Chinese Sculpture.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 6 (June, 1928), pp. 156-158 (1 fig.), ALAN PRIEST reports the addition to the Museum's Chinese collection of a wood sculpture of the late T'ang period representing Kuan Yin, the Chinese</page><page sequence="25">132 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 version of the great Indian Bodhisattva, Avalokitesvara. It is a statue of the type whose provenance is southern Shansi. The figure which represents the Bodhisattva as sitting erect is in a remarkably fine state of preservation. Chinese Silver.-In B. A. I. Chicago, xxii, 7 (Oct., 1928), pp. 88-91 (7 figs.), the Institute reports some recently acquired Chinese silver bowls, cups, and shears. Fresco from Moon Hill Monastery.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Pa.), xix, 2 (June, 1928), pp. 109-129 (6 pls.), HELEN E. FERNALD notes the acquisition by the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Museum of another fresco from Moon Hill Monastery (cf. an earlier review in A.J.A., xxxi, 2, 218, of a similar article in Mus. J. for Sept., 1926). The new fresco, from Ch'ing Hua Chin, in Honan Province, is 18 feet in height and 29 feet long, and is nearly perfectly preserved. This fresco is from the wall opposite the one acquired in 1926 and, like it, is in opaque tempera, similar to enamel where thick, done on walls of coarse reddish mud mixed with straw surfaced with a thin layer of slightly finer clay. The painting was removed by cutting it out in large oblong sections from behind. In composition this fresco is similar to the other,--Skyamuni Buddha en- throned in the center attended on each side by a Bodhisattva and surrounded by devas and devotees. The article by Miss Fernald describes the composition, delineation, and coloring, and supplies excellent plates. The Bodhisattvas are, according to Miss Fernald, probably to be identified as AkAgagarbha (Hii K'ung- tsang) and Ksitigarbha (Ti-tsang). The painting is, by the same authority, be- lieved to be of the tenth century, or, if later, Ming at the latest. Petroglyphs from Orkhon Valley, Mongolia.--In Antropologiya, 1927, pp. 135-142, ANATOL Nosov reports on petroglyphs discovered in the Orkhon Valley, in Mongolia. Goats, deer, etc., are represented; also a mounted horseman. There is a striking similarity with the Madeleine type of realism, but these figures seem to come from different periods and groups. Many of the animals seem in- complete, though they show strong realism. Two Chinese Buddhist Groups.-During the summer of 1928, there were exhibited in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts two famous Chinese Buddhist dedicatory groups in gilded bronze, lent to the Museum by Mrs. John D. Rocke- feller, Jr. Both figures are distinguished examples of sixth-century Buddhist art of Northern Wei. The larger of the two monuments has on the back a dated inscription which places the work in the year 524 A.D. Furthermore, the inscrip- tion tells the name of the man who dedicated it, and the district in which he lived. (B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 156 (Aug., 1928), pp. 57-60 (3 figs.)) JAPAN Japanese Sword Guards and Knife Handles.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 9 (Sept., 1928), pp. 212-216 (1 fig.), STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY writes about the col- lection of fifty Japanese sword guards and fifty knife handles now on exhibition in the Japanese Armor Gallery of the Museum. CENTRAL AMERICA COCLE, PANAMA.-The Illustrated London News, Oct. 13, 1928, pp. 653-655 (26 figs., 10 in colors) shows drawings and photographs of the discoveries made by A. HYATT VERRILL, in the province of Cocle, Panama (Indian Notes IV, 1). Much beautiful pottery was discovered which will aid materially in the study of South American archaeology. Ruins of enormous temple structures, with many sculp- tured stone columns constitute the major explorations. A volcanic eruption or an</page><page sequence="26">JERUSALEM] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 133 earthquake is believed to have caused the destruction of the temple, parts of which are greatly scattered. HONDURAS.-The British Museum Expedition to British Honduras this year has just placed on exhibition its find pertaining to the Early Maya Empire. Evi- dence going back as far as the first century A.D. is reported. A very interesting stone mask was discovered, also pottery, stone implements, but no traces of metal. (The Illustrated London News, Dec. 15, 1928, p. 1135 (7 figs.)) UNITED STATES BOSTON.-The B. Mus. F. A., xxvi, 158, Dec. 1928, announces the opening of the new wing of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, used for the display of deco- rative arts of Europe and America. A very valuable feature of this display is the series of rooms, with furnishings, from a room of the Tudor period, dating about 1490, ranging over various European countries, and then ending up with some fine American rooms, removed from their original homes, chiefly from various parts of New England. Engraved Gems.-In B. Mus. F. A. xxvi, 155 (June, 1928), pp. 46-50 (26 figs.), there is a report on the Warren collection of engraved gems now exhibited in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The collection includes Cretan, Mycenaean, Mesopotamian, and Persian seals, a Renaissance intaglio, and a remarkable show- ing of Greek gems of the sixth, fifth, and fourth centuries, supplemented by Etrus- can and Phoenician scarabs of Greek style and a series of Hellenistic and Graeco- Roman intaglios. PHILADELPHIA.-New Museum.-In Bull. Metr. Mus., xxiii, 6 (June, 1928), pp. 160-166 (4 figs.), RICHARD F.

TOLEDO.-Rembrandt Print.-The Toledo Museum of Art has recently acquired Rembrandt's etching "The Jew's Synagogue," dated 1648. (Toledo Museum of Art News, 52 (Sept., 1928)) NEWS ITEMS FROM THE SCHOOL IN JERUSALEM PROGRESS IN PALESTINIAN ARCHAEOLOGY DURING THE YEAR 1928 The past year was not less propitious than 1927 (see A.J.A., 1928, pp. 117-121). The most notable feature of the year's work was the great impetus given to pre- historic research; interest in the Byzantine period has also become more active. Nearly all the archaeological undertakings of the year were under English, American, or joint Anglo-American auspices, while two American excavations were carried on by British directors. Of the more important expeditions, three devoted them- selves to proto-archaeological research, seven to the Bronze and Early Iron Ages, and three (besides several minor ones) to the Roman and Byzantine periods. The great work of the University of Chicago at Megiddo, launched by Professor Breasted in 1925, promises to become more and more important, under the efficient direction of Mr. P. L. O. Guy. The entire mound has now been acquired, by agreement between the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities, so excavations will be carried on in the most scientific way, by removal of an entire stratum before the next level is attacked. The advantages of this method are evident: the civilization of each period will appear as a whole, and the danger of confusion of periods will be reduced to a minimum. There are many practical gains, such as the increased accuracy of plans, the elimination of the irregularities</page><page sequence="27">134 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXXIII, 1929 which inevitably arise when plans of adjoining areas of the same stratum, exca- vated in different seasons, are fitted together. The only hindrance to perfect results at Megiddo is that the plans made by Schumacher are for the most part so inadequate and so poorly identified as to period that there will be gaps in the new plans corresponding to the trenches dug by him. It is happily possible to describe briefly the most important discoveries of the past year at Megiddo, owing to the fact that a lecture was given by Mr. Guy at Oxford in late August, dealing with the excavations of the spring and summer. Hitherto four strata have been examined by Fisher and Guy, extending from the tenth to the fourth centuries B.C. The fourth stratum from the top, occupied in the tenth century, is undoubtedly Solomonic and yields very important material for our knowledge of the builder's art of the time. A discovery which may justly be called sensational was that of a large area covered with stables for horses. Each stable contained twenty-four stalls, twelve on each side of a central passage, presumably serving both for the grooms and for the storage of the chariots to which the twelve teams belonged. Each horse was attached to a separate mono- lithic stone pillar, which also supported the roof. Between the pillars were stone mangers. The floor of the central passage was paved with hydraulic lime plaster, as hard as cement, while the stalls in which the horses stood were paved with small cobblestones, to prevent slipping. So far space for nearly two hundred horses has been found, but it is not probable that the excavators have reached the end of the stable area, so the number of horses originally provided for may have been much larger. Thanks to this discovery, Mr. Guy has also been able to show that the precisely similar structures uncovered by Bliss in the fifth stratum of Tell el-Hesi, dating also from the tenth century B.C., represent stables for horses. Bliss was naturally enough quite unable to explain these installations. The biblical state- ments with regard to the construction of towns for the maintenance of the chariots and horses of Solomon (I Kings 9, 19: II Chron. 8, 6) often considered erroneous, are now proved to be essentially correct, though the numbers may be overesti- mated. It may be added that we should render the passage in Kings as "towns for chariots and chariot-horses," as pointed out before Guy's discovery by ILhr (Orientalistische Literaturzeitung, Vol. 31, col. 925). Megiddo was one of the cities rebuilt by Solomon, though it is not explicitly stated that it was devoted to the maintenance of his chariotry. The excavations of the University of Pennsylvania Museum at BeisAn, ancient biblical Beth-shan, Greek Scythopolis, continued actively during the last four months of 1928, under the direction of Mr. Alan Rowe, who has been in charge since 1925. The seventh campaign was no less successful than the sixth. The excavations of this season were carried on in five building levels, belonging respec- tively to Ramesses II, Sethos I, Amenophis III, pre-Amenophis III, and Tuth- mosis III, but the most important discoveries were made in the last mentioned stratum, dating from the middle of the fifteenth century B.c. From Mr. Rowe's regular reports in the daily press and the Illustrated London News, it is possible to describe all the important results of this campaign, without indiscretion. Work in the area occupied by the temple precincts of the time of Tuthmosis III led again to remarkable discoveries. A large slab of basalt, originally set in the temple portal, as would appear, was found, in a perfect state of preservation. On it are carved, in bas-relief, representations of beast combats, in two registers. Above, a lion and a gigantic dog (?) are facing one another, while they stand on their hind legs, with interlocking paws. Below a lion is shown with his four paws on the ground, roaring, while a gigantic dog (?) bites his flank. The execution of the lions is superb, though somewhat conventionalized. None of the lions of the</page><page sequence="28">JERUSALEM] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 135 so-called Hittite type, dating from between the twelfth and the seventh centuries, can approach the lions of Beth-shan artistically. No monuments of even remotely comparable artistic value, aside from some of Egyptian origin, have hitherto been discovered in the pre-Hellenistic strata of Palestine. The Assyrian affiliations of the monument are obvious, but it is not Assyrian in the ordinarily accepted sense. We may probably explain it as an example of the art of Syria and Northern Meso- potamia during the age of the Hurrian cultural empire, which flourished between the seventeenth and the fourteenth centuries before our era. The standard for this domain of Hurrian culture was set by the kingdom of Mitanni, which stretched in the fifteenth century B.C. from the Mediterranean to the central Zagros, and from central Armenia to the borders of Babylonia proper. Another remarkable discovery made this year at Beth-shan was the foundation of a fort-tower of the Egypto-Canaanite type known to the Egyptians as migdol, and dating from the reign of Amenophis III (ca. 1400 B.c.). This is the first migdol ever excavated, though representations of them are common in the Egyp- tian mural reliefs of the age. Its walls were built of sun-dried brick, on a massive stone foundation, and were nearly two and a half metres thick. To the Palestinian archaeologist, the most important feature of the work at BeisAn is the extraordinary precision in dating pottery which is possible, thanks to the numerous and exactly dated levels. The general results are in agreement with the views held by the few competent authorities, but since doubt of the reliability of these views has frequently been expressed, the new BeisAn material is exceedingly welcome. In future there will be no excuse for disregard of the pot- tery evidence, as has been so common among archaeological investigators in Pales- tine. From the beginning of April to the first of June the American School of Oriental Research, in co6peration with the Xenia Theological Seminary of St. Louis, con- ducted the second campaign at Tell Beit Mirsim, southwest of Hebron, probably biblical Kirjath-sepher. As in the spring of 1926, the work was under the super- vision of President M. G. Kyle, and the direction of the writer. Preliminary re- ports have been published in the Bulletin of the American Schools, as well as else- where. The mound has an area of nearly four hectares, with an average depth of debris varying from four to five metres. The six strata represented on the tell are apparently all separated from one another by burned levels, a fact which makes their clear demarcation exceptionally easy. The upper four strata have been exca- vated over considerable areas, while the lowest two remain to be studied in detail. At present it is only possible to say that the lowest, stratum F, belongs to the end of the Early Bronze and perhaps to the beginning of the Middle, but cannot be dated later than the nineteenth century, while stratum E belongs to the earlier phase of the Middle Bronze, and cannot be dated later than about 1700 B.c. The following four levels may be dated with a close approach to tertainty as follows: D in the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries; C in the fourteenth and thirteenth; B from the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the twelfth to the latter part of the tenth; A from the end of the tenth or the beginning of the ninth to the be- ginning of the sixth. Stratum D reflects a high level of culture and prosperity in the Hyksos Age, and the city which it represents was destroyed during the wars which accompanied the foundation of the New Egyptian Empire. The most remarkable single discovery in it was that of a limestone stela representing the serpent-goddess in relief. The goddess wears long draperies, while a large serpent coils around her legs. The upper part of the figure is unhappily missing. This stela is absolutely unique, though it has often been supposed that the Canaanites worshipped a serpent</page><page sequence="29">136 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 goddess, somewhat analogous to the serpent-goddess of Crete, and probably still more similar to the ophidian deities of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Stratum C belongs to the latter half of the Late Bronze Age, the age of the Tell el-Amarna tablets, as well as of the Israelite conquest described in Joshua. During this period pottery of the Late Helladic type was imported in great quantities into Palestine. It will be interesting to Aegaean archaeologists to know that the earliest examples of this ware so far found in Egypt and Palestine belong to the reign of Tuthmosis III, and cannot be dated later than about 1450 B.C. In earlier strata no sherds whatever have been discovered. The great mass of this imported pottery dates from the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries before our era, just when the Achaean thalassocracy is shown by the Boghazk6i tablets to have flourished. The impor- tation of Mycenaean ware stops completely not less than half a century before the introduction of Philistine ware, as shown by the work at Tell Beit Mirsim, at 'Ain Shems, at Ashkelon, and at Tell Djemmeh. With stratum B we enter the Iron Age, the period of Israelite and Philistine occu- pation. Stratum B covers the period of the Judges, as well as that of the United Kingdom, and its destruction may confidently be referred to Shishak, founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty, whose invasion of Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (ca. 918 B.c.) was little short of catastrophic. The following stratum, A, represents a town of about five thousand people, densely crowded together, and prosperous according to the rural standards of pre-exilic Judah. The length of occupation- not less than three centuries-is established by the pottery, and may be gauged roughly by the fact that the streets of the town show an average deposit of a metre since the first occupation of the stratum. Many hundreds of objects were discov- ered in this stratum, representing every phase of the life of its inhabitants. Owing to the fact that this town was contemporary with Isaiah and Jeremiah, the full record of its culture which we have obtained becomes peculiarly significant. It may be observed in passing that the writer's respect for the cultural attainments of the pre-exilic Jews has risen greatly as a result of his two campaigns on this site. The most remarkable discoveries were a series of four dye-plants, with extraordi- narily massive equipment, and a group of short Hebrew inscriptions from the sev- enth and the early sixth centuries. One seal impression bears the name of Eliakim servant of Joiachin, who is unquestionably to be identified with Joiachin, the next to the last king of Judah. Since he reigned less than one year (597 B.C.), our seal may be dated exactly-the first exactly datable inscription of the Old Testament period found in Palestine. City A was destroyed either in the Chaldaean invasion of the year 597, or, more probably, in the catastrophe of the years 588-6 B.c. The site was never reoccupied. From March to the end of May Professor Elihu Grant, of Haverford College, carried on excavations at 'Ain Shems, the site of biblical Beth-shemesh. His results have been described briefly by him in the Bulletin and the Quarterly State- ment, so we may summarize them here. Work was begun at this site by the Palestine Exploration Fund, under the direction of Duncan Mackenzie, before the war, but after three short campaigns was interrupted. The authorities of the Fund generously ceded their right of priority to Professor Grant, whose choice of a site for excavation was brilliantly justified by the results of his first excavation. There are three well-preserved strata at Beth-shemesh, belonging respectively to the Late Bronze, the Early Iron I (Philistine period), and the Early Iron II (Dual Monarchy). The site was occupied even earlier than the beginning of the Late Bronze, as is shown by the presence of Middle Bronze sherds and burials, and of sporadic Early Bronze sherds, but the first fortified town on the site cannot be dated earlier than about the seventeenth century B.C. Beth-shemesh, though not</page><page sequence="30">JERUSALEM] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 137 an important town, was occupied, more or less continuously, and with no inter- vening destruction, from the seventeenth to the thirteenth century, when the Canaanite town was destroyed, and replaced by an Israelite settlement, under Philistine domination from about 1150 on. About the tenth century, it would seem, the place was again destroyed, and the reoccupation was not intensive enough to produce a well-built city, as at Tell Beit Mirsim. The final destruction was referred to the invasion of Sennacherib by Mackenzie, but the pottery and seal impressions seem to require a later date, so that the town may safely be sup- posed to have been burned during the last Chaldaean invasion. The most important discovery this year was that of part of the Late Bronze and Early Iron I necropolis, just under the city-wall. Three cave cemeteries were found, belonging respectively to the end of the Middle Bronze, the Late Bronze, and to the end of the Late Bronze and the beginning of Early Iron I. From these grottoes several hundred pieces of pottery, many of remarkable beauty, as well as numerous bronze objects and articles of jewelry, were recovered. Mackenzie had discovered part of the Iron Age cemetery, but had missed the immensely richer Bronze Age necropolis. We may safely say that this is the most important dis- covery of early funerary remains sifice the war in Palestine. Work on the site of the oldest Jerusalem, generally called "Ophel," by a slight extension of biblical usage, was resumed by Mr. Crowfoot, acting on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, this past September, and continued until the latter part of December. The work on this site is decidedly discouraging, and Mr. Crowfoot deserves great credit for continuing to work according to the most scientific methods, despite the discouraging results. However, material of value for our knowledge of the ancient fortifications of the city on the western side of the hill, before the end of the Maccabaean period, has been discovered, and some evi- dence for the location of the much disputed site of Millo and Acra. A very inter- esting Byzantine mosaic inscription was also found this season. Mr. Crowfoot was also in charge of the joint excavation of the British School and Yale University at Gerasa, modern Djerash, one of the most important cities of the Decapolis. Work began in March and continued until June. For several years the Transjordan Government, with Mr. Horsfield as director, has been carrying on an extremely valuable work of excavation and consolidation, but efforts to interest outside organizations in the recovery of the ancient city were not successful until Professor Bacon, of Yale, took the matter up last year. The Yale-British School expedition devoted itself mainly to the church of St. Theodore, the interior of which was entirely cleared, though further important discoveries may be expected from the clearance of the exterior of the building. This church was built at the end of the fifth century, and abandoned, if not destroyed, in the seventh. Behind the apse was a paved court, a full story lower than the floor of the church, from which two wide stairways led down to it. In the center of the court was a foun- tain, which the excavators have plausibly identified with the fountain mentioned by Epiphanius, where water was annually changed into wine at Epiphany. The baptistry of the church is well preserved, and exceedingly interesting, not least because of its exceptional size and depth. Small finds were not numerous, and consisted largely of bronzes and glassware. The British School in Egypt has also continued its excavations in the extreme south of Palestine. Work at Tell el-Fri' was begun in December, 1927, by Mr. Starkey, who continued it until the end of the winter. Toward the end of Novem- ber, 1928, work was resumed, and the second campaign will probably not close before the end of March, under the direction of Sir Flinders Petrie, with Mr. Starkey as his assistant. Tell el-F~Ari' was occupied from at least as early as the</page><page sequence="31">138 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 Middle Bronze down to about the third century A.D. The summit of the mound is covered with Roman ruins, beneath which are remains of the Hellenistic period as well as of Early Iron III (Babylonian and Persian periods). Extensive remains of building operation ascribed to Shishak have been found, together with clear traces of massive fortifications of the latter part of the Middle Bronze, i.e., prob- ably the seventeenth century B.c. The most interesting discoveries, however, were made in the cemeteries of different periods, scattered over the plain to the west and north of the mound. In one tomb of the Iron Age were found the re- mains of a bronze couch and canopy made of tubular bronze framing, into which wooden poles fitted. To the same tomb belonged a beautiful silver ladle, with the handle in the form of a girl swimming, Egyptianizing in style. An Aramaic ostracon of the Persian period was also discovered. The site of Tell el-FAri' is exceedingly strong, and the topographic location is admirably adapted for Sharuhen, a town of Simeon, which was one of the centres of the Hyksos, and resisted the Egyptian arms for three years after the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt. Moreover, Sharuhen was also among the towns con- quered by Shishak. The identification with Beth-pelet, proposed by Petrie, is quite without foundation. It is to be hoped that the excavations begun here will be continued for several campaigns, since important light on the Philistine occupation, in particular, may be expected. The tombs already opened this sea- son are exceedingly interesting, though no accounts of them have yet been pub- lished, and so we must be silent. Professor John Garstang, for seven years Director of Antiquities, has taken ad- vantage of the increased time for research given him by his professorship at the University of Liverpool to resume archaeological work in Palestine. During the months of September and October he devoted several weeks to rather elaborate soundings at Tell el-Qedah, the site of ancient Hazor, discovered by him in the fall of 1926. Tell el-Qedah is one of the most extraordinary sites in Palestine, con- sisting of a large mound, to the north of which stretches a great enclosed area of some thirty hectares, which for convenience has been entitled the "Camp." It is situated on the main highway north from the Sea of Galilee to the BiqA' of Syria, just west of the southern end of Lake Hiileh. Garstang's investigations, which have been described briefly by the press, have shown that the date of the occupa- tion of the enclosed camp is in the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age, and that it was abandoned somewhere in the latter part of the Late Bronze, after the destruc- tion of the city. The immense rectangular rampart of terre pisbe closely resembles similar ramparts found elsewhere in Syria and Egypt, and all, so far as is known, belonging to the Hyksos period. The mound proper continued to be occupied through the Early Iron I and II, down into the eighth century, when Hazor was destroyed by Tiglathpileser III of Assyria (B.C. 735). A very clear-cut stratum, with well-built stone and brick construction, belongs to the tenth century, the period of Solomon, who is known to have rebuilt the town of Hazor. Professor Garstang also made some soundings at the mound of et-Tell, ancient Ai, east of Bethel, in the month of September. Part of the Bronze Age wall was traced, and pottery of the Middle Bronze and the beginning of the Late Bronze was found. It is interesting to note that Ai was destroyed by the Hebrews, as narrated in the Book of Joshua, and never reoccupied, in strict agreement with the biblical tradition. In July Rev. D. J. Chitty conducted brief excavations in the ruins of the church of St. Euthymius, at KhAn el-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem, on behalf of the British School in Jerusalem. A preliminary report has been published in the Quarterly Statement. The church was built by St. Euthymius, between 480 and 485 A.D.,</page><page sequence="32">JERUSALEM] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 139 and enjoyed its greatest prosperity in the sixth century. In the seventh century it was twice destroyed, once by the Persians (614) and a second time by an earth- quake (659), but continued in use down to about the thirteenth century. The most interesting discovery was that of a well-preserved mosaic pavement with elaborate geometrical and quasi-arabesque patterns, dating from the sixth or seventh centuries. The German excavations at BalAtah, the site of ancient Shechem, have been continued during the past year. Professor Sellin, conducted a short spring cam- paign-the fifth since the war-mainly devoted to the task of clearing away the earth excavated during previous campaigns. It was believed that a sacred menhir (maqqebah) had been found in the temenos of the Late Bronze Age, but this sup- posed discovery was proved later to be erroneous. From July to September a sixth campaign was conducted by Dr. Welter-Mauve, the new director of the exca- vations, on behalf of the German Archaeological Institute. Dr. Welter has been associated with Sellin in previous campaigns, and is familiar with the ground, besides being one of the foremost German classical archaeologists, long in charge of the work at Aegina. Under his direction the scientific character of the work at Balatah can only gain, and one of his first aims is to solve the chronological prob- lems connected with the excavations, which have hitherto not received much attention. Shechem was a most important place, and its chronology is a matter of the greatest importance to historians. Neglect of the pottery evidence on a Palestinian site brings with it loss of the only practical criterion for the chronology. From previous work at BalAtah it has become certain that the site was occupied from before the middle of the Middle Bronze down to the early Roman period, that is, to about 67 A.D., when it was destroyed by Vespasian. Two massive city walls, to each of which belonged a monumental gateway, have been unearthed, the earlier one dating apparently from the first half of the Late Bronze Age. Still older than the walls is a massive rampart of marl, dating probably back to the end of the Middle Bronze, like the rampart of terre piske found by Garstang at Hazor. The marl rampart represenits apparently the oldest phase of the later acropolis, in which were found the buildings designated by Sellin, somewhat doubtfully, as temples, one of earlier date, the other more recent. This acropolis is almost cer- tainly the Millo of the Book of Judges. During the summer Drs. Welter and Schneider also cleared the church of St. Mary, built by Emperor Zeno on Mount Gerizim between 484 and 491 A.D. The ground-plan of the church is perfectly preserved, consisting of an octagonal struc- ture, within which is an octagonal ambulatory, with the supporting pillars set along the inner sides of it. Around the main octagon is an outer one, the space between them being occupied by chapels, several of which have apses of their own. The apse of the basilica is separated from the interior of the main octagon by a rectangular choir, the floor of which is raised above that of the church proper. This church continued in use down to the eighth century, perhaps in part down to the tenth. After the great rebellion of the Samaritans under Justinian, the latter built a rectangular wall, with towers at the corners, around the basilica enclosure, to protect the church from future attack. Few smaller finds were made, the most interesting being that of a stone with a Greek inscription stating that it came from Golgotha. To conclude this sketch of last year's archaeological work in Palestine, we must describe briefly the results of the three prehistoric expeditions, at Shuqbah, in the WfAdi Khreitfin, and in the WAVdi el-Mughdrah, near Athlit. Palestine is certain to become the most important field of proto-archaeological research in the world during the next few years, barring totally unexpected discoveries elsewhere. The</page><page sequence="33">140 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 English, French, and Americans are now turning their attention to Palestine; exca- vations in various prehistoric sites will be conducted by at least three expeditions, headed probably by Miss Garrod, the Abb6 Boule, and Mr. Turville-Petre, during 1929. Miss Dorothy Garrod, the discoverer of the Gibraltar skull, and one of the most distinguished British proto-archaeologists, commenced work in a cave at Shuqbah northwest of Jerusalem, on behalf of the British School of Archaeology, in April, and closed her campaign in June. She was assisted by Mr. and Mrs. George Woodbury, members of the American School of Prehistoric Research, which thus enters the field of Palestine prehistory, a field which we trust will not be soon abandoned. The work at Shuqbah has already been described briefly in the Quarterly Statement. The great cavern at Shuqbah was discovered to contain early remains by Pore Mallon, Director of the Pontifical Biblical Institute, who generously suggested the site to Miss Garrod. Two strata of prehistoric remains were found, the lower one belonging to the Upper Mousterian, and the upper to the Upper Mesolithic. The lower culture stands very close to the Aurignacian of Europe, and thus belongs to the transition from the Lower to the Upper Palaeo- lithic. Among the artifacts were discovered a tooth and a piece of the skull of a Neanderthal man. Even more interesting were other bones belonging to Homo Sapiens, also found in the same breccia deposit. If in the proper context, this discovery would seem to show that modern man appeared at an earlier date in Western Asia than in Western Europe. The microlithic culture of the upper stratum is new to Palestinian archaeologists, and shows affinities both with the Tardenoisian of Europe and with the latest Capsian of Northern Africa. With the microliths were found pointed bone instruments and needles, belonging to a leather-working industry. During June and July M. Neuville, Vice-Consul of France in Jerusalem, carried on excavations in a grotto in the WAdi Khreitin, near the traditional site of the Cave of Adullam. His lowest level proved to be a very early Mousterian, with Acheulian affinities; no skeletal remains were found. The principal interest of this stratum lies in the fact that it demonstrates the relative priority of cave- dwelling in Palestine, as compared to Western Europe. Above the Mousterian level was a very interesting deposit of the Chalcolithic, antedating any remains hitherto found in excavating tells. In the late fall of the past year the attention of the Department of Antiquities was called to some prehistoric caves near 'Athlit, in the WAdi el-Mugharah, which were in danger of being destroyed by the quarrymen engaged in securing stone for the Haifa harbor. Mr. Richmond, Director of Antiquities, at once sent Mr. Lambert, of the Department, to the spot to make soundings. Mr. Lambert's soundings proved unexpectedly productive; he discovered a very well-preserved occupation belonging to the most obscure period in the history of Palestine, the transition from Mesolithic to Chalcolithic, a stage intermediate between the upper stratum at Shuqbah and the upper stratum at the WAdi Khreit-hn. Besides the artifacts, partly microlithic and partly neolithic in type-perhaps somewhat mixed-were bone awls of the same type as those found at Shuqbah, and a figurine of a bull, carved out of bone. The figurine has a certain vague resemblance to pre-dynastic Egyptian work, but belongs to a distinct culture. Here we have, for the first time, a clear archaeological document from the beginning of agri- cultural and cattle-raising life in Palestine. The rapid progress now being made by Palestinian archaeology will be evident from the preceding sketch. Next year (1929) excavations will be undertaken by the three prehistoric expeditions just mentioned, and will be continued at</page><page sequence="34">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 141 Megiddo, at Tell en-Nasbeh, at 'Ain Shems, at Shiloh, and probably also at Ophel and BalAtah. At the last moment news arrives that Dr. Sukenik is to undertake the excavation of a synagogue just discovered at Beit Ilfeh, west of Beisin. This synagogue appears to have remarkably well-preserved mosaic floors, containing representations of signs of the zodiac, like the mosaic of 'Ain ed-D-fq near Jericho. Dr. Sukenik is the leading authority on the Jewish syna- gogue, and is certain to obtain important material bearing on the vexed question of their chronology. Finally, let me again stress the need of increased help for the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. It is nothing short of a disgrace to American scholarship that this School should be so poorly supported. At present it receives from America, exclusive of the amount spent on publication, only a little over $5,000 a year for all purposes. Since this pitifully small sum is quite inadequate, the Director of the School is compelled to raise the balance needed as best he can, while the School excavations are all dependent upon co8perative undertakings of one kind and another. An endowment for this School is essential if American scholarly interest in Palestine is not to suffer irreparable harm. Just now it is possible to stress archaeological investigation in Palestine as never before; but without a center of research and a focus of interest, it will be impossible for us to take full advantage of the unparalleled opportunity. W. F. ALBRIGHT January 5, 1929 NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS The most noteworthy archaeological event in Greece during these last months has been the finding of the three bronzes in the sea off Cape Artemision on the north coast of Euboea. Two years ago a fisherman pulled up in his nets a bronze hand and arm which led to a great deal of talk about sunken treasure and inspired some unauthorized persons to attempt to find the statue from which the arm must have come. Their project was successful, but fortunately their plans were discovered before they could dispose of their loot, and the statue and its arm are once more united and safely housed in the National Museum at Athens. These events led the archaeological authorities to appeal to the Ministry of Marine for help in making investigations by soundings, and a boat was given them and put under the direction of the Ephor for that district, Mr. Bertos. With the help of the apparatus thus made available and with the assistance of divers, two more bronzes were brought to the surface before the weather caused the postponement of further work until the spring. In the course of the investigations other objects were found-amphorae, lead pipe, pebbles used as ballast, etc., which would indicate that the bronzes were part of the cargo of a ship wrecked off the Cape, as in the case of the Anti-Cythera finds. The wreck lies about 700 metres off shore at a depth of some 48 metres and is buried in mud and seaweed to such an extent that the work progressed very slowly. There is hope that the resumption of work in the spring will produce further results, but it will be difficult for it to produce anything finer than the "Poseidon" which is, without exception, the finest bronze in the Athens Museum. The statue is still undergoing a process of cleaning and cannot be put on exhibition for some time yet. It is, however, in an excellent state of preservation and although the arms and lower limbs have been broken off, the breaks are fairly clean and the joins should be almost invisible when repaired. The figure is more than lifesize and stands with feet apart, right arm raised as if to hurl some missile, while the left arm is stretched out to the side as if for balance. The object held in the right hand is missing, but from the</page><page sequence="35">142 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIII, 1929 position of the fingers it appears to have been held in a loose grip, and it does not seem probable that a trident could have been held this way. Both because of the pose and the type of head the opinion among experts now is that the bronze does not represent Poseidon, but Zeus, who is, probably, hurling a thunderbolt.- The head has a beauty and serene dignity that would appear mroe suited to the "Father of the Gods" than to the "God of the Sea." The god wears a long curling beard which, together with the hair above the brow and at the side of the head, is treated in a series of small clustered curls; these are not so archaic in style as the snailshell variety, but the separate locks are more like a question mark in shape, and an attempt has been made to distinguish the individual hairs by fine grooving. The top of the head is beautifully treated with these same fine grooves and around the head is bound a thin braid of hair in place of a fillet. The eyebrows are inlaid with a narrow strip of metal, while the eyes themselves were represented by some other material which is now missing. The torso is muscular and modelled in the firm style characteristic of the period just before the middle of the fifth century.2 The other bronzes consist of the forepart of a horse and the figure of a small boy. The horse is lifesize, and the part recovered includes the head, neck, chest and left foreleg. The horse was galloping with head and neck outstretched, ears flat, nostrils dilated and mouth partly open; the forelegs were, apparently, raised in air and not fastened to any base. The horse may have formed part of a chariot group. The vigor and simplicity of the modelling of the head would place it about the same date as those in the Parthenon pediment, although the bronze medium endows the animal with more vivacity. The figure of the boy appears to be later in date, perhaps belonging to the Hel- lenistic Period, although he is still so thickly encrusted with marine deposit that it is difficult to discuss his style in detail. He is lifesize and lacks only the right leg; his pose is full of life and vigor. He was apparently represented as a youthful (age about eight years) horseman with legs spread apart to grip to flanks of the horse and arms raised as if to receive acclamations at the end of a race. He holds the reins in one hand and the whip in the other and wears a light chlamys which left his right shoulder bare. The question of the provenance of these bronzes is still a matter for conjecture, but they may possibly have come from the nearby Sanctuary of Artemis at Histiaia. Another find of this past summer was a very fine marble funerary stele bearing a fifth-century bas-relief showing a seated woman bidding adieu to a standing male figure, while a nurse holds an infant in the background. This was found in the refugee quarter, Byron, during digging for foundations, and it appears likely that the site of a classical cemetery lies here, as some graves were also discovered. The relief is of excellent workmanship and bears the inscription: Favaybpa K77ratKpi-rovs IIorailov. At this time, when Mr. D. M. Robinson is lecturing about the Olynthos of the Classical Period, it is interesting to have a report from Mr. Heurtley of the British School on his prehistoric excavations in the same region. In continuation of his program of the systematic exploration of prehistoric sites in Macedonia, Mr. Heurtley excavated in 1928 two mounds in Chaldice, one at Moliv6pyrgo, the ancient port of Olynthos, and the other at Hdgios Mdmas, about a mile south of the same city. The former yielded evidence of two periods of occupation only, 1 For examples of similar pose cf. small bronze statuettes in the National Museum, Athens: No. 31, Carapanos Collection; Nos. 6194-6196 from Olympia. 2 A somewhat similar treatment of the torso, although the head is more archaic, may be found in the bronze statue of Poseidon from Boeotia, National Museum, No. 11761.</page><page sequence="36">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1928 143 the earlier showing pottery of the Early Helladic type, while the later level pro- duced much coarse monochrome ware closely akin to that of central Macedonia, but associated with Minyan ring-stemmed goblets, of rather coarser fabric than those from central and southern Greece. Remains of the habitations of this period also came to light, in the form of a thick, roughly-made wall with cross- walls at intervals; some of the compartments thus formed had one or more levels of cobble paving. The second site revealed four periods of occupation: Neolithic, with sherds resembling Thessalian wares; a much thicker stratum containing Early Helladic ware along with a complete potter's kiln, figurines of Trojan type, a necklace of teeth and carved bone beads and a stone axe; the third period was represented by much coarse ware, a few fragments of incised ware and a fair amount of Minyan; the finds from the fourth stratum agreed closely with those from "Period C" at Vardaroftsa in the Vardar Valley, including wishbone-handled vases and large quantities of Mycenaean (L. H. III b) sherds. At Knossos, in 1928, Sir Arthur Evans continued on an extensive scale the task of reconstruction in the quarters east of the Central Court. The work was supervised by Mr. Piet De Jong, architect to the British School, and lasted for five months. With the aid of reinforced concrete the whole of the Hall of the Double Axes, including its eastern and southern porticos, has been roofed over and the remains of the upper floor relaid at its original height. The gypsum pavement and other perishable features have thus been saved from further deteri- oration, and the painted stucco remains in the hall above have also been secured and protected. The lobby of the Grand Staircase has also been entirely restored and roofed over, and a replica of the great " Shield Fresco " that belonged to its inner face has been set up. M. Gillieron has also restored the "Fish Fresco" on the north wall of the Queen's Megaron. The reconstitution of the Grand Staircase area has at the same time been continued to a level somewhat above that of the Central Court. No extensive excavation took place, but near the House of the Frescoes a Minoan well was discovered containing more than thirty terracotta cylinders incised with signs, some of them taken from the linear script. A very careful exploration of the area north of the Central Court was made and a com- plete scheme of the upper system of the North Pillar Hall and Entrance Passage has been elaborated. Reconstruction work is to be done in this region in the spring of 1929. A Swedish expedition under Dr. Einar Gjerstad began explorations last year (1927) in two regions of the island of Cyprus: at Lapithos on the north coast and at Karavostasi on the west coast, on the site of the ancient Soli. At the first of these they opened and explored twenty-three tombs of the Early Bronze Age, and from the middle period (3000-1600 B.c.) there were two of particular importance: one of them appeared to be the burial place of some of the military aristocracy of Lapithos (c. 2000 B.C.), while the other (c. 2200 B.C.) may perhaps be considered as a royal tomb. The excavation of Soli has not been completed, but will be resumed later on. The 1928 campaign centered around Dali and Vouni. Dali is the ancient Idalion, and excavations had already been conducted there some years ago by Lang and, later, by Ohnefalsch-Richter. The Swedish expedition, therefore, confined their digging to the top of the Acropolis, where they uncovered a cult site with deposits beginning in the Late Bronze Age and continuing through the Iron Age into Late Hellenic times. In the lower strata (Late Cypriote III, 1200-1000 B.c.) were found five votive bulls of terracotta, seals and cylinders with figure scenes, carbonized remains of a wooden table with a cloth and olive stones on it. This is the first prehistoric cult-place found in Cyprus, and it is typically Cypriote in contrast to the Greek temple site on Vouni. At Dali there is no</page><page sequence="37">144 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXIIII 1929 temple, but only a large open court with an altar and the whole surrounded by a temenos wall. The cult was aniconic, and no votive statues were found, which is rather unusual for Cyprus; the votive offerings here were chiefly weapons, and two of the shields, are especially noteworthy with their stamped ornaments of lotus flowers and palmettes. Other kinds of offerings were also discovered: bronze bowls and lamps, other lamps of iron, and rings of bronze, iron and silver, some with engraved signets. A bull's head of bronze shows great artistic merit. No epigraphic material was found to prove the identity of the deity worshipped here, but Mr. Gjerstad believes that this was the temenos of a "Cypriote town goddess" whom the Greeks identified as Athena. At Vouni (ancient Aipeia) a palace covering an area of 10,000 square metres or more was partly cleared. This year's excavations disclosed a large central court, from which a wide staircase ,leads up to the western wing, which had at least two stories with terraces at the different levels; to the south lay the kitchen; to the north a system of magazines opening off a corridor, as in the Minoan Palaces of Crete-but this palace belongs to the Archaic and Early Classical Periods (c. 550-450 B.c.). The palace was approached by a staircase leading up to a monumental gateway, on either side of which bases for statues were found in situ, and the statues themselves were dis- covered where they had fallen on the stairway. Statuettes were also found which had apparently been placed in niches above the steps. These are in both lime- stone and terracotta and show strong Greek influence; some, indeed, closely resemble in style the Attic Korai. On the summit of the Acropolis, above the palace, there could be traced the foundations of a long rectangular building, evidently a temple. After the destruction of this temple a sacellum, contemporary with the palace, was built over part of the earlier structure. That this sacellinm was divided into three naves by wooden walls is proved by the post-holes and cuttings in the floor for the walls, although no trace of the wood itself remains. Across the court from the temple and sacellum were two small treasuries containing undisturbed bronze offerings-shields, swords, spear-heads, etc. In the sacelluiL itself were found a very fine bronze relief showing two lions attacking a bull, and a remarkable bronze statuette of a cow.' A limestone head of Athena wearing an Attic helmet, and three other heads of Athena found within the temenos, indicate that the sacellum was dedicated to this goddess. The Italian School under Professor Della Seta continued in 1927 their excava- tions on the site of Hephaisteia in Lemnos, and as a result of two seasons' work2 they have now found nearly two hundred and fifty interments. The ossuaries are of two types, being either oval vessels of red micaceous clay, sometimes decorated in relief, or else conical, or bi-conical, urns in coarser clay, mostly undecorated; the former group was usually richer in contents. Some of the vases which they contained must have been for funerary use only, since their necks were not pierced. The pottery in general falls into two classes, of which one is made of coarse ash-gray clay, and is most frequently in the form of small bi-conical amphorae, occasionally in groups of two or three united by a tall handle to form a kernos; the other is of finer clay, and its shapes include small amphorae, oenochoae, pyxides, etc., with geometric ornament in purple or red, though spirals and other motives reminiscent of Mycenaean appear at times in combination with them. With these two classes of ware, which must be of local origin, occur also imported vases of proto-Corinthian and Corinthian fabric; a single piece with 1 For pictures and further details see Illustrated London News, September 22, 1928. 2 An account of the first campaign was given in the News Items in the A.

Two aryballoi of the coarse local clay seem to represent, in ornament as well as form, native imitations of Corinthian imports. Fourteen tombs yielded gold jewellery, consisting of earrings, rings, necklaces with pendants, bracelets, and a single example of a stephane. Bronze fibulae, especially of bow-pattern, were frequent, but all of sub-Mycenaean or Geometric date. Among the weapons, axes and knives with straight or curved blades were more usual than spears. Other finds include a nude male statuette in gesso and a representation of a man struggling with a beast; in the same burial with this latter were several small figures of Bes. Of architectural importance is a small terracotta model of a building, in the form of a double cella with three columns at the sides and in the centre, which have rectangular capitals suggesting a proto-Doric type. These cemeteries appear to date from the eighth to ninth centuries B.c., and Professor Della Seta concludes that they belonged to a race which maintained strong recollections of Mycenaean civilization, but was not itself Greek; and that it should perhaps be identified with the " Tyrrheno-Pelasgian " population which occupied the island down to the time of the Athenian conquest. In the city of Hephaisteia the expedition has located and partly cleared a large building of polygonal masonry dated by its finds to the ninth or eighth century, contemporary with the cemeteries, but adapted (in the fourth or third, to judge by the use of double-T clamps) as a bath, which lasted down to Roman times. This discovery will be followed up in the next campaign. E. P. B.</page></plain_text>
