<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samvega: Aesthetic Shock by ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY The Pali word samvega is often used to denote the shock or wonder that may be felt when the perception of a work of art becomes a serious exper ience. In other contexts the root vij, with or without the intensive prefix sam, or other prefixes such as pra, "forth," implies a swift recoil from or trembling at something feared. For example, the rivers freed from the Dragon, "rush forth" (pra vivijre, Rgveda X. III. 9), Tvastr "quakes" (vevijyate) at Indra's wrath (ib. I. 80. 14), men "tremble" (samvijanle) at the roar of a lion (Atharva Veda VIII. 7. 15), birds "are in tremor" at the sight of a falcon (ib. V. 21.6); a woman "trembles" (sarhvijjati) and shows agita tion (samvegam dpajjati) at the sight of her father-in-law, and so does a monk who forgets the Buddha (Majjhima Nikaya, I. 186); a good horse aware of the whip is "inflamed and agitated" (atdpino samvejino, Dhammapada 144); and as a horse is "cut" by the lash, so may the good man be "troubled" (sarhvijjati) and show agitation (samvega) at the sight of sickness or death, "because of which agitation he pays close heed, and both physically veri fies the ultimate truth (parama saccam, the 'moral')1 and presciently pene trates it" (Ahguttara Nikaya, II. 116). "I will proclaim," the Buddha says, "the cause of my dismay (samvegam), wherefore I trembled (samvijitam rhaya): it was when I saw peoples floundering like fish when ponds dry up, when I beheld man's strife with man, that I felt fear" (or "horror"), and so it went "until I saw the evil barb that festers in men's hearts" (Sutta Nipata, 935-938)2. The emotional stimulus of painful themes may be evoked deliberately when the will or mind (citta) is sluggish, "then he stirs it up (samvejeti) by a consideration of the Eight Emotional Themes" (attha-sarhvega-vatthuni) (birth, old age, sickness, death and sufferings arising in four other ways); in the resulting state of distress, he then "gladdens"3'(or thrills, sampahahse li, Skr. hrs, 'rejoice' etc.) it by the recollection of the Buddha, the Eternal Law and the Communion of Monks, when it is in need of such gladden Samvega: Aesthetic Shock ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY</page><page sequence="2">ing" (Visuddhi Magga, 135). A poignant realization of the transience of natural beauty may have the same effect: in the Yuvanjaya Jataka, the Crown Prince (uparaja) "one day early in the morning mounted his splendid chariot and went out in all his great splendour to disport himself in the park. He saw on the tree-tops, the tips of the grasses, the ends of the branches, on every spider's web and thread, and on the points of the rushes, dew-drops hanging like so many strings of pearls." He learns from his charioteer that that is what men call "dew." When he returns in the evening the dew has vanished. The charioteer tells him that that is what happens when the sun rises. When the Prince hears this, he is "deep ly moved" (samvegappatto hutva), and he realises that "The living constitu tion of such as we are is just like these drops of dew;4 I must be rid of disease, old age and death; I must take leave of my parents, and turn to the life of a wandering monk." And so it was that "using as support of contemplation simply a dew-drop (ussavabindum eva arammanam katva) he realized that the Three Modes of Becoming (Conative, Formal, and Infor mal) are so many blazing fires. . . . Even as the dew-drop on blades of grass when the sun gets up, such is the life of men" (J. IV. 120- 122). Here it is a thing lovely in itself that provides the initial stimulus to reflec tion, but it is not so much the beautif ul thing as it is the perception of its evanescence that induces recollection. On the other hand, the "shock" or "thrill" need not involve a recoil, but may be one of supersensual delight. For example, the cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening (to Truth), accompanied by the notion of the Arrest (of the vicious causes of all pathological conditions), of which the seventh is an Impartiality {upekhaf that issues in Deliverance (vossagga = avasarga) "conduces to great profit, great ease, a great thrill (maha samvega) and great glee" (Samyutta Nikaya V. 134). In it there is "much radical intellection, leading to the full-awakening as pect of delight" (piti) or "contentment (tutthi) with the flavour (rasa) of the chosen support of contemplation that has been grasped;" body and mind are flooded or suff used; but this joyous emotion, after-effect of the shock, is a disturbance proper only to the earlier phases of contemplation and is superseded by equanimity (Visuddhi Magga 135—145). We are told that Brother Vakkali spent his days in gazing at the beauty of the Buddha's person. The Buddha, however, would have him understand that not he who sees his body, sees himself, but "only he who sees the Dhamma, sees Me;" he realises that Vakkali will never wake up (na . . . bujjhissati) unless he gets a shock (samvegan alabhitva); and so forbids Vak kali to follow him. Vakkali seeks to throw himself down from a mountain peak. To prevent this, the Buddha appears to him in a vision, saying,</page><page sequence="3">"Fear not, but come (ehi), and I shall lift you up." At this, Vakkali is filled with delight (plti); to reach the Master, he springs into the air,6 and, pon dering as he goes, he "discards the joyful emotion" and attains the fi nal goal of Arahatta before he descends to earth at the Buddha's feet (.Dhammapada Atthakatha IV. 118 f.). It will be seen that the transition from shock (that of the ban) to delight (that of the vision), and from de light to understanding, is clearly presented. Vakkali, at last, is no longer "attached" to the visual and more or less "idolatrous" experience; the aes thetic support of contemplation is not an end in itself, but only an index, and becomes a snare if misused.7 So far, then, samvega is a state of shock, agitation, fear, awe, wonder or delight induced by some physically or mentally poignant experience. It is a state of feeling, but always more than a merely physical reaction. The "shock" is essentially one of the realization of the implications of what are strictly speaking only the aesthetic surfaces of phenomena that may be liked or disliked as such. The complete experience transcends this condi tion of "irritability." It will not, then, surprise us to find that it is not only in connection with natural objects (such as the dew-drop) or events (such as death) but also in connection with works of art, and in fact whenever or wherever percep tion (.cucrffyo-i?) leads to a serious experience, that we are really shaken. So we read that "The man of learning (pandito = doctor) cannot but be deeply stirred (samvijjetheva, i.e., samvegam kareyya) by stirring situations (sam vejaniyesu thanesu). So may an ardent master monk, putting all things to the test of prescience, living the life of peace, and not puffed up, but one whose will has been given its quietus, attain to the wearing out of 111": there are, in fact, two things that conduce to a monk's well-being, content ment and spiritual-continence, viz. his radical premise, and "the thrill that should be felt in thrilling situations" (Itivuttaka, 30). We see this text (and from S. V. 134 cited above) that the "thrill" (samvega), experienced under suitable conditions, if it can still in some sense be thought of as an emo tion, is by no means merely an interested aesthetic response, but much rather what we so awkwardly term delight of a "disinterested aesthetic contemplation," —a contradiction in terms, but "you know what I mean." Now there are, in particular, "Four sightly places whereat the believing clansman should be deeply moved" (cattari kula-puttassa dassaniyani samve janiyanl thanani); they are those four in which the layman can say 'Here the Buddha was born!,' 'Here he attained to the Total Awakening, and was altogether the Wake!,' 'Here did he first set agoing the incomparable Wheel of the Law,' and 'Here was he despirated, with the despiration (nibbana-) that leaves no residuum (of occasion of becoming)!' . . . And</page><page sequence="4">there will come to these places believers, monks and sisters, and lay folk, men and women, and so say . . . and those of these who die in the course of their pilgrimage to such monuments (cetiya), in serenity of will (pasanna-citta) will be regenerated after death in the happy heaven-world" (Dig/in Nikaya II. 141. 142, cf. Ahguttara Nikaya I. 136, II. 120). As the words dassanlya (darsaniya) "sightly," "sight-worthy," commonly applied to visible works of art (as sravaniya, "worth hearing" is said of audi ble works), and cetiya,8 "monument," imply, and as we also know from abundant literary and archaeological evidence, these four sacred places or stations were marked by monuments, e.g., the still extant Wheel of the Law set up on a pillar in the Deer Park at Benares on the site of the first preaching. Furthermore, as we also know, these pilgrim stations could be substituted for by similar monuments set up elsewhere, or even construct ed on such a small scale as to be kept in a private chapel or carried about, to be similarly used as supports of contemplation. The net result is, then, that icons (whether "aniconic," as at first, or "anthropomorphic," some what later) serving as reminders of the great moments of the Buddha's life and participating in his essence, are to be regarded as 'stations" at the sight of which a "shock" or "thrill" may and should be experienced by monk or layman. Samvega, then, refers to the experience that may be felt in the presence of a work of art, when we are struck by it, as a horse may be struck by a whip. It is, however, assumed that like the good horse we are more or less trained, and hence that more than a merely physical shock is involved; the blow has a meaning for us, and the realization of that meaning, in which nothing of the physical sensation survives, is still a part of the shock. These two phases of the shock are, indeed, normally felt together as parts of an instant experience; but they can be logically distinguished, and since there is nothing peculiarly artistic in the mere sensibility that all men and animals share, it is with the latter aspect of the shock that we are chiefly concerned. In either phase, the external signs of the experience may be emotional, but while the signs may be alike, the conditions they express are unlike. In the first phase, there is really a disturbance, in the second there is the experience of a peace that cannot be described as an emotion in the sense that fear and love or hate are emotions. It is for this reason that Indian rhetoricians have always hesitated to reckon "Peace" (santi) as a "flavour" (rasa) in one category with the other "flavours." In the deepest experience that can be induced by a work of art (or other reminder) our very being is shaken (samvijita) to its roots. The "Tasting of the Flavour" that is no longer any one flavour is, as the Sahitya Darpana puts it, "the very twin brother of the tasting of God"; it involves, as the</page><page sequence="5">word "disinterested" implies, a self-naughting — a semetipsa liquescere—and it is for this reason that it can be described as "dreadf ul," even though we could not wish to avoid it. For example, it is of this experience that Eric Gill writes that "At the first impact I was so moved by the (Gregorian) chant ... as to be almost frightened. . . . This was something alive . . . 1 knew infallibly that God existed and was a living God" (Autobiography, 1940, p. 187). I have myself been completely dissolved and broken up by the same music, and had the same experience when reading aloud Plato's Pheedo. That cannot have been an "aesthetic" emotion, such as could have been felt in the presence of some insignificant work of art, but represents the shock of conviction that only an intellectual art can deliver, the body blow that is delivered by any perfect and therefore convincing statement of truth. On the other hand, realism in religious art is only disgusting and not at all moving, and what is commonly called pathos in art generally makes one laugh. The point is that a liability to be overcome by the truth has nothing to do with sentimentality; it is well known that the mathemati cian can be overcome in this way, when he finds a perfect expression that subsumes innumerable separate observations. But this shock can be felt only if we have learned to recognize truth when we see it. Consider, for example, Plotinus' overwhelming words, "Do you mean to say that they have seen God and do not remember him? Ah no, it is that they see him now anci always. Memory is for those who have forgotten." (Enneads, IV. 4. 6). To feel the full force of this "thunderbolt" (ua/r«)9 one must have had at least an inkling of what is involved in the Platonic and Indian doctrine of Recollection.10 In the question, "Did He who made the lamb make thee?" there is an incomparably harder blow than there is in "Only God can make a tree," which could as well have been said of a flea or a cut worm. With Socrates, "We cannot give the name of 'art' to anything irra tional" (Gorgias, 465 A); nor with the Buddhist think of any but significant works of art as "stations where the shock of awe should be felt." 1. The ultimate significance (paramartha-satyam) as distinguished (vijnalam) from the mere facts in which it is exemplified (see Pancavitksa Brahmana X. 12. 5, XIX. 6. 1 and Chandogya Upani$ad,VII. 16, 17 with Sankaracarya's Commentary). 2. We also feel the horror; but do we see the barb when we consider Picasso's Guernica, or have we "desired peace, but not the things that make for peace?" For the most part, our "aesthetic" approach stands between us and the content of the work of art, of which only the surface interests us. 3. A learned preacher's discourse is said to convince (samadapeti), inflame (samuttejeti) and gladden (sampahahseti) the congregation of monks (Samyutta Nikaya II. 280). 1.

A related association of ideas leads us to speak of being "car ried away" or "transported" by joy. In Matthew XIV. 27, 28, the words "Be not afraid . . . Come" are identical with the Pali ehi, ma bhayi in the Dhammapada Atthakatha context. 7. "O take heed, lest thou misconceive me in human shape" (Shams-i-Ta-briz, in Nichol son, Ode XXV).

But he wished them to have a divine affection, and thus to make them, from being carnal, spiritual. . . . Therefore he said to them, I send you a gift by which you will be made spiritual, namely, the gift of the Holy Ghost. . . . You will indeed cease from being carnal, if the form of the flesh be removed from your eyes, so that the form of God may be implanted in your hearts" (Sermo CCLXX. 2). The "form" of the Buddha that he wished Vakkali to see, rather than that of the flesh, was, of course, that of the Dhamma, "which he who sees, sees Me." St. Augustine's words parallel those of the Prem Sagar, chs.
