<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preface to the Issue ^On Evidence and Inference" Daniel Lerner The story was told by Albert Einstein of the young man who had married a very plain wife. Asked whether he was happy, the young man replied: "To tell the truth, I have to lie." This is Talmudism, an ancient variant of the general mode of logical disputation called dialectic. For the needs of debate, dia lectic is a superb instrument. It cancels certainty by casting doubt; while feinting at the mind, it delivers a verbal blow to the solar plexus that leaves the opponent gasping and speechless. It scores, in short, "debater's points." Why, then does dialectic, once a major mode of intellectual dis course, now figure only at the level of persiflage and repartee? Why does this mode of drawing inference from evidence no longer seem appropriate for serious needs? The answer lies largely in the reliance of dialectic on Sophie knowledge?in the ancient sense, knowledge "obtained by some secret process."1 The dialectical inference derives from evidence which is "secret" because undisclosed, implicit. Such putative knowledge, since it is not shared by others, cannot be used by them. On this point dialectic decisively parts company from science. The first test of scientific knowledge is that it must be public and not private, explicit and not "secret," available in a common fund for use by all who can learn. This test has a sociological derivation as well as a methodological consequence. The sociology of scientific knowledge has an enlightening history. The requirement of a public, explicit, common fund of propositions was established only against heavy opposition through the centuries from the powerful personnel of the magic and religion industries. The struggle for a rational science of medicine against those skilled in charms, amulets, incantations, herbs, and leeches is well remem bered. So is the struggle for an observational science of astronomy against those skilled in court astrology and clerical cosmology. The conception of knowledge as public disclosure to a common</page><page sequence="2">4 Dsedalus fund was, sociologically, the intellectual instrument by which a "new middle class" established itself between the dominant social orders and the ancient peasant mass. The growth of cities, the spread of literacy, the rise of universities, the reliance on inquiry?these were its institutional means. Through these institutions, the intellectual instrument was continuously extended to include all verifiable knowledge. Over the generations it captured from natural and social philosophy the several domains of inquiry now styled, with grand simplicity, Science. Faith in Science reached an apogee in the latter part of the nine teenth century in Victorian England, where the Newtonian universe was self-evident and the Spencerian gloss on Darwinian doctrine was persuasive. In twentieth-century Europe, following the collapse of the Pax Brittanica, the scientific creed came under sharp socio logical challenge from a new "class," the professional poUtical cadres of revolutionary counter-elites, discontented with their lot and ready to remake European society. The intellectual instrument of these new contenders was anti-Scientism, a manipulative mentality based on intuition rather than an investigative mentality based on evidence. Ludendorff, the spiritual presbyter of Nazism, said about the Scientistic Germany of his youth: "Wir waren alle Schwarm geister. Wir lernten sachlich statt pers?nlich denken." Mussolini, Stalin, and Hitler delivered heavy blows to the scientific creed. Excited anti-totalitarian philosophers in Europe forecast the "eclipse of reason." The Danish sociologist, Svend Ranulf, investi gated the intellectual issue more usefully in Hitlers Kampf gegen die Objektivit?t.2 The European psychoanalyst, Erik H. Erikson, clarified the profound impact of the Nazi attack upon objectivity in "Hitler s Imagery and German Youth."3 Throughout Europe there had sprung up, in the interwar years, "schools" of young thinkers vigorously re examining, with no reference whatsoever to contemporary politics, the logical foundations of the scientific creed?in Vienna, Warsaw, Cambridge (England). With the push of Bolshevism, Fascism, and Nazism through Europe, many of these European thinkers migrated to America. Rigorous reconsideration in this country of the assump tions underlying science, and the social order in which it had flourished, was stimulated by their coming. The process is reflected in the cosmopolitan composition of this Colloquium on the topic "Evidence and Inference." Only in prepar ing for publication was it realized that four of the five articles were</page><page sequence="3">Preface 5 prepared by persons reared in Europe. Two are Viennese who re ceived their higher education in Vienna, Paris, and Cambridge ( at M.I.T.); one was born in Germany of Danish parentage and was trained in Vienna; one is French, with post-doctoral training in Ger many. The rich Continental heritage of the five very different fields represented is indicated by this unexpected European confluence on a set of core problems in scientific concept and method. While these contributions reveal the diversity of researches in progress in the several fields of academic work, they are unified by attention in each case to the classic concern of evidence and inference. Ancient philosophy attacked these problems through dialectical analysis of the nature of knowledge (epistemology) and of the material known (ontology), with logic codifying the formal rules of rational discourse. Modern European thinking reshaped these concerns over the past century in the image of a probabilistic universe, in which verifiable knowledge tends to be experimental, quantitative, and subject to a factor of "human error" that must enter into the calculus. This bespeaks, despite our devoted tracing of intellectual lineages from the ancient Athenians, a new environ ment for the modern theory of knowledge. The newness is exempli fied in two modes of empirical inquiry?statistical and psychological ?which did not exist in Talmudic Israel or Socratic Athens.4 Consider the disciplines represented in this Colloquium. We begin with history and law (Aron and Hart-McNaughton), matters in which the ancients were highly sophisticated; we conclude with nuclear physics (Deutsch), which was unknown to them. In the middle are psychoanalysis and social psychology, which deal with matters familiar to the Greeks but by unheard-of concepts and methods. Between Sophocles' dramatic Oedipus theme and Erikson s clinical Oedipus complex, between Socrates' commentary on Athenian opinion and Lazarsfeld's methodology of attitude research, there intervene many transformations of intellectual climate, of which the most decisive is the scientific transformation in the past few centuries. As Kirtley Mather has put it: "To understand aright the revolution which has been accomplished in the minds of thoughtful men during the last few generations, one must compre hend the fact that the world of the pre-scientific age was utterly different from our world."5 A hallmark of scientific thinking is the quest for regularities underlying diverse events, invariants accounting for variable be</page><page sequence="4">6 D dalus havior. By this criterion, our Colloquium divides into two groups. The first three papers deal, in a modern framework, with problems well understood in the pre-scientific age, problems of the particular case and the personal judgment. The investigator's task is to assemble the relevant evidence and then to judge whether the array means A or B: true or false, innocent or guilty, well or ill. The historian, the judge, the physician follow methodological procedures that hinge upon a common characteristic: their personal judgment must play the decisive role in assembling the evidence, drawing the inference, and formulating the conclusion in each case they consider. The judge is, and must be, involved in the events whose meaning he judges. This is the nature of the clinical situation. As Erikson says: "The clinician, . . . appointed to judge the bit of interrupted life put before him . . . finds himself part of another man's most intimate life history." Aron, in turn, tells us that the historian "seeks to recognize himself among his ancestors or, conversely, to take account of what he is by discovering what others have been." Hart and McNaughton, in unraveling the skein of "adjudicative" and "legis lative" facts from which legal decisions are woven, show us why introspection is organic to clinical inquiry. The clinician must decide single "cases" rather than, like the scientist, establish regularities among diverse events (with only limited liability for the "case" in which any event occurs ). The authors of these three papers are keenly aware of this common bond between their disciplines. Aron likens the historian's role to that of the juge d'instruction, the man whose personal judgment is decisive in a court of inquiry. Hart and McNaughton, dealing with adjudicative facts as historical facts, point out the many technical traditions designed to safeguard the personal and introspective component of the judicial decision. Thus, the long tradition of "excluded evidence" (hearsay, opinion) reflect "the fear that the evidence will be given too much weight." And "expert testimony" may be disregarded solely because of the judge's "lack of a sense of competence in dealing with it." These papers clarify the acute methodological problem of the "probability of a single case."6 How can the method evolved to investigate a probabilistic universe of recurrent events in science be adapted to the adjudication of historical "cases," singular and non-recurrent. Aron formulates the historian's problem sharply and</page><page sequence="5">Preface 7 suggests that, given the nature of his material, probability methods can have only limited utility for historical logic. Hart and Mc Naughton point out that, neither certainty nor consistency being required by the court, even "the probabilities are determined in a most subjective and unscientific way." Especially interesting is their observation on judicial exclusion of statistical evidence: "The court somehow feels more comfortable permitting a finding to be based on eye-witness testimony even though the probative value of such testimony is itself determined ultimately by home-spun 'statistics' in the mind of the triers of fact and ... is probably no more indica tive of the truth than the [statistical] evidence." Erikson sees the clinical situation in somewhat closer relation to the probabilistic universe of scientific method. The psychoanalyst is not confined, Uke the historian and the judge, to past events. While his aim is to diagnose a life history, he can base his recon struction of the past upon a continuous series of observations in the present. These permit ". . . the gradual establishment of strategic intersections on a number of tangents that eventually makes it possible to locate in the observed phenomena that central core which comprises the 'evidence.'" Moreover, the psychoanalyst, again unlike the historian and the judge, works with a comprehensive, and more or less unified, theory. This codifies clinical procedures (the making, classifying, and interpreting of observations) suffi ciently, in Erikson's judgment, to conclude that ". . . there is enough method in our work systematically to force favorite assumptions to become probable inferences. . . ." The first group of papers thus carries us through the common problems and divergent procedures of the clinical mode of inquiry. The core methodological concern, for historian, jurist, and physician, is how to use the partial regularities disclosed by scientific investi gation to fortify, without overpowering, the introspective element needed to make net judgments on particular cases. The second group of papers reverses this epistemological problem with quite different consequences for scientific concept and method. What Lazarsfeld and Deutsch share is a common confidence in the probabilistic universe of science and a common concern that our introspective or intuitive insights should be worthy of the powerful apparatus of scientific inquiry. Thus, as Erikson leads us out of the dialectical universe of dis course via the acknowledgment of probability, so Lazarsfeld leads</page><page sequence="6">8 Daedalus us into the scientific universe via the problem of aggregation. How to match available units of observation with desired units of inter pretation is the problem set by Lazarsfeld. Or, in terms of the problems posed by Hart and McNaughton, what regularities of guilt can be deterrnined that will enable a judge to decide better (with lower chances of error) whether a particular defendant in a particular "case" is guilty or not? What regularities of power can be established, to take Aron's problem, that will enable an historian to decide whether a particular nation is strengthening or weakening? Martin Deutsch moves us from the problematics of research on human behavior to the simple elegance of nuclear physics?often considered the apex of scientific inquiry today?where research on the physical universe is compromised only by the human behavior of the experimenter. But to this bit of behavior, Deutsch attributes a very large role: "The decisive intuition of the experimenter is really the ability to recognize relevance in the evidence presented by the experiment." Intuition, in this usage, differs significantly from the decisive introspection of the historian-jurist-clinician. First, the physicist's intuition may determine the originality of his experiments, but it does not literally "decide" their outcome. The validity and relia bility of experimental results are decided by objective canons which are quite independent of the experimenter's intuition. Intuition, in this sense, counts more for the experimenter than for the experiment. Moreover, the physicist's intuition operates mainly on data which he himself creates. Whether Napoleon lost his reserves of power in Russia, whether John Doe robbed Richard Roe, whether the patient under observation hated his father?these are questions concerning past events that occurred once and for all, and no data can be "created" that will answer them. Whether velocity increases with pressure given constant temperature, whether the rate of learning decreases with age for a group of persons of the same sex? these are questions concerning a regularity in recurrent events, and data can be created to test these relationships in any time or place. The quest for regularities and the capacity to create its own data differentiate scientific from historico-clinical methodology. They underlie the tendency in scientific work toward abstraction and generalization. Hence, while jurists feel most comfortable with "eye-witness testimony," physicists are less deferential to sheer observation?as Deutsch puts it, to "methods which give the illusion</page><page sequence="7">Preface 9 of direct sensory perception of the events involved." Nor does Lazarsfeld find such methods especially helpful on problems of aggregation. The lessened scientific reUance on sensory observation does not, however, reflect any "dehumanization of science." On the contrary, and in ways that are not at all paradoxical, the second group of papers reveals a great reliance on the percipient person. But they require from him more than sharp sight or keen hearing. The valuable observer, for scientific purposes, works with a large intel lectual context for his perceptions. His intuition is a high-gain, wide-range radar, alert to all significant cues in his environment. Lazarsfeld speaks of this quaUty as "the image" with which the scientific worker goes about his analytic chores. Deutsch speaks of the "anthropomorphic image" which guides the experimenter's choice of research design. These variant expressions give the percipient person his large and indispensable place in even the most rigorous procedures of modern science. Introspection enjoys a major assignment, but it is instrumental and not merely self indulgent. Introspection helps to close the gap between the body of evidence assembled and the inference drawn from this evidence. Closing this gap is the meaning of rigor. Introspection is then rewarded, in appropriate scientific manner, by being called into question and subjected to test. * * * These papers originally were delivered as lectures in the first Hayden Colloquium of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sponsored by the new graduate program in poUtical and social science, with the support of Dean John E. Burchard of the School of Humanities and Social Studies, the Hayden Colloquium explores the common intellectual concerns of the arts and sciences. The present set of papers reconsiders the classic methodological problems of evidence and inference in the Ught of contemporary research. Future sessions of the Hayden Colloquium will set in a contemporary framework other classic problems of methodology; the topic scheduled for 1958-1959 is "Quantity and Quality." REFERENCES 1.
