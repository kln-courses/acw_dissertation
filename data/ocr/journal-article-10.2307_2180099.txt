<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS The Nature of the Physical World. By A. S. EDDINGTON. New York, The-Macmillan Co., I928. PP. xvii, 36i. There are two quite different methods of approach to the philo- sophical implications of physical science. One is to ascertain what a physical description cannot tell us about the world and to indicate what a curious and paradoxical affair it would be if it attempted the im- possible. The other is more difficult and distinctly more rare. It would consist in trying to show what physics, for example, can tell us about the features of events with which its methods and instruments qualify it to deal, and it might even lead to the conclusion that, with reference to its own appropriate objects, its conclusions are natural, believable, and as reliable as anything is likely to be in this uncertain world. Professor Eddington's Gifford lectures belong to the long series of essays whose theme is determined by the first of these methods of approach. His scientific knowledge and quite exceptional powers of exposition give the result a wide contemporary appeal. Philosophically the standpoint is very nearly that of James Ward's Naturalism and AAgnosticsLm or the second volume of Royce's The World and the Individual. And the answer of all three to the question inspired by the bequest of the late Lord Gifford seems, given the question, very nearly inescapable. Science cannot tell us anything about the absolute reality of things. Viewed as an attempt to provide such information its re- sults are abstract, arbitrary, highly paradoxical. 'Reality' is absolute and self-contained; the most elementary knowledge of physical meas- urements will demonstrate their essential relativity. 'Reality' is con- crete; the structures of mathematical analysis are incurably abstract. 'Reality' is total and fully determinate; the 'world' of the exact scientist is partial and exclusive of much that we know to be real. Professor Eddington has offered entertaining and novel examples of this perennial duality between the 'world of description' and the 'world of appreciation' but the main point was clear enough in advance. If there is still someone who believes that physical science is capable of providing him with a full, concrete and exhaustive account of the sum total of 'reality' he may now refer to The Nature of the Phy~sical World and learn to moderate his expectations. Yet neither the title nor the tone of this book limits its pretensions 502</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 503 to this conventional and innocuous endeavor. Rather do they suggest that we are to regard the results of this analysis as an adequate de- scription of what science does in fact take the physical world to be, and to suppose that what would be the properties of scientific conclu- sions if they were futile and inappropriate attempts to qualify some ulterior absolute are in fact their necessary nature. And that is hardly legitimate. It is true that space-time is not the answer to the riddle of the universe. It is equally true that Calvin Coolidge is not the grandson of Queen Victoria. And if either assertion seems pertinent. let it be made. But if one had started with the assumption that our former chief executive was essentially a pretender to the suggested relationship, that his political significance depended upon it and that his various activities were to be interpreted as futile attempts to work himself into the royal family, the discovery that he has in fact no such connections would take on the nature of an expose. Now Professor Eddington writes persistently as though not being metaphysical entities was the salient and distinctive character of the objects of physical science. Viewed in this light their own reputable and effective prop- erties do in fact appear highly paradoxical. But it is equally true that if Mr. Coolidge were an aspirant for the British crown his accent would be somewhat anomalous. Yet it remains a perfectly natural and understandable characteristic of a citizen of New England. Now there have been, of course, those who tried to claim for physics the kind of significance which Professor Eddington rightly denies to it. So far the amusing account of the rather ludicrous ineptness of theoretical physics in such a r6le is a legitimate reductio ad absurdurn. But really one should not take his own reductio seriously, or suppose that the distortion introduced into the physical world by a false per- spective of its purport and aspirations is actually its essential nature. And here our author, like so many of his predecessors, has made his most serious mistake. Denouncing materialism as a conclusion, he has persistently assumed it as a premise. Hence he has fathered upon the physical world itself the errors incident to the antecedent misrepre- sentation of its nature. Small wonder that on such a basis this 'world' proves to be a mere appearance. Even less wonder that physical analysis, thus portrayed as a curiously arbitrary attempt to achieve the impossible, should be even less adequate than its more congenial and mystical alternatives. On page 282 we read that "the crudest an- thropomorphic image of a spiritual deity can scarcely be so wide of the truth as one conceived in terms of metrical equations." Quite so. But the crudest anthropomorphic image of a spiritual deity may flatly</page><page sequence="3">504 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIX. contradict the evidence of physics or physiology as to the nature and operation of the processes of growth and decay, of life and death. And to suggest, even indirectly, that on this point the 'physical world' is somehow less real or reliable than the uncontrolled speculations of the mystic, is to misrepresent both science and reality. That Professor Eddington has designedly attempted any such misrepresentation I do nct at all suggest. But that he has fallen a victim to the traditional nineteenth century prejudice that the 'philosophy of science' is the picture derived from contrasting absolute reality with this meager manifestation of its nature, and that to discern what is wrong with this picture is at the same time to understand and to discredit the literal validity of scientific conclusions, I do most definitely assert. The result is an excellent picture of the conflict between such a method of approach to the physical world and the actual structure of the world it attempts to describe. That it presents anything approaching an accurate account of that world in its actual operations, or of the validity of physical science, is fairly clearly not the case. J propose in the remainder of this review to consider three out- standing instances of this type of argument. The book itself is by this time so familiar and favorite a weapon in the hands of those who for one or many reasons would discredit the literal adequacy of physical science with respect to those objects with which it actually deals, that there is no need to summarize its contents or to outline its arguments. We are concerned rather with the justice of the picture it presents of the philosophical meaning of the 'physical world'. That such meaning depends far less upon the up to date science than on the antiquated philosophy of the author is what remains to be shown. And in that connection the following considerations are, I believe, enlighten- ing. (a) What Professor Eddington refers to as "the problem of the elephant " is an excellent example of the whole procedure. It is to be proved that the 'physical world' is a mere aggregate of 'pointer readings' and hence a very poor substitute for the solid reality of our more intimate experiences. Consider the following. An elephant is sliding down a grassy slope. What does physics ask us to believe about this transaction? Being primarily interested in rather mundane features of the situation we proceed to weigh the elephant. " Now we are getting down to business; the elephant fades out of the problem and a mass of two tons takes its place " (page 25I). But in the name of common sense, why? Need the elephant necessarily disappear be- cause we have found out how much it weighs ? The answer is metai,</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 505 physical. We want to know what two tons is and we cannot say that an elephant is two tons. All we know is what we read by the pointer. Hence if we were to assume that the total event could be or should be reduced to the terms of our description so that it ceased to be a descrip- tion of anything at all, this strange conclusion would follow. But it does not follow from the weight of the elephant or from anything else that can be scientifically ascertained about it. It follows only from a bad philosophy of science which identifies physical happenings with the most general terms in which they can be described. That theory is false, as our author is well aware. But that it is or need be involved in any calculation involving the weight of the elephant in question is simply not the case. Again. We discover that the slope of the hill is 6o degrees. " Now the hillside fades out of the problem and the angle of 6o degrees takes its place" (loc. cit.). And so on. All that need be scientifically ascertainable in this transaction are the physically determinable properties of the entities in question. No physicist need for a moment assume that there are no other features of the event, nor is there the slightest reason to deny their poetic or even mystical significance. There may be bees and buttercups on the hill, the elephant may be acutely unhappy or jovially amused by its escapade; there is nothing whatever in the account to deny it. Of course, if we transformed physics into an attempt to plumb the metaphysical realities, whatever was here irrelevant would indeed " fade out of the picture." But in fact we do nothing of the sort. The elephant is no less an elephant because we have weighed him nor is the slope inscrutable because it has been measured. The only transformation that has gone on here is in the mind of a rather mid-Victorian scientist who clings to materialism even while he disowns it. And the 'physical world' which is the outcome of this distortion is in all truth subjective. That need not be denied. But it is not the world in which elephants have weight and slide down slopes and therefore it is not the physical world which science measures. (b) The very surprising results of the quantum theory seem to Professor Eddington of obvious philosophical importance. And here again there is the widest possible gulf between physical procedure and philosophical conclusion. We seem to have good reason to believe that in the measurement of microscopic phenomena our powers of exact specification are definitely limited. For example under some circum- stances it is impossible precisely to determine the position of a moving electron. Heisenberg has indicated the physical grounds for this incapacity of ours. It follows that beyond certain general limits we</page><page sequence="5">506 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIX. do not know where the electron is. It is indeterminate relatively and with respect to our powers of measurement. So much is clear. Now if we assumed that such measurable determination was exclusive and absolute it would follow that what was not thus determinate was absolutely undetermined, that it had no position at all. And so here. "The suggestion is that an association of exact position with exact momentum can never be discovered by us because there is no such thing in nature" (page 225). What such an intrinsically indetermi- nate entity would be is naturally hard to conceive, but that is hardly surprising. It might bear an analogy to will, as our author suggests. In that unspecified state it might indeed bear an analogy to almost any- thing. It leads to the strange notion of a "probability entity" and we are entertained with the notion of "'probably here" or "probably there" as the physical state of a moving electron. In one of his earlier stories Don Marquis recounted the life history of " Probably Arboreal " whom he had discovered to be named by scientists as among our earliest ancestors. The probability entity here described, inter- preted not as a mathematical device but as a physical condition, de- serves a place in the same category. It is apparent, I think, that materialism is the indispensable premise for this absolute indeterminism. Only with respect to a completely exhaustive and absolute set of meas- ures could indetermination be interpreted as an intrinsic condition of certain physical processes. When absolute determinism is surrendered, absolute indeterminism goes with it. (c) Most striking of all is the description of the selective power of the mind in determining the specific content of the physical world. Our author shows quite clearly that the self-inclosed nature of any physical structure must remain indeterminate with respect to the more detailed aspects of experience. Being compatible with any one, of a number of mutually exclusive possibilities, it naturally cannot choose between them, for precisely the same reason that the dictum that two and two are four is not in itself adequate to determine whether the entities added shall be flesh, fish or fowl. And again, if we identified the physical world as an order of events with the most abstract terms of its description, it would follow that there was nothing in the physical world to determine the choice between these alternatives. Now enters " the mind ", which, 'for its own reasons ", specifies what further char- acters this reality is to have. " Not once in the dim past, but con- sciously by conscious mind is the miracle of Creation wrought " (page 241). Mr. Santayana has referred ironically to the Old Testament idea of creation by " a vehement Jehovah swimming about in chaos."</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 507 Our author's account rivals the Biblical one in pictorial grandeur. But is not this mind itself a part of the natural world which it is sup- posed to create? Has it not organs, bodily limitations and antecedent conditions? On this theory it has not, since its organs are for physics mere measure numbers, its bodily dimensions indefinitely variable at the whim of an imaginative astronomer in search of a convenient measure system, and the permanence of its conditions mere shadows cast by the preferential slant of its own descriptive aspirations. What would a bio-chemist or a geologist have to say to such a world? There are other sciences than mathematical physics and other objectively determinable features of the physical world than those of Einstein's most general equations. Nor is there anything in mathematical physics itself to deny or subordinate these further aspects. So long as de- scriptive scientists are concerned about their own affairs they rarely imagine that the necessary limits of their attention in a given field of inquiry are also the furthermost boundaries of reality, which then requires some supernatural agency to reproduce in it what their own selective attention has eliminated. But once the 'philosophical' ques- tion is raised the bad metaphysics which these same scientists learned years ago takes control of the situation and forces them to portray their achievements to the general public as though they were excursions toward the ultimate. When both the scientist and the general public become aware of the futility of this procedure without yet seeing that it is also quite unnecessary and irrelevant to the genuine veracity of scientific conclusions, the way is open for the curious attempt to objectify this futility as if it were the philosophical meaning of the physical world itself. And that, in substance, seems to me to be what Professor Eddington has done. There are, then, two physical worlds for this philosophy. One is the battered and shopworn heritage of a discredited metaphysics. No one really believes in it as a fact, but there are still those who appear to believe in it as the essential philosophical interpretation of scientific conclusions. The task of revealing its inadequacies is still open to those who take it seriously enough to view the issue as a vital one. But there is another physical world, and it is the one with which physics, like all the other natural sciences, tries to deal. It is a world of unavoidable and insistent happenings, and it conditions the life and thinking even of very specialized mathematicians. About this world we know very little, far less than our predecessors imagined. In physics, however, we have found a means of discovering some of its more general features, and this process of discovery stands as some- 33</page><page sequence="7">508 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [Vort XXXIX. thing of a model for careful and honest thinking about matters of fact. The facts disclosed are relational, limited, incomplete. But they are facts for all that, and any whimsical or mystical insight which con- tradicted these facts would almost certainly so far be wrong. And since there are many such insights which do contradict these facts, there is a great eagerness to prove that our views about the origin and physical limits of life, for example, are less true than they appear to be. If Professor Eddington believes that this world can be subordi- nated to the dictates of " mind-spinning " and the insights of any type of supernaturalism, he has certainly not proved his case. Rather has he raised in the hearts of many wishful men a set of expectations which the course of events is not likely to fulfil. And to suppose that his point can be proved by substituting for this occurrent reality the 'physical world' of metaphysical materialism and applying to objective events the strictures only valid against a false theory about them, is to commit a rather serious fallacy. This fallacy, I believe, is at the root of many of the more exciting conclusions of this book. ARTHUR E. MURPHY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.</page></plain_text>
