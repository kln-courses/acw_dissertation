<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Priori Arguments from God's Abstractness RICHARD M. GALE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH There is a neglected but nevertheless interesting type of a priori argu- ment for it being necessary that God exists that is based upon the conception of God as an abstract entity, i.e., an entity which logically could not exist in either space or time.1 What is distinctive about these arguments is that they employ some premise that is such that the argument works only if it expresses a necessary truth about abstract entities. Four different specimens of this type of argument will be critically considered-St. Anselm's argument in Part I of his response to Gaunilon, along with Malcolm's two variations on it in his 'Anslem's Ontological Argument,' plus a simplified ver- sion of my own that clearly brings out the essence of these arguments. It will be shown that all four face the objection that their alleged necessary truth about abstract entities is question-begging. Further- more, each of the four arguments will be shown to be uncompelling by construction of a parallel argument that contains its alleged necessary truth about abstract entities and other premises that are no less plausible than those of the original but whose conclusion is logically incompatible with that of the original. And, for good measure, it will be argued that there are independent reasons for thinking it false that it is necessary that God exists and thus for holding suspect any argument which has this proposition as its conclusion. I. The Arguments Anslem writes: I insist, however, that simply if it can be thought it is necessary NOUS 20 (1986): 531-543 ?1986 by Nou's Publications 531</page><page sequence="2">532 NOUS that it exists. For 'that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought' can- not be thought save as being without a beginning. But whatever can be thought as existing and does not actually exist can be thought as having a beginning of its existence. Consequently, 'that-than- which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought' cannot be thought as existing and yet not actually exist. If, therefore, it can be thought as existing, it exists of necessity.2 This is a subtle and beautiful argument; but it cannot be fully ap- preciated, no less shown to be valid, until it is translated into the logistical form of contemporary modal logic. The argument attempts to prove that if 'that-than-which-a- greater-cannot-be-thought' (to be abbreviated as 'God') can be thought, then God exists of necessity. It takes the form of a condi- tional proof in which we begin with the assumption of the antece- dent proposition, which will be understood as: 1. It is possible that God exists. Two premises are then added. Both are intended as necessary truths, as they must be if Anselm is to be allowed to use them in his at- tempt to deduce from 1 that God 'exists of necessity,' which is to be rendered as: C. It is necessary that God exists. The first says that God 'cannot be thought save as being without a beginning,' which will be represented as: 2. It is not possible that God begins. That God cannot have a beginning in time is a logical consequence of Anselm's conception of God as an abstract entity. Following the Boethian-Augustinian conception of God's eternality as involving timelessness rather than everlastingness or omnitemporality, Anselm rightly deduces that it is not possible that God begin to exist; for, were He to do so, He would begin in time and thus be in time. The second added premise, also assumed to be necessary, is sup- posed to hold, or at any rate must hold if the argument is to suc- ceed, for every abstract entity. It says that 'whatever can be thought as existing and does not actually exist can be thought as having a beginning.' In accordance with the above way of understanding 'can be thought,' this will be paraphrased as: 3. It is necessary that, for any x, if it is possible that x exists and x does not exist, then it is possible that x begins. From 1-3 we are supposed to deduce C, at which point we can close the scope of our initial assumption 1 and deduce that if 1 then C. And since Anselm's opponent is supposed to grant him the truth of 1, C can be deduced by modus ponens. To show that C is entailed by 1-3 it is necessary to translate 1-3 into a Lewisian-style modal logical form and make use of the</page><page sequence="3">GOD'S ABSTRACTNESS 533 axioms of both S4 and S5. The following is the needed translation and argument. Anselm's Argument 1. MGod exists3 Assumption for Conditional Proof 2. -MGod begins Necessary Truth 3.

MGod exists D LGod exists 1-13x Conditional Proof Notice that if the material implication in 3 is not itself necessary, it can only be deduced that if it is possible that God exists, then God exists. And this isn't a bad day's work. The need to appeal to the axioms of S4 and S5 should not cause serious concern, since what they collectively say is that a proposition's modality is invariant among possible worlds; and I see no reason for doubting this. Norman Malcolm's two variations on Anselm's Argument are directed against an opponent who says that although nothing could prevent God from existing it nevertheless is the case that God's existence is contingent in that it both is possible that God exists and possible that He does not. In the first argument, he replies that 'from the supposition that it could happen that God did not exist it would follow that, if He existed, He would have mere dura-</page><page sequence="4">534 NOUS tion and not eternity, '4 which, I assume, is meant to be a substitu- tion instance of a necessary universal truth. This consequence, however, is absurd, since we conceive of God's eternality as excluding 'as senseless all sentences that imply that He has duration.'5 This argument can be explicitly formulated as an indirect proof that attempts to deduce a contradiction from the supposition that it is possible that God does not exist. Malcolm's First Argument 15. M-God exists Supposition for Indirect Proof 16. MGod exists Granted by Malcoln's Opponent 17. L(x)[M-x exists D x exists D x has duration)] Necessary Truth 18.

MGod exists and -MGod exists 16,24x Conjunction 26. -M-God exists 15-25x Indirect Proof In this argument we again find the two essential ingredients of the special type of a priori argument under consideration in this paper. It contains a premise-22-that is a logical consequence of the conception of God as an abstract entity, and another premise- 17-which must hold necessarily for abstract entities if the argument is to be sound. Both of these ingredients are also found in Malcolm's second argument. If God.. .does not exist then He cannot come into existence. For if He did He would either have been caused to come into existence or have happened to come into existence, and in either case He would be a limited being, which by our conception of Him He is not. Since He cannot come into existence, if He does not exist His existence is impossible. If He does exist He cannot have come into existence (for the reasons given), nor can He cease to exist, for nothing could cause Him to cease to exist nor could it just happen that He ceased</page><page sequence="5">GOD'S ABSTRACTNESS 535 to exist. So if God exists His existence is necessary. Thus God's existence is either impossible or necessary. It can be the former only if the concept of such a being is self-contradictory or in some way logically absurd. Assuming that this is not so, it follows that He necessarily exists.6 This very complex argument can be shown to be valid without the use of either S4 or S5, though to do so is a tedious process which is left to the Appendix. While this argument is far more complex than its two predecessors, it is of a piece with them. Each of these arguments contains a premise that is either identical with or a close cousin of one of its premises. This argument's premise 46.L(x)[(x does not exist and Mx exists D Mx comes into existence]7 appears to be identical with Anselm's premise 3. L(x)[(Mx exists and x does not exist) D Mx begins] assuming that 'come into existence' means the same as 'begin.' Also, its premise 56. L(x)[(x exists and Mx does not exist) D Mx begin or cease to exist] is a close cousin of Malcolm's First Argument's premise 17. L(x)][Mx does not exist D (x exists D x has duration)] agreeing in their antecedents when exportation is applied to 17 and differing only slightly in their consequents. What is common to all four propositions, which will become evident as we proceed, is that they are true only if no abstract entity can have a contingent existence. Before showing why this requirement is question-begging, it will be helpful to construct a simplified version of these three arguments which makes this requirement explicit.

Some Objections The first objection to be lodged against all four arguments is that each contains as a premise an alleged necessary truth that is question- begging. The conception of a question-begging argument is a dialec- tical one, since it concerns what propositions the opponent of the argument is willing to concede prior to the presentation of the argu- ment. Not every valid deductive argument will be question-begging. The valid argument that Socrates is mortal because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man will beg the question only if the per- son to whom it is directed initially rejects either of its premises. What is the dialectical context of our four arguments? What are the prior beliefs of the opponent of these arguments? The oppo- nent is characterized by Malcom as having the prior belief that God is a contingent being-that 'it might just happen that He did not exist.'8 When this belief is combined with the opponent's prior ac- ceptance of the Anselm-Malcolm conception of God as an abstract entity, it becomes clear that he will not grant premises 27, 3, 17 and 56; for he could offer God Himself as a counter-example to each of them. He can offer his abstract but contingent God as a counter- example to 27's claim that necessarily every abstract entity is either a necessary or impossible being. And exactly the same counter- example can be offered to 3, 17, and 56. Given his prior belief in the contingency and abstractness of God's existence, he would say that there is a possible set of circumstances under which their antecedents are true and consequents false. For 3 it involves a possible world, W1, in which God might exist but does not, and for 17 and 56 a possible world, W2, in which God exists but might not. But in neither W1 nor W2 is it possible for God to begin (or cease) or have duration. Thus, 3 is false in Wi and 17 and 56 false in W2. And since these propositions are supposed to be necessary-true in every possible world-all three are false. Against such an opponent, an Anselm or Malcolm must mount an argument to show that there is a logical inconsistency in the conception of an abstract contingent God. But they cannot, without begging the question, use their above arguments to accomplish this. In the opening sentence of this paper it was said that their arguments have largely been neglected. I think we can now see why. It is because they are blatantly question-begging. There is yet another way to discredit these arguments: show that for each of them there is a parallel argument that contains its alleged necessary truth about abstract entities-27, 3, 17, or 56-and other premises that are no less plausible than those of the original</page><page sequence="7">GOD'S ABSTRACTNESS 537 but whose conclusion is logically incompatible with that of the original.9 To do this we only need form the concept of a Greatest Conceivable Abstract Demon or devil, which will be abbreviated as 'GCAD,' also short for greatest conceivable cad. In addition to being non-spatial and non-temporal the GCAD will also be om- nipotent, omniscient, and, most important, providential. Of course, it will be malevolent, which is the only property which distinguishes it from God. When each of our four arguments is reformulated in terms of the GCAD in place of God there results an argument whose premises are no less plausible than those of the original (since it seems just as possible that our GCAD exists as that God does) but whose conclusion is logically incompatible with that of the original. Since all these arguments are valid, these parallel arguments render the premises of the original arguments dubious, in particular premises 27, 3, 17, and 56. It might be questioned why it is logically impossible for both God and the GCAD to exist. It is not because there would exist two omnipotent beings, but rather because there would exist two providential beings. A providential being completely and uniquely determines every feature of any world in which it exists which is such that it is logically consistent that this being completely and uniquely determines it. Thus, if two providential beings existed in a given world, each would completely and uniquely determine everything in that world which it is consistent for either one of them alone completely and uniquely to determine, thereby resulting in the contradiction that some things in this world are both completely and uniquely determined and not completely and uniquely deter- mined by one of the two providential beings. The only way to block this refutation is to argue that it is not possible for a being to have one of the divine perfections without having all of them. I know of no such argument that is at all plausi- ble, let alone convincing. It is interesting to note that even if such an argument could be produced, it would not save Anselm's Argument and Malcolm's Second Argument from refutation by a parallel argument that uses the concept of an omnitemporal God in place of that of a timeless God. There are two different ways of understanding God's eter- nality. So far we have been concerned with the platonic interpreta- tion, common to Boethius, Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Schleier- macher and Malcolm of eternality as timelessness. But the Bible, along with the Nicene Creed and most Protestant theologians, under- stand eternality as everlastingness or endurance throughout a time that is infinite in both its past and future extent. The God who is "religiously available" to ordinary believers-the personal God-</page><page sequence="8">538 NOUS also is conceived of in this omnitemporal manner. Malcolm could not consistenly attack the intelligibility or viability of this omnitem- poral conception of God. For he defends the viability of his timeless conception of God on the grounds that this conception enters into language-games that are actually played. But exactly the same can be said, only more so, in behalf of the omnitemporal conception of God.10 And I know of no acceptable argument to show that the greatest conceivable omnitemporal being is less great than the greatest conceivable timeless being. Anselm's Argument and Malcolm's Second Argument work equally well for the greatest conceivable omnitemporal being."I But, then, we again wind up with incompatible conclusions, this time between a providential timeless God and a providential omnitem- poral God. And don't try to get out of this problem by appeal to the doctrine of the Trinity. For this is supposed to be a mystery, and thus cannot be used to save a piece of rational theology, such as the arguments of Anselm and Malcolm. Again, the moral to be drawn is that the premises, in particular 3 and 56, of the original arguments are suspect. And since 3 and 56 are of a piece with premise 17 in Malcolm's First Argument in that the same sort of metaphysical intuitions which lead one to accept or reject one of the former do likewise for the latter, it also renders this argument uncompelling. Yet another way to discredit our four arguments is to show that their conclusion that necessarily God exists, when combined with the widely held view of God as essentially omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent and providential, is logically incompatible with proposi- tions that we ordinarily take to be possible, e.g. that there is morally unjustified evil, i.e. evil which is not attributable to some finite person's use of or failure to use his free will and is not necessary for the realization of some greater good or the prevention of some greater evil, and that every significantly free person always freely does what is morally wrong. Because God exists in and is omnipotent and benevolent in every possible world, it is clear why in no possible world is there morally unjustified evil, contra our common belief that it is possible for such evil to exist. The route to showing that the necessary existence of this kind of God renders it impossible that every free person always freely does what is wrong is more circuitous. The demonstration, again, begins with the premise that God exists in and is providential, omniscient and benevolent in every possible world. Since God can consistently determine that there are free persons, in every world in which there are free persons this is determined by God. Moreover, because God is omniscient, He has "middle knowledge" which allows</page><page sequence="9">GOD'S ABSTRACTNESS 539 Him to know in every possible world what every possible free per- son would do in that world in every possible free choice situation. But, since God also is benevolent, in any possible world in which God knows that every possible free person would go wrong in every possible free choice situation God would prevent this morally hor- rendous situation from happening by electing not to actualize any free person. And, therefore, contra our common belief, there is no possible world in which every free person always freely does what is wrong. It is not claimed that our common beliefs in the possibility of there being morally unjustified evil and of every person always freely going wrong are true, only that they are to be respected until good reason is given not to. And the above arguments, as argued, fail to do so. The obvious way to try to reconcile these two common beliefs with the possibility of God having necessary existence is to deny that God is essentially benevolent, as many have done. Thereby, it could be said that although God exists in every possible world He is not benevolent in every one of them; and it is in such a world that the possibilities of morally unjustified evil and every free per- son always freely going wrong are realized.12 But this is not as at- tractive a strategy as it might first appear for the following reasons. (a) First, there is the ad hominem objection that Anselm and Malcolm cannot consistently adopt it. In the later chapters of the Proslogion, Anselm espouses God's essential benevolence. Malcolm's defense of Anselm's second version of the ontological argument- the one that makes use of necessary existence rather than plain old existence as a great-making property-seems to rest on the possibility of the property of having unsurpassable greatness (to use Plantinga's terminology) being instantiated, in which a being has unsurpassable greatness if and only if it has maximal excellence, i.e. omnipotence, providence, omniscence and omnibenevolence, in every possible world. (b) Far more serious than this ad hominem objection is that unless God is conceived of as essentially benevolent the conclusion of the above four arguments is not sufficiently orthodox, failing to establish what traditional theists have wanted to prove, viz. that God exists in and has His maximal excellence-His greatest greatness-in the actual world. The conclusion of these arguments is compatible with God being a thoroughly reprehensible character in the actual world. (c) And since God, by definition, is eminently worshipable since a being of highest value, it raises doubt whether we can properly call this non-benevolent omnipotent, and omniscient being God. It might be prudential to treat this being as a "man of respect" (to</page><page sequence="10">540 NOUS be pronounced with a Sicilian accent), but it would be a farce to worship and adore it. (d) Finally, the usual reason for denying God's essential benevolence-to save His free will by having His choices vary across possible worlds-is weak. First, this variation in God's choices across possible worlds does not require that any of them be non-benevolent. Second, since it is logically impossible that God be subject to any freedom-cancelling constraint of either an external or internal sort, it makes no sense to speak of God as acting or choosing freely. The attempt to apply the concepts of human agency to God is a dangerous piece of anthropomorphism.13 NOTES 'I do not claim that my use of 'abstract entity' is the "official" or even the most common one in the history of philosophy. What is not a mere terminological point is whether an abstract entity in my sense is capable of causal agency and serving as the accusative of propositional attitudes. Peter van Inwagen, in a very penetrating article 'Ontological Arguments' in Nods, Vol. XI, No. 4 (1977), denies that non-spatio-temporal entities such as 'numbers, properties, propositions, sentence-types, sets' can be objects of 'love, hate, worhship... fear.' (p. 380) This seems wrong, since a noun 'that'-clause can properly serve as the accusative of a propositional attitude verb; e.g. I can fear that John is using drugs. Whether an abstract being can be a causal agent is more controversial, but plainly Anselm thought that God both is non-spatio-temporal and capable of timelessly bringing about effects in time. I myself find this conceptually absurd but will let it pass for the purpos of this paper. 2The translation is by M. J. Charlesworth of St. Anselm's Proslogion (Notre Dame: 1979), pp. 169-171. 3'M' and 'L' are monadic operators that abbreviate respectively 'it is logically possi- ble that' and "it is logically necessary that.' Often '(' and 'EL' are used instead of 'M' and 'L'. 4'Anselm's Ontological Argument,' The Philosophical Review, 69 (1960), p. 48. 5Lbid. 6lbid., pp. 49-50. 7The number of this premise corresponds to its number in the Appendix, and likewise for premise 56, which follows. 8Malcolm, op. cit., p. 48. 9My strategy is similar to that adopted by M. Tooley in his counter-argument to Plantigna's new version of the ontological argument in his 'Plantinga's Defense of the Ontological Argument,' Mind XC (1981), p. 425. '0Malcolm's failure to note that such language-games are actually played is due to a failure to take ordinary usage seriously, which is surprising in an "ordinary language" philospher! E.g. in support of his timeless conception of God he appeals on pp. 55-6 of his essay to the Ninetieth Psalm: 'Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou are God.' I have learned a lot from Nelson Pike's insightful discussion of this issue in his God and Timelessness (New York: 1970), especially pp. 183-4. "Malcolm's First Argument does not because its premise 22 says that it is impossible that God have duration. An omnitemporal God, although it can neither begin nor end, does have duration and thereby does not satisfy this premise. 12A way of reconciling the necessary existence of God with the possibility of every person always freely doing what is wrong is to deny that God has middle knowledge, as does Robert M. Adams in 'Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil' in the American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (1977). Herein, God is playing dice in creating free persons since He cannot foreknow what free actions they will perform. I find Adam's argument for deny-</page><page sequence="11">GOD'S ABSTRACTNESS 541 ing middle knowledge to God unconvincing, because it rests on an unacceptable anthropo- morphic demand that God have the same sort of justification for a knowledge-claim as human being could have. But this is a subject for another paper. '3I have profited from exchanges with Shelly Kagan, Peter King, Nicholas Rescher, and Peter van Inwagen.
