<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST unable to identify more than a very meagre account of the Exodus story from this source (a further difference from Van Seters), with no account of the plagues or of any legislation, covenant or theophany at Sinai. It seems to be implied that all other mate- rial (even the "E" passages) is of later origin. The result is a reconstructed narrative which is very much fuller in Genesis than in Exodus. A more detailed study of Levin's theory would need to examine whether it is as well grounded in Exodus as it seems to be in Genesis and whether the arguments he puts forward for an exilic date are really as compelling as he suggests. But this is without doubt a weighty contribution to Pentateuchal study and a refreshing change from the recent tendency to focus on Deuteronomistic contributions to the pre-Priestly Pentateuch. [G.I. DAVIES] L.M. MCDONALD, The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon. 205 pp. Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1988. The character of this book is primarily historical, but the author clearly indicates his view that the canon of Scripture is an unnecessary straightjacket for the Christian Church rather than having any continuing authority. Only the first three chapters deal with the O.T. Ch. 1 makes some reference to "canonical interpre- tation" and its problems; ch. 2 considers the meaning of the key terms "scripture" and "canon". Ch. 3 addresses the major historical issues about the canonization of the O.T. in Judaism and Christianity: McDonald emphasizes the diversity of views about the lim- its of the canon in first-century Judaism, and claims that from the beginning Jesus and the early Christians embraced a canon of Jewish scriptures which was wider than the Hebrew Bible as it is known today. In support of this claim he cites (and adapts) the list of over 150 references or allusions to the deuterocanonical/apocryphal and pseude- pigraphical literature in the N.T. collected by Kurt and Barbara Aland. It is, however, most misleading to overlook the fact that many of the so-called references or allusions are uncertain. For example, at the beginning of the list Matt. iv 4 is said to be a cita- tion from or allusion to Wisdom xvi 26: but it in fact contains an almost verbatim cita- tion of the LXX of Deut. viii 3 introduced by "It is written", whereas Wisdom xvi 26 presents an adaptation and paraphrase of the same verse from Deuteronomy. This is of no relevance at all to how the Wisdom of Solomon was regarded in the earliest Church. The next example (Matt. iv 15 ~ 1 Macc. v 15) is no better. In its reconstruc- tion of the early history of the canon the book is often very speculative and it contains a number of minor errors (for example the inclusion of three Greek biblical manuscripts among the "Lists of Old Testament Books in the Western Churches" on p. 179, where it is also not mentioned that the limited contents of Codex Sinaiticus are due to its being only preserved in part. [G.I. DAVIES] W. McKANE, A Late Harvest: Reflections on the Old Testament. x + 182 pp. T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1995. ?19.95. McKane states in the preface that these "'Reflections' have a relation to the transactions of the Honour seminar on Old Testament Theology which I conducted... in the University of St Andrews and as such they are a con- catenated description of my own Odyssey" (p. vii). Ch. 1 begins with the repetition by Moses Maimonides of "a dictum of earlier Jewish scholars to the effect that 'the Torah speaks in the language of the sons of man"' (p. 1), and with the contrast between the biblical use of anthropomorphic language about God and the philosophical preference for the via negativa when speaking of him. McKane goes on to consider the philosophical ideas of Thomas Aquinas and other thinkers, including in modern times A.M. Farrer (whose name appears as "Farrar"). The discussion goes on in ch. 2 to "the limits which Maimonides places on our knowl- edge of God and the economy which he imposes in making affirmations about God" (p. 23). It comes to a focus on the Israelite prophets whose message purports to be the words of God. "Maimonides has rejected the idea of a God who speaks", and so he seeks to account for prophecy in a way that "excludes supernaturalism" (pp. 40-1). McKane describes and discusses his attempt to solve the problem. Ch. 3 first looks at William Fulke, an Anglican of the late 17th century, who 561</page><page sequence="2">562 BOOK LIST stressed the importance of sound textual criticism and translation of the Bible, and who "expects to arrive ... by an accurate translation of the Bible" at "nothing less than the mind of the Holy Ghost" (p. 43). The views of Calvin and Zwingli in the 16th cen- tury, and those of the Roman Catholic Richard Simon in the 17th (who set against the uncertainties of biblical study the doctrinal authority of his church) are discussed. Chs 4 and 5 consider O.T. criticism and the canonical prophets. A. Kuenen, J. Wellhausen and W. Robertson Smith placed the prophets "at the centre of a process by which the nationalistic limitations of Yahwism were overcome and its advance to the stature of an ethical monotheism, capable of universalization, were achieved" (p. 65). Different views of the development of Israelite religion were expressed by W. Eichrodt and by those who favoured the Myth and Ritual approach. There was, indeed, a sig- nificant difference between the accounts of prophecy given by Kuenen and Smith in that the former denied a supernatural element, but the latter believed in divine inspi- ration. Although Wellhausen had a high regard for Kuenen and did not disagree with much that he said, he thought that "Kuenen was not at home with the canonical prophets" (p. 83). He held that Kuenen's book on the prophets was "more effective in clearing away the debris than it is in reconstruction" and he was "not enamoured of the polemical tone" (p. 84). B. Duhm too, although he rejected older ideas of inspira- tion, did not favour polemic against it, but sought rather to "diminish the emphasis on the doctrine of 'inspiration', to strike out on fresh paths" (p. 88). He contrasted prophets like Amos and Isaiah, who "experienced ecstatic visionary states" (p. 89), with Jeremiah and other later prophets, who did not. Duhm "shifts the investigation to the 'progres- sive revelation' which he perceives in the public domain of history, to the evidences of religious truth and moral seriousness..." (p. 90). Another view which McKane finds unconvincing is that of A.G. Auld, "who proposes to resolve the problem by assuming that these formulae [sc. "These are the words of Yahweh", etc.] are the product of sec- ondary editorial activity" (p. 90). Although Smith agreed with much that Kuenen wrote, especially with his esti- mate of the importance of the prophets and of ethical monotheism, he did not share Kuenen's rejection of "supernaturalism" and could still speak of "revealed truth". Smith said that "the supreme religious thought which fills the prophet's soul, and which comes to him... as a direct intuition of divine truth, an immediate revelation of Jehovah, is developed by the ordinary processes of the intellect" (quoted from Smith on p. 103). Yet McKane thinks that what Smith says "is incompatible with the supposition that he intends 'word of God' literally and is committed to belief in a God who speaks Hebrew into the heart of a prophet" (p. 103). However, "the kind of exploration of prophetic literature whose aim is to investigate how a prophet's words can be both 'word of man' and 'word of God' is not undertaken" (p. 111). McKane devotes chs 6 and 7 to asking what kind of men the canonical prophets were (especially those from Amos to Jeremiah). He considers whether the ways of think- ing then were as different from those of people today as scholars like I. Engnell assert, or whether it is possible to understand them on the basis of our common humanity. He argues that some, at least, of the differences are less great than has been claimed. For example, he claims that much that has been said about the self-fulfilling power of the prophetic word in Israelite belief is "founded on a lexicographical fallacy which [J.] Barr has exposed", namely, that "the spoken word [ddbdr] was also a deed". In fact, ddbdr does not have "'word', 'thing' and 'event' as a compound meaning... but 'word', 'thing' or 'event': different senses which it has in different contexts. In any particular con- text it has only one of these senses" (p. 128). McKane goes on in ch. 7 to consider the view of, for example, J. Lindblom and H. Gunkel that the prophets' teaching was derived from a "revelatory state of mind", involving vision and ecstasy. "The bone which I have to pick with Gunkel and Lindbom is their assumption that literary accounts of visionary experiences serve as a</page><page sequence="3">BOOK LIST 563 basis for a detailed reconstruction of these experiences" (p. 138). He also notes that L. Alonso Schokel (whom he mentions as if his surname were simply "Sch6kel") offers a different account of prophetic experience. McKane will not accept an interpretation of such experience "which creates a divide between the prophet qua man and the prophet qua prophet, and which associates the latter with the onset of special psychological con- ditions which interrupt the normal tenor of his humanity... Moreover, the descriptions which are given of the psychological states of the canonical prophets rest on the inse- cure basis of the accounts which appear in the prophetic literature", and the assump- tion "that these can be taken as transcripts of prophetic experience, whereas the rela- tionship... is much more complicated and problematic" (p. 151). Further, the idea that "the prophets were compelled to prophesy, whether this is interpreted as psychological compulsion... or as coercion by God" is "destructive of human freedom and fail[s] to capture the inner struggle and irreconcilable tensions with which the canonical prophet is riven..." (p. 151). The final chapter considers the hermeneutical method and O.T. theology. McKane discusses G. von Rad's attempt to show that, "though the Old Testament is a collec- tion of ancient books, it, nevertheless, has a relevance for the present and is not impris- oned in antiquity" (p. 154). He notes W. Eichrodt's criticisms of von Rad, but tends to regard them as invalid, and he holds that the "so-called 'existential' exegesis of von Rad confronts a more serious problem of biblical theology than Eichrodt allows or dis- cusses" (p. 163). McKane seeks to relate the "openness of the interpretation of Old Testament texts" to the poetic quality of prophetic poetry, which Alonso Schokel has stressed. A comment made by McKane draws attention to a danger in some modern translations of the Bible: "A plain translation which advertises its ordinariness and sinks into triviality is a failure to render those qualities of Hebrew poetry which invest it with the allusiveness and high seriousness it must possess if it is to carry the weight of the mystery" (p. 165). Further, "if hermeneutical openness is to be advanced as an impor- tant insight in the field of theology, the conservation of the widest possible range of reference at the levels of translation and literary appreciation should not be neglected" (p. 167). He notes, however, a contrast between the "literary openness" of the O.T. and an uncontrolled "charismatic exegesis of Old Testament texts" (p. 167), and also the treatment of the O.T. by R. Bultmann which "demands the destruction" of bibli- cal imagery "as the price of progress" in his "demythologizing hermeneutic" (p. 168). In conclusion, McKane looks again at the theologies of the O.T. by A.B. Davidson and T.C. Vriezen in comparison with the works of von Rad and Alonso Schokel. He welcomes the fact that the last two employ "a new hermeneutical method and both affirm that the exegesis of texts should not be static, that their meaning is open to the future and that their hidden resources can be revealed in subsequent enrichments of meaning" (p. 173). The book ends with indexes of names and subjects, and of biblical references. This is a thought-provoking book, but it demands careful reading if one is to learn what McKane's final judgements are on some of the subjects that he discusses. His principal conclusion is stated in the preface: "that God does not speak Hebrew, that the language of the Old Testament is human language and that, with this in mind, it must be studied like any other literature embedded in ancient documents" (p. x).
