<plain_text><page sequence="1">KEVIN HUTCHINGS Pastoral, Ideology, and Nature in William Blake's Visions of the Daughters of Albion It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer sun And in the vintage &amp; to sing on the wagon loaded with corn. - William Blake, The Four Zoas Superficially, pastoral poetry, in its pleasant myth of rural pleni- tude, seems highly to value the green world of nature; but, as Donald Worster has argued, a strong case can be made for the antithetical view. Discussing Christian pastoral allegory, for instance, Worster observes that the shepherd figure "does not merge with nature through his flock nor is his occupation a protest against urban alien- ation from the natural world. . . . On the contrary, he is the de- fender of the flock against the hostile forces of nature - wolves, li- ons, bears - and his profession is to lead his lambs out of this sorry world to greener pastures" (26). The scenario Worster describes is not inconsistent with the social dynamics informing what Michel Foucault has called "pastoral technology" ("Politics" passim). In Foucaulťs analysis, the "good shepherd" of Christian pastoral, far from allegorizing the selfless protector of a vulnerable human flock, becomes nothing less than an icon of "panoptic" governmental or- der, since his exemplary, ever-watchful behavior encourages indi- viduals to internalize social surveillance in the form of an obedi- ent, law-abiding conscience. And crucially, for Foucault, the con- science is basically anti-corporeal, functioning as the admonishing voice of a soul that effectively imprisons the body, chastising and threatening to punish those who succumb to the animal instincts Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 9.1 (Winter 2002) Copyright © 2002 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">2 ISLE and appetites of physical being ( Discipline 30). Despite the contrast suggested by their respective emphases upon environmental and social contexts, Worster's and Foucaulťs analyses are potentially complementary: both aim to expose and deconstruct pastoral allegory's ideological tendency to devalue the physical aspect of earthly being. By bringing these otherwise diverse critiques into much-needed dialogue, this essay aims to illuminate the complex problem of political resistance in William Blake's Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793). 1 In this poem, the protagonist, Oothoon, attempts to refute the socially and ecologically destructive dual- isms underpinning pastoral technology, opposing the tendency of her antagonist, the ascetic Theotormon, to align human biology with a hostile natural world that must be transcended in the name of an ostensibly liberatory spirituality. Since, in Western thought, access to spirit is generally regarded solely as the prerogative of humans, the dualism underpinning Chris- tian versions of pastoral tends to support an anthropocentric instrumentalization of nature, in which the natural world is seen as a mere forum for the actualization of human spiritual potential. Among other things, this view is consistent with the Judeo-Christian concept of a God-given and all-encompassing human "dominion" over nature (Gen. 1.26-28). In such a context, even the concept of a responsible stewardship over nature grows suspect, revealing beneath its seem- ingly benevolent guise the practical reality of a self-serving "ideologeme."2 It is in The Book ofThel (ca. 1789) - which critics often regard as Visions' s companion poem - that Blake first begins to explore this pastoral instrumentalization of nonhuman nature. Unlike Visions' s Oothoon, who "knows no fixed lot" (5:21), Thel's eponymous protagonist has a definite vocation: she is represented as a shepherd in both poetry and design.3 This aspect of Thel's identity is important, for it colours her view of the natural world in significant ways. Consider, for example, her effusive praise for the Lilly, the first nonhuman creature she encounters in the pastoral Vales of Har: О thou little virgin of the peaceful valley. Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'ertired. Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments, He crops thy flowers, while thou sittest smiling in his face, Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints. Thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume, Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs Revives the milked cow, &amp; tames the fire-breathing steed. (2:3-10; E4)</page><page sequence="3">Pastoral , Ideology , and Nature in William Blake 3 While Thel's encomium for the Lilly seems sincere, it is impor- tant to note that she celebrates this self-proclaimed "watry weed" (1:16) according to the same extrinsic, instrumental criteria that ste- reotype it as a weed in the first place. In other words, she values the Lilly strictly for the useful functions it performs in an explicitly human-centred pastoral economy: the flower is valuable because it nourishes, cleanses, revives, and tames various domesticated ani- mals and insects, each of which ultimately serves its human mas- ters as a source of clothing, food, or agrarian labour. To be sure, Thel embraces a much more expansive concept of utility than those who have taught the Lilly to think of itself as a mere, useless "weed." But because her discourse remains nonetheless firmly entrenched within a use-oriented conceptual paradigm, Thel can articulate no sense of the Lilly's otherness as a non-human creature, no notion of its possible intrinsic value. What is more, Thel goes so far as to imagine the Lilly willingly - indeed "smiling[ly]" - "Giving" its life in the service of the pastoral milieu (since the lamb, the most cen- trally "useful" of all pastoral creatures, will crop its flowers).4 At bottom, Thel's seemingly charming pastoral discourse evinces a rather arrogant domination of the natural world, articulating a view of human-nature relations that accords nicely with the Judeo-Chris- tian concept of human "dominion" over nature, not to mention Enlightenment science's view of the earth as the site of an ever- expanding "Empire of Man over inferior Creatures" (Glanville 188).5 In contrast to Thel, Oothoon articulates a vision of nonhuman nature that tends to unsettle anthropocentric complacency. Consider, for example, Oothoon's remarkable encounter with the Marygold of Leutha: For the soft soul of America, Oothoon wanderd in woe, Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort her; And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha's vale Art thou a flower! art thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; Now a nymph! I dare not pluck thee from thy dewy bed! (VDA 1:3-7; E45-46) While Oothoon's search for flowers is originally motivated by a self- centred concern to derive personal "comfort" from them (thus reveal- ing a commonplace understanding of their sentimental "usefulness" in human society), her subsequent view of the bright Marygold ("now a flower; / Now a nymph!") forces her to revise her understanding of flowers and their relationship to humans. A number of critics have noted the similarity between Oothoon's heterogeneous view of the</page><page sequence="4">4 ISLE Marygold and Blake's anthropomorphic portrait of a thistle in his cel- ebrated epistolary poem to Thomas Butts, dated 22 November 1802: 6 For double the vision my Eyes do see And a double vision is always with me With my inward eye 'tis an old Man grey With my outward a Thistle across my way[.] (11. 27-30; E721) This notion of "double vision," which Blake contrasts later in the poem with an insidiously myopic "Single vision and Newtons sleep" (line 87; E722), causes such things as thistles and flowers to exceed their assigned taxonomie categories, thus challenging prevalent ideas con- cerning the nature of their earthly being. And if one side of this per- ceptual doubleness nevertheless points toward an anthropomorphic "saming" of non-human creatures (where thistles become old men and flowers are transformed into semi-human nymphs), this saming, in Blake's logic, can never be absolute, or it would mark a fall back into the oppressive "single vision" he so emphatically decries. Hence, Blake stresses the bi-valence of a "double vision [that] is always with me," a vision wherein the perceived "humanity" of the nonhuman entity is continually unsettled by the otherness of its alternate inhumanity (em- phasis mine). Significantly, in both the poem to Butts and in the earlier Visions , such a mode of visionary perception marks the beginning of verbal dialogue between the subjects and objects of double vision, a dialogue that modifies the human protagonists' actions in subtle but significant ways. Such behavioral modification is readily apparent in the poem to Butts, which describes the poet's progress away from the familiar and familial evil represented by the demands of his father and brothers (11. 13-23), toward the visionary freedom characterizing Blake's imagina- tive Eternity. Although the thistle seems in one aspect of its double identity to represent an obstacle or impediment to Blake's pilgrimage (since it is stretched like a barrier "across my way"), it ultimately ad- monishes him at all costs to resume his forward progress: "'If thou goest back the thistle said / Thou art to endless woe betrayd / For there does Theotormon lower. . .'" (11. 31-33). Hence, Blake's subse- quent action - "I struck the Thistle with my foot / And broke him up from his delving root" (11. 41-42) - need not necessarily be seen as cru- elly vindictive or anti-natural. In order to respect the thistle's succinctly stated spiritual advice and resume the forward movement of his own pilgrimage, in short, Blake must remove it from his path. And yet, Blake's poetic encounter with the thistle partakes of the very sacrificial anthropocentric economy discussed above, an imag-</page><page sequence="5">Pastoral Ideology , and Nature in William Blake 5 ined order of being in which nonhuman entities freely relinquish their lives in the interest of human profit and prosperity. A similar dynamic is readily apparent in Visions, where the "Golden nymph" (a poetic hybrid of Marygold and nymph) magnanimously offers itself to its human beholder, saying "pluck thou my flower Oothoon the mild / Another flower shall spring, because the soul of sweet delight / Can never pass away" (1:8-10). One should note, however, the ways in which Blake modifies the conventional trope of nonhuman self-sacri- fice in his portrait of the Marygold. Not only is this plant indestruc- tible by virtue of its indwelling "soul of sweet delight" (an attribution of spirit that challenges the contemporary belief that only humans were endowed with souls); it is also physically immortal, locating its life nei- ther wholly in a soul that would devalue or negate its physicality, nor materialistically in the ontology of its individual flower, but in a com- bination of intangible spiritual and physical processes that manifest themselves in an endless succession of new blooms (hence the remark that "Another flower shall spring"). This processive aspect of the Marygold's botanical identity empha- sizes its difference from literary flowers depicted in other British texts of the late eighteenth century. Consider, for example, the opening lines to James MacPherson's Ossianic poem "Berrathon," which Blake likely had in mind as he composed Visions: Bend thy blue course, О stream, round the narrow plain of Lutha. Let the green woods hang over it from their mountains: and the sun look on it at noon. The thistle is there on its rock, and shakes its beard to the wind. The flower hangs its heavy head, waving, at times, to the gale. Why dost thou wake me, O gale, it seems to say, I am covered with the drops of heaven? The time of my fading is near, and the blast that shall scatter my leaves. Tomorrow shall the traveller come, he that saw me in my beauty shall come; his eyes will search the field, but they will not find me? (193) There are numerous striking parallels between Blake's portrait of the Marygold in Visions and Ossian's depiction of the wildflower in "Berrathon": each plant inhabits a pastoral vale (indeed, critics com- monly cite Ossian's "Lutha" as the major textual source for Blake's "Leutha"); each plant is covered with figuratively rendered dew (though Ossian's spiritualized "drops of heaven" give way in Visions to a much more earthly and implicitly erotic "dewy bed" [1:7]); and, finally, each plant functions as a mouthpiece for philosophical discus- sions of mutability and death. This last point is particularly impor- tant, because the flowers' different approaches to the topic of death emphasize the philosophical distance separating Blakean from Ossianic literary pastoral. On the one hand, Ossian's flower is decidedly hu-</page><page sequence="6">6 ISLE manized. Fully conscious of its mortality, it indulges in the most pa- thetic sentimentāliem, lamenting especially the impending loss of its distinctively human-pleasing beauty. Blake's no-less anthropomorphic Marygold, on the other hand, significantly refuses such sentiment, re- jecting the finality of death by defining its own life in terms of process and transformation. Hence, while Ossian's flower dwells on the past, becoming in "Berrathon" a vehicle for the backward-looking, nostal- gic longing so often associated with pastoral desire, its botanical coun- terpart in Blake's poem dwells contentedly in the present, a present fully open to the flux of historical change. Indeed, by actively predict- ing its future transformation ("pluck thou my flower . . . / Another flower shall spring"), the Marygold-nymph becomes a figure for for- ward-looking prophecy, the genre Oothoon will later deploy to chal- lenge the related sexism, racism, and anthropocentrism of the estab- lished political order. The Marygold's function as a figure for prophetic transformation in Visions is implicit in its alternate and alternating manifestation as "nymph." In the late eighteenth century, the word "nymph" carried a rich variety of possible connotations: it could refer generally to a youth- ful and beautiful woman, or to a variety of semi-divine natural beings such as water- or wood-spirits, or to a river or stream, or even, as "nympha," to the clitoris (all of which possible references have been considered by readers of Visions). But the term has an additional refer- ence that has gone largely unremarked. As the Oxford English Dictio- nary informs us, "nymph" can also signify "An insect in that stage of development which intervenes between the larva and the imago" - a usage Blake may well have noticed in the opening pages of True Chris- tian Religion (1781), where Emanuel Swedenborg discusses the worm's wondrous transformation into a beautiful winged butterfly (1: 15). If we recall, moreover, that Blake, in his frontispiece design to Jerusalem, depicts the renovated Jerusalem in the form of a gorgeously winged human-insect hybrid, we can see in the "Golden nymph" - at one level a figure for Oothoon's own selfhood (Rajan 246) - the promise of a transformation analogous to that which Jerusalem undergoes as she moves from the slavery of Ulro toward Blake's emancipatory Eternity. At any rate, if we allow the zoological reference as one possible aspect of the polysemantics informing Visions, we can see the Marygold- nymph as a radically fluid entity, an entity utterly exceeding the con- straints of a taxonomy based on "one law," the mercilessly homog- enizing code that the slave-master Bromion will champion later in the poem (4:22). Such excess not only undermines the regulatory impulses supporting contemporary science's categorical pursuit of "empire" over nonhuman creatures; it also poses a palpable threat to the Judeo-</page><page sequence="7">Pastoral, Ideology, and Nature in William Blake 7 Christian emphasis upon "purity of type, derived from Genesis and expressed in biblical injunctions against animal hybrids and human miscegenation" (Shepard 177). Hence, just as the pastoral shepherd "divideth his sheep from the goats" (Matt. 25.32-33), the Judeo-Chris- tian God separates impure from pure souls at the final judgment. Need- less to say, as both flower and nymph, Oothoon's Marygold subverts this purity imperative, becoming in the process something of a living transgression. Indeed, because of the sheer semantic heterogeneity of "nymph" (interpreted polysemously as woman, nature-spirit, clitoris, post-larval entity, and so on), the Marygold-nymph takes this subver- sion to the greatest of extremes, representing nothing less than "a . . . defilement by categorical standards" (Shepard 67). Given the thematic emphasis in Visions on the concepts of "purity" and "defilement," we can begin perhaps to appreciate the crucial importance of Oothoon's encounter with the excessive flower of Leutha. If the Marygold does not itself represent a threat to Bromion's oppressive "one law" (4:22), Oothoon's multiple vision of it certainly does, and Oothoon's carry- ing of this flower from the relative safety of Leutha's vales into the dangerous world belonging to Bromion and Theotormon signifies the beginning of her visionary challenge to that world. But a qualifying word of caution is necessary here, for it is immedi- ately after her encounter with the Marygold that Oothoon embarks upon the "impetuous course" (1:15) leading to her sudden brutal rape at the hands of Bromion. How are we to account for this set of circum- stances? According to Visions' s opening Argument, Oothoon originally hides in Leutha's vale, the site of an ostensibly "protective pastoral,"7 due to "fears" understandably associated with her sexual inexperi- ence (iii: 1-4). But, as the Argument's terse syntax suggests, her inter- action with the Marygold abruptly transforms her cautious fearful- ness into its diametric opposite, an intrepid and outgoing boldness: "I plucked Leutha's flower, / And I rose up from the vale" (iii:5-6). In the poem's longer narrative rendition of this scene, we witness a similarly sudden transformation, as Oothoon declares "I pluck thee from thy bed / Sweet flower, and put thee here to glow between my breasts / And thus I turn my face to where my whole soul seeks" (1:11-13). What is perhaps most important about these descriptions is their subtle figu- ration of Oothoon's behavior in botanical terms. In the Argument, af- ter plucking Leutha's flower, Oothoon not only acts in a floral manner (rising, like a growing flower, "up from the vale" [see Heffernan 10]); she seems also to internalize something of a floral identity, becoming, as the past tense of the verb obliquely implies, a "rose." While this poetic assumption of botanical identity seems at one level a fitting tribute to the flower she has just plucked (as if Oothoon is somehow</page><page sequence="8">8 ISLE absorbing the dying bloom's life-force or essence), it also carries more sinister connotations. Indeed, directly after the narrative rendition of this flower-plucking incident, Oothoon, having placed the Marygold "to glow between [her] breasts," turns to Theotormon like a flower toward the light, behaving in a manner reminiscent of the Sunflower of Experience, an automaton-like creature who mindlessly follows "the steps of the Sun" while never actually attaining the object toward which it "aspire[s]" (SIE, E25). While Oothoon should not be condemned for pursuing the object of her own desire in Visions, her floral behavior evinces in her very action a kind of passivity - a most subtle subjec- tion, in short, to vegetal compulsion or "natural law." The possibility that Oothoon has become subject to some form of "natural" constraint in Leutha's vale takes on greater urgency when we consider the poetic figuration of Bromion's act of rape. In the Argument, Oothoon declares that "the terrible thunders tore / My virgin mantle in twain" (iii:7-8); and in the poem itself we are told that "Bromion rent [Oothoon] with his thunders" (1:16). By figuring rape as the meteorological phenomenon of thunder, Vi- sions seems to naturalize Bromion's act (Rajan 248), suggesting that its violence is an aspect of nature itself. The poem establishes a clear parallel, moreover, between the rapacious "thunders" that violate Oothoon, leading to her subsequent enslavement, and Blake's de- piction of human slavery as an aspect of natural tectonic activity: "[SJlaves . . . and children bought with money," we are told, "shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires / Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth" (2:8-10). Although Blake's reference to "religious caves" presents this enslavement as a prob- lem of culture and ideology, his figuration of lust in terms of inces- sant volcanic activity suggests the culpability of nature and natu- ral process as well (emphasis mine). At any rate, since Oothoon's botanically rendered behavior prior to the rape suggests at least some lack of autonomous agency, and since subsequent poetic ref- erences to meteorological and tectonic activity similarly link the dynamics of sexual oppression and slavery to natural necessity, we should beware of reading Bromion's sudden appearance in Visions in terms of what Leo Marx has called "the trope of the interrupted idyll" (27). In differing degrees, it seems, the violence of compul- sion already inhabits both the idyllic vales of Leutha and the osten- sibly antipastoral realm of "Theotormon's reign," the realm in which Bromion rapes Oothoon (1:15). Hence, if Oothoon is to attain free- dom from violence and victimization in Visions, she must question not only Bromion's and Theotormon's cultural ideologies, but her own pastoral identification with nature as well.8</page><page sequence="9">Pastorał, Ideology, and Nature in William Blake 9 This is not to suggest that Oothoon must entirely reject the realm of nature. On the contrary, such rejection informs the erroneous behavior of Theotormon. Because he follows the via negativa, the "negative way" of ascetic consciousness, Theotormon believes he must reject all things earthly and corporeal - including especially his own physical appetites and sen- sual instincts - in order to become one with an abstract, wholly other Godhead. In Blake's iconoclastic view, such self-abnegation involves a sadomasochistic mortification of "the human form divine" (SIE; E13). Hence, the penitential Theotormon engages in acts of self-flagellation,9 and he guiltily indulges in the shedding of "secret tears" (2:7). For Oothoon, such self-abuse is the ultimate product of Urizenic reli- gion, which "rewards . . . continence" (7:8) with the promise of redemp- tion and salvation in a hyper-hygienic (because wholly incorporeal) heav- enly afterlife. Thus, she asks Theotormon Why dost thou seek religion? Is it because acts are not lovely, that thou seekest solitude, Where the horrible darkness is impressed with reflections of desire. Father of Jealousy, be thou accursed from the earth! Why hast thou taught my Theotormon this accursed thing? Uli beauty fades from off my shoulders darken'd and cast out, A solitary shadow wailing on the margin of non-entity. (7:9-15) This passage forcefully indicts the doctrinal asceticism informing Theotormon's religion. The "horrible darkness" is Oothoon's devas- tating figure for the abstract, wholly other God of negative theology, a "non-entity" existing only as "reflections" of the believer's projected ideology of selfhood. Hence, Oothoon's reference to Theotormon's "desire" is most telling. If Theotormon is to be consistent in his renun- ciation of all things earthly, including especially his own libidinal im- pulses, he must also renounce the very desire that necessarily moti- vates his self-mortifying asceticism; for, as Oothoon recognizes, Theotormon's self-renunciation, far from being selflessly austere, in- volves a displacement of libidinal pleasure, an indulgence of selfhood she insightfully calls "the self enjoyings of self denial" (7:9). To quote Judith Butler's relevant discussion of ascetic discipline, Theotormon's strange "intermingling of pleasure and pain" is the product of "a re- nunciation of the self which can never quite accomplish that renuncia- tion, which, as an incessant accomplishing, carries with it the pleasur- able assertion of self" (49-50). Such self-absorption does not imply the self-congratulation of one who believes he is holier than others. Rather, it is a species of "negative narcissism," involving as it does a continu-</page><page sequence="10">10 ISLE ous " preoccupation with what is most debased and defiled" in the self (49-50; emphasis mine). So self-preoccupied, Theotormon can never acknowledge and return Oothoon's proffered love. In the meantime, as Oothoon poignantly complains, "beauty fades from off my shoul- ders." This remark - emphasizing at one level the necessity of a sexual carpe diem - reveals what Theotormon's austerity makes of Oothoon's beauty in the present : the evanescent (i.e., "fad[ing]") and thus illusory quality of a human object of desire that must, like all earthly things, be renounced in the name of an impossible spiritual "purity." Theotormon's rejection of earthly beauty has important implica- tions for a consideration of Visions' s critique of Judeo-Christian pasto- ral. As part of her effort to persuade Theotormon to abandon his se- vere austerity and its attendant pain and sorrow, Oothoon utters a series of hopeful auguries whose combined rural imagery paints an idyllic pastoral picture. I cry arise О Theotormon for the village dog Barks at the breaking day. the nightingale has done lamenting. The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east; Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure. (2:23-28) In an illuminating discussion of the biblical context of Visions, Helen Ellis argues that Oothoon's words "are a rural eighteenth-century English ver- sion of the Bridegroom's call to the Bride" in The Song of Solomon (25), a text seen by eighteenth-century commentators as "affordpng] ... a high exemplification of Pastoral Poetry" (Blair 2: 402): Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is heard in our land; The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. (Song Sol. 2.10-13) The similarities between the Bridegroom's call to the Bride and Oothoon's call to Theotormon are readily apparent. At the thematic level, both calls are invitations to sexual consummation, where the speakers interpret the fertility of natural landscapes and the activities of nonhuman animals as positive auguries of human sexual consum- mation. And, rhetorically, both passages are framed by similar gram- matical imperatives, urgent invitations to the loved one to "arise" and assume his or her proper station in the created order.</page><page sequence="11">Pastoral, Ideology, and Nature in William Blake 1 1 Unlike the Bride in the pastoral Song of Solomon, however, Theotormon is incapable of responding to his lover's call: his as- cetic doctrine quite simply cannot approve Oothoon's particular interpretation of earthly signs. Hence, in a touching lament, Oothoon decries what Theotormon's asceticism has made of the world: "In- stead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye / In the eastern cloud: instead of night a sickly charnel house; / That Theotormon hears me not!" (2:35-37). The contrast between Oothoon's view of nature and Theotormon's could not be more pronounced. For Ellis, this contrast is a generic one: Theotormon's ascetic withdrawal trans- forms "the beautiful pastoral world" envisioned by Oothoon (and depicted in the Song of Solomon) into an all-pervasive "nightmare" (26). But while this attention to generic transformation is helpful and important, Ellis's remark misses the subtlety of Blake's critique of pastoral discourse in Visions. Although Theotormon's total rejec- tion of earthly beauty certainly appears to manifest itself as an overt rejection of the pastoral idyll, his alternative vision of the natural world suggests otherwise. To recall Worster's argument, Christian appropriations of pastoral tended to allegorize the green world as ultimately hostile to the spiritual well-being of the flock. In such a context - wherein heaven is considered the true paradise, the sole realm of eternal and therefore authentic "life" - the earth becomes merely a locus of mutability and death, the "sickly charnel house" of Theotormon's discourse, which sees the body and all physical nature as a tomb. Far from being anti-pastoral, Theotormon's worldview evinces strong ideological affinities with that of tradi- tional Christian pastoralism. Indeed, Blake's representation of the sun as "an eye / In the eastern cloud" (cf. the eye-like image of the sun in the design to plate i) is a figure for the kind of panoptic surveillance Foucault outlines in his critique of pastoral technology. According to Theotormon's ascetic paradigm, in short, the conscience - as indwell- ing representative of an all-seeing, omniscient God - functions via the agency of self-chastising "thought" (4:3-11) to exact obedience in the believer, continually policing, judging, and disciplining the embod- ied portion of his or her being, including all carnal desires, physi- cal appetites, and corporeal acts. Hence, rather than negating Judeo- Christian pastoralism, Theotormon's dilemma lays bare the most ominous of its underlying ideological assumptions, taking the pas- toral mode to its logical conclusion, wherein an imperialistic soul shackles and enslaves the body, branding the "virgin joy[s]" of embodied existence "with the name of whore" (6:11-12). Despite her tendency to affirm the natural world as a source of multiplicitous vision, Oothoon is clearly affected by Theotormon's</page><page sequence="12">12 ISLE asceticism. Obsessed with the distinction between defilement and purity, her invocation of "Theotormons Eagles" is a case in point: I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air, Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect. The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast. The Eagles at her call descend &amp; rend their bleeding prey. . . . (2:14-17) A few lines after Theotormon's eagles conduct this questionable and violent ritual of purification, Oothoon invokes the eagle as a figure for impending apocalypse, announcing that: the Eagle returns From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east; Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake The sun that sleeps too long. (2:25-28) The eagle's "Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions" aligns him with the early evangelists; for when Jesus sent his apostles to minister "to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," he qualified their pastoral mission as follows: "whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them" (Matt. 10.6; Mark 6.11). While this aspect of Visions's intertextuality might support the view that the eagle is potentially an apostolic agent of Oothoon's renovation (cf. Heffernan 14; Wilkie 59), the bird's "shaking the dust" also car- ries more ominous connotations, suggesting that, like the passively aggressive Theotormon, it "shakes off" or rejects the earthly, em- bodied aspect of its being. Such a figurative dynamic certainly in- forms the eagle's next appearance in the poem, where Oothoon in- vokes it in a discourse on perception and difference: "Does not the eagle scorn the earth &amp; despise the treasures beneath? / But the mole knoweth what is there, &amp; the worm shall tell it thee" (5:39- 40). Given the severely hostile and judgmental attitudes implied by the verbs "scorn" and "despise" in this passage, it is difficult to admire the eagle's lofty nobility. By contrast, the verbs attributed to the lowly mole and worm ("knoweth" and "tell") imply on the part of these humble creatures a comparatively serene, non-judg- mental mode of knowledge, and an uninhibited openness of com- municative exchange. Moreover, the antithetical conjunction "But," which directly follows the reference to the eagle's scorn and con- tempt, makes it clear that the transcendent eagle does not itself</page><page sequence="13">Pastorał, Ideology , and Nature in William Blake 13 "know" the things it presumes to judge, suggesting that its conde- scending antagonism toward the earth is, like all prejudice, based on a fundamental ignorance. Despite this affirmation of earthliness, Oothoon finds it exceed- ingly difficult to oppose Theotormon's anti-sensual, ascetic philoso- phy. Her obsessive desire to "reflect. / The image of Theotormon" (2:15-16) is a case in point. Directly after Theotormon's eagles "de- scend &amp; rend" Oothoon's ostensibly "defiled bosom," the narrator offers the following summation: "Theotormon severely smiles, her soul reflects the smile; / As the clear spring mudded with the feet of beasts grows pure &amp; smiles" (2:18-19). Oothoon's passively affirmative re- sponse to Theotormon's sadistic severity suggests the extent to which her own identity has been "obliterated and erased" (2:34) at this point in the poem. Hence, numerous critics have approached the simile of the mudded spring with suspicion, seeing in it a "brazen convention- ality" (Bloom 109-10) and a "banal, Urizenic righteousness" (Ander- son 3) offering ample evidence of Oothoon's utter enslavement. While these suspicions are certainly justifiable, we need not fully endorse them. At the simplest level, it is significant that Blake chooses to rep- resent the ostensibly spiritual process of ascetic self-cleansing via the "natural" simile of a mudded spring; for, by identifying "pur[ity]" with earthly process, this simile emphatically opposes Theotormon's self-righteous desire to renounce the material world. And while the simile seems figuratively to identify Oothoon as "no more than a re- flecting spring" (Linkin 188), it certainly carries more positive conno- tations as well. Far from being merely reflective, springs are sources of active and dynamic process; thus, they should not be confused with the "standing water" which, in Blake's poetics, "breeds reptiles of the mind" (MHH 19; E42). Just as moving waters will not remain polluted by the incursions of drinking beasts, Oothoon, the simile suggests, will not be permanently contaminated by the darkness of Theotormon's shadowy severity. Hence, while the simile's simplicity of language and rural imagery recall the conventions of a regressively nostalgic pasto- ralism, its dynamic aspect connotes the potential for social transfor- mation, which Blake associated with a forward looking, visionary, and emancipatory mode of poetic discourse. Indeed, the figure of the mudded spring plays on a series of pro- phetic biblicąl allusions that have, to the best of my knowledge, en- tirely escaped the notice of Blake's commentators. The wild beasts and polluted spring of Visions likely allude to passages from The Book of Ezekiel, wherein the Egyptian Pharaoh is likened to "a young lion of the nations," a predatory beast which "earnest forth with thy rivers, and troublest the waters with thy feet, andfouledst their rivers " (Ezek. 32.2;</page><page sequence="14">14 ISLE emphasis added).10 With this passage in mind, we might correlate Theotormon's philosophy with pharaonic tyranny. The likelihood that Blake's simile also alludes to Psalms 68.30 adds further force to this interpretive possibility. In this passage, believers are instructed to "Re- buke the company of spearmen, the multitude of bulls," until "the people that delight in war" are scattered. Significantly, the King James Bible offers an alternative gloss for "the company of spearmen," al- lowing the phrase's original Hebrew to be translated as "the beasts of the reeds" (emphasis mine). In his highly influential Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, published by Blake's patron Joseph Johnson in 1787, Robert Lowth sees these beasts as a complex figure for "the fierce and insolent tyrants" who oppress the Jewish people; and, in his own translation from the Hebrew, Lowth depicts these beastly tyrants "'striking with their feet, and disturbing the silver, or perhaps desirable rivers;' that is, destroying and laying waste the pleasant places of Judea" (Lowth 1: 136-37n). In Lowth's reading, tyranny has harmful social and environmental consequences, just as it does in Visions, where Oothoon functions simultaneously as a figure for enslaved humanity and an exploited natural environment.11 In short, Oothoon, the "clear spring," is trampled and "mudded" by tyrannical "beasts" like Theotormon, whose ascetic theology manifests itself as religious op- pression. However, since the mudded spring ultimately "grows pure &amp; smiles," we can see in this seemingly pastoral figure a minor but significant prophecy of revolutionary, even apocalyptic (because re- velatory) change. Far from embodying the "brazen conventionality" of insipid pastoral, and far from being only a figure for the reflection or reduplication of political oppression, the simile of the clear spring emphasizes Oothoon's potential to recuperate her lost clarity of vision amid the most adverse circumstances. And yet, when Oothoon asks Theotormon "How can I be defild when I reflect thy image pure?" (3:16), her discourse on purity and defilement becomes problematic indeed. Although she is certainly correct to question her status as "defild," Oothoon's rhetoric problem- atically takes for granted the pre-given purity of Theotormon's "im- age," suggesting that she has become a mere surface, a passively "reflect[ing]" mirror. Such a reading is complicated, however, by the syntactical ambiguity of the line in question. Oothoon does not say "I reflect thy pure image"; rather, she asserts, "I reflect thy image pure." Because the modifier "pure" follows rather than precedes the clause's noun, the reader is at liberty to consider Theotormon's purity not as a pre-given quality subsequently and passively reflected but as some- thing Oothoon's act of "reflection]" causally bestows upon him. Hence, while Oothoon's continuing attention to the problem of her own de-</page><page sequence="15">Pastorał, Ideology, and Nature in William Blake 15 filement is at one level symptomatic of her subjection to Theotormon's ideology of spiritual purity, her language seems subtly to mock him, evincing a degree of critical agency by exposing his purity as fabrica- tion, if not as self-righteous facade.12 Immediately following her curious claim to reflect Theotormon's "image pure," Oothoon deploys a series of "natural" metaphors which enlarge her critical exploration of the relationship between purity and defilement in the poem: Sweetest the fruit that the worm feeds on. &amp; the soul prey'd on by woe The new wash'd lamb ting'd with the village smoke &amp; the bright swan By the red earth of our immortal river: I bathe my wings. And I am white and pure to hover round Theotormons breast. (3:17-20) In this series of figures, Oothoon attempts to come to terms with her predicament as a rape victim by invoking the theodical trope of the felix culpa or fortunate fall, defending the very necessity of "defile- ment" to the ultimate attainment of a true or higher "purity." Accord- ing to the poetic logic informing the passage's opening metaphors, Oothoon is herself both the "fruit that the worm feeds on" and "the soul prey'd on by woe," once-pristine entities who have been sub- jected historically to contamination via external imposition, imposi- tion ostensibly proving the superlative "Sweet[ness]" of their own es- sential being. As is often the case with arguments based on the highly conventional tropology of the felix culpa , however, Oothoon's proposi- tion is less than convincing, seeming like a mere apology for the exist- ence of tyranny. This problem becomes especially apparent when we consider the next metaphor in the series. In her poetic guise as the "new wash'd lamb," Oothoon is unquestionably a figure for the spiri- tual purity and innocence so conceptually crucial to the ideology of pastoral technology; but, as her "ting'd" condition makes plain, she has become - by virtue of this same purity13 - a burnt offering, an un- witting instrument of sacrificial ritual. At the danger of mixing meta- phors, I would suggest that Oothoon has become something of a scape- goat, a sacrifice made to atone not for her own sins but for those of her self-righteous oppressors. The next metaphor, that of the "bright swan," is the lengthiest and most complex one in the above-quoted series. The most frequently cited interpretation of this figure belongs to Kathleen Raine, who ar- gues as follows: "This is Plotinus' philosophy. The swan - Plato's em- blem of the soul - has but dipped its wings in the 'red earth' of the natural body, which is the ever-flowing river of generated life. The soul bathes its wings and is pure" (1: 177). According to this interpre-</page><page sequence="16">16 ISLE tation (whose dualistic premise is not at odds with Theotormon's as- cetic rejection of materiality), the pristine swan of the soul is contami- nated by its descent into an earthly supplementarity, in which it "has but dipped its wings" (emphasis mine). From this standpoint, Oothoon deploys the swan metaphor to emphasize the inessential nature of a physicality that necessarily - but only temporarily - defiles the essen- tial, spiritual portion of our being.14 Such a reading suggests the contradictory nature of Oothoon's po- sition in Visions. As her attempted courtship of Theotormon makes plain, she wishes to affirm and celebrate corporeal existence via joy- ful, uncoercive sexual consummation; however, the metaphorical lan- guage she uses to convince him of her worthiness implicitly negates physicality in favour of a concept of undefiled spirit. It is appropriate, then, that the eagle devouring Oothoon's "defiled bosom" in the illus- tration to plate 3 (the same plate upon which the figure of the swan appears) has a beak that looks "rather like the bill of a swan" (Erdman, Illuminated 131). Since the swan is an emblem of the soul, this illustra- tion functions to underscore the Foucauldian pastoral dynamic we repeatedly witness in Visions : that of the soul violating the body in the name of an impossible purity. And since the eagle's swan-like bill is poised in the illustration to penetrate Oothoon's physical body, we must once again entertain the ominous possibility that the eagle - which Oothoon invokes in the text as the spiritual antidote to her physical "defilement" - figuratively repeats the appallingly violent act of rape by which she was originally "defiled." It is possible, however, to find in Visions' s swan metaphor an alter- native significance. As the "bright swan," Oothoon's soul is certainly "ting'd" by "the red earth" of its corporeal embodiment; but when Oothoon says "I bathe my wings," we need not see her as washing off a less than desirable earthly stain. On the contrary, since the "red earth" is "of" the river in which she bathes, and since the river is itself "im- mortal," we might see her as the recipient of an earthly baptism, in which her spiritual aspect is somehow completed by its corporeal "tinge." Oothoon's subsequent claim that she is "white and pure to hover round Theotormons breast" (3:20) need not contradict this reading. Like the Song of Solomon's celebrated Bridegroom, who is both "white and ruddy" (5:10), Oothoon, it seems, may be simultaneously "white and pure" and "ting'd" by the red earth of embodied existence. Whether we choose to interpret Oothoon's references to the tinge of materiality in a positive or negative light, we must acknowledge their rhetorical force, since they are able to persuade Theotormon to break the austere silence he has maintained throughout the course of the poem (see 3:23-4:11). Unfortunately, Oothoon remains unable to</page><page sequence="17">Pastoral Ideology , and Nature in William Blake 17 convince Theotormon that the earthly creation is anything more than a "sickly charnel house." Hence, appropriating his discourse of death for counter-discursive purposes, she utters the following lines: Does not the worm erect a pillar in the mouldering church yard? And a palace of eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave Over his porch these words are written. Take thy bliss О Man! And sweet shall be thy taste &amp; sweet thy infant joys renew! (5:41-6:3) We must, I believe, answer Oothoon's questions about pillars and pal- aces with a resounding no; for it is humans who erect gravestones (as signs of nostalgic commemoration), just as it is humans who construct ideal heavens or "palace[s] of eternity" (as metaphysical guarantees that our lives and deaths are not without meaning). For Oothoon, how- ever, the church of this passage, surrounded by its "mouldering" yard of "death," is ultimately less important than the patently earthly worm - the abject horror of which inspires humanity's urgent construc- tion of palatial idealisms, comforting fictions that would compensate for the brute fact of death, the fact that in death our bodies are nothing but nourishment for grave-crawling worms. Such gothic horror is, however, only implicit in Visions . Oothoon's worm, rather than emphasizing our fears of hell or hopes for a heavenly afterlife,15 utters an exuberant, life-affirming impera- tive and a doubly "sweet" prophecy, focusing on and affirming the earthly here and now: "Take thy bliss О Man! / And sweet shall be thy taste &amp; sweet thy infant joys renew!" This sentence, one should note, avoids an enslaving grammatical determinism by following the basic structure of prophecy as Blake describes it in his Annota- tions to Watson: "If you go on So / the result is So" (E617).16 By attributing prophetic utterance to a worm, Oothoon not only re- minds us of our mortality and so urges us to seize joy while we are able to do so; she seems implicitly to postulate the universal avail- ability of prophecy in a cosmos wherein literally "every thing that lives is holy" (8:10), including even the lowliest worm.17 Nancy Moore Goslee is thus correct, I think, to see the worm's prophecy as a "positive vision [which] becomes the premise for Oothoon's own rebirth" (121). And yet, given her continued inability to convince Theotormon that his asceticism is a mode of "hypocrite modesty" - the "self- love that envies all" (6:16, 7:21) - it is perhaps understandable that Oothoon resorts at last to outrageous extremes, deploying the rheto- ric of masculinist sexual fantasy to shock him out of his self-suffi- cient complacency and into a state of other-oriented desire:</page><page sequence="18">18 ISLE But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread, And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold; I'll lie beside thee on a bank &amp; view their wanton play In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon: Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first born beam, Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e'er with jealous cloud Come in the heaven of generous love; nor selfish blightings bring. (7:23-29) In its concern for the purity of origins (implied by references to the "rosy morning" and "the first born beam" of a temporal dawn), Oothoon's fantasy is pastoral in mode, depicting something of a sexual golden age, an idyllic natural milieu ostensibly immune to the "selfish blightings" of normative sexual politics. As we have seen, however, pastoral idealism tends in Visions to involve an un- derlying complicity with the politics of dominion and slavery; and, under close scrutiny, Oothoon's rural "heaven of generous love" is not nearly as generous as its pastoralism might superficially sug- gest. As Leopold Damrosch, Jr., has observed (198), Oothoon's "silken nets and traps" are disturbingly analogous to the religious "nets &amp; gins &amp; traps" (5:18) she has already denounced as mecha- nisms used "to catch virgin joy, / And brand it with the name of whore" (6:11-12). According to her own logic, then, Oothoon has become a procuress; and her references to "mild silver" and "furi- ous gold," while emphasizing the beauty of the "girls" she would catch for Theotormon, also signify their status as objects of exchange in an economy not of "free love" but of sexual commodification. But as the subsequent lines would suggest, Oothoon seems fully aware of such commodification. Hence, without waiting for a re- sponse from Theotormon, she immediately juxtaposes against this sexual scenario a poetic homily on avarice, indicting a social economy that reduces the "furious gold" of physical or sexual en- ergy to the mere - but no less fetishized - gold of the marketplace: Does the sun walk in glorious raiment, on the secret floor Where the cold miser spreads his gold? or does the bright cloud drop On his stone threshold? does his eye behold the beam that brings Expansion to the eye of pity? or will he bind himself Beside the ox to thy hard furrow? does that mild beam blot The bat, the owl, the glowing tyger, and the king of night. The sea fowl takes the wintry blast, for a cov'ring to her limbs: And the wild snake, the pestilence to adorn him with gems &amp; gold. And trees. &amp; birds. &amp; beasts. &amp; men. behold their eternal joy. (7:30-8:8)</page><page sequence="19">Pastoral Ideology ; and Nature in William Blake 19 Arguably, the miser in this passage is at one level a figurative stand-in for Theotormon, who hoards his sexual energy the way an avaricious man hoards money. Thus, the "stone threshold" where the miser counts his gold recalls the "threshold hard" of Bromion's caves, where the jealous Theotormon sits earlier in the poem keeping watch over - one might say, counting the sins of - the ostensibly "adulterate" Bromion and Oothoon (2:3-7). It is no wonder that gold is ultimately associated in Visions with the "wild snake," which adorns itself "with gems &amp; gold," for in Judeo-Christian mythology it is Satan himself, in the guise of the serpent, who puts an end to earthly sexual innocence by suc- cessfully tempting Adam and Eve, thus supposedly destroying the original pastoral paradise. But Oothoon's discourse on the miser complicates this seemingly anti-pastoral moment. For while the ironically named "mild beam" in the miser's eye (likely an allusion to Matt. 7.3-5) disables his ability to sympathize with other humans, it also prevents him from sympathiz- ing with the nonhuman inhabitants of his environmental context, thus "blot[ting] / The bat, the owl, the glowing tyger, and the king of night." If Oothooñ is correct in her proposition that "every thing that lives is holy" (8:10), this blotting must be seen as an act of sacrilegious vio- lence. Thus, the reader is invited to eschew the miser's example, re- specting all living things, including not only the ominously nocturnal creatures Oothoon catalogues, but even the traditionally demonized "wild snake" of Biblical mythology. At this late point in the poem, Oothoon's focus on symbolically ominous animals is fraught with socio-generic significance. To the extent that benighted tigers and stealthy serpents allegorize a preda- tory threat to the welfare of pastoral lambs (figures for the human flock), they become, paradoxically, figurai vehicles for the effective pedagogical consolidation of pastoral technology. A properly in- ternalized pastoral fear of such figurai bugbears translates easily, in other words, into fear of, and obedience before, that cosmic "pro- tector," the all-knowing, all-seeing Shepherd in the sky. Ultimately, in the name of such omnipotence (whether conceived in secular or in sacred terms), tyrants like Theotormon themselves presume to separate the proverbial sheep from the goats, the virgin from the whore, the pure from the defiled. Against this authoritative ideol- ogy of exclusion, Oothoon articulates in Visions an anti-imperialist prophecy of all-inclusive community, asserting the irreducible re- ality of a minutely particularized cosmos in which literally "every thing that lives is holy." Unfortunately, this emancipatory vision fails to translate into ac- tual physical liberation, as the poem's concluding lines make plain:</page><page sequence="20">20 ISLE Thus every morning wails Oothoon. but Theotormon sits Upon the margind ocean conversing with shadows dire. The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, &amp; echo back her sighs. (8:11-13) Repeating its plaintive refrain (cf. 2:20, 5:2), Visions closes without resolution. Having been reduced to a "margind ocean," Oothoon's celebrated realm of nature - once responsive and even prophetic, as her earlier encounters with the Marygold and worm demon- strate - becomes an inarticulate void, unable in Virgilian style to "echo back the charms of Amaryllis,"18 unable even to echo back Oothoon's ebullient assertion of its own living holiness. Hence, while the echo, commonly a pastoral "metaphor of reciprocity," conventionally evokes in pastoral literature a "sense of relatedness between man and not-man" (Marx 23), the non-natural echo of Vi- sions subtly reminds us of the alienation that exists between hu- mans and nonhumans as a result of pastoral technology and the related pursuit of human "dominion" over embodied nature. In its fully human trajectory, Visions' s echo ultimately highlights the mu- tual solidarity of oppressed humans, the communal integrity of an enslaved female sub-culture forced to share a common burden of "woes" and "sighs"; and Oothoon's emphatic and continuous wail- ing, while signifying her immediate failure to revalue earthly life and sensory experience, indicates her unflagging "determination to awaken those around her" (Linkin 192) - her determination, that is, to identify and resist the subjection that is part and parcel of pastoral technology.19 NOTES 1.

In qualifying her argument, however, Sturrock notes in passing that "protective pastoral" is not without a dark side, since it presupposes the existence of violence and danger - ominous forces which necessitate the institution of "protection" itself - while inadvertently encouraging a per- haps too trusting passivity in those who place their faith in the protective milieu (100, 106). 8. Because of limited space, the ensuing discussion focuses upon Oothoon's relationship with Theotormon.

In his Remarks on Ecclesiastical History (1767), John Jortin notes that the sacrificial lamb of "sin-offering" was necessarily "without bodily spot or blem- ish" (1: 122). 14. Robert Gleckner points to analogues in Blake's own writing to arrive at a conclusion similar to Raine's neoplatonic one. For Gleckner, the swan metaphor recalls Blake's pastoral "Night" (11. 45-48), wherein the speaker is cleansed of earthly impurity via a "wash[ing] in life's river" (E14); and, to a similar end, it anticipates Milton , wherein the eponymous protagonist</page><page sequence="22">22 ISLE "bathe[s] in the Waters of Life to wash off the Not Human (M 41:1; E142).

Watson; E617) is fully in line with Martin Buber's argument that "the task of the genuine prophet was not to predict but to confront man with the alterna- tives of decision" (177). For both Blake and Buber, prophecy emphasizes human agency, the ability to intervene in and change institutions and, there- fore, the course of history. 17. Cf.
