<plain_text><page sequence="1">Confronting Corruption in the Hemisphere: A Sociological Perspective Anthony P. Maingot I. INTRODUCTION THE free-lance writer Claire Sterling has done what academics have so far failed to do: document the fact that corruption and the violence which so often accompanies it, represent a real security threat to the nations of this world (see Sterling, 1984, 1990, 1994). In three data-packed books, Sterling has exposed the ugly, dark side of the waves of money which flow through many major financial systems and, quite literally, flood some of the small states. Even the most jaded student of the Caribbean, for instance, has to take seriously some of her most recent revelations, not the least of which is the following startling assertion: The world's first independent Mafia state emerged in 1993. The sovereign island of Aruba ... proved to belong to the Mafia in fact if not in name. Small islands are not so hard to acquire (Sterling, 1994: 21). While Sterling errs in calling Aruba a sovereign state - its defense and foreign policy are still under control of The Netherlands - her account of how the Caracas-based Cuntrera brothers had managed to penetrate Aruba and buy everything "from hotels . . . to the prime minister . . . "found partial corroboration in the massive investigation of the Sicilian Mafia launched in Italy in the early 1990s. Just before her book Anthony P. Maingot is Visiting Senior Research Associate at the North- South Center and Professor of Sociology at Florida International University. A former editor of HEMISPHERE Magazine, he is the author of numerous articles and books, of which the most recent is THE UNITED STATES AND THE CARIBBEAN (Macmillan, 1994). 49</page><page sequence="2">50 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS appeared, the Italian Carabinieri took the Cuntrera brothers, Paolo and Pasquale, out of Caracas, in handcuffs, to face an Italian court. Up to that point they had functioned as respect- able Venezuelan and Caribbean businessmen.' Claire Sterling has been joined by many others - few, if any, academics however - in warning the world about the threat of organized crime and how corruption converts that threat into an international issue. Anthony Lake, currently US National Security Advisor to the President, speaks of the threats stemming from organized crime and a "nefarious nexus of crime, terrorism and the weapons of mass destruction" (Lake, 1994: 15). Even a cursory survey of the literature on the Caribbean Basin, in the early to mid-1990s, reveals the outlines of a monstrous new menace to the survival of these small states and their larger Latin American neighbors. There are accounts of corrupt banking practices that stretch throughout the Hemisphere (Beaty and Gwynne, 1993; Ehrenfeld, 1992; Donadio, 1983), as well as detailed accounts of region-wide organizations involved in smuggling drugs, guns and aliens.2 Finally, there is the literature which deals specifically with what Sterling calls the Pax Mafiosa: links between the various national criminal cartels that extend across the continent and which are often beyond the reach, and certainly beyond the control, of national crime-fighting forces.3 No one can fail to be dismayed by the apparent unending litany of stories about the social ravages caused by official corruption. This is especially galling when the stories come from societies with scarce resources who are forced to engage in heavy international borrowing to sustain minimum stan- dards of living. To read of levels of illegal capital flight equal to, or larger than, the level of indebtedness which cause such social and political strains is to experience a sense not only of the absurd, but also of the extreme perfidy of these phenomena which come under the rubric of corruption. One is also made aware of how feeble the countermeasures are. Yet, while such emotive and normative reactions are arguably essential if the world is to take a serious interest in this area, such sentiments can only herald the beginning of a serious theoretical analysis</page><page sequence="3">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 51 of the problem. The fundamental task of understanding, and then combatting, the phenomenon of corruption has to be a research exercise little different from the study of other sociological problems.4 II. UTILITY OF A SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH ANY definition of corruption has to incorporate, at a minimum, the notions of wrongly getting an advantage - pecuniary or otherwise - in violation of official duty and the rights of others.5 Definitions are universally found because corruption, however defined, exists everywhere and, in one form and to one degree or another, is condemned and theoretically punishable everywhere. There might be cultural differences in the way "wrongfully" is defined in law and custom, but there are no known cases where there are no definitions of behavior labelled as corrupt. Merely to assert this, however, is to engage in truisms. The issue is how to research this universal phenomenon in a systematic way. The first function of a more systematic, and theoretically self-conscious, approach to corruption is to avoid the pitfalls of two very common fallacies regarding corrupt behavior. The most frequent fallacy stems from the tendency towards personalization: e.g., believing that one thoroughly corrupt individual is the cause of it all. At a more general level, personalization responds to a natural, and very widespread, prurient interest in what people do, rather than to abstract notions of how society functions. The higher the individual's status and, presumably, quotient of power, the greater the propensity to attribute blame. This propensity also flows from the very logical fact that, in much of Latin America, politics often involves an anthropomorphism: the state is perceived and described in terms of the person holding the presidency. In those cases where regimes are identified and characterized in terms of the president's name (viz., peronista in Argentina, calderonista or figuerista in Costa Rica), the tendency to personalize cases of corruption is even stronger. It is also a plausible proposition that in Judeo-Christian societies, person-</page><page sequence="4">52 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS alizing the problem of corruption responds to the propensity to see both redemption and punishment in individual, not systemic, terms. You cannot punish the whole society, but you can mete out "exemplary" punishments. However, it is quite evident that, whatever the origins of the fallacy of personalization, its explanatory power is very limited. The portrayal of General Jose Manuel Noreiga of Panama, for instance, as the personification of all immoralities, illustrates the limitations. For starters: how different was Noriega's modus operandi from what officers of the Panama National Guard had been doing for three decades? How different was the behavior of that Guard from the practices of other sectors: business, banking, civilian politicians? Were they not all in some fashion part of an enterprise?6 On the international level: at what point did the United States change its labelling of Noriega from that of useful "lesser evil" (and, thus, its willingness to "marry" him politically) to one of harmful "total evil"? In other words, just how deviant was Noriega in his national and international geopolitical context? And how did the labelling of that deviance change over time?7 Another fallacy to be avoided is that of odious moral comparisons of whole cultures. North Americans, for example, have long tended to view Latin America as inherently corrupt. Even as culturally perceptive a social scientist as Kalman H. Silvert would claim that, "In only Costa Rica and Chile, of the twelve Latin American countries in which I have had even a little experience, have I found consistent official probity" (Silvert, 1966: 176). It is also the case, however, that from the 19th century onward, Latin Americans also judged the US capitalist culture as profoundly corrupt (see Reed, 1977: 60-63). There are two subsets of specific fallacies about remedial action which often flow from these cultural generalizations. First, that one can impose one's moral codes cross-culturally, i.e., the belief that one can teach other societies specific approaches to probity in public office. The opposite of this optimistic idealism is arguably even more fallacious: the ultimate subjective and relativistic approach, i.e., the notion that it is impossible to pass judgment about probity and</page><page sequence="5">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 53 corruption on other cultures. Such total relativism is evident in Glen Caudill Dealy's assertion that the favoritism, nepotism and graft which characterizes Latin American public and private relations cannot be judged or called corruption by cultural "outsiders." The "insider", he maintains, knows that this system is really "the law of reciprocal favors" (Dealy, 1992: 130), which "foreshadows and reinforces culturewide rationality in Latin America" (Dealy, 1992: 191). The fact is that, while it is difficult to impose moral codes on other cultures in this world of mass communication and globalization of economies (and even of political forms), different cultures are perfectly capable of making the necessary "translation of codes" to form very similar judgments about corruption. What operates is the international demonstration effect Daniel Lerer wrote about three decades ago. Lerer might have merely overstated, not misunderstood, the role of the mass media in creating "a genuine 'world public opinion"' (Lerer, 1964: 52-54). Indeed, those who have compiled wide-ranging studies of corruption show that, though there are certainly cultural differences in definition and adju- dication, there is, nevertheless, a specific area or social problem called corruption with which every society must cope. It is this shared understanding that justifies attempts to formu- late theories of corrupt behavior and the mechanisms for combatting it. "Transparency International," based in Berlin (Germany), is premised on just such a conceptualization. III. OPERATIONALIZING A THEORY OF CORRUPTION THE first problem of any comparative research on corruption is arriving at a definition which lends itself to cross-cultural and cross-national research. The question of arriving at such an operational definition is important for two fundamental reasons. First, given the international dimensions of the threat of crime which feeds on corruption, it is important to discover (1) whether international or at least Hemisphere-wide understandings of meanings exist and (2) whether, how, and why these meanings change over time. Only after this is done can we enquire into how long we can expect the present cycle</page><page sequence="6">54 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS of meanings and attitudes to last. Secondly, there is a necessary relationship between how a practice is defined and the measures which are recommended for its solution. Since, as we hypothesize, the menace is international, the solution has to be equally international. The first task in formulating any operational definition of corruption is to understand that the study of corruption has to proceed on two conceptual levels: first, the attempt to reach some theoretical understanding of what motivates or causes corrupt behavior. Quite distinct, conceptually and empirically, is the need to understand the dynamics behind the cyclical nature of society's concern with corruption. It is hypothesized that while there might well be profound continuities in corrupt behavior, societal responses to this behavior tend to take place in cycles. Decades ago, Walter Lippmann noted not only that in the United States corruption was "endemic", but that there were strong continuities in certain corrupt practices. But Lippmann did not stop there. He argued that no history of corruption was possible, only the history of the exposure of corruption. Lippmann helped us further by noting that expo- sure invariably was merely one sequence in a cycle which alternated between "unsuspecting complacency and violent suspicion" (Lippmann, 1930: 31). What is involved is that the public's perceptions and dispositions to take action, to punish corrupt behavior, change over time. Theories developed to explain corrupt behavior at the individual, or small group, level might not necessarily serve to explain the collective transitions from complacency to indignation and suspicion, and the consequences which flow from these. In other words, the definition of corruption is invariably premised on public perceptions at a given time that the behavior involved is deviant. For similar reasons, and virtually without exception, theories of corruption are derived from theories of deviance. It is in the particular operational expla- nation of what causes that deviance that the theories differ. In fact, we can group the various theories into three general categories often found implicit in popular North American and Latin American-Caribbean explanations of corruption.</page><page sequence="7">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 55 Category No. 1: Theories premised on cultural behavior. Cultural explanations are very common in Latin America and tend to adhere to two well-established theories of criminal behavior, both emphasizing the socialization process. First, the theory of cultural transmission maintains that offend- ers adhere to a unique value system (or subsystem) which endorses, rather than condemns, the deviant behavior. This would mean that Latin American officials are corrupt because there exists a bifurcated moral sense in which corrupt behavior, while in office, is not only not condemned but, on the contrary, is actually approved. One hears such explanations often. In a study done with focus groups in Buenos Aires, "culture" (i.e., "the way we were raised") topped the list of reasons why the society was so corrupt (Araujo Noguera, et al., 1992). Typical is the oft-repeated assertion of Emmanuel Edouard (1890) that to work for the state in Haiti was "to be in politics," which meant - by definition - to be eternally distrustful, false and conniving. It was a particular subcultural norm that to steal from Haitian state revenues "did not engender reprobation, but outright envy" (Edouard, 1890: 42). A very similar attitude was reported for pre-revolutionary Cuba. There was a tendency to dismiss accusations of corruption against high officials by saying that they merely reflected a pervasive culture. "One can steal everything in sight down to the office furniture," wrote Ruby Hart Phillips of the New York Times, "and about the only reaction out of the public is an admiring, 'that's a smart fellow"' (Phillips, 1935: 130-131). Hart Phillips attributed this to the fact that, in Cuba, there was "an entire lack of conscience," which she, as a New Englander, found most disturbing. Even nationalists tended to accept the existence of an official subculture of corruption, but they tended to blame the North Americans for initiating it. "Magoon and the North American Provisional Government," wrote the very nationalis- tic Historian of the City of Habana, "were the ones who perverted and corrupted our administrative customs" (Roig de Leuchsenring, 1923: 138-153).8 In 1933-34, the Cuban people rebelled against their political system. It was, said an official mission sent from the</page><page sequence="8">56 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS US, a rebellion against "irresponsibility, unproductiveness and corruption" (Commission on Cuban Affairs, 1935: 5). Despite that "frustrated revolution", little changed for the better in terms of probity. In fact, affairs might even have gotten worse under the democratically-elected governments of 1944-1952. The most formidable social movement between the revolution of 1933-1934 and the Castro revolution was the anticorruption crusade of Eduardo Chibas whose theme was "Vergilenza contra dinero." (Shame, or indignation, against money). This was a theme which Fidel Castro picked up, making anticorrup- tion one of the three major planks of his 1953 declaration that "History Will Absolve Me" and, subsequently, of the early phases of his revolution. He would later shift strategies and maintain that, in order to eradicate the culture of corruption, one had to eradicate the capitalist system which nurtured and sustained it. A second culturally-based theory is that of differential association: e.g., because of their intimate, small-group inter- action and association with deviants, individuals engage in similar behavior. One often hears that because the big fish are "biting," one should naturally expect the smaller fry to "bite" also. This meaning is contained in the popular Cuban saying, from the period of President Jose Miguel G6mez (1909-1913), that " Tiburon se banay salpica" (when the shark takes a bath, those around him get splashed). Not surprisingly, Gomez' nickname was Tibur6n. This was a version of the trickle-down theory, since it was assumed that there would invariably be residual benefits from corruption at the top. President G6mez, wrote historian Charles E. Chapman in 1927, must be consid- ered one of the best men the republic ever had. To be sure he was a grafter, stealing about $8 million, but even in his corrupt deals he saw to it that the country got at least a little something (Chapman, 1927: 297-316). However, Chapman's final judg- ment on Gomez is also a judgment on Cuban culture: because he did not steal as much as he could, and despite the fact that he would have garnered (and deserved) "unqualified condem- nation" in a country with more wholesome political traditions, in Cuba "it is a question whether, on the whole, [G6mez] does not more nearly merit praise."</page><page sequence="9">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 57 Category No. 2: Theoretical schools which empha- size social conflict or social strain explanations. This approach tends to be popular among more radical interpreters of the Latin American and Caribbean reality. It is assumed that, due to the obstacles to legitimate social mobility and advance- ment presented by the steeply stratified nature of Latin American and Caribbean social structures, there is a propensity to resort to deviant means in order to achieve socially approved goals. This describes, in many ways, Robert K. Merton's "innovator," who has internalized the cultural values of wealth, prestige, power, and (perversely) combines these with the equally acceptable cultural virtues of hard work, cunning, and initiative (Merton, 1968: 195-203). This is the basis of so many "Robin Hood" stories and speculations about the behavior of drug kingpins and the alleged admiration in which they are held by the poor. As popular and useful as these theories may be for the study of particular types of deviance, it cannot be said that they are adequate, in and of themselves, to advance an understand- ing of corruption. Even if they pretend to explain the sources of, or motivations behind, the corrupt act itself, this is only one level of the general problem. Certainly, such theories fail to explain why public attitudes move in cycles of attention to, and indignation at, behavior considered corrupt. Since one cannot explain a variation in behavior logically, through factors which supposedly remain constant (in this case, culture and social structure), these attitudinal cycles require different explana- tions than those provided by Categories 1 and 2 above. Category 3 might offer an approximation. Category No. 3: Theories which emphasize indi- vidual choice. A more operationally useful definition is one which focuses on the individual as a rational actor, one who makes utilitarian choices in a particular social and economic context.9 This involves a double level of theorizing. First, this theory focuses on the individual who, in contemplation of a corrupt act, is able to weigh rationally his moral scruples, fear of official sanctions and public disapproval on the one hand against the potential material gains and psychological gratifica-</page><page sequence="10">58 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS tions provided by the act on the other. Very clearly and evidently, while the desire for gain might be strong, perhaps even consistently so, the legal and moral context is subject to change and, thus, is able to alter the outcome of the calculation. It is possible to place the rational urge for gain in check by the equally rational urge not to be subjected to sanctions, whether legal or social, at home and abroad. Thus the burden of research is placed not just on the individual actor, but also on the context within which that actor makes his or her choices, on the particular opportunities and temptations, the attitude toward corruption, which might exist at a particular time. This emphasis on individual choices holds even if one takes into account more macroeconomic versions of the rational actor theory such as "enterprise theory." The latter maintains that when there is strong demand for a commodity or decision, the very forces of supply and demand make it easy for even law-abiding individuals who have access to the desired commodities (or who can make the necessary deci- sions), to stray into the illegal part of the supply chain. The very concept of an "enterprise" indicates that we are not talking about limited opportunities for corrupt action but about a whole gamut ranging from the legal to the illegal. Smith, who focuses on criminal enterprises, explains this controversial approach to deviance by arguing that economic activity takes place across a broad spectrum that includes both legitimate and illegitimate businesses. There is a range of behavior along which any business can be conducted, and legality is an arbitrary point on that range. This point can be shifted by passing new laws, or promulgating regulations, but these do not in themselves change behavior; they might merely make behavior that was formerly legal, illegal - or vice versa (Smith, 1980: 358-386). In some ways, this approach is at the heart of the theory of the former president of Colombia, Alfonso L6pez Michelsen, that the drug trade is Latin America's first successful "multina- tional" business precisely because the trade is such a large national and international enterprise. As such, it has many legal</page><page sequence="11">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 59 aspects which, in turn, attract a number of other activities, not all of which are necessarily illegal in and of themselves, even though the enterprise is a despicable business as a whole (Lopez Michelsen, 1988: 35). This approach also forms the basis of the philosophy of the financial secretary of the Cayman Islands, the largest offshore banking center in the Caribbean, who notes that there is money-laundering everywhere in the world, in company with the majority of legitimate money handled by the offshore industry. Since this is so, he then asks the rhetorical question: "why is it that, whatever we do in Cayman, perfection is expected of us?" (quoted in Maingot, 1994: 176). Whatever the theoretical validity of the enterprise ap- proach to deviance, the fact is that the United States has been actively trying to eliminate the legal, but gray, areas which exist in many multinational criminal enterprises. In 1986, the Anti- Drug Abuse Act targeted the banking system. The traditional distinctions between "deliberate intent to violate the law" and "indifference to legal requirements" were, for all practical purposes, abolished. Nevertheless, the value of an approach which combines rational actor theory with more economic (enterprise) theories is that it enables us to understand why so many officials still opt for honesty even in the face of powerful, almost all-encompassing, pressures (both macroeconomic and individual) towards deviance and corruption. It is evident that the other side of the calculation - moral sentiments and fear of public disapproval - must carry a powerful counter weight. Indeed, a plausible argument could be made that, worldwide but perhaps especially in the Western Hemisphere, we have entered the indignation phase of the cycle. Given the globalization of economic enterprises (and their reputations or goodwill), the fear of losing status and/or reputation has both national and international dimensions.10 The same forces that increase temptation and facilitate the globalization of crime also operate to enhance their opposite: probity in office. All this is to say that, at the present phase of the cycle, the calculations in individual decision-making have become more and more complex and, in more cases than we might suspect, even heartrending.</page><page sequence="12">60 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS IV. THE PRESENT CYCLE THERE can be little doubt that, in this Hemisphere, the cycle at present is in a phase which combines two elements: (1) the existence of a multifaceted and multinational enterprise, fueled by the drug trade and fostering corruption, which is accompanied by (2) a new awareness of, and indignation at, that corruption which is also multinational. In the last two decades, the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean have witnessed an unprecedented wave of protests against official corruption. It is important to note the process in the US: the major market for drugs and of dirty money is now at the center of the counterattack on crime and corruption. During the 1970s, the major investigations of corruption among US multinationals took place in the context of the deep social crisis provoked by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. What had been regarded as a virtual necessity - paying bribes to meet international competition and conform to national and interational customs - suddenly became a matter for congressional investigation. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 was enacted after two major scandals had placed the United States in an embarrassing international situation with many of its allies: (1) the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation payments to prominent foreign government offi- cials, and (2) the revelation that the Chairman of United Brands had paid the president of Honduras $2,500,000 to reduce a proposed tax on bananas. The Honduran president was overthrown, the Chairman of United Brands committed sui- cide. Subsequent investigations by the US Senate Banking Committee and the Subcommittee on Multinational Corpora- tions, as well as the official investigations in the foreign countries, gave the concept of the bribe universal legal significance. The scandals contributed to the general atmo- sphere of indignation which brought about two high-level resignations: first of US Vice-President Spiro Agnew and then of President Richard Nixon. In 1978, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, a law that provides for the appoint- ment of independent prosecutors to investigate allegations of official impropriety. Such is the fervent interest of the press -</page><page sequence="13">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 61 and presumably the public - in issues of probity, that what to a foreigner might seem a triviality is considered, by a 1990s United States, to merit considerable political scrutiny. Witness the Whitewater inquiry into the pre-administration activities of the Clinton family, which has thrown a pall over the present US administration and refuses to go away. Additional cases from the Caribbean and Latin America will serve to illustrate the general assertion that the concern with official corruption extends throughout the Hemisphere. Few regimes have been investigated for corruption more frequently than that of Lynden Pindling in the Bahamas. The various commissions of enquiry never quite found Pindling personally guilty of any specific cases of corruption. They have revealed, however, widespread official corruption; so much, in fact, that many an outsider repeatedly expected that Pindling's Progressive Liberal Party, in power since 1973, would suffer the electoral consequences. That was not to be. Pindling won three elections since 1973 by comfortable margins despite serious charges of malfeasance. Though expecting to be reelected again in 1992, he was roundly defeated by a party which promised to bring in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Scotland Yard, the Canadian Mounted Police, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to return the nation to "an acceptable level of accountability." Whereas, in the past, international scrutiny never coincided with local indignation, in 1992 there occurred a neat dovetailing of the two, causing a powerful political impact. A similar case was the apparent unassailability of Prime Minister Vere Bird and the governing Antigua Labour Party. They appeared invulnerable to accusations of corruption until a one-man commission of enquiry from the United Kingdom (UK), plus investigations by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the US Senate, blew the cover off a scandal- ously corrupt government. Revelations included the sale of ten tons of Israeli weapons - purchased for the 90-man Antigua army- to the Medellin drug cartel. Because of the international outcry, the government of Vere Bird was badly shaken, and the Prime Minister was unable to impose his choice of successor.</page><page sequence="14">62 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS The Antigua Labour Party did manage to win the national elections again, though under the leadership ofVere Bird's son, who had broken with his father and ran on a campaign that promised to clean house. The Bahamas and Antigua cases tend to support the proposition that charges of corruption initiated from outside the country are politically effective only when they coincide with similar sentiments at the national level. It is not so important to discover which inspires which as it is to know when they dovetail, or overlap, and the impact these have domestically. On the other hand, the case of Trinidad and Tobago (T/T) provides illustration of a situation where this overlap has not taken place, despite a significant anticorrup- tion climate both at home and abroad.1 The situation of corruption in the island's security forces, particularly their suspected involvement in the drug trade, had been the subject of an inquiry which produced a report submitted to Parliament (the Scott Drug Report). Nothing ever came of that report. By the early 1990s, the evidence of drug- related criminality, in which members of the security forces were active participants, had become so serious that the government solicited outside help. The United Kingdom responded to a request from the T/T government by sending a high-level investigative team from the New Scotland Yard. While it found that corruption was widespread within the police force, its report concluded that a thorough investigation was not possible for three reasons: (1) that, even after seven 4-week tours, the British detectives were still not sure whom they could trust within the Police Service; (2) that, since they had no clout with the police (and were given none by the government), they were unable to compel testimony, and (3) that, and worst of all, their work was being actively sabotaged by corrupt higher-ups. As the foreign investigators put it, There had been promotions, transfers, and acting ap- pointments, which had the effect of giving a clear message to the honest element in the police service that the old and corrupt guard was still very much in control (Seaby, 1993: paragraph 8.4.1.).</page><page sequence="15">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 63 On 20 June 1994, the Minister of National Security of Trinidad and Tobago reported to Parliament that major parts of the documentation and evidence collected by the New Scot- land Yard had disappeared. His explanation was typical of that of political bureaucrats which some officials of democratically- elected governments use to explain their incompetence or incapacity in the face of organized crime: That [the loss of the Scotland Yard documents] is the kind of problem that I would find it extremely difficult to lay blame at the footsteps of any Government, because the Government does not have control over the police files, the court files, and that sort of thing (Sunday Guardian, 1994: 6). Trinidadians would be excused for being cynical, given their knowledge that none of the over one hundred officers identified as corrupt by the New Scotland Yard Report had been sanctioned at the same time that the Attorey-General was discussing new bills to deal with the nature of bail and the use of one-way mirrors in identification parades (The Trinidad Guardian, 1994: 14). A former Minister of National Security commented on the disingenuousness of the goverment's excuses at a time when the drug problem had taken on "octopus-like proportions" and the Police Service appeared to have "careened out of control" (Padmore, 1994). Our theory allows us to hypothesize that, given the pressures existing at both the international and domestic levels, it is only a matter of time before the two will mesh and a serious campaign to "clean house" in Trinidad and Tobago will begin that will wash away not just the criminals, but also many a politician, private sector individual, and Police Service officer. This has been occurring in too many other places in the Hemisphere for any one country to remain immune for very long. Many of the anticorruption campaigns in Latin America and the Caribbean have resulted in the trial (and even impeachment) of sitting or former presidents. In some ways, one can point to the trial, in civil court in 1987, of the former president of the Dominican Republic, Salvador Jorge Blanco, and an ex-Secretary of the Armed Forces on charges of</page><page sequence="16">64 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS corruption as one of the first of an extraordinary series of movements against corruption that were soon to become endemic in the rest of the Hemisphere. Not surprisingly, the Dominicans - who followed the proceedings on radio and television for over two years - baptized it the "Trial of the Century" (Gonzalez Canahuate, 1992). The Dominican case was particularly important because the action began, and was conducted in the civil tribunals, as a felony matter. In most other cases in the Hemisphere, the usual procedure is to conduct political trials in the Congress, much as an impeach- ment action would be carried out by the US Congress. In the cases that involved two other former presidents, Jaime Lusinchi of Venezuela and Alan Garcia of Peru, the actions against them were begun in the Congress in the midst of definite political overtones. In other locales, the actions were taken against presidents still in office: Fernando Collor de Mello in Brazil and against Carlos Andres Perez in Venezuela. While these cases were the most notable (or at least received the most attention), other incidents took place which tend also to corroborate the thesis of an unprecedented, Hemispheric-wide reaction to corrupt governmental prac- tices.12 In Costa Rica, a parliamentary committee reported on widespread corruption in the judiciary and a special committee within the Partido de Liberacfon Nacional (PLN) expelled one its founding members and one of Costa Rica's most popular ex- Presidents - Daniel Oduber - on allegations of association with drug lords. In Colombia, the charges lodged against officehold- ers (sitting and past) were both so numerous and so serious that an important weekly publication named corruption as "a disease to which the country appears to have become accus- tomed" (Semana, 1991). Recording the numerous incidents of corruption which reached right into President Carlos Menem's family and presidential entourage, journalist Mario Diament concluded that the difference between corruption in Argentina and that in the United States is that, in the latter, it takes place within in the system, whereas in Argentina "it is the system" (Diament, 1991: 20). Such understandable cris de coeurcan be heard throughout the Hemisphere. They are symptomatic of</page><page sequence="17">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 65 the collective indignation at forms of behavior that are viewed as corrosive and pernicious, an indignation that is heightened when, and because, they are seen as deeply entrenched in official circles. It is important that the international community respond to these national campaigns. History tells us that if the international context had been more sympathetic to the anticor- ruption campaign of Cuba's Eduardo Chibas, he might have had an easier time proving some of his charges of corrupt flights of capital overseas, especially to the United States. The history of Cuba might have taken a different turn. The fact is that international condemnation and persecu- tion of corrupt practices at home or abroad can lend significant weight to anticorruption campaigns in individual countries. However, such international moral indignation must be rein- forced with actual crime-fighting assistance. Any definition of political action combines political will with political capabili- ties. The reality is that many small societies have neither the investigatory capabilities nor the judicial means to deal with this international menace. One way of doing this without injury to national sentiments and the laws of these small countries is to understand how a sociological approach to corruption, com- bined with elements of their legal systems, can fit into this new era of the internationalization of corruption and violence.

CONCLUSION: THE LAW OF NECESSITY AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE brief review of recent stirrings in Costa Rica, a country not particularly known for its ongoing involvement in organized crime, will introduce the use of one aspect of the legal system which can be crucial in combatting international corruption: the law of necessity.13 During the first half of 1994, Costa Ricans were faced with three situations which, in many ways, reflect the enormous variation in, and complexity of, what generally falls under the rubric of "official corruption."</page><page sequence="18">66 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS In August 1994, Costa Ricans were made aware of the dimensions of the losses of the oldest bank, the state-owned Banco Anglo-Costarricense: an unprecedented US$100 mil- lion. The major losses came through a complex set of transactions in Venezuelan public debt bonds handled by a Chilean stockbrokerage. Since the Venezuelan banking sys- tem was itself on the verge of collapse due to alleged malfeasance, Costa Ricans could be excused for making linkages between the two crises. On 21 September, all the members of the Board of Directors who had anything to do with the losses were arrested and jailed under charges of "fraud and illicit enrichment." The Minister of the Presidency put the judicial action in context by declaring that "it satisfied the public clamor for justice" (Soley, 1994). The public was also clamoring to know more about a sensational case of drug- running and murder that was taking place in the midst of the Organizaci6n de Investigaci6n Judicial (OIJ), a specialized unit set up to fight organized crime. Several agents, with proven links to Colombia's Cali cartel, were arrested and jailed. In both of these cases, Costa Rica's investigatory and justice system appeared to be working to the satisfaction of most citizens. However, state actions in a third set of criminal activities with international ramifications did not go that smoothly. On 28 May 1994, Costa Rica's OIJ arrested six Venezuelan bank robbers who had been operating in Costa Rica for over a year. During that time, they had held up a number of banks and armored cars, killing several guards and gathering 156 million colones in loot. They had also opened up two business corporations and a restaurant, using bank loans to do so. When finally apprehended, the authorities found in their possession a veritable arsenal, along with records of their contacts with important members of the business community and the police force. A judicial process was begun. But then the newly-installed president of Costa Rica,Jose Maria Figueres, ordered (8 June 1994) the six extradited to Venezuela, where they were wanted on multiple charges of assault, theft, murder and kidnapping. This executive action immediately unleashed a judicial and constitutional storm. The case illustrates some</page><page sequence="19">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 67 of the difficulties that democracies encounter in attempting to take swift and effective measures against crime. The Executive justified its actions on the grounds of the Estado de Necesidad (state of necessity) argument. In Costa Rican law, this argument assumes that, when (1) a real and immediate threat to the state and to society exists, and (2) there is no other means of dealing with the situation reasonably available, the state can then take whatever action it deems necessary to defend certain principles and rights even if, in the process, they may violate other principles and rights. The Executive based its argument on two sets of facts: (1) The fundamental responsibility of the Executive branch, through its ministries of Public Safety, Justice and the Minister of the Presidency, is to safeguard the welfare of the people; and (2) Given the limitations of the Costa Rica security system and the organized and professional nature and interna- tional contacts of the criminals, the Presidency could not fully guarantee the safety of the citizens. The dangers of a rescue mission, or the exactment of retribution against peaceful citizens by associates of the six, were too great (La Naci6n, 1994a and 1994c). Neither the Supreme Court nor many other jurists, and certainly not the main opposition party, accepted the government's argument. The Supreme Court decided unani- mously that the president and the pertinent ministers had all engaged in abuso de autoridad (abuse of authority), a charge which carried a possible jail term of from 3-24 months. They were also ordered to pay damages to the six Venezuelans who had been expelled (La Naci6n, 1994b). The Court rested the burden of its decision on three points: (1) since the accused had entered through the nation's airport several times, they prob- ably enjoyed a legal status, (2) they were already being subjected to judicial process, which this executive action disrupted, and further, (3) even if there were grounds for argument on the basis of an Estado de Necesidad, only the courts could make that argument, not the Executive branch.</page><page sequence="20">68 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS The response of Costa Rican society was predictable. Even as legal scholars supported the Court, the public solidly supported the president. The reaction is predictable because it bears a superficial (though, for all that, no less influential) similarity to other cases in the Hemisphere - viz., Alberto Fujimori in Peru and Rafael Caldera in Venezuela - where the Executive has taken unilateral, decisive action on the ground of a "state of necessity" argument and garnered the support of a majority of the public in the process. This is a trend that needs to be analyzed. Certainly, actions based on the law or principle of "necessity" need to be analyzed in light of both the new threats to, and limitations on acting alone of, the smaller states. To be sure, this principle cannot serve as a carte blanche to any and every arbitrary action of the Executive, no matter how popular it might be at the time. One has to be concerned that public impatience with democratic procedure and the capacity to poll the popular will immediately will incline executives to agree with Niccolo Machiavelli that "When the act accuses, the result excuses." In other words, the "necessity" argument cannot be allowed to become little more than the legendary dilemma of "dirty hands" that has been posed by thinkers from Plato to Machiavelli to the present: a Prince's right (even obligation) to commit improprieties for the public good. Nor should this be confused with the state's right to declare states of emergency or of exception. The idea is judicial formulation to meet a new type of criminal threat: internationalized corruption and vio- lence. It has to have solid grounds in both national and international law, as well as in sociological theory. As it turns out, there are solid grounds on which to make this argument. In US law the concept of necessity differs qualitatively from that of the necessary. The latter is susceptible to various meanings, from the merely convenient to the absolutely physically inevitable. Necessity, on the other hand involves "a condition arising out of circumstances that compels a certain course of action" (see Bykofsky v. Borough). It is the same argument used to justify an act of self-defense: where there is</page><page sequence="21">MAINGOT: CONFRONTING CORRUPTION IN THE HEMISPHERE 69 a condition arising out of circumstances that compels a certain course of action in a reasonable manner and with no other acceptable choice. A similar definition exists in international law, where a "state of necessity" implies that The international wrongfulness of an act of a state not in conformity with what is required of it by an international obligation is precluded if the State had no other means of safeguarding an essential State interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril" (Interational Law, 1987). It is clear that there is ample opportunity in international and domestic law to appeal to self-defence or law of necessity arguments. It is also evident that, at least in this Hemisphere, we are in a cycle which has two dimensions: (1) an increased level and complexity of corruption through its interationaliza- tion, and (2) a heightened awareness of the need to take drastic action to counteract this corruption. The small state is often selected by international criminal organizations precisely be- cause of its limited crime-fighting capabilities. It is, therefore, the small state in particular which can make the most effective use of the principle of self-defense or the argument of necessity. Since, as hypothesized, involvement in corruption is a choice made by rational people, the law of necessity augments the probability of punishment and sanctions, thus adding weight to that side of the calculation. If properly used domestically and coordinated internationally, the law of neces- sity could be a major weapon in the war against corruption. NOTES 1.
