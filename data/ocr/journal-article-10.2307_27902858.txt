<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INVISIBLE PAW* I If I have erred in giving to natural selection great power ... in having exag gerated its power. ... I have at least, as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations.1 One of Darwin's purposes in writing The Origin of Species was to rebut the doctrine of separate creations. Moreover, the argument he was chiefly concerned with?which was both his target and the model of his own argument?was the familiar argument from design. In one well-known version of this argument we are asked to consider the human eye, to consider its complex design and the functioning of its various parts, and ask ourselves if it is any less wonderful a contrivance than a telescope.2 Now we would never suppose that telescopes came into existence through the concurrence of physical forces; neither then ought we to think this of the eye which is equally complex. As surely as the telescope is witness to the ingenuity of man, so is the human eye witness to the greater ingenuity of God. And if a creator is responsible for the eye, he must also have created the species to whom that organ belongs. Darwin clearly felt the force of this appeal, and writes: It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process.3 The eye is complex and wonderful; yet, Darwin argues, the analogy with the telescope is not compelling. The argument from design begins with an expression of wonder? wonder that the eye should be so excellently fitted to its purpose, so intricate ly adjusted and connected with the brain as to permit us to see. Such an ex traordinary configuration must be accounted for somehow, unlike a rock or puddle of water which demand no explanation.4 And what other explanation is there? From the absence of alternatives, the doctrine of creation draws in creased plausibility. Darwin addressed the lack of an alternative explanation. To fill it meant of course to accept the premise that the world of nature is wonderful, that</page><page sequence="2">230 ELIZABETH WOLGAST biological things are fitted to their lives in ingenious and intricate ways. Darwin speaks of the perfection of nature, and admits that the challenge is difficult: To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.5 But, he argues, the absurdity is only apparent. We need not invoke God's in vention even for this. For if we suppose a nerve sensitive to light and then imagine "that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way . . . tend to produce a distincter image," and that, as variations are produced, "natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement," then we can imagine reaching the present state of perfection, given a sufficiently long time. "A living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man."6 If this account provides for the development of the human eye, the argument from design has a competitor. As that argument asks: What other explanation can be given for this marvelous device? Darwin answers: Natural Selection. Darwin models his argument consciously and deliberately upon the theological argument. His, like the other, begins with a wonderful premise, and needs to. He even employs the language of the design argument in order to show that nature may seem to have purposes while its workings are not really the reflection of purpose. But there is danger as well as cleverness in this strategy, and Darwin admits later that he was unable to annul the influence of my former belief. . . that each species had been purposely created; and this led to my tacitly assuming that every detail of struc ture, excepting rudiments, was of some special, though unrecognized service.7 As we shall see later, this is a crucial difficulty in his theory. For the moment, however, it is interesting to see how closely his argument holds to the form of the argument it is meant to replace. Consider the options that lay before Darwin. The argument from design offered a single explanation of how things come to be as well-ordered as we find them. Under that explanation, no room is left for supplementary hypotheses of biology. The single principle of creation was comprehensive, exclusive. To displace it then Darwin needs to provide a substitute. For sup pose that he gives a principle which accounts for only some of the facts; the objection will be speedy: "But you have not explained all the facts, and those left unexplained stand as proof that we must posit creation."8 What was</page><page sequence="3">THE INVISIBLE PAW 231 needed was a principle just as comprehensive and universal, which would also give the form of all explanations in advance. This was the task assigned to Natural Selection. It was a formidable challenge, to replace God's power in the natural world with something else. First of all, Darwin needed to accept the view of nature implied by the premise; second, he needed a principle which was in one sense omnipotent and which, without having purposes, could act as if it had them. At least this is what Darwin took his task to be. II We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seed, and are constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey.9 It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.10 Darwin introduces his theory by telling us a good deal about the in fluence that breeders have on the characteristics of a breed. He quotes an authority on breeding (Youatt) who speaks of the principle of selection (of breeding toward desirable characteristics) as that which enables the agriculturalist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.11 A breed is more or less plastic, giving rise to variations which can be en couraged or discouraged at the breeder's will. The plasticity of a species is an important part of Darwin's argument, and is expressed in the underlying fact of variation. We have breeders who improve their breeds, then, thanks to variations occurring naturally; what is needed is a natural force which does the same thing. Just such a principle is natural selection: Natural Selection ... is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as im measurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.12 Here is an inversion of the argument from design. As that argument com pares nature to craft, concluding that no merely natural forces could have produced such complex organs as the eye, Darwin proposes that no mere art could compete with the capabilities of nature! By what presumption can he</page><page sequence="4">232 ELIZABETH WOLGAST take this to be apparent? To answer this we must look at the ideas of Adam Smith and Malthus, both of whose works were known to Darwin, and to both of whom he refers as authorities.13 Smith is most famous for his theory of trade, a view which implied that the best policy a government could adopt was one of absolute freedom of trade. Where a government was inclined to protect its local industires against competition from foreign producers, it needed to foresee that the end result would be the raising of prices for its citizenry and consequently a decline in living standards. The government was best advised to keep hands off and let the economic forces work their way. Though there might be pain in the short run with industries failing, in the long run the community would fare better and the country's industries would be strong and competitive. Let everyone pursue his own advantage, Smith recommended, and it will be as if an "invisi ble hand" was guiding matters to an optimal result?a result better than any the government could achieve with even the most thoughtful and well meaning interference. The forces of trade are more efficient in producing economic benefits than any political programs. In Darwin's words, Smith is proposing that the power of nature is superior to the power of art. Making an inference parallel to Smith's, Malthus argued against government policies of social support; in short, the amelioration of poverty and care of the indigent.15 He argued that humans will in any case reproduce to their maximum ability, having always the maximum children in a family. This leads to overpopulation and an intolerable demand on food supplies, which in turn will lead to disease and death for those unable to earn enough to provide for their larger families. Ultimately the population increase will sub side, it will level off, and there will be enough resources again for all. If government intervenes, it encourages a higher rate of reproduction than is supportable with the available food supply. Through its well-meaning action the government thus actually increases the misery of death and sickness, i.e., by postponing the time when the disproportion of people to food should be faced. The wise policy for government, then, is no positive action at all?to let the path of self-interest intersect with the available food resources in recur ring cycles. Though unsteady, this "solution" is ultimately the least painful and the most stable condition the society can hope for. By trying to set minimum wages or supporting the indigent, government only interferes with its workings to produce greater misery. The assumption that every being reproduces to its maximum level is adopted by Darwin without change: There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that,if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair.16</page><page sequence="5">THE INVISIBLE PAW 233 And from this the Malthusian conclusion follows: As more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.'7 It should be remarked that the competition for food which Malthus posited for the human population has now been broadened to signify struggles between species and even struggles with physical conditions. I will return to consider this point in detail later. The analogy between Darwin's argument and Malthus' is superficially very close: the tendency to fecundity and the struggle to survive?competition for food?which results from it, and the eventual control of population growth by disease and starvation. Like the invisible hand of Adam Smith, the invisible paw of nature works efficiently and leads inexorably toward its end, as do the forces of economics and reproduction in Malthus. In all three theories, art cannot compete with nature. Furthermore, while Smith and Malthus used their theories to support a laissez faire policy by government, the analogous purpose of Darwin's argument can be said to be the displace ment of God as governor of natural things. Thus far the parallels are striking. Having drawn out these similarities, however, I must remark an irony in Darwin's willingness to model his theory on those of Malthus and Adam Smith. For Darwin begins his argument with recognition of the fitness, the wonderful connectedness of natural things, complex mechanisms fitted to ex acting tasks and serving purposes useful for the survival of creatures. From such facts the invocation of a purpose or something very like purpose seems to flow naturally, the questions remaining being what kind, and how it works. But to serve this role Darwin invokes something as little estimable as the ser pent in the garden?the struggle of beings to survive a hazardous and at best marginal existence. To see the irony, consider the effect had Malthus set out to explain the wonders of human social life with his population hypotheses! For Malthus, there is no bright face on the population issue.18 There is only the grim and depressing fact that, no matter what one does, many people will die of disease and starvation. Darwin himself was perhaps aware of the in congruity of his explanation with the facts to be explained, and so leads us from the "face of nature bright with gladness" to the unpleasant way in which the perfect order is maintained, as if to convince us that he was not leaving his original premise entirely behind. Yet it is hard to avoid the impression that the argument which began in wonder and admiration of the natural world has now come to a sad end.</page><page sequence="6">234 ELIZABETH WOLGAST III I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.19 Nature is a Great Breeder, proceeding in her own way to select and improve the breeds, preserving useful traits and letting others disappear. She works like a human breeder, but on a grander scale. But lest we be too easily captured into thinking that Nature, with her purposes and power, is not very different from God, we need to remember that the instrument at her hand is the struggle to survive?a universal struggle which alone saves the world from overfecundity. Let each individual pursue its interest, he might have said, and the result will resemble a marvelous and thoughtful plan. Malthus has been criticized for some of his assumptions, including the idea that the food supply is fixed and the assumption that humans tend to reproduce at a maximal rate. Under these assumptions, a society must be seen as the setting for a deadly serious sort of musical chairs, a game in which one person gains at the expense of someone else. Not everyone can win, so the tardy and weak, those lacking energy or determination, will lose mortally, while those who are strong, competitive, energetic, and quick to seize oppor tunities, will flourish. This picture of the "struggle to survive" seemed to be the model Darwin was looking for in nature. We need to look closely, however, at how such a struggle works in the natural world. By "the struggle to exist" Darwin says he meant a variety of things, including dependence of one being on another, and including ... not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. ... A plant on the edge of a desert is aaid to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground.20 His use does seem, as he says it is, "large and metaphorical." Consider some of the things it includes. It includes a seed struggling on the ground, for one. Now there is a sense in which we say a plant struggles to survive a drought, turning limp and brown though still alive, and reviving when the rains come. We may even say it has won its struggle, although what it did was simply endure. This use of 'struggling' is certainly metaphorical, patterned by anthropomorphic think ing on the struggle of a patient to recover. Of such a patient we say that he</page><page sequence="7">THE INVISIBLE PAW 235 fights against disease, refuses to give up and eventually wins when he takes a turn for the better. But even this is a kind of metaphor as it applies to patients under sedation, inactive, medicated and restrained in a hospital. But ac cepting such metaphorical struggles, can the term be extended to allow that seeds struggle to germinate? Do eggs struggle to be fertilized? Do chicks struggle to be conceived? There is something wrong with the subjects of these "struggles" which even enthusiastic anthropomorphism cannot rescue. So one difficulty in Darwin's use of 'struggling to exist' is that it is applied where no discernible activity is taking place, much less anything that looks like a struggle. And as we shall see, the tendency to speak in terms of an activity or process where there is none constitutes a wider difficulty for Darwin. Leaving seeds aside, one can certainly speak of a beached sea creature struggling to regain the sea. And one can surely speak of people struggling against poverty, maneuvering to get the necessaries of life and keep their creditors pacified. And there are struggles by weak or infirm things to keep going and so survive. There is, then, plenty of struggling for survival in the world of nature including humankind. But looking back at the model of Malthus we ask, Are these struggles competitions! Does the seed really compete for the chance to germinate? Against what? Does the poor man compete to keep the utilities turned on? Does a whale compete to get himself into the water again? Certainly this sort of language misrepresents. Then what shall we say of the Malthusian model here?the model of com petition among men for food? Even taken metaphorically it doesn't apply to the above examples. But some cases surely serve Darwin's purposes better. Suppose that two animals, e.g., lions, are fighting over a carcass. They are competing over which shall have it, they threaten one another with injury until one of them backs down. One wins, the other loses, and the loser goes without this par ticular meal. Is this competition a clear case of the struggle to survive? It's not clear. The winner certainly has his desire and will have a satisfied ap petite, but is the loser now threatened with starvation? We have no way of in ferring this unless food is in short supply; and even then to call this kind of competition a struggle for survival is an exaggeration. The struggle here which is really a form of competition is not a good instance of the struggle to survive. Animals of various species compete very hard for dominance and a place in the pecking order, and the way they go about it can be very fierce and threatening. Thev competition has clear winners and losers, moreover, and privileges concerned with food and mating seem justifiable prizes. But such struggles are not directly connected with survival, nor does the intensity of the struggles seem to express the determination of individuals to survive. The subject of the competition is quite different.</page><page sequence="8">236 ELIZABETH WOLGAST Take another case: Suppose a lion to be stalking a rabbit which it catches. Or take an eagle descending on a prey, or a snake attacking a mouse. These seem just the kind of examples Darwin would have us use when he speaks of the darker side of nature's happy face. Are these true examples of the Malthusian struggle for life, the competition for crucial resources? For the analogy to hold, the lion and the rabbit should seek the same food? otherwise what should a competition be about? Yet clearly this doesn't work; nor does it make much sense to speak of the rabbit competing with the lion at all, any more than of the egg competing or struggling with the eagle. These various creatures make an effort to get their food?you can call that a strug gle. But they don't struggle against one another or compete with one another in this effort, or do so only rarely. The predator and his prey are not involved in the same game, you might say, where food is concerned. Malthus' model supposes that there is one food supply which all humans in the laboring classes compete for. Exporting the model to the natural world, then, carries the implication that the lion and the rabbit cannot both have their dinners. But since the lion's dinner is rabbit, it is necessary that the rab bit should have its own food supply. It is necessary that the one species should succeed in its quest for food in order that the other should succeed in its. The natural world, then, is full of interdependence, symbiosis, and that is to say that the game is not like musical chairs. This is perhaps the most striking flaw in Darwin's use of Malthus' work on population as a model for the process of natural selection. What I have said does not deny that in a condition of drought there is often too little of a food source, say grass, to go around, and the first to eat may deprive others of their means of sustenance.There is a kind of rough and bitter competition in this situation such as there was said to be among the Ik, and the lives of many species can be altered by it. But the normal situation is not one in which every blade of grass has been eaten by something; more usually there is plenty of food for prey, and their main concern is the hunger of their predators. But this is not a competition between them in any sense of the word. Nor is it clearly a model drawn from human society. I conclude that Darwin used 'struggle for existence' too broadly and, taking Malthus as his guide, too easily identified the struggle with a competi tion. Even his own examples seem doubtful: Does the seed left on the ground struggle to germinate? How does it? Does it struggle against the weather, against the seed next to it, struggle for sun? Once it has germinated, the idea of its struggling makes some sense, but not before. Similarly, does an infant struggle to get appropriate care in its early life, struggle against neglect? Someone in the arctic may struggle to get to his destination, but does he struggle against hypothermia? A male may struggle to have an opportunity to copulate, but is he struggling to reproduce?</page><page sequence="9">THE INVISIBLE PAW 237 When Darwin tells us how the birds idly singing round us are, in feeding, really destroying life, he is not showing us either a struggle to exist or a com petition. Imagine the seed or insect holding up its end of the contest! Also the metaphor of struggling to survive doesn't fit the consumption of life by other life, since their struggles are for different resources. The problem is Darwin's hasty importation of Malthus' assumptions about human reproduction and food supply?assumptions needing criticism in that context?into a world where they are even less appropriate. If competition and the struggle to sur vive are not coincident in the human world, even less are they in the larger world of creatures and plants. The model Darwin uses implies that, in the great competition of nature, the winner of the competition is also the winner in the struggle to survive, and the loser loses the survival game. In such a way does Natural Selection work to improve the breeds, giving us in every breed a group of winners while the losers perish. The identification of winner in competition with winner in the survival struggle gives Natural Selection the character of purpose, of improv ing and selecting as if there were really a Great Breeder at work behind the scenes. It follows that Nature loves a winner, and that winners represent the same kind of merit as a champion canine does in the show arena. Yet something in this consequence is clearly awry: The highly bred dog does not get to be best by competing or taking what others require. The Great Breeder needs to be thought about more critically. If one considers what factors influence the survival of a creature it is hard to begin to count them. For some, maternal care may be the first in im portance; health and speed count too; cooperation comes in somewhere, and learning?being willing to learn; and even avoiding struggle can be helpful. Chance and luck count, for the eagle may not care which mouse he comes upon first or which egg he carries. If one now stops to ask: Where does com petition fit in?, one might be inclined to answer that it doesn't. For privileges and respect, competition may be crucial?but for survival? It might be best to leave that question open. Darwin's world of nature could be described as a big, competitive society. That's understandable, since he used Malthus' assumptions regarding society to explain the workings of Natural Selection. It could hard ly come as a surprise therefore, if Darwin's theory of the natural world were later used as a model for a theory about the social one, as it was by Spencer among others?if the high regard that Nature has for winners, and her presumed love of competitions, were reflected in a social view proclaiming that all must be for the best in the most individualistic and competitive society. But it is interesting that such a conclusion was not Darwin's own, as we shall see below.21</page><page sequence="10">238 ELIZABETH WOLGAST III When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances . . . nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen;... how far more interesting ... will the study of nature become.22 Darwin recommends that we look at a complex biological structure in terms of its history, analogous to the history of a building or a machine, hav ing stages of development and contributions to it. Like the theologians he sees the features of nature as devices serving purposes. The history of the organism or organ, then, must contain within it an account of its design. How does the notion of adaptation make such an explanation plausible? That is the subject of this section. Nature the Great Breeder works to improve strains, never to weaken them. Natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifica tions at a different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species.23 Natural selection will work to the advantage of the species, Darwin argues, for if a change is injurious, the species will become extinct! The reasoning is eerie and question begging: Natural Selection works for the best by either improving a species or bringing about its extinction. From the viewpoint of the species the choice is not indifferent. Yet like the human breeders whom she outperforms, Nature has no interest in the unfit. It is as if she gave to every creature the threat: Adapt or perish. Let us look more closely at this notion of adaptation, for I believe it contains a crucial ambiguity. Frequently, as in the passage above, Darwin speaks of modifications of species, and when these are favorable they are called adaptations. A creature can be adapted to its environment in countless ways, in many dimensions: the color of its feathers, the shape of its beak, its manner of hiding, its propensity to hibernate, its quickness and its care of its young. All these things can be thought of in terms of their fittingness to the life that the creature lives and the environment it inhabits. If a creature has the same color as its habitat, that is a perfect example of its fitting in?its fittingness?to its environment. But one could say, conversely, that that is the right and most fitting environ ment for that creature; the environment fits it. Thus, to say that a creature fits into its environment is not much different from saying that the environ ment fits that creature. A certain beak is fitting for a certain way of feeding,</page><page sequence="11">THE INVISIBLE PAW 239 e.g., boring holes into trees, much as a spoon is fitted for eating cereal but forks and knives aren't. And so the handy bugs just under the bark of trees make a fitting food for creatures with such beaks. And one can say that cereal is fitted to be eaten with a spoon. The things fit together, they are fitting to one another. In this sense you could say that a shy person is fitted to, or adapted to, a solitary job, an outgoing person to a team job, an outdoors person suited or adapted to life as a woodsman, a deaf person adapted to work in a noisy environment. In this sense, being adapted to something only says something about the relationship of two things, and of course this relationship is implicitly contrasted to one of rtcwadaptation or wAzfittingness. So a bold person is unfitted for a life full of constraints, a mechanical one needs something to tinker with, etc. The notion of fitness involved here is not much different from the sense in which a knife is unfit for eating soup while a spoon is suitable. When the argument from design expresses wonder at the perfect ap propriateness of an eye to its function, the fittingness of its parts to their role, and compares the eye to a watch or a telescope, one might understand this to be fittingness in the sense described above. The eye is fitted to see, and con versely, the conditions of light and its refraction are appropriate for such an organ to be a sense organ. Yet the use of the eye in the argument leads away from this meaning, the more so because the eye is being compared with an ob ject of human design and invention. The eye, like the telescope, is perfectly adapted to its function?like the telescope adjusted to its work, and like the telescope ingenious in conception. We are here a long way from the similarity of a bird's color to its background, and that is to say, more is imported into the notion of fittingness here than was evident in its other use. Still, remnants of that use remain: the human eye is not adapted to life in the sea, and it is un fitted for seeing things behind or above; it is not a good or appropriate eye for a fish or an insect but is well fitted for human vision. We are, then, unclear at the outset what the significance of the eye's fitness for its purpose is supposed to be; and a similar problem confronts us in interpreting Darwin's use of 'adapted'. Darwin tells us the answer to this confusion: Think of an organism or an organ as a "production of nature . . . which has had a history," he says, and look at it "in the same way as when we look at a mechanical invention"?as a sum of labor of numerous workmen. We know now that we should not think of how a bird's color fits its environment in the same sense as that we use to say that a picture fits a room, or a room a picture. Organs and organisms are not merely adapted to their settings, but they contain or are adaptai/ojw. There is a process or history to be observed behind the fact of their fitting in, a process of adaptation or modification.</page><page sequence="12">240 ELIZABETH WOLGAST Adapting has an active meaning well enough. For instance a person may adapt to the hazards of city life by studying martial arts, or by carrying a weapon, or by staying off the streets. And if one doesn't adapt, there may be a price to pay. What is suitable in one context isn't suitable in another, and we need to change as we move from one to the other. A person may adapt to the present business environment by learning computer technology or ac counting, thus warding off the hazards of unemployment. Therefore it is pos sible to think of animals doing something similar?they too need to adapt to conditions or suffer a price. As an environment changes, an animal may begin hibernating, or take to the water, or hoard a supply of food. And then, having made such changes, we can say of the animal that it has adapted or adjusted and now is adapted to its conditions. It has made a change or alteration in view of some condition of the environment, and become adjusted to that con dition. Clearly the two kinds of'being adapted' are connected. A creature which changes as a response to need may become better adapted. The end result is the same: fitting in with one's conditions, as in the case of a shy person developing social skills as a job requirement. Therefore, from the fact that some creature adapts to an environment, it will follow that it is better adapted than before. From adaptation, adaptedness or fitting in will follow. But the converse inference will not hold. From the fact that something fits its environment it does not follow that it adapted or went through a process of adaptation. If this did follow, one could infer from the fitness of fingers to typewriting that the fingers came about for that purpose, or from the fitness of an organ or some feature that it grew to be so. From the fitness of a shy person to work at the library it does not follow that working at the library led to such a condition. Therefore it is important to keep the two senses more or less separated. The distinction drawn here is a simple one, not unlike many distinctions between related meanings of the same word. Yet it holds a kind of key to Darwin's reasoning, and in this way. Darwin looks at the characteristics of organisms (as does the advocate of creation) in terms of their fit with the animal's environment. He then asks, much as Paley does, what can be the ex planation for this suitability, this adaptedness? And the answer which Natural Selection allows him to give is that the adaptation is the result of a process, the process of adapting. Everywhere that there is adaptedness, there is also evidence of adaptation. Natural Selection "adapts the inhabitants of each country."26 It proceeds by "successive, slight, but profitable modifications."27 The vision is inspiring: It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about,</page><page sequence="13">THE INVISIBLE PAW 241 and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms . . . dependent on each other in so complex a man ner, have all been produced by laws acting around us.28 Organic things fitted together must be viewed as constructed forms produced by natural laws. Their fitting so neatly together is indeed evidence for this. Darwin does not confine his explanations to just those features which serve a clear purpose, moreover. Here is how he describes some curiously formed seeds in the Galapagos: In certain islands not tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds.29 Were the hooks then developed in order to provide for the transport of seeds by animals? The answer is yes, even though there are no animals about. The hooks remained as the habitat of the seeds were changed; the manner of their production is unquestioned. They are modifications designed for a purpose. The issue can be seen as an issue concerning what things require explana tion and what things don't. The argument from design takes for granted that anything that works well in the biological world (supposing that we can judge about this)?the plant that thrives, the creature that is adjusted to the condi tions of its life, complex organs?all invite explanation in a way that other things do not. Rocks and inanimate phenomena don't need such explanation. Do misfits? Or perhaps there aren't any. In any event, the argument from design embodies the assumption that good functioning in the biological world always warrants explanation. Darwin's argument embodies the same assumption, and does so because of the way he way he moves from the fitting together of natural things to the conclusion that there was a process leading to this state, a process analogous to the way in which inventions derive from the efforts of men. An animal might be said to be adapted to its surroundings in having a color that matched. That is a feature of its adaptedness or adaptation. But what do we mean by this? If we mean a modification, then we have suggested that it came to have this color having previously had a different one. The animal modified itself or was modified with respect to its color. But what ground have we for saying this, for thinking that it used to have another color and came to have this one for whatever reason? Our evidence is only that the color is now fit, appropriate. We can only describe it as it stands, without any evidence of its history. But if this is our situation, we have no right to speak of its color as a modification. And if it is not a modification but only a fitting character, we don't need to give a special account of it at all. The need for an explanation vanishes. The animal had to have some color and to live</page><page sequence="14">242 ELIZABETH WOLGAST somewhere; That its color matches the background of its habitat is simply one of the color relationships possible. It is characteristic of Darwin's reasoning to view a feature of some organism in the way he tells us we should, as a contrivance with a history and a point. All features are adaptations, i.e., modifications, and all modifica tions are useful. Then all features must be useful for some purpose. This line of thinking is seductive, and we find biologists prone to asking: What is the adaptive significance of, e. g., the great dependency of human infants?, as if there must be some answer and an answer which pointed to a history in the direction of usefulness.30 But this is to assume that every characteristic war rants explanation and explanation of the same sort, namely, how this con trivance came to be developed for some end. Why is the creature colored thus? Why does it eat such food? Why does it reproduce in the spring? Why does it mate? One becomes dizzy with the possibilities, wanting to ask why one should suppose these questions have any very interesting answer. An animal mates because it wants to, it has the color it was born with, the color of its parents?isn't that enough? No?not for Darwin or for Paley. The move from describing creatures as well adapted to explaining their features as adaptations, and its illogic, explain why so many Darwinian ex planations sound strange and backwards. The explanation puts a verb in the active mood?the creature modifies itself, Nature modifies it. So we have ex planations such as: creatures protect themselves by developing a bad taste; or, they protect themselves by making themselves resemble the scenery; or, they arrange their mating season so that the maximum number of young survive. Or, they come to be sexual forms out of the desirability of having a large gene pool! How could we possibly know whether such an explanation is ap propriate? We could if we had evidence of a history of changes, or a pattern of related forms?such a sequence as Darwin did have with his island finches. In such a case we can speak of mutations and modifications with some plausibility. But what about the other cases? To explain them in a similar way amounts to a petitio principii, for it assumes the history must be there in stead of looking for proof that it is. And then finds just-so stories to fit. An odd consequence ot this kind of reasoning, which supposes that every desirable feature (and so potentially every feature of a viable creature) must be explicable as a modification, is this: For each explanation we must posit a prior form of creature, one without that feature. And then we are free to wonder, what features did it have? If the dove's color is a modification, what color was the dove prior to modification? If the elephant's trunk is an adapta tion, what was it like, the trunkless elephant? If a bird's sharp beak is an adaptation, was its beak once dull?or had it no beak at all? A nose? There is no way of stopping these-questions, for on the Darwinian pattern of continual</page><page sequence="15">THE INVISIBLE PAW 243 modification, there will always be a previous form which itself was a modification of another before it. And how shall we describe them? As having unfit colors and wrtsuitable features? As having no features? The latter pos sibility is intriguing and leads us in the direction of Darwin's common mam malian ancestor which was neither one kind of mammal or another, not ro dent or sea creature or marsupial. Then what?with what "common features" was it endowed? It bore its young and fed them as a mammal. But that does not describe a creature. It describes a logical ancestor, not a biological one. And that is preceisely what Darwinian logic leads to, a regress to an animal which has virtually no features. On such a creature Natural Selection could work as a sculptor with a piece of clay, much like the way the nineteenth-century breeders spoke of their work with breeds. Anything was possible, and that is to say, any improvement was. But what was there originally, the subject to be improved? I don't believe this interpretation of Darwin is an exaggeration. At the end of Origin he tells us himself: Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.31 Those few simple forms or even one were the logical ancestors posited by the kind of explanation Darwin's theory entails. They were simple, which is to say they lacked the adaptations that Natural Selection would bring about; their lives were less wonderful, for the results of Natural Selection can only be improvements. The fewer their characteristics, the more suitable as ancestors. Amoeba, perhaps, or insensate lumps. And, Darwin writes: When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.32 He views them not as special creations, but as creations nontheless, crea tions of the best workman of all, and evidence that Nature really does outperform Art. When Darwin recommends that we look at an organic being, not "as a savage looks at a ship" but as a "summing up of many contrivances ... in the same way as when we look at a great mechanical invention" he is giving us a bad steer. This was the way natural things were regarded by theologians, to be sure. But from such a perspective there is too much need for purpose and</page><page sequence="16">244 ELIZABETH WOLGAST too little room for what just comfortably is. Beasts seem to us adapted to the conditions of their lives?how could we judge them to be otherwise??though they fret and flail, and stick their heads in the sand, and threaten aggressions they cannot perform, and pretend to be what they aren't. We in turn go to the movies and have a drink and see our psychiatrists. These things are all done in the course of managing, which is to say surviving; but to say that they are practices which help us to survive and are even designed to help us to survive is certainly hasty. To ask for their functional significance does really seem no more sensible than asking for the significance of dust on the stairs. The call for explanations has gone out of control. How did this state of affairs come about? The answer is to be found in the challenge which was presented to Darwin by the design argument: all fit tingness in nature needs explanation; the only question that remains is whether a divine designer is the right explanation. The evidence which points to a designer must be explained in some other way if there is a genuine alter native. The evidence that points to a designer must point to something else. It is well known that the design argument can be rebutted by protesting that there is plenty of evidence of bad design, in the mishaps that we and other creatures are led into; and that there is plenty of evidence of no design at all. The real question to be asked is, Why do we insist upon any explana tion in this or that case? What makes us think that here is a meaningful one? Where there is evidence of a process, then there is also evidence to support the quest to know how it came about and how it worked. But is there always this kind of evidence? That's the neglected question. It is the legacy of the design argument that the question, Why did this come about rather than something else? is presumed always to make sense in the biological world. The quest to understand nature is in this way founded on faith, a faith that divine creation or some comparable force brought things to be as they are. Just as faith lies behind Paley's account of the eye, so faith lies behind Darwin's?in both cases a faith that something must account for it. While, as I have suggested, a more plausible stance for a naturalist is to look first for evidence that this or that form of account is appropriate. Do we have evidence that the bird's color came to match the surroundings? If not, then modification by Natural Selection cannot be presumed to provide an "ex planation" of it. Nor can we be sure that explaining the bird's color is the right subject, since the bird's migration into matching surroundings would have a different form but yield the same result. And the surroundings themselves changing would work as well.33 What are we seeking to explain, then? That should be decided carefully, and not taken as given. One might argue, then, that the greatest influence of the argument from design on the science of biology was the legitimacy it gives the question, Why</page><page sequence="17">THE INVISIBLE PAW 245 did this come about and not something else? For it begs the question what has come about and what the framework of investigation should be. Instead these are taken as matters of faith. IV Let it be borne in mind how all-important, in the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and courage must be. The advantage which disciplined soldiers have over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence each man feels in his comrades. . . . Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the world.34 Moral codes develop just as physical characteristics and reproduction pat terns do, and for the same reason. Their worth is proved by the viability of those holding them; they are adaptations in whatever sense the term applies to biological features. So Darwin believes. The same questions that were raised about biological adaptations clearly apply here as well, questions about what is meant by a struggle to survive which could yield these codes of behavior; and second, what ground there is for assuming that men were ever without them?that men originally had some nonmoral social existence out of which the moral life was carved by Natural Selection. The first question casts a sceptical light on the whole idea of moral values, since the struggle for life in the Malthusian sense would seem not to justify any ethical community at all. It is to answer that objection that a great deal of sociobiological writing has been dedicated. But the second question is harder and more devastating, for if we have no evidence that there was an original nonmoral form of human life, then there is nothing to explain?nothing for Natural Selection to account for. Do we have such evidence? A citizen of seventeenth or eighteenth-century Europe might be ex cused for pointing, as Hobbes and Locke and Rousseau did, to the "savages" of the New World to prove what state men originally must have lived in. But by Darwin's time such views of man's "original nature" were being questioned and by now are surely relegated to the lists of mythology. Why should we think there was such an ancestor out of whose self-interest morality developed? Looking at the lives of "simple" cultures?African tribes and American Indians and Pacific Islanders?shows us established moral codes and men who disobey them no less than looking around at our own society. To say that there is a code, notice, does not imply that people observe it, nor does having a moral code show that morality pays off under Natural Selec tion. The best that can by claimed is that having the code pays off, but even Thrasymachus and Gyges could allow the truth of that. Therefore the conclu</page><page sequence="18">246 ELIZABETH WOLGAST sion that courage and fidelity owe their existence to Natural Selection is even farther from proof than the claim that the dove's gray comes about in that way. One can still ask, perhaps, Does morality help us to survive? Does it have survival value? To this question Darwin seems to answer yes, together with modern sociobiologists. Yet the application of "helpful" to this subject is curious. Does religion help us to survive? Does faith in a just reward after death? Does refusal to believe the truth of a pessimistic medical prognosis? Do powerful ties of affection help us? Having pets around the house? Having a demanding job? A good psychiatrist? At such a point we have lost the con nection between these questions and the developmental aspect of Natural Selection. Perhaps morality does help, among a heterogeny of other things; that would give no justification for morality. Gyges might take vitamins and go about his nefarious business as usual. However Darwin is not to be associated with such "Darwinian" moral attitudes as those of Herbert Spencer, who thought it was really right that the weak should perish as they lost in the competition of human life. Nor is Darwin in agreement with the proposals of Malthus?that is, that there should not be government policies to help the poor lest their misery be thereby prolonged and exacerbated. Darwin specifically addresses this issue, invoking a moral sympathy which itself, he believes, results from Natural Selection: The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts.... Nor could we check our sympathy, if so urged by hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature . . . [fori if we were inten tionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with a certain and great present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propogating their kind.35 He seems to say that hard reason might lead us to act like Spencerians, but doing so would weaken that sympathy which, in other areas, serves us rationally and well. Against our better and most realistic judgment we con tinue to be charitable and solicitous toward those who, by the criteria he thinks to be used by nature, are unfit. The reason really is that it is the right and moral thing to do, and to act otherwise would be to jeopardize our moral character. In a Kantian vein he would let the consequences?awful and Malthusian?be hanged. One could say, then, that he exempts morality from Natural Selection in the very last analysis. Tracing the progress of Darwin's idea of natural selection from its roots in social theory shows us the great plausibility of the sociobiological hypothesis within a Darwinian framework. It is useless to argue, I believe, that while Darwinian thinking works for reproduction and sex and fleeing</page><page sequence="19">THE INVISIBLE PAW 247 from harm it cannot apply to the more "complex" social aspects of human life. Such an objection is easily accounted for on the same model as the objec tions of such as Wallace, who was willing to have evolution account for animals but not for mankind. The true source of the difficulty lies in the man ner of argument regarding both biological and nonbiological features of creatures; and the source of this in turn is the rival argument from design against which Darwin's argument was pitted, and upon which it was also modeled. One could say that he only replaces the divine Creator with a natural one, and replaces the stuff of which Adam was made in Genesis with a common ancestral blob. And then views the work of such a creator with ap propriate wonder. Where Darwin most notably departs from his mentors in social and economic theory is in hi s sanguine view of the natural world. One might argue that it is the same wonder which invokes the explanation of Creation: Here is something so noteworthy that it cannot pass unexplained. What then is the explanation for it, how did it come about? I have tried to show that describing cases of fittingness of things in natural systems can be understood if we ac cept that there is a contrasting unfittingness also found in nature?like the unfittingness of the human back to sitting all day in a chair, or the unfit tingness of many insects to life through a cold winter. But once this contrast has been established the cause for wonder is diminished, and the need for giv ing an account of Nature as a wonderful creation has gone. We may find ex planations of various kinds to be appropriate for different kinds of natural facts. In one case we may have evidence of a history of modification?such as Gould gives regarding the panda's thumb. In other cases there may be evidence that predators eliminated one variant of a species?butterflies which were clearly visible, for instance. We may find evidence that the enlargement of the human brain was subsequent to humans' use of their hands to craft and create, and due to the exploitation of that capability. Possibly we could find evidence that the development of brain size was related to the many sounds we can make, including singing and whistling and humming and shouting, and so was attached to exploitation of this distinctively human capability. While artifacts are unlikely to give proof of such a connection, if they did, would they show that the brain was developed because it is useful for survival! It seems more reasonable to say that explanations can be different and not subsumable under a single principle, not making a single design whose motif is survival. There may be no overall design. A last point can be added about the connection between adaptedness and the struggle to survive. If one consults the reports of those who observe such creatures as the Langurs (Sara H rdy) or the chimpanzees of Africa's Gombe (Jane Goodall), one may certainly marvel at the ease with which they fit into</page><page sequence="20">248 ELIZABETH WOLGAST their environments?the plentiful supply of food, the leisure to nap when they please, the pleasure taken in a romp with their peers, the serene lives of the in fants. Here are two idyllic forms of life, at least viewed from the human perspective. Yet one phrase that cannot aptly be used of these creatures is that they "struggle to survive." On the contrary, what is wonderful is the absence of any need to struggle. There are competitions for dominance, but, as I showed, these aren't survival struggles. There are no predators to speak of, but on every hand a friendly and gentle environment. Therefore there would seem to be a question about the compatibility of the two concepts? adapted and struggling to survive. In Malthus' world of the laborers com peting for jobs, suffering starvation and disease under adverse economic con ditions, does one describe them as adapted? Better adapted are the leisure and business classes, he would say; but in their situation, is there a struggle to sur vive? Where the one description applies with perfect clarity and unequivoca tion, the other seems less appropriate. If this is so, it is a kind of final irony in the Darwinian scheme. The adapted do not struggle; those who must struggle are not adapted. The challenge Darwin took up was the reconciliation of the face of nature bright with gladness with the darker side of competition and natural selection. It was a more ambitious project than those of Malthus and Adam Smith, but Darwin thought to carry it off with the workings of a single princi ple against a background of natural variation. With that he meant not to destroy the vision of wonder which began the search for an explanation, nor the admiration of a civilized European for his own time and society. It is not surprising if we find that the task was more than he could accomplish. Elizabeth H.

Besides Darwin's own references to Malthus, there are references to Adam Smith's works in moral theory scattered through the Descent of Man. But one sup poses Smith's work on economics would be generally known, and S. J. Gould among others refer to Smith as an influence on Darwin, e.g., Gould writes that "Darwin grafted Adam Smith upon nature to establish his theory of natural selection" Ever Since Darwin (New York: Norton, 1977), p. 100. 14. Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, first published in 1776. It is in Bk. IV ch. II that the famous passage occurs in which Smith describes the self-interested in dividual who "neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. . . . He intends only his own security; and by directing [domestic! in dustry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.... [Moreover! by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it." (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1976), p. 477. 15. Thomas Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Populations, first published as a pamphlet in 1798, then as a book in 1806. Malthus took his principle of population to be universal in the biological world, and refers to the "constant tendency in all animated life to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it" which tendency, left unrestrained, "would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all-pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law; and man cannot by any efforts of reason escape from it." (Bk. I, ch.I) This is another evidence of the curious way in which social theory and biology draw on one another for theoretical support. 16. Origin, p. 117. 17. Cited in 16 above. 18. It should not be inferred that Malthus was altogether resigned to the unhappy way in which the forces work. He thought that by regulating their sexual habits and the age at which they mate, people could do a great deal individually to alleviate the problem.
