<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ICONOGRAPHY OF AN ACHAEMENID STAMP-SEAL ACQUIRED IN THE LEBANON By P. R. S. Moorey A number of useful preliminary classifications of Achaemenid seals have been made since the publication of Menant's still fundamental studies in 1886,4' but there has been little progress in the interpretation of their iconography. The following detailed study of an unusually complex stamp-seal is offered as an attempt to clarify some of the problems involved in the iconology of Achaemenid art. The large seal, illustrated on P1. Ia and Fig. 4, bought by the Rev. G. J. Chester in Beirut in the late nineteenth cen- tury,48 has a distinctive shape which confirms that it was made in the region where it was bought and a series of designs which, whilst immediately giving its relative date and cultural context, are sufficiently 47 M.

The main scene, a very familiar Achaemenid Court Style rendering of the age-old " Master-of-Animals " associates the seal with the secretariat of the Persian Imperial administration. The reverse offers a scene which seems at first sight as Levantine as the seal's shape, but which is found on closer examination to have Iranian traits. Along one edge runs a frieze of profile lion-heads, characteristic of Achaemenid applied arts, whilst along the other edge is a challenging series of religious images not often documented in the western Empire. On typical " Phoenician " seals Persian influence may only be detected in small details of dress and weaponry,49 throwing into more prominence the foreign elements on Levantine seals like this one. Despite a relative wealth of documentary evidence for certain provinces, but not Syria among them,50 the Persian period is among the least known archaeologically of the historic periods in the Near East. It happens that the rare variety of motifs on this seal offer an unusual opportunity for considering the cultural impact of the Persian overlords in the fifth century B.C. on the Syro-Phoenician region (P1. Ia; Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Drawings of the designs on the tabloid stamp-seal, Ashmolean Museum 1889.406. The shape of this seal is commonly referred to as " tabloid ": rectangular, with flat faces and sides, pierced lengthways so that it could have been mounted as a pendant. Such seals are normally decorated on the two faces and on those two edges not interrupted by holes. These seals, which have still to be classified into coherent groups, appear towards the end of cylinder seal use in the Near East, where they occur in Cyprus and the Syro-Phoenician region of the adjacent mainland.51 This is not a Meso- potamian or Iranian seal shape in the first millennium B.C. The shape was transmitted westwards to the Aegean Islands in the eighth century B.C., perhaps through Cyprus.52 Many of the Cypriot seals of this category are crudely cut and examples with finely rendered scenes in Syro-Phoenician styles of the eighth or seventh centuries B.C. are rare in the literature.53 Rarer still it would appear are such seals of Achaemenid date. The scenes cut on the Ashmolean seal will be taken here in reverse order of prominence ending with the " Master-of-Animals ". (a) Detached animal heads (Fig. 5b) Although the detached lion-heads in profile are crudely cut, and may in two cases be reversed, no other explanation of this edge seems plausible, particularly when united with the contemporary comparative evidence. The use of detached animal heads, either self-contained or in frieze as on the seal's edge, is a distinctively Achaemenid trait in the minor arts of the Near East, since it derives not 49 W.

The latter, based on fabric hangings, sometimes have border designs of profile horned lion-heads in a row.58 Among the Achaemenids, as among the Scythians, costume was ornamented lavishly with sheet-gold silhouettes of men, animals and geo- metric shapes. There is also evidence from Persepolis to suggest that hangings in the royal apartments were sometimes similarly decorated rather than embroidered.59 Here again, although there were undoubtedly Assyro-Babylonian precursors,60 is a fashion adopted by the Medes and Persians from their Scythian confederates in the later seventh or sixth century B.c. Among the motifs was the detached animal head. At present profile lion-heads in jewellery may only be cited from groups revealed through clandestine excavations and the antiquities market (Fig. 5a). The authenticity of the primary finds seems well- founded, but many subsequently circulated examples are modern copies of varying quality. Hamadan was the reported source of the initial discovery.61 Miss Kantor has dated those pieces from it now in Chicago to the reign of Artaxerxes II (404-359 B.c.), though the evidence is such as not to preclude a date well back into the fifth century. In the " Chicago Treasure " detached animal heads appear both as necklace pendants and as bracteates for sewing onto fabric, associated in this case with complete lion silhouettes, griffin-heads and an encircled bust-a motif found on the other edge of the Ashmolean seal (Fig. 4 right). This edge is the most difficult part of the seal to " read " with confidence. The motif set at the top is most readily interpreted as the bust of a man facing to his left set within a circular frame. The hatched horizontal bar below, as also that further down, seem only to be dividers,62 framing between them a motif taken here to be a fire-altar: a pedestal rendered as a simple cone with the flames stylized into a dome, as on other representations at this period and later.63 The altar is set on a ground- line which turns upwards and curls over at the top on either side. Beneath the lower hatched horizontal bar there is a very sketchily rendered device now much obscured by a chip in the stone. (b) Encircled male bust The encircled male bust attired in royal costume is one of the primary symbols in the Achaemenid " court style ", appearing on seals and jewellery.64 Although the exact form of the circle is not always clear, particularly on seals, the lower edge is normally thickened to form a crescent. On the royal tomb-facades at Naqsh-i-Rustam a crescent within a plain disk invariably appears above and to the right of the fire altar, behind the better known human winged disk.65 The plain version of the crescent within a disk, taken as a representation of the moon in all its phases, may be traced back to the Old Babylonian period in Mesopotamia as a symbol of the moongod Sin."6 Such it was still in the reign of Nabonidus and, when at Ur, even Cyrus paid obeisance to this god.67 It had passed into Phoenician 55 S.

Entirely distinct from these glyptic scenes is a still unique occurrence in monumental Neo-Assyrian art, on the great rock relief at Bavian, where the king is shown standing within the " Rod and Ring " symbol held by each of the two facing deities, one male and one female.70 In each case the monarch faces the deity and raises his hands in reverence. This symbol is invariably held by deities in Mesopotamia and is taken to represent divine power or lordship, delegated as and when was appropriate to the king, viceroy of the gods on earth. It never seems to have been the exclusive attribute of any deity.71 This symbol does not appear in Achaemenid art; nor, as will be seen, is it likely that the king is ever shown in the disk at that time. The identity of the encircled bust in Achaemenid times has been much discussed. Evidence for a final resolution of the question is still lacking. The problem is two fold: was this intended to show the reigning monarch or an ageless " royal hero " ? Or was this a god and, if so, which one ? In the Assyro- Babylonian iconographic tradition deities invariably wear horned crowns of varying form, as does the hovering human winged-disk at Behistun (c. 520 B.c.). But thereafter the human winged-disk and the encircled bust wear the royal tiara and only " man-bulls " as guardians and on column capitals, and winged sphinxes, at Persepolis retain their traditional horned crowns.72 This has in part encouraged the suggestion that the human winged-disk cannot satisfactorily be taken to represent the supreme deity in Achaemenid art, as is commonly assumed, but should rather be seen either as the " daimon " or " genius " of the Achaemenid dynasty or the " spirit " of the Persian peoples. 3 That there was always understood to be a special relationship between the king and the supreme deity of the local pantheon is everywhere apparent in the ancient Near East, but in the first millennium B.C., neither the living nor the dead king was regarded precisely as a deity outside Egypt.74 It is then unlikely that symbols traditionally reserved for the gods, even without the horned crown, would have represented either the " royal hero " or the reigning Achaemenid king as, in the case of the encircled bust, Dalton suggested and L'Orange later asserted.75 Brief examination of its usage in glyptic endorses this view. On Achaemenid court style seals whenever the encircled bust appears on the same seal as the winged- disk, with or without human bust, it is always set below it in a secondary position.76 Even so, it is clearly an object of worship, sometimes by the king or " royal hero ", himself.77 In this subsidiary position also appear, rarely, the human bust with four wings,7" and more often the wheel.79 In this argument 68 W.

VIA (Pasargadae).</page><page sequence="6">148 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES a seal of certain provenance is particularly welcome, the more so when it comes from Pasargadae. On a cylinder excavated there by Stronach a four-winged human bust above a wheel is juxtaposed to a crescent above a " royal hero ", a lion-dangler, carrying a curved sword (Fig. 6). This indicates that the four-winged human bust, a development of the Achaemenid period, is merely a variant of the more familiar human bust in a winged disk with a single pair of wings. The wheel is to be taken here either as a sun symbol in its traditional Near Eastern role8o or in its later, more elaborate, Iranian guise as the " wheel of heaven " embracing the whole of material creation.81 Yet the question remains: does the crescent here stand for a separate deity or is it merely the lunar aspect of the supreme god ? For the moment, as both Schmidt and Miss Kantor have argued,82 the latter seems the more viable attribution. The well known description of Persian gods given by Herodotus (I. 13I) is not incompatible with such a reading of the symbolism " Zeus (i.e. the supreme god), in their system, is the whole circle of heavens.... They also worship the sun, the moon, and earth, fire, water, and winds, which are their only original deities ". Ahuramazda, as the supreme universal god, had a variety of different symbols variously emphasizing his association with the sun and moon. These derived initially from the tradi- tional Assyro-Babylonian solar winged disk and the lunar crescent or crescent within a disk. Fig. 6. Design on a cylinder seal from Pasargadae. (After D. Stronach, Iran I (1963), pl. VIA). This reading of the crescent, and the related plain and anthropomorphic crescent within a disk, may be confirmed by the imagery of the superb contest scene on a well known cylinder seal in the Oxus hoard.83 A vertical line divides the design into two parts which appear to be complementary. On the right a human warrior tramples a recumbent foe and spears another above whom hovers alone a winged human disk facing the conqueror. To the left a comparable scene appears in which the conqueror is balanced by a falling victim, his arm raised in reverence, above a recumbent colleague. In the upper field here, at its centre, a plain winged solar disk is set above an encircled bust facing to left, its thickened lower edge clearly shown (Fig. 7). The whole design requires a very close identity between the symbols in the upper field. On the only inscribed seal which may confidently be attributed to a satrap, that of Arsames of Egypt, a plain winged disk and a crescent set side by side appear over a comparable contest scene, presumably showing the satrap in the guise of conqueror (Fig. 8).84 Finally, as regards its status, it would seem more likely when the encircled bust appears alone, as on the Ashmo- lean seal, or in the primary position above a fire-altar, as on the Qizqapan tomb facade in Iraqi Kurdistan, that it is the supreme deity who is thereby symbolized, albeit in a lunar rather than a solar aspect. 80 R.

Dalton, The Treasure of the Oxus, no. iz4, pl. XVI). (c) Fire-altars When fire-altars appear on seals of the Achaemenid period, and they are the most important single novelty in the imagery of this time, they are usually the focus of a symmetrical design, flanked by worshippers of varying status and function.85 On a cylinder seal in Brussels a plain winged sun-disk over a fire-altar is juxtaposed to a royal hero fighting a rampant winged sphinx.86 An isolated fire- altar also appears on a very unusual Achaemenid agate cylinder seal, now in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, flanked by a human-headed bird carrying barsom rods;87 this creature may suggest manu- facture in Babylonia. In view of its important role in native Iranian religion it is not surprising that the fire-altar should hold an important place in the glyptic " court style ". The most perplexing aspect of the rendering here is the base line with rising ends on which it is set and for which I have traced no exact parallel. Only an exceedingly tentative suggestion may be made, largely in view of the area whence this seal comes. By analogy with Phoenician seals this might denote the prow and stern of a boat in which the altar is seen to be standing.88 If this is a viable interpretation and it has been suggested to me that the motif below the lower bar is a fish, then known Iranian imagery is here Fig. 8.

Boat-borne gods in Phoenicia, accompanied on occasion by incense-altars and braziers, are an adaptation of a well-known Egyptian theme not only confined to this part of western Asia, but even to one well defined group of seals made there in the Persian period in a wholly local style.89 In Phoenicia these seals are taken to show Baal Hammon or Baal Shamen in the solar boat. But much more decisive evidence is required before this seal's fire-altar may confidently be interpreted as a modification of Iranian imagery through contact with Phoenicia. (d) Suckling animals On the reverse of the Ashmolean seal are suckling animals particularly associated in the first millen- nium B.C. with Phoenician art, whither they had passed from Egypt, where the cow and calf were the customary combination. This group has been interpreted as symbolizing the mother goddess suckling a deity or ruler, identified variously as suited the local pantheon. The cow and calf is carved on ivory furniture inlays from Arslan Tash and Nimrud90 and on seals through into the Achaemenid period.91 A monumental group of cow and calf, possibly of cast metal, stand in front of the Urartian temple at Musasir as represented on a relief of Sargon II of Assyria.92 Two features, the species of animal and the two cocks above, distinguish this rendering. The horned animal is not bearded so neither the capra ibex nor the capra aegagrus is intended. Its solid build, the ribbed upper surface of the horns and their distinctive curve (allowing for the distortions of a profile view) suggest a moufflon: an animal particularly well known in the art of pre-Achaemenid western Iran.93 Although the female moufflon has horns, they are not normally so large or striking as those of the ram; but this is a recurrent problem with suckling scenes. Both a ring bezel and the cheekpieces of a bronze horse-bit, of the eighth or seventh centuries B.C., from Luristan show an antlered animal suckling its young.94 The only species of the deer family in which the female bears antlers is the reindeer. Whereas it is just possible that such an animal is indeed intended on an Achaemenid Court Style scaraboid seal now in Leningrad,95 for zoological reasons it is very much less likely in western Iran or indeed the Levant or Aegean region, where seals with antlered animals suckling their young also appear.96 This device should be taken as a convention for indicating a species irrespective of sex, also applied to other animal families such as the " maned " lionesses suckling cubs on " Nimrud Ivories ".97 (e) Cocks Above the suckling moufflon appear a pair of cocks, a bird as closely associated with Iran as the beast beneath. Apart from isolated representations98 the bird does not appear in the iconography of Western Asia until the eighth century,99 when, as with the honey bee,100 growing contact with Persia encouraged its regular import into Mesopotamia and the Levant.

The bird appears on various objects made in Luristan in the earlier first millennium B.C.101 and on seals and ring bezels in the Achaemenid period.102 On a cylinder seal excavated from a fifth century grave on mound W at Kish in Iraq a pair of confronted cocks appear in the upper register with a goat beside them, below is a winged leonine monster facing a bull across a " sundisk ". A male worshipper stands above the bull (P1. Ib). On a cylinder of similar date from Babylon only the cocks and a star appear.103 The symbolism of the cock in the Near East before the Hellenistic period is obscure and may not yet be confidently linked to its subsequent association with the sun, the human soul and fighting, fully examined by Goodenough.l04 It has been taken, rather naturally from the cockrow at sunrise, as a sun-symbol in pre-Achaemenid Iranian contexts but there is no compelling evidence.105 Indeed there are a number of cases in late Assyro-Babylonian glyptic when the cock appears in conjunction with such established lunar symbols as the crescent and the disk-and-crescent. On a Neo-Babylonian cylinder seal in the British Museum a priest stands before an empty offering table, the draped crescent standard of the Babylonian moongod Sin and a bird, commonly taken for a cock, standing on a podium. What is much more clearly a cock appears on a podium alone before a priest on another contemporary cylinder seal.106 If indeed there is a lunar symbolism implied here, then the conjunction of the cocks and the encircled bust is not accidental. (f) Master-of-Animals On the main face of the Ashmolean seal is set the " Master-of-Animals " in Persian dress wearing the upright tiara, his head turned to the left. He is flanked by a rampant winged bull and a lion facing outwards but with their heads turned back and grasped by the " Master ". So ubiquitous and varied was this motif in the Persian period that no useful purpose would be served here by a comparative examination, more particularly since Bivar has recently considered this motif in a series of closely related papers.1'7 His widely ranging discussion uses a subtle combination of religious, iconographical and philological detail in an attempt to demonstrate that there was a continuity between Roman Mithraism " largely preoccupied with beliefs concerning death and a deity of the underworld " and " its presumed origins in the ancient Near East ".108 This basic premise is only relevant here in so far as it leads Bivar into an often uninhibited identification of gods of death and the underworld on Achaemenid period seals, and on coins manufactured in the cities of Phoenicia, Cyprus and Cilicia.x09 A " Master-of-Animals " in Achaemenid guise appears in the upper register of the carved stone stela from Kamini in Athens taken by Bivar as his starting point. In his consideration of this motif Bivar argues firstly that it " may have represented in different historical periods, conceivably Gil- gamesh, Bel-Marduk, Heracles and the prophet Daniel, besides, possibly, the Iranian Ahuramazda ... in most cases the meaning of the theme was religious ".no After an examination of the use of the motif on seal impressions from Achaemenid public and private administrative archives he concludes, secondly that " this motif suggested to a contemporary the seals of the Achaemenid king, and of his central administration ", arguing specifically that the upper register of the Kamini stela was likely to be a 101 Moorey, Persian Bronzes, nos. 177-9, I I6, 413-5, p. 231. 102 E.

Frye, " Problems in the Study of Iranian Religions ", Religions in Antiquity (Goodenough Fest- schrift, ed. J. Neusner; Leiden, 1968), pp. 583-9. 109 The point to which this argument is pushed may be judged from the claim that the exceptionally naturalistic " Graeco- Persian " hunting gems (sometimes showing the pursued animal alone), and unspecific " slaughter " scenes on other Achamenid gems, could allude to the cult of Nergal and its local equivalents: Mithraic Studies, pp. 66-7, 91-2. 110 Henning, p. 5 .</page><page sequence="14">152 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES large-scale copy of the seal-impression of a king, most probably Artaxerxes II.111 In a subsequent paper Bivar greatly extended his religious interpretation of the Achaemenid " Master-of-Animals " in an argument with overt Zoroastrian implications. He suggested that in Babylonia it might have been identified with Bel-Marduk " regarded as a deity of good, while the rival cult of Nergal, the underworld deity, appears to have emerged as the antithesis ".112 Bivar's conclusions that this theme has a primarily religious significance and that it appears with striking regularity on sealings in Achaemenid public and private business archives are cogent: but his ensuing interpretations are not sustained by the evidence. It has long been doubted whether this motif in Mesopotamia was ever intended either to represent " Gilgamesh " or a specific local deity;113 nor is Bivar's treatment of Nergal commensurate with local Mesopotamian evidence for the god's varied character."4 Even allowing that a Babylonian might have read this group as Bel-Marduk in the fifth century, it is highly unlikely that anyone closely associated with the Persian administration would have seen it in such terms. Even before the sack of Babylon by the army of Xerxes in 480-482 B.C., and the removal of Marduk's gold statue, Achaemenid regard for this primary symbol of Babylonian nationalism was, if not overtly hostile, then highly equivocal. There is also considerable glyptic evidence to show that local iconography for local gods, the so-called " Neo-Babylonian " style, persisted in use through much of the Achaemenid period. In advancing his case Bivar offers no compelling reason for rejecting the more generally accepted view that the Achaemenid " Master-of-Animals " represents not a god but rather the king or " royal hero ", though this explanation would tally very well with his analysis of its administrative usage. Distinguishing confidently between these two possible identifications is, as yet, not possible, but happily for present purposes largely irrelevant. On occasion a particular monarch may have been intended, at least on very fine seals or rings, but this figure is not so much an individual ruler as an immediately recognizable symbol of all the attributes of the Achaemenid monarchy in reality, as well as in myth and theology. Miss Porada has noted how the Achaemenid " Master-of-Animals " dominates a variety of monsters who earlier in the Neo-Assyrian period had appeared only as the victims of supernatural heroes or winged genii not of the Assyrian king. On the Assyrian " royal seal " the king fought only lions;115 no certain equivalent to this seal has yet been identified in Achaemenid court protocol.116 Miss Porada took this innovation as a conscious change by Darius to symbolize the superhuman powers and position of the Great King. Although there is no evidence that the Achaemenid king was ever regarded as a divinity (outside Egypt), there is ample evidence that he held a very special position distinct from ordinary mortals, and that his spirit was an object of worship after his death.", As earthly viceroy of Ahuramazda the king enjoyed a cosmic role best illustrated by reliefs on palace door-jambs at Persepolis showing the " royal hero " in combat with a single monster. These are the only surviving monumental versions of the Achaemenid " Master-of-Animals ". It is commonly argued that in Assyro-Babylonian times these monsters represented the multiple forces of chaos among which evil and death would be numbered. To this extent the idea underlying Bivar's primary thesis may have some force; but any attempt to see in these combats the reflection of a coherent theology 11x Ibid., p. 59; this conclusion does not sufficiently allow for persisting uncertainty about the exact definition and identi- fication of" royal " seals in Achaemenid chancery practice: Greenfield J.A.O.S. 82 (1962), pp. 297-9; Esther 3. 10o-13 suggests the ultimate royal authority was conveyed by the impression of a ring bezel. 112 Mithraic Studies, pp. 95-6; this argument is ingeniously extended to the " Lion and Prey " motif (carved on the lower register of the Kamini stela) taken to symbolize the gods of death in various cultures in the Empire, even its regular appearance on the stairway reliefs at Persepolis. The evidence advanced, primarily numismatic, is not compelling and this explanation no more convincing than the various astrological interpretations; cf. comments of C. Nylander in Acta Iranica I (1974), p. I44, n. 30. The suggestion that this was primarily a sign of royal authority, temporal and supernatural, still has much to commend it. 1as Bivar notes these discussions, notably H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals (London, I939), p. 67 and B. Goff, Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopotamia (New Haven, 1963), p. 241 ff.; but does not attempt to controvert them on their own ground. 14 Especially E. von Weiher, Der babylonische Gott Nergal (A.O.A.T., 1971); on Marduk see W.

Moreover it might be better to say that their role was ambivalent, not exactly corresponding to any precise and simple antithesis of good and evil. When controlled, like good watchdogs, they were a threat only to intruders into their master's household; when uncontrolled, a menace to all. Thus creatures like the lion and winged bull, which on occasion appear as victims of the royal hero, might equally well serve on palace walls at Susa as seemingly benign and benevolent apotropaic symbols. It has already been argued here that the winged disk and the encircled bust in their various forms denote not different deities but distinct aspects, the solar or the lunar, of the universal god Ahuramazda. The " Master-of-Animals " often appears either directly under one or other of these symbols. This is an oblique indication that the " Master-of-Animals " is not himself to be seen as the supreme god. Similarly when the ruler appears recognizably on seals in this secular role, riding in a chariot, walking under a sunshade, or as conqueror, he also appears below such symbols.11s The " Master " may then be taken as a supernatural " royal hero " triumphant: the visual epitome of Achaemenid dynastic authority: the agent on earth of Ahuramazda's control of the universe. Stern has examined the emergence in Judah of a local glyptic style based on Achaemenid " Court Style " models.119 No comparable work has yet been done for Syria, where excavation has been much rarer on Persian period sites than in areas to the south. Papyri sealings from Samaria, Shechem and the Wadi Daliyeh Cave indicate widespread administrative use of simple stamp-seals and ring-bezels cut with " Court Style " scenes of the royal hero in combat with a single beast. It may be assumed from seals found in Syria, though not yet from sealings, that such also was the case there. Throughout the Persian Empire local glyptic styles persisted, modified to a greater or lesser extent by contact with Achaemenid iconography. The Ashmolean tabloid, its four faces allowing for an unusually elaborate range of motifs, symbolizing both the political and the religious sides of Achaemenid royal authority, may not have been designed or intended for regular use. Indeed the shape is hardly suited for such purposes. The multifarious practical use of the mass produced stamp-seals of the Empire as the personal signatures of a largely illiterate population is so clear as to divert attention from the possibility that amuletic power, long enjoyed by some if not all seals in the Near East, had not yet entirely disappeared. There is one parallel for the Ashmolean seal that suggests such a purpose. The juxtaposition of the two main scenes is matched on a stamp-seal found at Persepolis in what may have been a votive deposit beneath a door socket made in the reign of Darius I.120 Particularly striking for this discussion is the fact, as Miss Porada has noted, that this was originally a hammer-shaped Syrian seal cut with a calf and cow suckling motif, with a predatory bird hovering above, modified so that an Achaemenid " Master-of-Animals " in Median costume might be incised on the new upper face,121 presumably at Persepolis. Finally there is the extent to which seal stones of this kind reflect the impact of the Persian hegemony on areas of the Near East with strong, age-old artistic traditions of their own. The shape, and to a lesser extent the suckling motif, are Levantine, the rest is not. Cooney has shown how the Persian presence in Egypt is only revealed in artefacts by small details of costume or jewellery, or by isolated stylistic traits and artistic motifs.122 More recently Hanfmann has assessed the evidence for Turkey: " I arrived at the conclusion that they lived in ' Little Persias ' . . . . It seemed as if only articles of personal attire, arms bestowed as signs of honour by the king, jewelry, gold, silver, luxury glass vessels, and rich textiles, in short, only arts immediately pertaining to the personal adornment of members of satrapal courts were distinctively Persian ".123 If this summary is extended to cover military detach- ments or garrisons of troops from within Iran stationed far afield in the Empire, whose equipment included more mundane items of typically Iranian manufacture,124 then it fits Syria equally well. 118 D.
