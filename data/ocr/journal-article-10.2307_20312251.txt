<plain_text><page sequence="1">TURNER'S SYNDROME IN THE FEMALE CONGENITAL AGONADISM COMBINED WITH DEVELOPMENTAL ABNORMALITIES BY W. P. U. JACKSON, M.D., M.R.C.P., D.C.H. AND R. SOUGIN-MIBASHAN, M.B., Ch.B., B.Sc. (Fromn the Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town) Hypogonadism, manifesting itself as primary amenor rhoea and lack of development of uterus, vagina, and breasts, without any evident disease of or operative interference with ovaries, thyroid, or intracranial struc tures, is usually attributed to pituitary insufficiency. The tiny, frail, delicate, fair-skinned dwarf demonstrating the Lorain-Levi syndrome is the prototype of primary hypo pituitarism. One should not, however, label as examples of pituitary deficiency all other hypogoiadic individuals with no resemblance whatever to the Lorain type. One such group has now been conclusively proved to be due to primary lack of development of ovaries. Historical Background This is recent. In 1938 Turner described seven cases with webbing of the skin of the neck, cubitus valgus, and infantilism. He noted that the short webbed necks of his cases were not due to any vertebral abnormalities, and bore no relation, therefore, to the Klippel-Feil group of conditions. He thought the syndrome might be of pituitary origin. In 1942 Varney, Kenyon, and Koch reported the cases of four short, sexually retarded females who showed an increase of pituitary gonadotropins in their urine. Laparotomy demonstrated ovarian aplasia, which could not have been pituitary in origin in view of the urinary findings. The same year Albright, Smith, and Fraser (1942) independently demonstrated the primary origin of the syndrome and discussed in detail its differentiation from hypopituitarism on the basis of 11 cases of their own. In 1944 Wilkins and Fleischmann published an interesting and thoughtful analysis of this syndrome of ovarian agenesis. They again showed a primary lack of development of the ovaries, which were " developed but little, if at all, beyond the stage of the primitive genital ridge." They point out that affected persons, though sexually underdeveloped, are obviously female in appear ance, habitus, organs, and inclinations, so that female differentiation itself must be entirely independent of the embryonic gonad. They divide the syndrome into three constituents-first, the gonadal agenesis and its conse quences; secondly, the skeletal abnormalities, which cannot be directly occasioned by the ovarian agenesis but must be associated congenital developmental ano malies; and thirdly, other congenital dysgeneses, parti cularly involving the eye, ear, and aorta. They could find no evidence that the condition is hereditary. Lisser and his co-workers (1947) were able to report on 25 cases which they had personally observed. They remark upon their extraordinary uniformity in appear ance and build, and use the term " shield-like chest" to describe their patients' frontal aspect. Salient Features of the Syndrome 1. Gonadal.-Primary :-Lack of development of ovaries -surgical exploration of some cases (Wilkins and Fleisch mann) has revealed " ovaries " consisting of a primitive genital ridge composed only of stroma-like cells. Epithelial or primordial germ-cell proliferation is absent. Secondary: Primary amenorrhoea-this is invariable, and the usual presenting complaint. The vagina and uterus are infantile in size and in mucosal differentiation. The breasts are non existent, the nipples pin-point. The pubic hair is usually present but scanty; sometimes absent. Bone age is normal, or only slightly backward. Generalized osteoporosis of varying degree is present. Urinary gonadotropins are in creased, the number of mouse units (depending on the method used) usually considerably exceeding 50 in 24 hours (Wilkins and Fleischmann, 1944; Sohval, 1951). Urinary 17-ketosteroids are diminished but not absent, typical values being around 2-5 mg. in 24 hours. Insulin tolerance is normal, with normal hypoglycaemic responsiveness. The appearance is female. Libido is usually present, often strong, and normally heterosexual. Oestrogen therapy leads to development of secondary sexual characters. 2. Skeletal.-Stature is short-around 53 in. (135 cm.) not really dwarfed; rarely tall (Sohval). The build is stocky, thick-set, with wide " shield-like " chest. The span is often wide, some inches greater than the height; otherwise the proportions are normal. Minor vertebral chondrodystrophy is common; the cervical spine, although occasionally bifid, or fused as in Klippel-Feil's disease, is usually normal. Webbed neck is usually but not invariably present. It is remarkable that this odd deformity is so commonly asso ciated with ovarian agenesis and occurs only very rarely in other citcumstances. Cubitus valgus-a decreased "carry ing angle" was part of the original syndrome described by Turner, but is not invariable. This obtuse angle between the humerus and radius is normally slightly smaller in females than in males, averaging 167 degrees (Gray's Ana tomy, 1944). Pes cavus, talipes, syndactyly, and various minor vertebral anomalies also occur. 3. Associated Anomalies.-Ocular defects are curiously frequent, squint, ptosis, and cataract being the most com mon. Coarctation of the aorta has been found several times, and hypertension of independent occurrence is mentioned by Wilkins and Fleischmann. Mental defect and deaf mutism are reported by those authors. Diagnosis Originally the diagnosis of primary ovarian agenesis was established by two special procedures-the direct examina tion of what genital tissue there was, usually by laparotomy, and the demonstration of increased urinary pituitary gonado tropins, which exculpated the pituitary gland. It was gradually realized, however, that the clinical syndrome as outlined above was so characteristic that it could be diag nosed without such elaborate enterprises; in fact, it has become one of the select group of disorders that can be diagnosed on sight (Case 2). The complaint of primary amenorrhoea, the stocky, thick-set, broad-chested, shori individual, with webbed or at least short-looking neck, the lack of breast tissue, pin-point nipples, and minute pale pink areolae make an unmistakable picture. Cases have</page><page sequence="2">AUG. 15, 1953 TURNER'S SYNDROME IN THE FEMALE TIBmSIN 369 MM~ICA JOURNAL even been diagnosed before the time of puberty (Lisser et al., 1947), the skeletal changes being so characteristic (cf. Case 3). The elimination of hypopituitarism is easy: sufferers from this are truly dwarfed rather than small, frail and delicate rather than stocky; their necks are normal, their pubic hair is completely absent, their bone age is very back ward, their gonadotropin output is very low, and their 17 ketosteroids are minimal. They are extremely sensitive to insulin, so that only one-fifth to one-tenth of the normal amount should be used for tolerance test if hypopituitarism is suspected; and they show hypoglycaemic unresponsive ness (Albright, Smith, and Fraser). Finally, oestrogens do not produce any response in respect of secondary sexual characters. The following cases all presented themselves at Groote Schuur Hospital within the course of a few weeks. Case 1 A girl aged 18 complained of never having menstruated. She had always been somewhat smaller than her friends of the same age. Pubic and axillary hair had developed at 15. She was mentally bright and had done well at school. Her sex feelings were apparently normally strong. She had a "' serious " boy friend. All ON76- II ~~~her family were normal, in cluding eight siblings. Ex amination revealed a short, dumpy, bright girl with re dundant skin folds each side of her neck (Fig. 1). Her left 'eye was red, the lids were swollen, and the eye lashes deficient, owing to a congenitally blocked naso i *9 | . lacrimal duct. Pubic and axillary hair was present in moderate growth. Breast tissue was entirely absent and the nipples were pin point. The carrying angle was small (about 163 de grees), but not excessively SO. There was a mild pes cavus at rest. Her weight was 92 lb. (41.7 kg.); height, 56 in. (142 cm.); span, 60 in. (152 cm.); pubic height (lower segment), 271 in. (70 cm.); upper segment, 28j in. FIG. 1 -Case 1 Webbed (72 cm.); head circumfer neck, thick-set build, pin-point ence, 21 in. (53 cm.) Her nipples fairpubichair. external genitalia and uterus were infantile, and uterine scraping produced no endometrial tissue. Other systems were normal. The blood pressure was 140/90 mm. Hg. Radiographs showed slight general osteoporosis. The bone age was within normal limits, a little behind that of the control of same age and sex. The right twelfth rib was missing, and there were minor irregularities of vertebral bodies. The skull was normal except for slight porosis of the middle table. The B.M.R. was -13 ?,' and -19% (two estimations on Sanborn metabulor); E.C.G. normal; and the Wassermann reaction negative.

Repetition of the test gave more normal figures; certainly no undue sensitivity was shown. The 17-ketosteroids were (1) 2.4 mg. per 24 hours (normal 6-S1 mg.); (2) 2.6 mg.; serum cholesterol, 360 mg. per 100 mL; urine gonadotropins (F.S.H.), positive at 96 mouse uterine units per 24 hours (method of Klinefelter, Albright, and Griswold, 1943). Stilboestrol, 1 mg. a day, was given for three weeks of every four, with ethisterone, 10 mg. a day, for the last 14 days of each four-weeks cycle. An apparently normal period of five days' duration occurred after the first month. Devel opment of breasts and growth and pigmentation of nipples and areolae were evident after two months. Comment.-This was a very typical case of ovarian agenesis, with the low B.M.R. and high cholesterol (not repeated) as the only unexpected features. She bore no mental, clinical, or skeletal resemblance to a cretin. Case 2 Within a week of the admission of Case 1, a coloured girl aged 17 presented herself, quite fortuitously, to one of us at the out-patient department. Her very appearance short, dumpy, and short-necked, with ocular asymmetry was enough to suggest the syndrome. After a complaint of primary amenorrhoea, we were able to predict the other typical features. She denied all sex feelings. All her family were normal, in cluding two. sisters.

Her measurements are actually the opposite of eunuchoid (with larger lower segment), and lend weight to the belief that the statural peculiarities are not themselves due to gonadal deprivation. She did not bother to follow her treatment schedule. Case 3 A red-haired girl aged 94 complained of a discharging ear. Her performance at school was quite good. There was no relevant family his tory.

Comment. - Despite the young age and the absence of special examinations, we have no hesitation in forecast ing a lack of development of breast tissue and of menstrua tion. The hypertension was noteworthy. Factors Involved in the Syndrome The curious clinical attributes of these patients have made them subject to much pathogenetic speculation. Most writers, accepting a genetic ovarian defect, agree that this alone cannot explain all the abnormalities. The occurrence of multiple congenital anomalies in the syndrome makes it likely that shortness of stature is but one manifestation of a germinally defective soma, not directly related to the degree of ovarian agenesis (Sohval, 1951 ; Wilkins and Fleischmann, 1944). Indeed, a feature such as cubitus valgus is an anthropomorphic feminism, while skeletal lengthening, rather than shortening, typically follows oestrogen lack at an early age (" eunuchoidism "). The frequent osteoporosis may be ascribed to the loss of osteoblastic effect of oestrogens, and is comparable to the similar condition of menopausal women (Albright and Reifenstein). In this syndrome of ovarian agenesis, how ever, the osteoporosis, although slight, is more universal than is the typical vertebral rarefaction of menopausal females. By the same token it has been suggested by Wilkins and Fleischmann that hypertension (present in some degree in our three cases, without evidence of coarctation) is com parable to that found in Cushing's svndrome and the post menopausal state in which there is aiso an oestrogen deficit associated with persistence of adrenocortical androgens. The extremely rare findings of good breast development (Lisser et al., 1947; Hertz et al., 1950) and of diminished urinary gonadotropins (Hertz er al.) with proved absence of ovarian tissue are not readily understood. Role of Adrenal Cortes The presence of a little pubic and axillary hair and urinary 17-ketosteroids in Turner's syndrome is ascribable with fair certainty to adrenal activity. Albright et al. (1942) contended that this adrenal cortical function is nevertheless below normal, conceivably as a result of altered pituitary stimulation in the anovarian state. He therefore blames the adrenal cortex for a decreased growth rate and consequent shortness of the patients. With this problem in mind, we applied some of the re cently adopted tests for adrenal cortical function (Thorn and Forsham, 1950) to our Cases 1 and 2. Circulating eosinophils and the urinary uric-acid/creatinine ratio were determined before and after an intramuscular injection of 25 mg. of A.C.T.H. (see Table). Thorn Test Eosinophils per c.mm. Uric-acid/Creatinine Ratio Case No. Before After Fall Before After Re A.C.T.H. A.C.T.H. A.C.T.H. A.C.T.H.i 1 120 50 58 3y. 0-36 0o67 83 /7% 2 80 30 62-5% 066 096 464%o A fall of 50% or more in circulating eosinophils and a rise of more than 50% in the uric-acid/creatinine ratio are said to denote adequate adrenal cortical function. By these criteria, in neither Case 1 nor Case 2 were the adrenals responsible for any of the shortcomings; but it is by no means acceptable that such procedures test all functional modalities with equal fairness. Bartter, Forbes, and Albright (1950) measured the effects of A.C.T.H. administration on steroid, electrolyte, and nitrogen metabolism in a case of ovarian agenesis. They interpreted the results as confirming slight hypofunction of the adrenal cortex, but concurrent findings in a normal control are not given. Further study in this field may be of value in augmenting the scope of hormonal treatment in these little women. Summary All congenital hypogonadism is not of pituitary origin. The syndrome of primary ovarian aplasia is described, starting with a brief account of the history of the recog nition of the condition. Turner in 1938 first remarked the peculiar combination of webbed neck, short stature, and female infantilism. The important features of the condition are considered, and these are so characteristic as to present an unmistakable and readily diagnosable picture, plainly distinct from primary hypopituitarism, cretinism, eunuchoidism, or any other clinical state. Final proof of diagnosis is to be sought in the urinary gonadotropin level and the laparotomy finding of lack of ovarian tissue, but these are really unnecessary embellishments of a cast-iron clinical diagnosis. Two itllstrative cases are described, both with high urinary F.S.H. A third case is presented, and although the patient is only 10 years old we believe the diagnosis to be ineluctable. The curious conglomeration of congenital anomalies in the clinical picture is discussed. The modern tests of suprarenal function were applied to the first two cases, and normal responses were obtained. We are pleased to thank Professor F. Forman for his interest and advice in this article, and Dr. W. H. Opie for permission to report the third case. Dr. H. Zwarenstein kindly performed the tests for gonadotropins.
