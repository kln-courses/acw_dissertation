<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological objects have been at the centre of several legal battles in recent years, but one of the most celebrated legal cases involving antiquities came to an end exactly 90 years ago. Ken Neill, a Senior Inspector in Northern Ireland's Environment Service, gives the details. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND The Broighter Hoard or hato Carson caught the boat ONE FEBRUARY evening in 1896 in the townland of Broighter, Co. Deny, close to the shore of Lough Foyle, Thomas Nicholl and James Morrow unwittingly became the principal witnesses in a controversial legal case which was to last until 1903. Nicholl later described how, using a new type of American plough, he 'had been double ploughing a stubble field to a depth of eleven inches when the plough was jerked by striking some object'. When he investigated he saw that the coulter of the plough held a small metal dish, and close by in the ploughed ground were a number of other metal objects 'arranged inside one another'. The two men took the finds back to the farmyard and they were washed in the open sink by a maid who later married Thomas. Her statement that 'it is quite possible that some small objects may have been washed down the open drain, for it was not then known that the finds were of gold and no great care was taken in their cleaning' is every archaeologist's nightmare. It may also be significant that Mr Nicholl commented that the objects 'felt as if they had been coated with some greasy material'. It later emerged that the plough had uncovered two bar tores, two necklaces and a beaten bowl, as well as an elaborately decorated buffer tore and an Page 24</page><page sequence="2">exquisite model boat complete with mast and oars. The objects were probably deposited some time after 100 BC, making the boat the earliest evidence for the use of sail in Irish waters. After cleaning, the objects were taken to the farm owner who sold them to a jeweller in Deny City the next day. They were then bought by the Cork antiquarian Robert Day, who had the damaged objects restored in Dublin before taking them to London. The hoard became public knowledge the next year, 1897, when Arthur Evans (of Knossos fame) published an article on the objects and the Royal Irish Academy promptly demanded that they be declared treasure trove and handed over to it. In the ensuing controversy Day withdrew the offer of the gift of an ancient bell to the Academy and they understandably withdrew their vote of thanks! The finds then became a matter of national dispute when it emerged that Day had sold them to the British Museum for ?600 and they refused to part with the treasure. The case dragged on until June 1903 when it was brought to the High Court in London. Two eminent King's Counsellors represented the British Museum, while the Crown case (and hence the RIA) was put by the Attorney General, aided by the Solicitor-General and prominent Unionist, Sir Edward Carson. The Attorney-General's case was straightforward; the objects had been hidden with intent to recover and as treasure trove belonged to the Crown. In contrast, the British Museum argued that the hoard was a votive offering, abandoned with no intent to recover. Therefore, it was not treasure trove and was rightfully theirs. As a secondary defence they also argued that even if the hoard was deemed treasure trove, the Crown had delegated this privilege to the Fishmongers Company and through them to Joseph Gibson, the landowner. Much of the argument centred on whether the field at Broighter had been under the sea at the time when the hoard was deposited and a stream of learned witnesses were called to give evidence. Some argued that the area had indeed been at the bottom of the sea 2000 years ago; others such as Robert Lloyd Praeger fe ^HH ; jmSK?k, i ! IHHh??- ! ^ HBHP?"

Upon investigation they saw that the coulter of the plough held a small metal dish, and close by in the ploughed ground were a number of other metal objects 'arranged inside one another'.

The inclusion of the exquisite model boat could also be seen as evidence that this was an offering to a water deity rather than a hastily hidden treasure. The importance of votive deposits in early society was not realised 90 years ago, however, and Mr Justice Farwell was able to state 'there is no known case on record of any votive offering having ever been made in Ireland at any time'! King Edward VII gave the objects into the keeping of the Royal Irish Academy a few weeks later and they are now housed in the National Museum in Dublin. Controversy has continued to sunound the hoard, however, with claims that it was in fact found inside an old umbrella in a ditch and that the objects are not a genuine Irish hoard. It is quite possible that part of an old umbrella was found close to the find-spot, as Mrs Nicholl stated that James Morrow searched the area on the day after the find, and the entire field was later dug over by treasure hunters. Today, however, most archaeologists accept that the Broighter objects are a genuine hoard. If Thomas Nicholl was aware of the controversy he must have been puzzled as to why none of those who doubted his version of events ever spoke to him, despite the fact that he died as recently as 1964 in his 91st year. Finally, it is worth speculating whether Justice Farwell would have made the same judgement if he had been as aware as we are today of the undoubted role of votive offerings in early society. It is certainly possible that he would have looked on the British Museum's case more sympathetically and allowed it to keep its purchase, so perhaps Sir Edward Carson deserves a posthumous vote of thanks from the National Museum.

It was even reported that a Professor Howell had suggested that this part of Ulster had once been part of the North Pole! Thomas Nicholl, then aged 28, was brought to London as one of the principal witnesses for the Academy, but his rich north Deny accent proved too much for the court officials and it was found necessary to engage Professor J. L. Myers, a lecturer in Classical Archaeology at Oxford, as an interpreter! Eventually, after four days of legal submissions, Mr Justice Farwell pronounced the hoard treasure trove and ordered that it be handed over to King Edward VII. He was obviously not impressed by the British Museum's case and summed up by stating that 'The court had been occupied for some considerable time in listening to fanciful suggestions more suited to the poem of a Celtic bard than to the prose of a legal reporter. The defence has asked the court to infer the existence of an anthropomorphic deity; the existence of an unknown sea; and the existence of mythical Irish chiefs or kings who would be likely to make a surmised votive offering to this mythical Irish Neptune'. Farwell considered that the most crucial evidence was the fact that the objects came from an area only nine inches square, incompatible in his opinion with votive deposition in the sea. No one at the time seems to have considered the possibility that a votive offering could have been in a bag or container which had subsequently decomposed. In hindsight could this explain the greasy material which Mr Nicholl noticed on the objects? More recently Richard Warner has argued that the hoard was indeed a votive offering, buried where it was found or cast into the River Roe or Lough Foyle and subsequently washed up during flooding. This theory has much to commend it, most notably the fact that the flat and Page 26</page></plain_text>
