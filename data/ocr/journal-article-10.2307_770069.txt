<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER STANLEY STILES 15 June 1901-15 December 1985 Elected F.R.S. 1957 BY M. ALPERN WALTER STANLEY STILES lived almost his entire life in or about London. Born there on 15 June 1901, he died on 15 December 1985 at his home in Richmond, Surrey. His maternal grandfather was a native of the west country who went to sea, and then settled in the south. His maternal grandmother was from Norfolk. His sister, Mrs Grace Etheridge, three years his senior, writes: '...they were of "yeomen stock" and had the qualities of honesty of purpose which such people at that time appeared to possess'. No doubt these included a reluctance to complain, and for W. S. Stiles's mother, Elizabeth Catherine (nee Smith) Stiles, it was a fatal one. In January 1919 she died at the age of 42 from peritonitis after a ruptured appendix. The following year, Stiles's father-also Walter Stiles (1866-1967)-having devoted his working career to the Metropolitan Police, retired at the age of 54, in the middle of a long life. W. S. Stiles's paternal grandfather (also Walter Stiles), a builder of Cobham, Kent, had a brother, James, a corn merchant of Pimlico, whose son (still a fourth Walter Stiles, an artist) was the father of a fifth Walter Stiles (1889-1966), Professor of Botany at University College, Reading University and later at Birmingham University, who was elected to Fellowship in the Royal Society in 1928 for his studies of salt uptake by plant cells and of plant respiration (James 1967). With the abundance of this family forename, W. S. Stiles was 'Stanley' throughout his life to family and friends alike. Stanley Stiles attended Burlington (Preparatory) School and St George's Higher Grade School. In 1912 he entered the Polytechnic Day School, Regent's Street, London, as a student of the Technical Secondary School (on the commercial side) in one of 12 free places. We can gather 817</page><page sequence="2">*6 -f IZ-1</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs some idea of the environment he found there from a brief history of the school prepared some 45 years after the event (Seaman 1957, p. 30): Before 1919 the school had at least three different purposes. First-in its own estimation, we feel-was its work as the rough equivalent of a junior technical school, aiming to fit boys for apprenticeship to a trade. Second, was its approximation to a commercial school, aiming at equipping boys for junior post in offices. Third, it could, if necessary, give a boy the appropriate instruction to enable him to pass the qualifying examinations for entry into the lowest grades of the Civil Service, or even to get him through the London Matriculation, which would qualify him to begin a university course. Few boys however reached this standard .... For example, in 1912 only four boys succeeded in matriculating from the school. According to Seaman (p. 40), 'The outbreak of the First World War tended to turn the Polytechnic into a vast recruiting depot and the School into something like a species of young soldier's battalion.' Seaman goes on to quote G. E. Dench ( a Latin and English master in Stiles's day, later to become Second Master) in an article published in The Quintinian in 1934 in describing the atmosphere in that period: 'Extraordinary amateurs on the teaching staff filled the places of the good men at the front. Every boy was a cadet and the drills made sad havoc with the lessons.' In Seaman's view (p. 41), Dench 'clearly regarded the war years as constituting "the most difficult period" in the school's history up to 1919'. If Stiles felt at all deprived or cheated by this, there is no record of it. In his Personal Record he notes that he 'took chemistry and physics. The laboratories were very good, and I became very keen on chemistry'. In June 1917, along with four other boys and two girls, he passed the University of London Matriculation Examination. He took a position with Messrs Johnson &amp; Matthey as a learner assay chemist, continuing his studies in the evening at Birkbeck College, which was then not yet a part of the University of London. Its work was devoted in the main to education in the evening of those who, like Stiles, supported themselves by full-time jobs during the day. However, after some time Stiles resigned from his position at Johnson &amp; Matthey and become one of the rare full-time students at the College. In July 1918 he passed Inter Science (chemistry, physics, mathematics) and won an Andrews Entrance Scholarship (Science) to University College London. He entered in October 1918 as a student of chemistry. Under the influence of Professor Alfred W. Porter, F.R.S., he switched to physics as his main subject after one year. As an undergraduate he was influenced most by Professor Porter and Professor W. H. (later Sir William) Bragg, F.R.S. He took the B.Sc. London (External), with second class honours in physics in October 1920. At Bragg's invitation, he stayed on as a junior Demonstrator in Physics 818</page><page sequence="4">Walter Stanley Stiles and did a little research: an X-ray spectrometer study of organic crystals. Kathleen (Yardley) Lonsdale, F.R.S., William Thompson Astbury, F.R.S., and J. Desmond Bernal, F.R.S., among others, began dis- tinguished careers by planting their roots in this fertile soil. Whatever Stiles's contributions to biophysics owe to the formative years under Bragg is not so easy to sort out, for unlike the others he did not follow Bragg's interest in crystallography. He notes in his Record that most of his spare time was spent in taking courses: Professor Watson's course in zoology for the first M.B. and Professor Gwynne Vaughann's first M.B. course in Botany (Birkbeck College). Mrs Etheridge continues: 'From boyhood he was always more interested in some form of analytical study rather than in games .... He once bought a Hebrew second-hand book-to study the language.' Family legend has it that it was a Hebrew-English dictionary. He had decided to study the Old Testament in the original language when confined to bed with an illness. He later learned Danish, according to these sources, to get to know better a young Danish visitor living for a time with the Etheridges. He also learned German, Italian and French. Among the books at his bedside on his dying day were a new English-Spanish dictionary (perhaps bought in preparation for the symposium held in his honour in Peniscola, Spain, in September 1985) and Fourman's Teach yourself Russian. This facility and his years with Bragg were responsible for his first publication: a translation into English of a German textbook of crystallography (1).* Later, in collaboration with his supervisor in the Photometry Section at the National Physical Laboratory (N.P.L.), he undertook a translation from Italian into English of the second edition of Recent advances in atomic physics by G. Castelfranchi (21). When this was finished he wrote to John von Neumann and to a London publisher raising the possibility of translating von Neumann's Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik (1932) into English. Von Neumann was agreeable but the publisher evidently decided that the book was too thick and the population of potential readers too thin. (More than 20 years later, an English translation by another translator and a different publisher did appear.) Two of his papers are not in English. One of these (28) was probably written in German directly by him. The other, doubtless was written with the considerable assistance of his Spanish co- author, Senior J. Cabello (65). Stiles claimed at the time of the Peniscola Stiles Symposium not to understand much Spanish. Stiles left University College in 1922. Two decades later, he recalled in his Journal the possibilities that then lay before him: 'to study (1) medicine, (2) math and (3) physics'. No doubt it was with the first in mind that he had taken courses in zoology and botany in the preceding * Numbers given in this form refer to entries in the bibliography at the end of the text. 819</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs two years. But he was drawn to mathematics (an attraction lasting the rest of his life). On 17 October 1922 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, with the aim of taking Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in June of 1924. Two books stood out for him as the main influence of his Cambridge days: G. H. Hardy's Pure mathematics and Constantin Caratheodory's Vorlesungen iiber reelle Funktionen. In the spring of 1923 he took Part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos and was placed in the second class. Abruptly the plan to take Part II the following year was altered; he left Cambridge after only three terms. We are told: 'indifferent health and differences with my father leading me to throw up the course'. 'Indifferent health' was to plague him throughout his life in which he achieved a great deal, despite it. According to Mrs Etheridge, the 'differences with his father' was an unwillingness of his father to offer financial support. The latter had recently remarried; no doubt there were other needs for the limited income of a retired Superintendent of Metropolitan Police. This decision changed his life. In the Journal passage quoted in the preceding paragraph enumerating his options on leaving University College, the next sentence is: 'I chose (2), went to Cambridge, but made a mess of things'. All his life he continued to study mathematics, consistently working through the examples at the ends of the chapters. At the age of 48, he confided in his Journal: My general interest in maths lies in the direction of theory of functions, real and analytic-Fourier integrals &amp; integral functions. The indispensable basis is a good knowledge of the matter of Titchmarsh's Theory of Functions. At the same time other branches of maths must be brushed up: Baker on Geometry, Schlesinger on differential equations, and also de la Vallee Pousin .... I hope in the next two years to bring myself up to Part II standard in pure maths. Having completed no postgraduate research, Stiles left Cambridge and became lecturer in physics and mathematics in the Municipal College, Portsmouth. After a year he joined the Royal Naval Signal School in Portsmouth as a Junior Scientific Officer. There he developed a sensitive audio-frequency amplifier for electrode signalling. In 1925 he transferred to the N.P.L. in Teddington, where he remained until retiring in June of 1961. In his first year he worked on thermionic emission and on general photometric problems. Thermionic emission is the subject of his next book (13). It is a survey of knowledge (up to December 1930) on this subject with particular reference to the filaments of radio valves. 820</page><page sequence="6">Walter Stanley Stiles ILLUMINATING ENGINEERING In due course Stiles found himself in the Photometry Section of the Light Division. At this time, though the discovery of the incandescent filament lamp was 45 years old, the design of light sources and lighting fixtures was still largely empirical. The prodigious increase in the use of the car at night introduced a new dimension to problems of glare and visibility which had to be better understood if motor car headlights and street light fixtures were to be fabricated with more rational design principles and more precisely positioned for optimum visibility and minimal discomfort. It was toward the understanding of glare that Dr J. W. T. Walsh, the head of the Photometry Section, assigned the research of the junior scientific officer newly placed in his charge. In 1925, glare research was floundering. On the one hand were a considerable amount of laboratory data on visibility which, although obviously relevant, could not easily be extrapolated to field conditions because of the use of controls necessary in laboratory work: monocular viewing through a small artificial pupil, for example. On the other hand was a growing body of information obtained by different investigators using field conditions of observation but with different kinds of test objects, the results of which did not seem to cohere. Moreover, the search for the sources of the effects of glare spanned a range of possibilities, from such purely physical constructs as scatter of light within the eye to vague psychological concepts, such as 'nervous strain'. The problem was attacked from many sides; many variables were found to influence the results, but their interdependence made understanding difficult. An influential report (Troland 1922) distinguished between veiling glare, dazzling glare and scotomatic or blinding glare in an effort to analyse glare into components. Luckeish &amp; Holladay (1925), Holladay (1926) in the laboratories of the General Electric Company in Cleveland, Ohio, made a distinction-contrary to usage-between glare and visibility, confining the former to the experience of the observer and the latter to the state of the object he sees. Stiles (10) made a more useful distinction-now standard practice-between disability glare (i.e. the reduction of visibility produced by a glare source which is not necessarily accompanied by discomfort) and discomfort glare (i.e. the sensations experienced with glare sources which are uncomfortable but do not necessarily interfere with seeing). The importance of this was his insight that the latter could best be analysed by rather imprecise subjective instruments, such as psychological questionnaires, but that the former could be probed, with considerable analytical depth, by requiring observers to judge whether the radiance of a small circular test spot was such that the spot was visible or not. Stiles's science was not anything if it was not thorough, and in his analysis of glare he studied both discomfort and disability glare; but his main contributions to the study 821</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs of glare and to vision research more generally emerged from the imaginative use of the measurement of threshold of a small test spot. Stiles's study of disability glare (2, 6, 7) measured threshold increments and decrements of a 2? test spot for central vision on a background of luminance B in the presence of a glare source which produced a variable illuminance E in the plane of the pupil, with the glare source at angle 0 from the line of sight. Results with this arrangement are well described by the following equation, which was found to hold over a great variety of experimental conditions: f = B + mE/On, [1] in which m and n are positive constants, and /f is the luminance of a background in the absence of the glare source which produces that threshold also found in the presence of a given background, of luminance B, and the glare source. If several glare sources at different positions in the visual field are used, the relation still holds, providing the simple summation mLEEi/O is substituted for the final term in equation [1]. Stiles called /f the equivalent background. Equation [1] is an empirical relationship used by Holladay to describe results obtained over a limited range of conditions for an opaque annular test target whose bright surround was varied for threshold annulus visibility. Stiles's immediate concern was to see if the same relation was valid over a wider range of field conditions, including importantly those relevant for street lighting and motor car headlight viewing, and whether it was equally useful for the much simpler detection threshold of decrements and increments of a small circular patch of light. Equation [1] is now known as the Holladay-Stiles equation of disability glare, not only because Stiles provided affirmative answers to these questions, but also because he showed how, with the equation, results with different test targets from different laboratories (not only at N.P.L. and in the U.S.A., but also in Holland and Italy)-which seemed incoherent when plotted as functions of test threshold radiance-could be made to cohere remarkably well when plotted as functions of equivalent background radiance as the dependent variable. For Holladay /f was the equivalent veiling brightness, one of the three kinds of glare according to the Troland (1922) report. But the 'equivalent background' had deeper significance for Stiles. It quantified the 'equivalence principle', a necessary consequence of the hypothesis that (i) a localized retinal area can exist in various states of adaptation, depending upon previous stimulations of the entire retina and on the immediate stimulation of the retina external to the given area, and that (ii) changes in these states of adaptation cause variations in the perception of a stimulus to the area at any given time. Stiles &amp; Crawford (19) tested this hypothesis with a bright 'conditioning stimulus' and with various parameters for the test, including its size, duration and colour. Although 822</page><page sequence="8">Walter Stanley Stiles thresholds with different test parameters varied widely, it was found with white light that the conditioning stimulus had the same equivalent background independent of these parameters and that the identity persisted, regardless of the luminance of the conditioning stimulus, though the equivalent background varied with this conditioning stimulus luminance. This result verified the equivalence principle and thus provided evidence in favour of the assumptions used in deriving it, including the interesting assumption that the effect of imposing a steady, uniform area of white light over the entire field affects a localized test only by changing the state of adaptation in the test area. These results were of immediate practical value and they provided the core upon which Stiles's subsequent work on glare and visibility mainly depended. For example, from them he was encouraged to build glare meters (11, 29) which allowed him to measure the equivalent background of actual head lamps and street lights at night in the street to verify the validity of equation [1] in the field. But more fundamental was the application of the equivalence principle to other problems of retinal adaptation and of visual perception more generally. Two of these will suffice here as representative of the breadth and primary qualities of the principle. The retina maintains sensitivity to small perturbations in luminance over an extensive range of background luminances following the so-called Weber law AB/B = constant (AB is the threshold luminance of the test on the background of luminance B). On the other hand, following exposures sufficient to bleach nearly all the molecules of visual pigment, this same sensitivity falls in the dark by a factor of 105 slowly over the course of an hour or so. How these two aspects of visual adaptation-light (or field) adaptation and dark adaptation-are related is a fundamental problem still unresolved. In the 1920s and 1930s it was widely, if not generally, believed that the slow course of recovery of dark adaptation reflected regeneration of visual pigment in the receptors, but this explanation in its simplest form predicts that the time course of recovery in the dark would be independent of test size. But experiment showed that test size was an important variable in both dark and field adaptation. An important advance was made when Crawford (1937) used the equivalence principle to unify the effect of test size in field and dark adaptation by showing that the equivalent background followed a recovery time course in the dark after exposure to a flash largely independent of test size. In a significant review lecture on adaptation, Stiles (86) presciently noted that 'The equivalent background idea, although quite old, has not in my opinion been used as much as it deserves'. Indeed, it was shortly to assume a central role in experiments on, and the theory of, adaptation in the hands of such forceful proponents as H. B. Barlow, F.R.S. (Barlow 1964; Barlow &amp; Sparrock 1964) and W. A. H. Rushton, F.R.S. (1963, 823</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs 1965), who held opposing views of equivalence physiology. Barlow's ideas were extended in the elegant model of Lamb (1981) in which the back reactions of photolysis provide the equivalent background (or dark-light) of bleaching. The model predicts increased frequency of quantum-like electrophysiological events in the rod following bleaching, a prediction confirmed directly in single toad rods by Lamb (1980). On the other hand, this model is inconsistent with the separation of real light signals and dark light signals detectable in some night-blind people (Alpern et al. 1972). The matter remains to be settled by recording events inside single rods to a variety of bleaching and equivalent background in succession, once procedures for carrying out such experiments on viable human rods are routine. However this is resolved, the role of the equivalence principle remains fundamental to our understanding of dark and light adaptation. The equivalence principle was used in the study of a more perceptual form of adaptation (following prolonged fixation of a series of dark and bright bars-a grating) by Blakemore &amp; Nachmias (1971). Even more remote from problems of glare and visibility was the recent application of the equivalence principle to test single-mechanism theories of visual space localization by Palmer (1984). This work extends the equivalence principle to problems of visual perception very different from matters discussed in Stiles's Madrid lecture. Still, it is derived directly from his paper with Crawford (19), and Palmer clearly acknowledges his debt to it. The equivalence principle was one fundamental spin-off of Stiles's work on glare, of basic importance for vision research more generally. A second was the usefulness of thresholds of a small test spot. The latter was to become a major technique in Stiles's later experiments. When in due course he applied it to the case of a test light of one monochromatic light upon a background of another, he increased by 100 % the variety in the set of experiments devoted to the study of colour based upon what Brindley (1960) called the 'psychophysical linking hypothesis', that optic nerve signals which are physically identical will yield identical visual sensations. Stiles was a physicist. He approached scientific problems in general, and glare and visibility in particular, at their fundamental roots. For example, his studies on glare include an evaluation of Raman's theory that disability glare was a result of entoptic scatter within the eye. He analysed the problem as a theoretical physicist applying the theory of Rayleigh scattering after showing that any contribution from reflections at the internal surfaces in the eye media can be neglected. The results, compared with measurements of equivalent background by Holladay and himself, were sufficiently discordant with theory to convince Stiles that scattering within the eye media played only a minor role in elevation of threshold by glare sources (8). This conclusion is consistent with 824</page><page sequence="10">Walter Stanley Stiles subsequent studies, which find no evidence for measurable entoptic Rayleigh scatter in normal eyes. But many illuminating engineers still maintain that entoptic stray light from glare sources reaching the foveal image of the test in ways not considered in this paper (e.g. halation at the fundus or transcleral illumination) is the major source of threshold elevation by glare sources. This view was implicit (but not explicit) with the discovery by Stiles &amp; Crawford (36) that whether a glare source was imaged on the fovea, or alternatively on the optic nerve head (which contains no photoreceptors), the effect was no different from that found when it was located at any other point of equal angular distance from the test spot. Evidently Stiles was persuaded by this result-though I found no evidence in his published work-for in a personal communication dated 8 October 1987 Professor W. D. Wright noted: 'we used to meet over lunch or somewhere and argue things out, but we rarely got heated about it. We differed, for example, over the causes of glare. He seemed to think it was all due to light scatter and that lateral inhibition played no part.' But being a physicist did not mean ignoring the practical problem of illumination engineering. Indeed, in his first half dozen years working on these problems he became in fact an illuminating engineer. His fundamental measurements of foveal increment thresholds in the laboratory (6) were often binocular and almost always using natural pupil precisely because they were conditions appropriate for field application. It is only after his invention of a glare meter, which can be used to measure thresholds and equivalent backgrounds in the field, that measurements made in the laboratory are carried out with a small artificial pupil. During this period are several papers devoted to very practical illumination problems such as 'The street-lighting requirements of different types of streets' (18), 'Mass experiments in street-lighting' (17), 'The evaluation of glare in street-lighting installations' (15), 'The evaluation of glare from motor headlights' (26) and 'Problems of headlight illumination: dazzle and fog' (31). Much of this research had to be done in the field, out of doors at night, often in cold damp weather. In his Journal, dated 29 March 1934, we find the following entry: Easter vacation commenced this evening.

In 1928, Walsh became Honorary Secretary of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (C.I.E.) and he appointed Stiles as General Secretary and Editor. Stiles served a three-year term culminating in the 1931 Cambridge Conference of the Commission. At the 8th Session of this conference the famous 1931 C.I.E. Standard Observer Color Matching Functions were adopted. He served on many committees of the Illuminating Engineering Society, including a committee on the physiology of vision and one on mine lighting, as well as on its Council; he was elected a Fellow of that Society in 1943 and in 1960 its President. He was awarded its Gold Medal in 1967. THE EFFECT OF ANGLE OF INCIDENCE OF A RAY OF LIGHT STRIKING THE RETINA ON THE BRIGHTNESS AND COLOUR OF THE SENSATION IT EVOKES From the start in the Photometry Section, it was clear that Stiles needed some way to measure pupil size in the field. In the early work on glare (7) he did it by photography. But with the short exposures required and the photographic plates available at the time, useful data could not be obtained on subjects with dark irises. Infrared film became available around 1935, and it was used for the first time on this problem shortly thereafter by Stiles's colleague, B. H. Crawford (Crawford 1936). Between these events, Stiles invented an ingenious subjective pupil- lometer based on the principle familiar from photography that the illuminance (E) of an optical image, is directly proportional to the product of the luminance of the object and the area of the entrance pupil of the optical system. In 1917 the American psychologist Leonard Thompson Troland emphasized that the physiological stimulus for vision is the retinal image and that its intensity should be analogously quantified. He introduced a unit of retinal illuminance (which he called the photon) defined as the retinal illuminance of an object of luminance 1 cd m2 viewed through a pupil area of 1 mm2. (The rise of quantum mechanics was associated with a quite different meaning of the word Troland used for his unit, and after Troland's premature death in 1932 the unit was called a troland.) Stiles's idea was to have an observer make a photometric match 826</page><page sequence="12">Walter Stanley Stiles between two fields; the light reaching the retina from one of these depended upon the area of the pupil (A), whereas the light reaching the retina from the other was independent of A. Figure 1 at the top illustrates the final version of this instrument developed and used by Stiles &amp; Crawford (22). Light from the source diffused by the opal glass O was reflected by the prism to fill the hole E in the centre of which the subject's pupil was centred. From this same source, light illuminated a ground glass, a variable attenuator neutral wedge W and the small circular aperture stop P. The lens formed an image of P 1.5 mm in diameter in the plane of the subject's entrance pupil (so that the lens is seen filled with light in Maxwellian view). If the diameter of the subject's pupil is at least 1.5 mm, all the light in this second path is collected by the eye. The two homogeneous fields (below on the left) are divided by the edge of the prism: the brightness of the upper field is independent of, and that of the lower field is dependent upon, the area of the subject's pupil (A).

With that adjustment, according to principles upon which the instrument is designed (and the troland based): B,A, = BUAu, [2] in which the Bs refer to illuminances, the As refer to limiting entrance pupil areas, and the subscripts 1 and u refer to lower and upper fields respectively. Since A = A1, A = (1.5)2rcBu/4B,, = aCr, where a is a constant. When Stiles &amp; Crawford tested their 'pupillometer', they found it did not work: the device consistently underestimated the sizes of wide pupils. Most experiments fail to work, so it is hardly remarkable to find such occasions in the working life of any experimental scientist, even one as gifted as W. S. Stiles. But when an experiment does not work, many of us refuse to become distracted from our goals by the fact of it; rather, we look for a way around the problem: photograph the pupil in ultraviolet light, for example. What is remarkable is that the Stiles &amp; Crawford did not take that route; rather, they took time out to ponder the problem posed by their results.* When all possible instrument errors and artefact sources had been excluded, they inferred that where the human eye is concerned, the photometric principle did not apply because rays of light entering the pupil considerably off axis are less effective visually than those entering near the axis. To confirm this, they set up an apparatus so that both the lower half field and the upper half field were seen in Maxwellian view so that the retinal illuminances produced by both beams of light were independent of the size of the natural pupil. The two beams X and Y (figure 1, lower right) were then arranged so that Y always transversed the centre of the pupil and the point of pupil transverse of X was changed in small (ca. 0.5 mm) steps across the pupil horizontally (and vertically). Both brightness matching and flicker photometric matches were used and gave comparable results. If I0 is the luminance of X needed to match Y through some point near the centre of the pupil and I the luminance of the match more generally, Stiles &amp; Crawford found when X entered near the edge of the pupil log (I/Io) ~ 0.8. This is the Stiles-Crawford effect, or the Stiles-Crawford intensity effect, i.e. the Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind (SCI). * In contrast to Schroeder (1926) who also measured pupil area by the photometric principle, in this case with the binocular Pulfrich (1922) photometer. He provided a 1 mm2 artificial pupil over the right eye and measured the size of the natural pupil of the left eye by attenuating the light before the latter until the oscillations of the pendulum of the instrument were parallel to the frontal plane. When Schroeder noted that the results were inconsistent with Reeves's (1920) photographic data, he refused to recognize the possibility that the difficulty this inconsistency pointed to belonged to his-not Reeves's-pupillometer. 828</page><page sequence="14">Walter Stanley Stiles If y = Io/I is known for each point of pupil entry specified in polar coordinates r, 0 (with origin at the pupil centre), then for any given entrance pupil the relative luminous efficiency E can be calculated by f SS (r, 0) r sin 0 dO dr E = [3] r sin 0 d dr ' where the integral extends over the entire entrance pupil. Stiles &amp; Crawford calculated the values of E for circular entrance pupils of different diameters. They then made the two beams X and Y coincident at the centre of the pupil and varied the size of the (circular) aperture stop for the X beam so that a range of (circular) entrance pupil areas a were provided comparable with the calculated range, and the value of E for each area directly measured by matching the two fields as before. The agreement between calculated and measured values of E was regarded as satisfactory, but in fact a small but systematic non-additivity was found for two of the three observers. The explanation for this effect was-as to some degree it remains to this day-an enigma. Stiles &amp; Crawford thought it unlikely that reflections and absorptions in the preretinal eye media could account for the effect and supposed the effect of light on the retina was a function of its angle of incidence. But the matter was certainly not settled in this first paper. The demonstration by Crawford (1937) that the effect disappeared in the course of dark adaptation and by Stiles (38) at threshold in the peripheral retina, that the presence or absence of the effect was wavelength dependent seemed to settle the matter in favour of the polar sensitivity idea. Moreover, such observations identify that idea with the optical properties of individual photoreceptors, as first suggested by Wright &amp; Nelson (1936). This is the prevailing modern view. The first experiments on the effect used white light. In such experiments no obvious change in colour is evident for lights traversing the different regions of the pupil. Nevertheless, Stiles saw that for a fundamental understanding of the effect it was important to describe its characteristics under elementary conditions; so he undertook a study of it in monochromatic light (33). The test light traversed the pupil and the adjustment of its radiance matched it to a reference standard, a second and independently controlled monochromatic beam always traversing the centre of the pupil. Several new facts emerged. 1. The results over almost all of the pupil radius r were quantifiable by the empirical relation log0 - log I = p(r-r0)2, [4] in which I is the radiance needed for the match through any point r in the pupil, the subscript 0 represents these values when the radiance for the match was a minimum, and p is a parameter quantifying the directional effect. 27-2 829</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs 2. Although r0 remained essentially unchanged as a function of wavelength, there is a remarkable and rather complex dependence of p on wavelength. It is a minimum (-0.0532) near the middle of the spectrum (A = 520 nm), largest (-0.0721) in the violet extreme (A = 440 nm), somewhat less (-0.0639) near A = 660 nm, the red extreme. 3. With test and reference wavelengths identical and traversing different parts of the pupil, no adjustment of the relative radiances of the two beams yielded a satisfactory match. This is nothing less than the discovery of a new effect: the colour of a monochromatic light of identical wavelength striking the identical point on the retina varies depending upon the region of the pupil through which it passes. Stiles was persuaded that the increase in absorption in the optical media as an hypothetical explanation of the intensity effect would only reduce the intensity of a monochromatic ray, and by increasing the intensity of the incident light to re-establish what was (before attenuation by the eye media) a physical match, the colour impression would remain the same! That the colour was not the same argued strongly that the Stiles-Crawford colour effect (later called by Hansen (1943) the Stiles-Crawford effect of the second kind to differentiate it from the intensity effect) was retinal in origin and 'that in all probability the intensity effect is also retinal'. The logic of this passage is as convincing today as when it was written more than 50 years ago; the arguments of those, such as Best (1939) and Weale (1961, 1981), who, despite it, hold out for the preretinal alternative, do not persuade. To measure the colour effect, Stiles adjusted both the wavelength and the radiance of the test for a match. The differences between the wavelengths of the test and reference at the match measured what became known as the Stiles-Crawford 'hue shift'. For a separation of say 3.5 mm between the two in the entrance pupil, a yellow, orange or red test appeared redder; in the blue-green it appeared bluer, and in the violet extreme, bluer again. For almost 25 years, Stiles's measurements of the hue shift provided the paradigm for all subsequent measurements of the colour effect, despite the fact (explicit in this first paper) that even with test wavelength and radiance as dependent variables, a completely satisfactory match was impossible at some reference wavelengths. All of the remarkable insights into photoreceptor physiology emerging from this paper were achieved through compromise with the ideal experiments. But compromise to what end? Certainly not promotion. Civil servants are not promoted for publications. Was there a sub- conscious striving for a more academic life? Entries in his personal Journal sometimes suggest this. More likely, he despaired of ever acquiring the apparatus necessary for the ideal experiment and was reluctant that all he had discovered be lost on that account. Human colour vision is trichromatic, and the quantification of the hue shift in this initial study (and those modelled after it) was constrained to 830</page><page sequence="16">Walter Stanley Stiles two degrees of freedom. So the measurement of the complete colour effect had to wait almost a full quarter of a century until in another landmark paper Enoch &amp; Stiles (85), using all the power of the great trichromator Stiles built at N.P.L. (74), achieved this goal completely on one eye and partially on another, by matching three primaries traversing the centre of the pupil to a monochromatic test, the point of pupil entry of which was the independent variable. This later study confirmed the supersaturation of the blue-green obliquely incident test noted in 1937 and discovered in addition a small desaturation of off-axis orange test which remains to this day a theoretical stumbling block in our understanding. But even in this first paper on the colour effect, the data was sufficient for Stiles to infer that the absorption spectra for each of the three species of visual pigments differed with angle of incidence of light on the retina in a way not equal to the other two, and to sketch a theoretical explanation which, with elaboration, remains the most widely accepted interpretation. In this view, the intensity effect is hypothesized smallest at the wavelength of maximum absorption and a variation in the magnitude of the intensity effect occurs with wavelength corresponding to the absorption curve of the photochemical substance. Because the absorption spectra of the three visual pigments of foveal vision differ, the wavelength dependency of the intensity effect for each species is different. Brindley (1953) developed a more realistic picture of how this occurred by supposing the pigment at the wavelength of maximum absorption for normal incidence to be in high concentration; as the angle of incidence on the retina increased, the length of the light path through the visual pigment in the receptor outer segment (hence its optical density) decreased. At every angle the density is highest at the wavelength of peak absorption and decreases according to the spectral distribution of the absorption coefficient of the visual pigment molecule. The resulting changes in the visual pigment absorption spectrum with retinal angle of incidence, according to these considerations, can be quantified by the Beer-Lambert law of absorption to a good approximation. Brindley introduced the term 'self-screening' to identify this mechanism. More recently, analogues of cones as wave guides are described and some qualitative attempts at theory along this line suggested. No satisfactory theory using the waveguide model has yet been applied to a quantitative fit of the Enoch-Stiles or other more recent data, but most investigators continue to believe that such theories represent promising possibilities. PERSONAL LIFE AND CAREER AT N.P.L. Stiles lived quietly and modestly. More than most, he concerned himself with ideas, as opposed to activity. He studied German classical and philosophical books and during the long vacations at school spent 831</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs holidays in Germany, often occupying student digs at Heidelberg. As a young man, he played tennis; music was also a passion and, though a perfectionist, he found relaxation and great recreation at the keyboard of the piano, at which, according to his niece, Mrs James (Hermione) Wilson, he was skilled. Brahms, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven sonatas and Schumann were favourites. Despite all this, he records in his Journal on 12 March 1933: It is a fact which worries me a little sometimes, that I have no hobbies (i.e.) an activity additional to the main activity of a man's life by which he earns his bread or at least justifies his existence, and one in which he acquires a certain degree of proficiency so that he is distinguished from his fellows of the same profession, as an authority of amateur rank .... I have dabbled a bit in gardening, music, sport, etc., but in none of these things have I sufficient talent, experience &amp; skill, or deep interest to serve as basis for a true hobby. He was completely absorbed in his work, in further study and in his reading. University College London records that one Walter Stanley Stiles, 15 Wimbledon Park Road, London S.W.18, whose last passed Public Examination was 'Maths Tripos Pt I Cambridge 1923', enrolled in the Faculty of Arts (Scandinavian Studies) for a course in Danish beginning in October of 1925 and ending in July 1926. On 15 August 1928, he married Pauline Frida Octavia Brendstrup, only daughter of Provincial Judge Henrik Brendstrup of Hillerod, Denmark. There were no children. Surviving him by a little more than a year, Mrs Stiles died on 6 April 1987. Their life together seemed tranquil. She understood his dedication to his work, if not the work itself, and always gave him help and encouragement, though it often required giving up many social pleasures she would otherwise have enjoyed. Except when war prevented it, they spent their summer holidays in Denmark. Stiles was very fond of Denmark and Danish people and was very popular with her friends and family. Though not a believer, he accompanied her to her (Lutheran) church whenever she went. They did not seem to talk much about such differences between them. Though his wife knew he often worried, she could not remember that he spoke to her of these worries. Instead, he seems to have gained some relief by confiding a good deal in his Journal. 28 May 1932: This afternoon P. operated on for removal of appendix. Operation appears to have been successful as far as can be seen at this early stage. There is always an element of risk in a major operation, and I have had to think of my attitude to death. As a man of science I believe that with death 832</page><page sequence="18">Walter Stanley Stiles the life of the individual ceases absolutely, i.e. that the consciousness of which I am the 'nucleus' is ended never to function again. If I were an adherent of an anthropomorphic 'resurrectional' religion, I could comfort P. and myself by saying that if anything did happen to either of us we should be together again in the hereafter, and I could pray to God to guard us &amp; I could thank God when the operation was successfully over. Curiously enough I felt most at a disadvantage compared with an orthodox Christian, when I heard that everything seemed to be going well with P. I wanted to ring out thanksgiving &amp; to 'demonstrate' my relief and thankfulness. I suppose the outlet the Christian has for these feelings is to praise God. They discovered doing crossword puzzles together as a recreation both enjoyed; it became a regular feature of their life together. Cricket matches and Wimbledon tennis on television were sources of mutual enjoyment in their later years. Stiles's Journal reveals a mind with many curiosities and catholic interests, not only in mathematics (pure, rather than applied) and physics (especially quantum mechanics), but science more generally. His reading was wide: treatises on logic, metaphysics, Shakespeare, essays, bio- graphies, art, travel, the poets, classical novels and new books exploring modern thought. One encounters Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson and Journal of a tour to the Hebrides, Shakepeare's King John, and Tammery's Science et philosophie among his current reading, without turning the page of his Journal to cite a representative example selected at random. Mrs Wilson adds that when he 'was unwell or tired he would read Jane Austen. He never got tired of Jane Austen'. Some time in his late thirties, he collected reprints from eleven published papers on physiological optics, photometry and applied optics (33,38,5,19,22,23,24,36,26,32,27), bound them together and sub- mitted the volume to the University of London. With this serving as a thesis, he was awarded the D.Sc. in June of 1939. Five years later, he was awarded the Carpenter Medal by the University for a thesis of exceptional distinction in experimental psychology, including the physiology of the central nervous system and special senses. Among the worries which found their way into his Journal was the usual human concern for progress of his career and a highly unusual concern as to whether the work he was doing justified his existence. His progress in the scientific civil service, which he joined in 1924 as Junior Scientific Officer, was painfully slow. He was promoted to Senior Scientific Officer on 25 May 1942 6/4/45. I was not promoted to P.S.O., but this did not disturb me until I learned that - , who was made S.S.O. at the same time as I was, has received his promotion. I should judge my record at least as good. 833</page><page sequence="19">Biographical Memoirs Both the head of the Division and people outside of the lab displayed a fairly complimentary attitude to him, but there seems to be no inclination to translate these opinions into the only form which is unambiguous. 23/4/46. Assimilated to P.S.O. in new salary scale, but position of entry in scale not yet indicated Finally, on 5 April 47 the first appointments to a new grade 'Senior Principal Scientific Officer' were announced and Stiles's name was on the list along with a dozen others (including Dr J. Bronowski, Dr A. M. Turing and Dr A. M. Uttley). This provided for the promotion of individual research men of exceptional quality who would not necessarily have administrative responsibility. There followed a spurt of vigorous research during the subsequent interval when at different periods he was joined by Mlle F. Flamant from l'Institut d'Optique, Paris, and Sefior J. Cabello, and then Dr M. Aguilar of El Instituto de Optica 'Daza de Valdes', Madrid. In the midst of this productivity, Stiles was asked if he would like to take on the headship of the Photometry Section when Walsh retired. He chose to do so. It was not a happy decision. Chronic episodes of ill health had plagued him over the years, even as a boy. But there was a sharp increase in their number and severity during the interval 1951-55 when he had three hospital stays, including two surgical procedures. It is now possible only to speculate, but there is reason to believe that, however real the physical basis for all this may have been, the added pressures of organizing and administrating his section summed to what must have been considerable psychological stress. In 1951, at its meeting in Stockholm, the C.I.E. had stated the need for modern measurements of normal colour-matching functions. With the help of strong outside support, Stiles persuaded the appropriate authorities at N.P.L. to build, for what can only have been a princely sum at that time and place, his trichromator to carry this study out. The immediate pressure was to present measurements with both 2? and 10? fields in a pilot study of 10 normal trichromats to the meeting of the C.I.E. at Zurich in June 1955 (76). Considering that the four years between these two meetings was the same as the time interval between the conception of the Canadian Trichromator (which had all its design from the original instrument) and the emergence of the first set of colour- matching functions on it, one has some feeling for the enormous burden Stiles may have felt, as this deadline approached. The load was too much and in late March 1954 he suffered what his doctor described as a nervous breakdown, which inactivated him for about three months (and made his attendance at the International Meeting on Problems in Contemporary Optics in Florence, Italy, 10-16 September 1954, impossible). That the obligation to the C.I.E. was nevertheless fulfilled was due in no small 834</page><page sequence="20">Walter Stanley Stiles measure to the industry of his junior associate, Dr J. M. Burch, and of Stiles's dedicated assistant, Miss Pamela Fowler. Perhaps a further source of anxiety during this time may have been a gradual eroding of his own self-esteem. Stiles understood modern physics well enough to realize that whatever may have been the case in the time of Thomas Young, Helmholtz, even Schr6dinger, first-class research on colour was not regarded by leading physicists as at the cutting edge of physics in the days immediately after Hiroshima. So when in October 1945 the Head of the Light Division, T. Smith, F.R.S., and the Director of N.P.L., Sir Charles Darwin, F.R.S.-both physicists-proposed him for Fellowship in the Royal Society, he was not sanguine of his chances of election. But appreciation of reality is one thing, and one's hopes and aspirations another, and as each succeeding March passed, the repeated cycle of fantasy of unexpected appreciation of the beauty of what he was doing in vision, sharply brought back to reality by the publication of the latest list, must gradually have eroded his self-esteem. In September 1954, the physiologist William Rushton proposed his name again. This time there was much greater understanding-among biologists at least-of what Stiles had achieved, and a growing appreciation of the importance of biophysics among leading physicists. On 2 October 1954 he was asked by the Physical Society to deliver its 18th Thomas Young oration, which he did on 25 February 1955. On this occasion he detailed the design of the Stiles N.P.L. Trichromator and presented the mean 2-10? colour matching pilot data on 10 subjects (74, 76). On 11 December 1955 he gave up administrative headship of the Photometry Section and reverted to Senior Principal Scientific Officer with full-time research responsibilities. After election to the Royal Society in 1957, concerns for justification of his existence, development of his career, worries and anxieties in general disappear from the pages of his Journal. In 1958 he was promoted to Deputy Chief Scientific Officer, and in July 1961 he retired from the Scientific Civil Service. In the New Year Honours List of 1956 he was made O.B.E. in recognition of his distinguished wartime research on glare and dazzle. In 1965 he was awarded the Edgar D. Tillyer Medal of the Optical Society of America for outstanding contributions to the field of human vision-the first (and, even today, only one of four) non-U.S.A. nationals to obtain this distinction. In 1967 he was awarded the Newton Medal of the Colour Group of Great Britain as well as the Gold Medal of the Illuminating Engineering Society of Great Britain for outstanding contributions, to the advancement of lighting. In 1968, he was awarded the Prix Niels Finsen, a Gold Medal of the Congres Internationale de Photobiologie for fundamental contributions to the sensory aspects of human vision. 835</page><page sequence="21">Biographical Memoirs TWO-COLOUR INCREMENT THRESHOLDS In June 1979 Stiles (104) used the occasion of an invited talk to the International Research Group on Colour Vision Deficiencies to relate how he came to the study of colour. He traced the development of the use of the equivalent background and the increment threshold to study glare and dazzle of motor-car headlights simulated by small glare sources in the laboratory, and then added (p. 111): But probably more significant than the glare results was the fact that, when the colour of the illuminant became an issue (at that time the illuminating engineer had tungsten filament white, sodium discharge tube yellow and mercury discharge tube green from which to choose), it was almost inevitable that in the laboratory we should take the simple but crucial step of illuminating the screen with one colour and measuring the increment threshold with a test spot of a different colour. Test sensitivity The first results of this work appeared in 1933 in a paper written with B. H. Crawford (23). Threshold increments of monochromatic lights were obtained on white and coloured backgrounds and surrounds. Plotted as a function of test wavelength, the resulting curves are complex. For foveal fixation there may be two or even three distinct peaks or humps in different parts of the spectrum. Such curves were analysed as the weighted linear sum of three fixed functions of wavelength, each of which was thought independent of the other two. Though more work would be needed, the results indicated that the peaks of these functions occur at 440, 540 and 600 nm (or possibly 620 nm). These three functions recalled the three fundamental variables of the trichromatic theory of vision, developed to account for 'the three-dimensional character of colour matching equations. This condition would be consistent with the existence of three kinds of receptors, each kind having a specific excitation curve, but the colour mixture data do not of themselves uniquely determine these excitation curves' Stiles &amp; Crawford mistakenly believed that their method had the advantage over colour matching in estimating such curves in that in their method 'there can be no question of changing the wave-lengths of maximum sensitivity of the three mechanisms by a mathematical transformation'. The heights of these individual component curves were considered to be governed by three adaptation variables, /l, Y2, 1/3, which depended upon the specific background under evaluation, but with white back- ground fields all three were believed to be determined by a single parameter: the equivalent background. On the other hand, with coloured fields each of the three adaptation variables were changed independently. 836</page><page sequence="22">Walter Stanley Stiles Even with the admittedly meagre data, the authors concluded that their results 'definitely ruled out' three receptor mechanisms with maximum sensitivities very close together in the middle of the visible spectrum, as required by Hecht's theory. They go on to note that, however questionable the arguments advanced by K6nig &amp; Dieterici (1892) for Elementarempfindungen and Grundempfindungen may be, the K6nig &amp; Dieterici blue and green curves peak at wavelengths very close to those revealed by their method. On the other hand, the new method reveals only a hump rather than a distinct peak for the red curve, and Stiles &amp; Crawford are reluctant to infer from it a maximum to compare with 0.59 im (Elementar- empfindungen) and 0.56 pim (Grundempfindungen), though elsewhere in the paper it is evident that it is clearly shifted to a longer wavelength than either of these. This difficulty is by no means a trivial one due to measurement imprecision. Modern repetitions (Sperling &amp; Jolliffe 1962; Sperling &amp; Harwerth 1971; King-Smith 1975; Pugh et al. 1985) reproduce their findings well, but they are now interpreted in a quite different light. The mistake in interpretation is substantial, and Stiles was quick to discover it; unfortunately not quick enough to obviate its publication on 2 October 1933 nor to avoid having it pointed out to him by T. Smith and J. Guild when the paper was read to the Royal Society on 11 October 1933. In his Journal, dated 10 December 1933, we read (p. 132): Since reading the R.S. paper on 'Lim. B. Incr. etc' in the discussion on which T. Smith &amp; Guild criticized the theoretical developments suggested, have gone very carefully into these latter. There is no doubt that for the reason noted on 23rd October the three functions X1 X2 X3 are not uniquely determined by four curves of 1/ U against A for four different sets of values 1q2/3 as stated on p. 110 [Journal]. It does not therefore follow and is probably untrue that, as stated in the paper, determination of 1/U will enable the three functions X1 X2 X3 to be uniquely determined so that there can be no question of changing the wavelength at which the curves exhibit maxima by mathematical transformation. To this extent I admit Smith's criticism. On the other hand I believe, in opposition to Smith, that 1/U curves can reduce the permissible choice of X1 X2 X3 to a degree that cannot be attained with colour matching data. The mistake was understandable, and the problem of documenting compellingly that what Stiles later called 'threshold versus wavelength' curves are valid receptor action spectra is a formidable one still with us. Some 32 years later, Professor George Wald used a quite similar method in a vigorous effort to isolate the excitation curves of the three kinds of foveal receptors and, in the two decades or so since this approach, has found extensive application in analysis of acquired colour-vision defects. (In that literature it is sometimes referred to as the 'Wald' method.) 837</page><page sequence="23">Biographical Memoirs This was by no means the only mistake in the interpretation of the results of this paper (103). A second was the assumption that the measured sensitivity was a linear combination of fixed component sensitivities, and a third was that the changes in adaptive state of the entire retina (i.e. both fovea and extrafovea) to white light could be specified by a single parameter. Despite these obvious shortcomings, this paper shows deep under- standing of the wide horizons of the vast English and foreign literature of colour science, including the most advanced thinking of the nineteenth-century German giants, Helmholtz and his students Konig and von Kries-truly surprising for one who has come to the field so recently and has been so productively occupied during that interval in the quite unrelated practical problems of illumination engineering. It is a pioneering effort and noteworthy step forward in several respects. A method is used to obtain cone sensitivity functions of wavelength for the first time which depends not at all upon colour matching, and results with the method indicate spectral characteristics conspicuously at variance with those required by Hecht's (1932) theory. More important than either of these is a remarkable theoretical advance. This was the insight that each one of the adaptation parameters is independent of the other two. It promised the possibility that with a suitable selection of test wavelengths, the spectral characteristics of each species of photoreceptor could be defined by the wavelength dependency of the radiance of a monochromatic background elevating the threshold of a given test by a fixed amount, even for a background wavelength far removed from the peak sensitivity. Before undertaking such a study, Stiles replaced the assumption of linear combination of component sensitivities with the assumption that the measured sensitivity was set by the most sensitive component. This turned out to be a substantial improvement, but even here, at the end of his days as an experimenter, small discrepancies between theoretical expectation and measurements pointed to a substantial difficulty with the model. Field sensitivity By approaching practical problems of illumination engineering at their roots, Stiles's early work at N.P.L. led him to the equivalence principle and to the discovery of the Stiles-Crawford effects. About 1937, both of these digressions from the practical aims of the Photometry Section brought him by different routes to face the most fundamental issue of colour vision theory of those days: the nature of the action spectra of the three species of cone photoreceptors upon which, according to tri- chromatic theory, foveal vision depends. The work already completed (23) pointed to a highly innovative and yet straightforward way this could 838</page><page sequence="24">Walter Stanley Stiles be approached experimentally. Still, he hesitated. In his Journal on 22 March 1932 he wrote: Again attacked by doubts about my work on vision. The questions that worry me are, (1) Am I doing the work I am paid for doing or am I wandering off onto questions which may be of interest in the science of vision but for which I have no mandate ? (2) Even assuming the equivalence principle etc. can be included in the problems set for me to tackle, have I tackled them in the right way? Do the results obtained so far justify more time being spent on this work? Are the conditions set too artificial? In fact what kind of a job am I making of the work regarded as a piece of research ? (3) I have spent seven years at the NPL for most of which time I have been concerned with glare, visibility, etc. Does this work present a field in which my efforts are likely to meet with some measure of success or is it a more or less barren region? With or without such doubts, it was his nature that if he were to work on practical problems of illumination he could not stay away from fundamental questions of vision, even without the mandate to deal with them. His next paper (38), however, consolidated this basic research by bringing the path which the increment threshold studies followed, together with the road the directional sensitivity work took, in pursuit of the lead pointed to in the initial two-colour increment threshold paper (23). The divergence of these two paths at the beginning of this paper (38) is a formidable obstacle for any writer, and any reader. The amount of ground to be covered is enormous; readers quickly and repeatedly lose the forest in the trees. In the end, convergence is achieved, but in terms of the certainty and of the understanding we learn to expect from him, it is incomplete-as, indeed, despite a prodigious amount of research by Stiles and by many others in the last fifty years, it remains to this day. With all these faults, this paper is one of the great masterpieces of vision research in this century. It is Stiles's magnum opus, providing the roots for experiments which were to occupy him the rest of his long and productive life, and occupying many others as well. The paper begins with an introduction to the directional sensitivity of the retina. It emphasizes the novelty of the paper in using thresholds in its measure compared with nearly all previous studies, which used matching. The absolute and differential thresholds are studied, the latter plotted as a function of background radiance with the wavelengths of both the monochromatic test and background field varied (independently) throughout the visible spectrum, and for normally, as well as obliquely, incident tests. For the peripheral retina the results are analysable according to the duplicity theory: the curve relating the background radiance to the test radiance at threshold (hereafter the increment threshold curve) is clearly divided into two parts. The lower part is attributed to rods, the upper to cones. For rods the equivalence principle 839</page><page sequence="25">Biographical Memoirs holds exactly: light of each and every wavelength is precisely equivalent (within +0.1 logo1 unit) to lights of any other wavelength whether in its stimulation effects or in its adaptation effects. The parafoveal absolute threshold is independent of test angle of incidence on the retina for monochromatic test lights throughout most of the visible spectrum. But the directional sensitivity of the parafoveal absolute threshold at the long-wave test spectral extreme is well described by equation [4] with the directional sensitivity parameter p not obviously different from that found by using absolute thresholds for the fovea at this wavelength. But the absolute threshold for the fovea is directionally sensitive at all wavelengths. Evidently, cones are directionally sensitive at all wavelengths. Either rods are directionally insensitive at all wavelengths and in the dark parafoveal cones are more sensitive to a long-wave test than parafoveal rods, or parafoveal rods are directionally insensitive to most parts of the spectrum but about equal in directional sensitivity to cones for long-wave lights. A choice between these alternatives is not achieved in this paper. (Nine years later with Mlle F. Flamant he exploits the full power of the equivalence principle for rods to resolve this issue in favour of the former alternative by varying the wavelength and the angle of incidence of the background while holding the angle of incidence as well as the wavelength of the test fixed, the latter at a value (say 500 nm) selected to be stimulating rods and rods alone (55).) The parafoveal increment threshold curve for a 500 nm test and a long- wave (690 nm) background does not show the second (i.e. the cone) branch. Instead, threshold (U(500)) radiance is directly proportional to background radiance (W(690)) following Weber's law (U(500)/W(690) = a constant) over a range of 104 before the energy in the background field is exhausted. Reducing the background wavelength only slightly increases rod sensitivity to the background sufficiently that a change occurs at the highest radiances. The increment threshold increases substantially over the expectation of Weber's law. The increase 'is believed to be genuine but its explanation depends on a new factor to be dealt with later' (p. 86). The new factor is rod saturation. It is dealt with in a paper on the subject with Mariano Aguilar some 15 years later (73). (In it, Aguilar &amp; Stiles use everything Stiles has learned about how rods and cones differ to make the test maximally excitable for rods (and minimally sensitive for cones) and vice versa for backgrounds to follow out the rod increment threshold curve as far as possible. Rod threshold rises to infinity at backgrounds, bleaching only negligible rhodopsin (about 0.12 % of the molecules per second). The scotopic mechanism is incapable of exploiting to its full extent the signal: noise ratio present at the level at which photons are absorbed. Whether this is a property of the individual rods or of the retinal neural network is a question unresolved in 1954 and has been a subject of some psychophysical and extensive electrophysiological study since. Modern evidence favours the former 840</page><page sequence="26">Walter Stanley Stiles interpretation. This is still another classical Stiles paper, required reading for every student of rod function and still extensively cited.) Turning from the lower to the upper branch of the parafoveal increment threshold curve, it is immediately evident that the same analysis, applied so successfully to the lower branch, breaks down completely when applied to cones. This is because 'the duplicity theory must be supplemented with the idea of three distinctive types of cones, an idea which is, of course, inherent in many forms of the trichromatic theory' (p. 89). With this sentence the thrust of the paper shifts from directional to spectral properties; the data under consideration shift from the parafovea to the fovea. The directional sensitivity of the fovea is still of interest, but the major emphasis of the remainder of this paper is on the analysis of the foveal data, assuming that the equivalence principle was appropriate for each one of the three species of foveal cones. Grounds for this assumption were found in the foveal two-colour increment threshold curve for a blue test on a yellow background, which was divisible into two distinct branches, though in this case the target size and position obviated the possibility that one of these was due to rods. Indeed, the field sensitivity of the upper curve revealed the action spectrum to be that expected from 'blue' cones whereas that for the lower suggested 'green'. However, the red and green cone components of even the few two- colour combinations (with longer-wave tests) in which the increment threshold separates into branches are not nearly as distinct, and in 1939 the adaptation and excitation action spectra of the red cones are identified by only a 'first attempt'. Nevertheless, from the results it is evident that the magnitude of the constant defined by Weber's law (called the 'Fechner fraction') for blue cone excitation is about 4.6-4.8 times larger than that for green or red cone excitation. This is only the first of many ways in this and in subsequent papers-first Stiles (57), then many others (Brindley, Rushton, J. J. Du Croz, D. G. Green, J. Krauskopf, E. N. Pugh, Jr, J. D. Mollon, P. G. Polden, K. Kitahara and myself, among others)-documented substantial differences between the blue cones and the red and green cones as operationally defined by Stiles. These include visual acuity, critical flicker frequency, spatial and temporal modulation transfer functions, change in sensitivity in the dark following adaptation to specific monochromatic backgrounds, and the wavelength dependency of the directional sensitivity parameter p in an equation analogous to equation [4] but applicable to blue cones alone. In this paper Stiles gives similar estimates for each of the three cone species, which in principle can provide an independent approach to the theory of Stiles-Crawford colour effect not yet profitably exploited. Good evidence is given that the equivalence principle holds for blue cones: for green cones the action spectrum for excitation agrees with that for adaptation, but in the former, test wavelengths longer than 510 nm rely only on 'first attempt' estimates. 841</page><page sequence="27">Biographical Memoirs For red cones the 'first attempt' estimates are all that is available; the agreement is satisfactory. The discussion of this paper is remarkably succint. It is confined to the description of a single diagram summarizing how the two-colour threshold is fixed for any test or any background wavelength and background radiance, based on the three action spectra of foveal cones and a standard increment threshold 'template' curve. In the context of the time it appeared, this paper's most revolutionary single discovery is the nature of these action spectra. They are of the 'K6nig type' with the Amax of the blue and green cone curves more or less where Stiles &amp; Crawford (24) had suggested them, but with the red cone curve around 576 nm, i.e. almost exactly halfway between the red Grundempfindung and the red Elementarempfindung curves of K6nig. Although K6nig &amp; Dieterici (1892) had introduced somewhat similar curves, and numerous authorities (Abney, Schr6dinger, Troland and many others) had used them or not very different ones in developing theory or summarizing constructs, there was little agreement about it. The assumptions needed to infer the K6nig curves from his results were extensive, and the experiments themselves and nearly all other un- equivocal relevant experimental evidence then available were based on matching. In Young-Helmholtz theories the results of colour matching must be quantifiable as a linear transformation of the three cone action spectra of the theory, but the number of equally acceptable such transformations of a given set of colour-matching functions are infinite and there was then no information available allowing the correct choice from among this infinite set. Stiles's measurements yielded these spectra directly (independent of matching), the assumptions upon which their derivation rested were few and reasonable, and the results were consistent with the general lines suggested from matching. But when they were published, and for a good while thereafter, they attracted almost no attention. It is useful to digress in search of reasons. The first is obvious: the year of this paper's publication was the year that World War II began. But the paper appeared on 10 March; war did not begin until September. There was no war in America in 1939 and would not be for almost three years. Yet the reception in North America was even frostier than in Great Britain and Europe; it would remain so for a much longer time. The real difficulty was the identity of the physical factor, or factors, upon which the photoreceptor action spectra depended. By 1939 physiologists generally believed that for human rod vision this was a photochemical event, the absorption of visible light by a photosensitive substance, rhodopsin, in the outer segments of rods. This too had been widely doubted by the mainstream of the subject since the great pioneer of rhodopsin chemistry Friedrick Wilhelm Kiihne (1837-1900), Helm- holtz's successor in the chair of Physiology at Heidelberg, wrote a 842</page><page sequence="28">Walter Stanley Stiles paper on the subject, 'Das Sehen ohne Sehpurpur', in which he showed many examples of vision (even colour vision) with eyes whose retinas contained no rhodopsin or in which all the measurable rhodopsin had been bleached. The persuasive case was made by Selig Hecht (1892-1947), who remeasured the rod spectral visibility curve and matched it to the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin with Robert E. Williams in the George Holt Physics Laboratory of the University of Liverpool. To remove all doubt that the first stage of the visual process was a photochemical event, Hecht &amp; Williams (1922) had to explain how, 46 years after the discovery of rhodopsin, despite a proliferation of experiments on visual pigment chemistry by Ktihne and by many others, Hecht included, the only visual pigment ever discovered in a retina was rhodopsin. To deal with this fact, they compared their measurements of the human rod visibility curve (Amax = 510 nm) with available data on the human cone visibility curve (Amax = 558 nm) and showed that the two could be made to coincide simply by shifting the former curve horizontally 48 nm to the red along the wavelength axis. The assumption of a single photosensitive substance providing the physical basis of photoreception responsible for both the rod and the cone visibility curves is seen as a 'necessary conclusion' from this comparison. To account for the 48 nm shift required to make it so, they introduce the ad hoc (Kundt's) rule 'well known in spectroscopy .... If one colourless solvent has a decidedly greater refracting or dispersing capacity than a second, then the absorption bands of a substance dissolved in the first will be nearer the red end of the spectrum than when dissolved in the second.' To identify the single photosensitive substance, Hecht &amp; Williams compared their rod visibility data with their best estimate from the literature of the (normalized) absorption spectrum of rhodopsin and found the necessary coincidence provided that the peak of the absorption curve is shifted some 7 or 8 nm toward the red. (It remains to be shown elsewhere the evidence convincing me that their suggesting the possibility that a single photosensitive substance readily extractable from all vertebrate retinas was both the photosensitive substance of rods where, according to Kundt's rule, its peak was 7 or 8 nm red-shifted and the photosensitive substance of cones, where its peak must be red-shifted 55 nm, was the crucial event in convincing the mainstream of physiology that the initial link in vision between man and nature, i.e. between the biological and the physical, was a photochemical event.) Prominent among the host of questions left unanswered by the Hecht &amp; Williams synthesis was any explanation of the trichromatic character of photopic vision. It accounted well enough for the luminosity of objects. What about their colour? There is no evidence that more than a handful of this paper's readers troubled themselves about the problem. Like glare research when Stiles first took it up, colour was widely known among 843</page><page sequence="29">Biographical Memoirs vision researchers to be a 'messy' subject. Many of the most prominent among them were proud to admit they did not understand it, and even well after the end of World War II, distinguished scientists were known to go out of their way to advise new research students to stay away from colour vision. There were, of course, the curves of K6nig, which was one way the photoreceptor basis might be managed. But the Young- Helmholtz solution was by no means the only alternative available, and if there were ways of deciding among the plausible alternatives, no one had suggested any, much less implemented one. Among the few who recognized this difficulty was Hecht himself; he would abandon neither the scheme nor the basic idea of the Young- Helmholtz theory that trichromacy required the absorption of light in three different kinds of cones, each with a different action spectrum. His resolution (Hecht 1932) was 'three receptor mechanisms with maximum sensitivities very close together in the middle of the spectrum', which Stiles &amp; Crawford (24) erroneously claimed their results 'definitely ruled out'. Stiles learnt the lesson of T. Smith's criticism well. He does not repeat this claim in 1939, though his evidence is now much stronger. In 1939 no reference to Hecht's theory or of any of the other colour vision literature proposing various 'fundamental primaries', as they were often called then, is given. Readers are left to reason such matters out for themselves. This is neither the first nor the last example in Stiles's writing in which full appreciation of what is written demands more from readers than many devoted to it. If he had erred more in the direction that T. Smith had chastised him, the subject might have moved forward more quickly. Though the 1939 cone mechanism spectra are given, without critical comment, by Wright (1946), colour vision authority in Britain lagely ignored this paper until W. A. H. Rushton in the mid-1950s began forcefully to call it to the attention of all who would listen. In the U.S.A., Hecht's influence was strongly felt and there is hardly a suggestion that anyone had read this paper before the early 1960s. (In 1949 I took a seminar largely devoted to the various possible ways of determining the fundamental curves of human colour vision; this one did not come up.) There is correspondence in Stiles's notebook from a distinguished American suggesting the view implicit (but never explicit) in Hecht &amp; Williams that the discrimination of hue must depend on a special photoreceptor mechanism different from that required for the discrimination of brightness, long after Hecht himself abandoned it. In 1956, describing the dark adaptation experiments of Auerbach &amp; Wald (1954, 1955), Wald admitted that it was only with these experiments that he understood for the first time 'what Stiles was up to'. In developing their quantitative model of an opponent-colours theory, Hurvich &amp; Jameson's (1955) proposed systems of photosensitive materials-whether the four-pigment system actually used, or the three-pigment alternative, 844</page><page sequence="30">Walter Stanley Stiles which they point out could have served equally well-followed the pattern proposed by Hecht's (1932) theory, i.e. the absorption spectra of all pigments peaking very close together in the middle of the spectrum. (Later they conceded that pigments with three widely separated spectral peaks would serve their model equally well as the ones used in their theoretical calculations (Jameson &amp; Hurvich 1968).) The great achievement of this paper is that at a time when the influence of Hecht's views on luminosity and colour was at its zenith, Stiles provided psychophysical evidence, independent of colour matching, that, contrary to these views, the three-cone mechanisms of foveal vision have their respective peaks widely separated from each other in the spectrum. Not everyone was receptive to this evidence, as we have seen, but there were a handful who were, M. H. Pirenne and W. A. H. Rushton (when he took up vision in 1949) most important among them. Rushton had the platform presence and personality to make evident to those who would listen that it was important to study Stiles's work, in a way that Stiles would not, indeed could not, do. But even before that, Rushton must have found in this work the key which made possible his own most important contribution to vision. For if it were true, as Hecht maintained, that all cone pigments peak together in the middle of the spectrum, then their individual difference spectra, which Rushton hoped to measure, would be difficult, if not impossible, to separate by his approach. But if Stiles was right, densitometry had promise of objective demonstration of different cones pigments in the normal fovea at a time when 'no one can say with complete certainty that he has ever had a cone pigment in a test tube' (Darnall 1960). Moreover, if Stiles was right, it should be possible to make the case strong by comparing and contrasting measurements on the foveas of trichromats with those on dichromats, an unlikely possibility with Hecht's scheme. So Rushton studied this paper and decided on the basis of evidence he found in it that it was worth the effort to build an instrument to measure visual pigments objectively and non-invasively in living human eyes. The results were a strong confirmation of Stiles: they proved directly that the cone pigments existed and in sufficient concentration that their absorption spectra might well be measurable at the cellular level in vitro as viewed under the microscope. This in its turn inspired the preliminary microspectrophotometric measurements of Marks et al. (1964) and of Brown &amp; Wald (1964). This was followed by the clear results on a human retina by Bowmaker &amp; Dartnall (1980), which show startling quantitative agreement between the action spectra of Stiles's cone mechanism obtained psychophysically, and the absorption spectra of visual pigments in the outer segments of single human cones. It detracts not an iota from Stiles's achievement to add that this is hardly the final word. The comparison requires a correction for spectral losses in the lens which remains to some extent uncertain, and a single 845</page><page sequence="31">Biographical Memoirs retina provides no hint of the variability we have learned to expect in human vision. The precision of single-cell absorption spectra can in no way compare with the accuracy of human psychophysics. In this last respect, at least the action spectrum of the photocurrent in the monkey (Macacafascicularis) is a considerable improvement. With this technique Baylor et al. (1987) have found good agreement between red cones and 15 and the green cones and n4. (See the section on Mechanisms of colour vision, below, for the developments leading to the pi mechanism terminology and to its definitions.) On the other hand, their spectrum of blue cones differs remarkably from n3. Much work remains to be done. But there can be no doubt of the lasting importance of Stiles's 1939 two- colour increment threshold paper (38) in guiding modern research on photoreceptor function. LINE ELEMENT Throughout the war Stiles worked on the theoretical implications of this monumental paper (38) in the time he could spare from war research and perhaps in situations, e.g. air raids, when security considerations obviated it. Even before the termination of the Pacific war, he submitted the paper which, in a tradition pioneered by Helmholtz (1891) and Schr6dinger (1920), relied upon his skill as a mathematical physicist (47). Helmholtz (1891, 1892) first devised a theory of how perceived colour differences were determined by the properties of three fundamental colour-response systems in terms of a line element: '... line elements aim to specify pairs of colour stimuli that present a particular constant perceived difference, for example, a just-perceptible difference, by the positions and distance apart in tristimulus space of the points representing these stimuli' (107, p. 654). Helmholtz's theory of colour vision was that the process was governed by three independent response mechanisms, each with its own characteristic wavelength dependence, r(A), g(A), b(A), and each a different linear transformation of the colour-matching functions. The response of the red mechanism to colour stimuli of spectral power distribution (P(A) dA) becomes R = fPar(A) dA; G and B are similarly found. For each mechanism acting alone, sensitivity to a just noticeable difference of responses (dR = R' -R) from two quite similar colour patches of slightly different spectral power distributions were assumed to follow Weber's law (dR/R = constant). In the intermediate luminance range Helmholtz assumed that the constants for all three of these responses are equal. He also assumed that when all three mechanisms were in operation together the smallest perceptible difference 846</page><page sequence="32">Walter Stanley Stiles ds is obtained by combining the Weber fraction of each mechanism acting alone in the same way as independent errors are compounded, i.e. (ds)2 = (dR/R)2 + (dG/G)2 + (dB/B)2. [5] Helmholtz tested this line element by searching for a set of response functions or fundamentals which, when applied to it, would yield the hue discrimination data available to him at the time. But the response functions required did not yield a satisfactory description of the foveal step-by-step visibility curve (a curve showing the energies of mono- chromatic lights of constant brightness) when calculated by equation [5]. These response functions are grossly different from Konig &amp; Dieterici's values, with which, on the basis of his own increment threshold paper (38), Stiles believed they ought to agree better. Stiles's modification of Helmholtz's line element, including the entire luminance range, was (ds)2 = [C(R) dR/p]2 + [C(G) dG/y]2 + [C(B) dB/l]2, [6] in which ,(R) is the empirical increment threshold curve of the red mechanism acting alone as found in the 1939 work, Y(G), ,(B) are similarly defined, and p, y and / are constants proportional to the limiting Weber (or, as Stiles called them, Fechner) fractions of the three mechanisms, also as determined by that work. Because at a sufficiently high intensity equation [6] reduces to (ds)2 = (dR/pR)2 + (dG/yG)2 + (dB/fB)2, [7] it might be supposed the Stiles modification of the Helmholtz line element (equation [5]) was very slight indeed. But that supposition masks a substantial difference. The f(A), g(A), b(A) of Stiles's line element, unlike the Helmholtz equivalent, did not emerge from the best fit of the line element to hue discrimination data, but are quantities specified at the outset by the three foveal spectral distributions of wavelength emerging from the field and test sensitivity experiments in Stiles's 1939 paper (38). Indeed, a fair statement of the purpose of his line element paper (47) is to establish the validity of these distributions as the three fundamental response mechanisms of human colour vision. In this connection, one may recall Hecht's (1932, p. 160) reply to a comment of W. D. Wright with regard to the former's colour vision theory in the Joint Discussion on Vision held on 3 June 1932 at the Imperial College by the Physical and the Optical Societies: Author's reply: ... While I appreciate Mr. Wright's comments, I am tempted to ask him one question. He says on closer examination the cone primaries 'seem to have little solid foundation or advantage over other such curves'. I should like to know what 'other sets of curves'. He cannot mean the infinite variety of mixture curves which, because they are arithmetical transformations of mixture data, are capable of yielding those data back 847</page><page sequence="33">Biographical Memoirs again. He must therefore refer to curves which like those given here, describe quantitatively at least five different aspects of colour vision. No such 'other sets of curves' exist to my knowledge. In a word, it is, I believe, an unstated aim of the line element paper (47) to substantiate 'another set of curves' meeting Hecht's requirements. Stiles first showed that these mechanisms are well described by a specific linear transformation of the colour-matching functions of the 1931 C.I.E. Standard Observer. Next he applied the line element to the gamut of colour discrimination data available (enlarged substantially since the days of Helmholtz and Schr6dinger). The approach is logical and straightforward, but the mathematics is tedious and complicated, if not esoteric. To predict the step-by-step luminosity curve he represented the two patches as nearly equated in the chromaticity diagram and allowed the radiance of one of the patches to be adjusted while its chromaticity remained fixed. Differentiation of equation [6] and setting the result equal to zero yielded the minimum (ds)2. This equation (with higher-order terms neglected) back in tristimulus space was a reasonably exact description of the equal-brightness condition applicable to two coloured patches of nearly the same chromaticity. For the special case of monochromatic patches of wavelengths A and A + 6A and radiance W. and WA + 6WA. This result is 6 WA -C2dR, C2dGA C dBf -6A + A+_ A [8] WA RA dA GA dA BA dA [8] R - 2 - G -2 B -2 in which C,2 = (R) 2 (R) + -(G) + ,(B) _P _f _y and C2, C are similarly defined. Successive applications of equation [8] yielded the radiances of a series of monochromatic patches of light whose wavelengths change in small steps from, say, the blue to the red end of the spectrum (or vice versa) and each of which matches its neighbours in brightness. The normalized reciprocal of the spectral distribution of WA calculated in this way is the step-by-step luminosity curve ( VA) obtained from equation [8] by a sequence of steps duplicating mathematically those actually followed in the experiment. Because of the nature of ~(R), etc., equation [8] can only be generally solved by a method of successive approximations. But there are two asymptotic solutions. In the first it may be noted that at sufficiently high radiance levels C2, C2, C2 approach (l/p)2, (1/7)2, (1/,)2 respectively, which yields: log VA = const.-log WA = const. + (l/p)2 log RA + (1/y)2 log GA + (1l/)2 log B. [8a] 848</page><page sequence="34">Walter Stanley Stiles The other is the limiting form of equation [8] when the radiance is very low, derived by assuming that, regardless of wavelength, coloured patches at absolute threshold have the same brightness: V2 = const. [(R/p)2 + (G/y)2 + (B/f)2]. [8 b] During the war there could have been neither the time nor the facilities to measure the step-by-step visibility curve on the eye most relevant to validate the rA, gA, bA of the 1939 paper and test the theory. Given the familiar large individual differences in transmissivity of the ocular media (particularly in the short-wave spectral extreme) which certainly caused individual differences in measurement of step-by-step visibility data available to him in the literature for this comparison, the agreement found between theory and data must be regarded as 'good'. More modestly, he referred to it as 'substantial' (p. 53). But that is not the end of the matter. Stiles noted that all lights (not necessarily monochromatic ones) having the same VA according to equation [8] would belong to the set of equal small-step brightness. It is readily shown that equally bright lights, as defined by equation [8a], will not generally be additive. He calculated a mixture of 470 nm monochromatic light and 660 nm lights, each with the same small-step brightness as a fixed comparison light, and showed that the small-step brightness of the mixture is not twice the small-step brightness of the comparison, but 2.63 times: a difference of about 27 o. He calculated the small-step brightness of a white light of 2060 K, compared it with the sum of the small-step brightnesses of its component wavelengths, and showed the equation to be in error by 8 %. Unfortunately, direct experimental tests of these predictions of additivity failure are difficult to imagine. On the other hand, the additivity of brightness equations in flicker photometry are easy to measure and were known to hold within a precision of 1 or 2 %. But equal brightness as defined by heterochromatic flicker photometry 'cannot be derived from the line-element without additional assumptions and will not be discussed' (p. 54). Left unsaid in this terse sentence is the enormous amount of time and effort and notebook pages devoted to the calculation of the additivity of brightness equation in flicker photometry. On 12 July 1944 he noted the following in his Journal ... Questions as to my paper on the line-element. In view of the break-down of my theory of flicker photometry, should I hold back paper or rewrite in a much simpler form... Although the line element assumes that the three cone mechanisms have different limiting Weber fractions at high radiance levels, it predicts a common limiting fraction of a pair of barely discriminable light patches of the same colour. Readers are referred to the classic measurements of K6nig &amp; Brodhun (1889) for the established facts in agreement with these predictions. 849</page><page sequence="35">Biographical Memoirs By a line of reasoning analogous to that with which equation [8] was derived for small-step brightness, the paper gives the derivation of the equation that predicts just noticeable differences in wavelength of 6A of monochromatic lights of equal small-step brightness. It is successful in these predictions in fitting the wavelength discrimination data of Wright &amp; Pitt (1934) reasonably well. The final task confronting the modified line element is its ability to predict more generally the smallest discriminable difference in colours of equal small-step brightness at 25 different positions distributed through- out the chromaticity diagram. The distributions of such thresholds about any given point in the C.I.E. 1931 chromaticity diagram are defined to be ellipses by their modified line element equation. Experi- mental data on this matter had been obtained by D. L. MacAdam (1942) measuring the standard deviation of the settings of a physical match approached from each of 15 or so directions in the colour plane ingeniously holding luminance fixed at 15 mL at the same 25 loci in the diagram. MacAdam found that a plot of the distribution of standard deviations around each point in the C.I.E. diagram was also well fitted by ellipses. The question was: How did the orientation, lengths of the minor and major axes of each one of the ellipses calculated from the line element agree with the 25 empirical MacAdam ellipses? Stiles also used the same calculation with interpolations to infer the logarithm of the sizes of equal colour steps as a function of the distance from one end of four different lines in the C.I.E. diagram and compared them with measurements of Wright (1941) on four subjects along the same lines, as well as those of MacAdam's observer similarly interpolated from the MacAdam ellipses. After allowing for the absolute magnitude difference between standard deviation and smallest colour difference threshold, Stiles found the empirical (MacAdam) and calculated ellipses showed 'some similarity'. The orientation of the two sets of ellipses as well as the logarithms of their respective areas were highly correlated, but the logarithm of the ratios of the two semi-axes in the respective studies were not. This is hardly surprising because the logarithms of the ratios of these two axes for the single ellipse from the second MacAdam observer (himself), from whom an ellipse can be calculated, fall in the middle of the (uncorrelated) scatter plot of experimental against calculated logarithmic ratios rather than anywhere close to a line showing the (hypothetical) perfect correlation. Similarly, the predictions of the colour threshold as a function of distance along the line between two points on the C.I.E. diagram do not agree remarkably well to empirical measurements on any one subject of Wright and of MacAdam, even allowing that individual differences in criteria between equal small colour steps and colour threshold would allow for a vertical displacement of the theoretical curve in the logarithmic ordinate scale. But it is noted that 'the experimental curves of different subjects, compared in the same way, show differences which are hardly less marked' (p. 62). 850</page><page sequence="36">Walter Stanley Stiles In balance, one concludes after reading all but the penultimate sentence of this paper that Stiles has made his case very well indeed that: (i) the field sensitivity method of his 1939 paper (38) is a valid way of operationally defining throughout the spectrum the action spectra of three species of cones upon which the trichromacy of normal foveal vision depends in the first instance, and (ii) that the modified line element of this paper is the most quantitatively explicit theory of colour ever formulated and the most successful. One is left with the impression that documenting that either of these inferences is wrong would require field sensitivity spectra, upon which the modified line element may be based and applied to experimental spectral colour-matching functions, step-by-step lum- inosity, Weber fractions for monochromatic lights of different wave- lengths, hue discrimination data, and general colour difference thresholds (i.e. MacAdam ellipses), all measured on the very same eye. Stiles, in fact, draws neither of these inferences. Rather, he infers that, although the modified line element is along the right lines in the aspects of colour vision it predicts quantitatively, the reader is referred to the appendix to substantiate the view that it is 'in difficulties' applied to measurements of the general colour threshold. The difficulties are the following. Considering the C.I.E. chromaticity coordinates for colours of constant brightness as curvilinear coordinates on a surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance apart of whose neigh- bouring points being defined by the line element ds, Stiles derives the equation for the Gaussian curvature of the surface from his modified line element equation. The Gaussian curvature of this uniform chromaticity surface calculated from the line element varied with chromaticity and was found to be negative throughout the domain of real colours. Ludwik Silberstein (1943), a student of Helmholtz and mathematical colleague and sometime collaborator of D. L. MacAdam in the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories in Rochester, New York, used an empirical expression for ds derived from MacAdam's data and found that the Gaussian curvature of this empirical surface was positive in some areas of the chromaticity diagram, negative in others. Despite Stiles's reservations about the importance of the modified line element on this account, it remains to this day the most advanced development of component (i.e. Young-Helmholtz) colour theory yet achieved. In his Journal, dated 24 December 1944, is: ... Secret weapon attacks extended to the North of England. Decide not to hold back paper on line element. There is a good deal more I have to say about it but this had best be kept for a second paper by which time I hope to have more experimental evidence... In contrast to the two-colour increment threshold paper (38), the appearance of the line element evoked a prompt and sharply critical response almost immediately from none other than Silberstein (1947), which made two points. The first was that any representation in space of 851</page><page sequence="37">Biographical Memoirs an element of length by equations such as equations [5] or [6] can be made Euclidean by a very simple transformation, but Silberstein's own analysis of MacAdam's ellipses showed that this was not possible with the available empirical data. The second was to call the reader's attention to the fact that Stiles's 'fundamental concept of pairs of "just dis- tinguishable" color patches and the associated unit steps (not per- ceptible), taken over from von Helmholtz and K6nig, is rather vague. At any rate, MacAdam's and our own concept of "standard deviations" in color matchings, paired with the rather plausible distribution function of probabilities of the matches, seems to offer a more sound, and less arbitrary, foundation for the metrics of the color domain' (p. 295). Finally, Silberstein found it 'regrettable that Stiles... did not comment on our alternative criterion of colour discrimination...' Although Stiles had himself anticipated the thrust of Silberstein's first point in his appendix to reference (47), the stronger inference the latter drew from the result seems to have carried the day with contemporaries such as Le Grand (1948), if not Judd (1949). The net immediate impact of the theoretical paper (47)-like that of its experimental partner (37)-is succinctly summarized by the phrase: 'generally ignored'. There is a certain amount of anti-intellectualism in this. Even the least demanding of Stiles's papers is not easy to absorb in quick reading; concentration and hard thinking are needed for them all. But both the experimental paper (38) and especially its theoretical counterpart (47) are unusually difficult. The former is long and circuitously organized. The latter is written in the style of theoretical physics to which the mainstream of colour science (trained in psychology, illumination engineering, biology, physiology or in medicine) was unaccustomed. No doubt many contemporaries were relieved to take from Silberstein the implicit suggestion that it is unnecessary to exert the time and effort required to understand Stiles's line element, and few of them seem to have done so. Stiles never responded directly to Silberstein's (1947) criticism. But in his subsequent writing on the topic (93,97) he emphasized a clear distinction between empirical line elements, such as the Silberstein and MacAdam models which were devoted to 'the facts of colour dis- crimination unalloyed by theoretical pre-occupations and interpretations in terms of visual mechanisms' and inductive line elements 'derived from the knowledge we have of the visual processes that make colour discrimination possible'. The latter models should 'not only reproduce tolerably well existing blocks of colour discrimination data but... should display the connection of discrimination with basic attributes of visual mechanisms. Ideally... [they] should provide a framework capable of modifications and extensions which may help in understanding visual behaviour in more diverse observational situations' (reference 97, pp. 9-1 0). 852</page><page sequence="38">Walter Stanley Stiles This distinction between the two categories is perhaps not always sharp. Almost every successful theory relies upon unproved assumptions; Stiles's line element is by no means an exception. Certainly combining Weber fractions of individual mechanisms in the same way as ind- ependent errors are combined in the derivation of equation [5] (or [6]) is as arbitrary and ad hoc as any feature of empirical line elements. Still, the former has its roots in the effort to analyse how the discriminations are achieved in terms of their physiology in a way that the latter do not attempt. As one of the great masters of colour science, Stiles was interested in, and erudite about, both varieties of line elements. But in his research he followed Helmholtz and Schr6dinger. Analysis of mechanism had a greater fascination for him than mere mathematical description of behaviour. With regard to Silberstein's other criticism, Stiles did not regard the failure of the uniform-chromaticity-scale surface of constant brightness, defined by his line element to reflect the fluctuations in sign in Gaussian curvature required by MacAdam's ellipses, as a fatal flaw that undermined its entire structure. Rather, it was a difficulty pointing to the need for further data and theoretical modification of the original approximate theory. Stiles supposed his line element as an n-dimensional Riemannian space embedded in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. In general, these quantities are related by m = \n(n + 1). Thus if in a three- dimensional line element space, attention is experimentally confined-as with MacAdam's ellipses-to the domain of chromaticities of constant luminance, the colours can be represented on a two-dimensional Riemannian surface embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. With regard to the complex problem represented by a more quantitative comparison between the details of MacAdam's ellipses and those predicted by Stiles's line element, a modern student is inclined to regard the inductive line element less harshly than Silberstein's critique suggests, given the measurement imprecision in the data base from which each line element was derived and that both the observers and the observing conditions differed. With regard to measurement imprecision, Wyszecki &amp; Stiles (107, p. 667) note: It is difficult to estimate, and in fact has not been tried how, the Gaussian curvature would vary if small perturbations, simulating observational uncertainties of about 15 %, were introduced to the lengths and orientations of the major and minor axes of the MacAdam's ellipses. On the basis of Farnsworth's (1958) work ... such perturbations may show that the Gaussian curvature underlying MacAdam's ellipses could be near or equal to zero in the chromaticity domain. Observer and conditions of observation differences have assumed a perspective more favourable to resolving this difficulty of the Stiles line 853</page><page sequence="39">Biographical Memoirs element as a result of a comparison of the ellipses predicted by it with all the available empirical ellipses (Wyszecki &amp; Fielder 1971). In this comparison, a formula of Chickering (1967)-derived from MacAdam's (1966) modification of the equation of Friele (1965) and then employed in a computer optimization routine to adjust the parameters, calculating thereby McAdam's ellipses to a very good approximation-was also included. (This not only provided a benchmark standard for the comparison but also allowed MacAdam ellipses to be calculated for regions of chromaticity chart for which experimental data were unavailable.) In the actual comparison, it was found, not surprisingly, that this formula fitted the MacAdam data quite well. More surprising was that the ellipses predicted by the line element of Stiles fitted the empirical results 'almost as well' (p. 1151). On the other hand, the ellipses of MacAdam's observer, particularly for red and purple test colours, showed 'significant and systematic discrepancies' when com- pared with the empirical ellipses of all the other observers. Wyszecki &amp; Fielder attributed these to differences in experimental procedure as well as differences in observers. Schr6dinger assumed that the line between any two points in tristimulus space with the smallest number of just perceptible steps between the two colours provided the measurement of the perceptual distance between the stimuli in the form of the number of steps. With this assumption, Stiles calculated on a surface of constant brightness the geodesic lines between the achromatic stimulus and the spectral locus or the line of purple (as well as circles of equal radii) using Stiles's line element. The resulting theoretical lines of constant hue and saturation plotted on the 1931 C.I.E. chromaticity diagram have a remarkable resemblance to a similar plot of the empirical lines of constant hue and chroma set up in the Munsell colour system. A projective transformation of these loci, in which the transformation coefficients were determined by least-squares optimization, yields a diagram remarkably similar to the 1960 C.I.E.-U.C.S. diagram. These difficult calculations were made feasible only with the advent of modern computers and make their first appearance in the first edition of Color science (93). A second extension of Stiles's theory, in a quite different direction, was the insight that Trabka (1968a, b) provided to its physiology by applying modern signal- detection theory to the threshold-radiance curve. Still a third was the application of Stiles's line element to the analysis of small-step, step-by- step luminosity data and wavelength discrimination data of colour vision defectives to infer the action spectra of the cones in anomalous trichromacy (Alpern &amp; Torii 1968 a, b; Alpern &amp; Moeller 1977). Despite such successes, Stiles believed to the end of his life that the model of how visual mechanisms function upon which his line element was based was too simple (see below). 854</page><page sequence="40">Walter Stanley Stiles WORLD WAR II At the outbreak of World War II, Stiles, at the zenith of his most productive years, had already achieved a considerable body of dis- tinguished work, even for a healthy man. But he was not a healthy man; chronic poor health was to plague him for the rest of his life. Tinnitus, migraine and sick headaches, stomach pains, gastric haemorrhages, acute trigeminal pains, nausea, ulcers, colds, being overwhelmed with work and feelings of inadequacy, feeling tired and symptoms of general nervous exhaustion were periodic interruptions in his daily routine. Correspondents are invariably unusually solicitous as to his health. One reads in his Journal, dated 2 June 1941: Resuming full time Lab work after my illness. Shall also resume Lab fire watching but not local fire watching for a few weeks yet. Rejected for military service on Saturday last. When the war came, Stiles was immediately immersed in applied work. Human vision during combat in a modern major war is subject to a variety of problems with few or no counterparts of importance in peace time, and Stiles was uniquely qualified to deal with them. So he served the entire war with distinction, doing what he did best on war-related problems, as a scientific officer at N.P.L. In the end, some 28 unpublished reports of work carried out during the period 1939-45 were submitted. Their topics varied from 'The effect of a rhythmic searchlight on the visibility of objects' (Admiralty), 'Spotting a mortar shell with binoculars' (note to Gen. Phys. Committee Ministry of Supply), 'Use of searchlights or the sun's reflection to dazzle dive-bombers by day' (Dazzle Subcommittee F.P.P.C. ?), 'Methods of testing the opacity of steel wool' (M. of H.S. and I.E.), 'Ground observation in moonlight by means of a smoke screen' (M. of H.S.), 'Aircraft scanning report' (Admiralty), and 'Protection of dams against special air attack' (note to scientific advisors M. of P.). In a brief summary of some of this work he was asked to give after the war (50), these studies of glare and dazzle were divided into three groups: (i) protection from excess of natural light, (ii) protection from dazzle from gunflash and searchlights, and (iii) dazzle as a possible weapon. Most of this was tedious and some was doubtless boring. (On 2 February 1942 he noted in his Journal: '... Frankly I am not greatly interested in some of the ad hoc problems which come my way now...'.) In addition to everything else, there were committee meetings. On 30 May 1945 we read: I hope I may be able to give up the Subcommittee. I don't want a squabble about this. It would be best to agree with its quiet demise. When that is gone I shall have the following committees: 855</page><page sequence="41">Biographical Memoirs (a) F.P.R.C. Vision CTTEE (b) R.N.P.R.C. (c) I.E.S.

Despite what must have been onerous, time consuming, uninteresting and laborious work, he recognized its necessity and was remarkably effective at it. On 8 December 1945 he confided to his Journal: Downstairs this afternoon after a sharp attack of flu .... Letter from PM's secretary inviting me to let my name go forward for the O.B.E. I accepted. What time he could spare was devoted to writing the line element theory, to study, and to reading. Just before D-Day, he was asked to lecture to the Physical Society on 'Current problems of visual research' (43,44). The lecture is still well worth reading. In it, Stiles implicitly acknowledges a fundamental mistake committed at the Joint Discussion on Vision of the Physical and Optical Societies almost a dozen years before. On that occasion, Professor F. A. Lindemann, F.R.S. (later Lord Cherwell, Professor of Physics at Oxford) raised a question about points of contact between visual phenomena and quantum theory. In a quite astonishing prescient, yet casual reply, Stiles (20) succinctly outlines a proposed series of experiments on the matter which, when actually carried out and the results published a decade later, was to become one of the most fundamental papers in vision in the 20th century (Hecht et al. 1942). This proves that the peripheral retina of the eye is so sensitive under fully dark-adapted conditions that the physical fluctuations due to the quantum nature of its stimulus affect moment-to- moment threshold fluctuations. By 1932, Stiles had worked out the theory of experiments that would test this idea, outlining them for the others at this small meeting, including-prominently among them- Hecht himself, in response to this question. But there was a mistake. Stiles searched hard for a way to sort out these quantum fluctuations from fluctuations due to more biological and psychological factors of which his many threshold measurements on his own eye assured him there were many sources. By the time of these Discussions, reasoning from the fact that the number of incident quanta was small only for light near the peak of the rhodopsin absorption spectrum, he thought the answer was to compare the shape of the psychometric function illustrating the 'frequency of seeing' obtained for test stimuli of two different wavelengths, e.g. at 520 nm, where the threshold was only 50 quanta, to that at 700 nm, where it was 200000. (Stiles detected this fundamental 856</page><page sequence="42">Walter Stanley Stiles error as early as 11 June 1933, judging from an entry in his Journal on that day. Threshold fluctuations depend not upon the number of quanta incident, but on the number absorbed. According to the principle of univariance, this would be wavelength independent.) In his 1944 lecture to the Physical Society, Stiles implicitly acknowledges this error with the statement that 'Such evidence as there is indicates no marked variation in the precision of threshold determinations as the wave-length is changed' (44, p. 332). On 26 May 1944, Stiles notes in his Journal: Great relief to have delivered my lecture last Wednesday (24/5/44). On the whole it was a success but I wish I had not cut bits out to save time. They could have stood another 5 min. MECHANISMS OF COLOUR VISION When the press of applied research for the war effort slackened sufficiently to permit it, experiments on fundamental visual problems began again. The two-colour work resumed where it left off in 1939. Generality of the two-colour threshold Stiles's first concern on returning to the increment threshold was to establish the generality of the 1939 result (carried out on his own left eye alone) on seventeen other normal trichromats, one protanope and one deuteranomalous trichromat (49). To this end he measured the two- colour foveal increment threshold curve with the use of filter primaries for a blue test on an orange background approximating dominant wavelengths of 470 nm and 615 nm respectively. All subjects show the operation of at least two (i.e. the 'blue' and the 'green') mechanisms. A new observation was the intrusion of rod vision in some subjects, which he separated out by measuring the cone threshold during intervals of time before rods had time to recover from intense light adaptation-a useful technique used by many of us since, when wandering of fixation introduces this pernicious artefact. At least one such subject was found on further work to maintain normal fixation, but yielded a rod-free response when the direction of fixation was ? to the left of fixation. This idiosyncrasy is remarkable only in so far as it is representative of one of many such fascinating bits of information which a close reading of even the less significant of Stiles's papers reveals. They suggest interesting experimental questions promising a better than usual payoff matrix if posed even today, more than 40 years after they were written. 857</page><page sequence="43">Biographical Memoirs Pi mechanisms The next step was to determine complete field sensitivity spectra for the blue, green and red foveal mechanisms on five observers. One surprising result was further complexity. Instead of only three mech- anisms of the original scheme, it became necessary to suppose seven (71,81). Obviously this was more than necessary for trichromacy, and Stiles modified his view that each mechanism represented the action spectrum of a different photoreceptor species. The meaning of the term 'mechanism' changed from the crisp concrete notion of the absorption spectrum of a visual pigment in the cone outer segments inferred from colour matching, to the action spectrum of a colour-coded channel. This latter was broad enough that in 1961 and in 1967 (86,94) it could be extended to describe models of colour channels in which the inputs from the receptors are subject to a considerable amount of cross talk. Models of this latter kind are not helpful in explaining the physiology of symmetric trichromatic colour matching but are crucial to dealing with the more general questions relating to how colours appear as they do and how lights are detected. The seven foveal action spectra defined by the postwar two-colour experiments were called (71) n mechanisms-in a deliberate effort to avoid names which imply perceived colour. They were differentiated by numerical subscript. Three of these, T1, nz2 and t3, have their peak in the short-wavelength part of the spectrum. The first is the 'blue' mechanism of 1939. The second is not well understood, even today. It was not evident in 1939 work and does not appear in all observers; in some others it has, at best, an ethereal existence, being pronounced at the beginning but gradually disappearing. It has a second and very pronounced peak in the neighbourhood of 561 nm in the yellowish green spectral region. z74 is the 'green' mechanism studied originally in 1939; at higher radiance level it becomes modified to a somewhat narrower shape and slightly more sensitive (relative to 74) at the short-wave side of the spectrum (81). The modified spectrum became 1t4. n5 is the original long-wave sensitive mechanism; it becomes modified at high radiances to a slightly broader spectrum with slightly more sensitivity (relative to T5) at the long-wave part of the spectrum, int (81). Though it was clear to Stiles (who remained firm in his conviction that the laws of symmetrical colour matching-i.e. visual equivalence by strict substitution-required only three foveal cone visual pigments) that all seven n mechanisms could not define absorption spectra of visual pigments, the question as to which (if any) of the n mechanisms operationally defined visual pigment absorption spectra remained open for the rest of his life. He was delighted with newer evidence summarized in the review by Pugh &amp; Mollon (1979) leading to the strong suggestions that i3 was a mechanism in agreement with his original meaning of the term, while t1 was one in agreement with the 858</page><page sequence="44">Walter Stanley Stiles more recent concept-indeed one of the colour mechanisms (the 'blue-yellow' mechanism) of opponent colour theory. The micro- spectrophotometric results of Bowmaker &amp; Dartnall (1980) and the elegant electrophysiological data of Baylor et al. (1987) provide direct evidence that at least some of the n mechanisms define cone pigment absorption. But many modern authorities remain unconvinced that this identity of visual pigment absorption and psychophysical action is precise for n5 and n4. The matter is very much a subject of current research. Interactions between mechanisms Field sensitivity action spectra have one advantage over all the other proposed ways of estimating the absorption spectra of human cone visual pigments psychophysically: the end point is best controlled for differences in the viewing conditions (in Stiles's terminology, the 'conditioning stimulus'), including most importantly its wavelength, even when the test is near one spectral extreme and the conditioning stimulus at the other. This is no guarantee of validity, and it may be that the increase in number of mechanisms from three to seven caused Stiles to look more closely at the assumptions upon which the method was based. Of these, the assumption of independent mechanisms was the most crucial and the most vulnerable. In September of 1958, Stiles began nine months of research in the laboratory of Gfinter Wyszecki of the National Research Council, Ottawa, studying the independence of the mechanisms at threshold. Given a mixture of two lights, each component of which stimulates completely independent mechanisms, the probability of detection of the mixture Pm is defined by Pm = 1 -(1-pl)(1-P2), [9] in which p, and P2 are the probabilities of detection of each component alone. Stiles used this theorem of probability in what have since become known as test additivity experiments, though a more appropriate word is test probability summation. Given two wavelengths sufficiently separated in the spectrum (according to the 1939 results) to stimulate the two different mechanisms, and given their mixture (in relative units, i.e. fractions or multiples, of the respective thresholds when the components act alone) in any proportion, the probability of detecting of the mixture on 50 % of the trials can be calculated from equation [9] and the shape of the psychometric function. To evaluate probability summation (and therefore independence), Stiles held A1 fixed (at one spectral extreme) and varied A2 throughout the spectrum. The results from these first Ottawa experiments on test additivity were startling, and he waited nearly eight years before publishing them (94). If, for example on a high red background, one of the lights was red and the 859 28 RBM</page><page sequence="45">Biographical Memoirs other green, mixed say in equal proportions, far from revealing independence of the mechanisms at threshold, Stiles found that the threshold mixture contained more red radiance and more green radiance than required in either of the two alone at threshold! Obviously some kind of physiological inhibitory interaction was involved that undermined the independence assumption under these conditions. The implication of these findings changed Stiles's perspective, both of the physiology of the increment threshold and of the line element. In particular, he now began seriously (94) to consider the possibilities of extending the line element into a zone theory of colour vision in which the later stages included opponent colour-coded channels that also could be probed by the two-colour technique. This was the beginning of a whole new line of increment threshold research. R. M. Boynton joined Stiles in his final year before retirement at N.P.L., in collaboration in the very first of this line of research. With him came M. Ikeda as research student from Japan. These experiments (91) probed the test mixture paradigm more extensively, including the mixture of test increments and test decrements of various proportions and of different wavelengths, including those each selected to test different mechanisms (e.g. r1 and 7es). According to the Helmholtz and Stiles line elements, discrimination is related to the root mean square of the three independent mechanisms; hence increments and decrements should be equivalent in their effects. The results of these experiments clearly documented not only that the rT mechanisms were not independent mechanisms at threshold, but that increments and decrements had quite different effects: with a selection of wavelengths such that each component was unlikely to be exciting the same mechanism at threshold, a mixture of two increments showed clear evidence for physiological inhibition whereas a mixture of an increment and a decrement yielded evidence for probability summation! The complexity of the interactions revealed by this work is still not organized into a general scheme, but it provided the point of departure of much subsequent study of thresholds in the context of opponent processes in the coding of colour in zone theories of colour vision (Sperling &amp; Harwerth 1971; Pugh 1976; Augenstein &amp; Pugh 1977; Mollon &amp; Polden 1977; Pugh &amp; Mollon 1979; Pugh &amp; Larimer 1980; Polden &amp; Mollon 1980; Thornton &amp; Pugh 1983; Friedman et al. 1984). It is true enough that this development was in the spirit of the time. Much of it might well have followed independently of these mixture experiments; some of it (Sperling &amp; Jolliffe 1962; Guth 1965) evidently did. But it is also true that Stiles's very first experiments in Ottawa in 1959 proved remarkably prescient of much of modern work along these lines. This included (i) evidence leading to the strong inferences that the T7 mechanisms were not independent, (ii) clear evidence for opponency between outputs of middle- and long-wave sensitive receptors and a colour opponency between outputs of short-wave and middle-wave and/ 860</page><page sequence="46">Walter Stanley Stiles or long-wave sensitive receptors at thresholds, (iii) evidence that the adaptive state can remarkably influence the colour-coded signals inferred as the outputs of these opponent channels, and (iv) evidence that changing the test duration also can conspicuously change such signals (Pugh &amp; Kirk 1986). An important building block of this later development, essential for establishing which, if any, of the n mechanisms are valid operational definitions of visual pigment absorption spectra, was an experimental test of what became known as field additivity. Stiles never tested field additivity directly himself. Experiments of this kind seem first to have been carried out by de Vries (1946c, 1948, 1949), who verified additivity for his version of the 'green' mechanism, by Boynton et al. (1966), Pugh (1976), Polden &amp; Mollon (1980), Sigel &amp; Pugh (1980), Wandell &amp; Pugh (1980a, b), Kirk (1985) and Reeves (1987). In a cogent modern summary of the two-colour increment threshold work, Pugh &amp; Kirk (1986) have recently noted that only n3 and n5 remain as viable candidates for valid operational definitions of cone visual pigment absorption spectra, although even here 'some equivocal results remain unexplained'. It is remarkable that a technique developed explicitly for elucidating the psychophysical characteristics of cone visual pigments, and from which all our modern understanding of cone visual pigments developed, has become ultimately of limited usefulness, at best, in elucidation of pigment absorption spectra although at the present time it remains a powerful analytical tool in the study of colour-coded opponent channels, the existence of which Stiles never successfully incorporated into a general line element. OTHER THEORETICAL PAPERS Stiles's publication list is not long. As a civil servant there was no pressure on him to make it so, and there is almost no redundancy in whatever was published. No doubt he enjoyed the stimulation and fellowship of meeting with friends and colleagues at small conferences in his subject, and with a proliferation of these after the war, many of his major papers appeared as invited lectures in the proceedings of such meetings. Sometimes he summarized progress in areas about which he had thought deeply, even if the contributions of his own experiments to the subject may have been small. Three invited lectures of this latter kind-to the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers (in 1948), the combined meeting of the International League of Opticians and the Institute of Optics of Florence, Madrid and Paris (in Madrid, 1960), and the Newton Lecture to the Colour Group (in 1967)-stand out. The first lecture (54) pioneers the probe of physical principles underlying the shape of the absorption spectra of visual pigments of which (at that time) only rhodopsin, the photosensitive substance of rod 28-2 861</page><page sequence="47">Biographical Memoirs vision, had been identified. Stiles used the factors known to determine the absorption of light by simple molecules to explain the linear relation between the logarithm of rhodopsin absorption of monochromatic radiation and test wavenumber (or frequency, v) in the long-wave end of the spectrum. He assumed a minimum energy Eo must be available for the absorption of a single photon. If the absorbed light energy hv is less than this minimum, the deficit must be supplied by the thermal vibrational energy of the chromophore group in the unexcited ground state. If all chromophore groups possessing sufficient thermal vibrational energy are equally capable of absorbing light, the average absorption coefficient of the molecule a. is proportional to the number of chromophore groups with a thermal vibrational energy of Eo-hv or more. In thermal equilibrium, Stiles assumed that the chromophore groups were dis- tributed among the possible energy levels in accordance with Boltzmann's law (i.e. the number in an energy level Ei being proportional to e-EilkT) and that the vibrational energy levels were very numerous and close together. These assumptions lead to lna, = const. + hv/kT (for hv &lt; Eo). In this equation h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is absolute temperature. The precision of the measurements of rhodopsin then-or even now- available was unequal to the precision required by the theory. To surmount this obstacle. Stiles took advantage of the expectation that the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin ought to correspond to the action spectrum of rod vision to exploit the much higher precision available even then from the action spectrum of human night vision. (Analysis of the contemporary evidence on the correspondence between these spectra is the major thrust of the earlier part of the paper.) Stiles noted that in the plot of the logarithm of rod sensitivity as a function of v, the long-wave spectral extreme of this action spectrum in man was a straight line with a slope of 0.79 h/kT. He attributed this small discrepancy to the approximate nature of his calculation, which gave no consideration to structural properties by which the chromophores of different substances must be distinguished. (To simplify the calculation he assumed that the absorption coefficient of a chromophore in the ith state had a constant value A when hv &gt; (Eo-Ei) and that, given dm, the number of vibrational levels between E and (E+dE), A(dm/dE) was independent of E.) Supposing instead A(dm/dE) = const. exp oE, In a. = const. +hv [1/kT- o]. 862 leads to</page><page sequence="48">Walter Stanley Stiles This increase in dm/dE with E corresponds to a crowding together of the vibrational levels towards the higher energies. For the chromophore group, o- is regarded 'as a kind of structural constant for the group in its particular environment and probably as independent of temperature'. For rhodopsin, Co = 4.9 x 1012. Absolute thresholds in the fovea for the long-wave spectral extreme provide reasonable evidence with which to estimate o = 3.1 x 1012 for the unknown pigment Stiles inferred for the long-wave sensitive cones. The paper concludes with the observation that for rods, understanding of the subjective data has been enriched by directly measured chemical and physical data on the properties of the photochemical substance absorbing the light, and that in this paper the process was reversed: i.e. the subjective data had enriched the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of rhodopsin. For cone substances, about which nothing was known (in 1948), the subjective data provide information about 'the physical and chemical properties of substances whose existence we can only infer'. The Madrid lecture (86) considers adaptation in almost all of its aspects: light, dark, rod, chromatic and even colour transformations. There are two experimental approaches to these topics: thresholds and measurements of appearances. In any review of thresholds the pro- ductivity of Stiles's own laboratory, described above, would necessarily be prominent. Here it is a succinct-even terse-but thorough, treatment of the understanding brought to adaptation phenomena at the time by threshold measurements and hints in what way further work may improve matters. (Readers may recall the remarks on the equivalent background quoted in the section of this memoir devoted to his work in illumination engineering.) But the concise summaries in the paper of the status of understanding brought to adaptation phenomena by studies of colour and brightness appearances in general, and by the asymmetrical matching methods (such as binocular matching) in particular (to which Stiles never made any substantial experimental contributions), are at the heart of the reason this may be regarded as a 'theoretical' paper. The terseness is achieved by a mathematical formalism which gives the essences of the advantages and rigorously documents details of the difficulties of the method not found elsewhere so completely yet concisely stated. The theory of asymmetric matching based on the simplest hypothesis of adaptation, namely that each fundamental colour mechanism acting independently is altered in chromatic adaptation by a single constant, is developed within this formalism. The equations characteristic of von Kries's law of coefficients are derived, and the way in which binocular (or asymmetric) matching can be used to determine the action spectra of the three fundamental colour mechanisms with the aid of these equations is outlined. 863</page><page sequence="49">Biographical Memoirs Stiles then reviews the various ways this simple picture breaks down: by yielding complex solutions to the transformation matrix derived from the two sets of tristimulus values obtained from asymmetric matches made in experiments locating each member of a set of three stimuli for which presumably no matter how the eye is adapted no colour change results, or by failures in the additivity law applied to the asymmetric matches, and the complication of different fundamental colour mech- anisms appearing under different adaptation conditions. The implica- tions of these results are analysed and the theoretical explanations put forth by various authors to deal with them evaluated. The Madrid lecture (86) concludes with an analysis of the demonstrations of two-colour pictures of Edwin Land (1959a, b), which attracted a good deal of attention at the time. In a letter to Stiles, dated 11 December 1960, Rushton writes about this paper: Dear Stanley, Here at last is your M.S. which I have read through carefully several times. It is the most profound discussion of adaptation I have ever seen, and I hope I have been able to learn the principal things it teaches... Stiles returns to the study of colour appearance in his Newton Lecture devoted to mechanism concepts in colour theory (94). Asymmetric matching is analysed with somewhat more attention to physiological possibilities than in the Madrid lecture of seven years before. The discussion of the Von Kries law of coefficients is approached through a graphical construction with which Stiles introduces these possibilities in the simpler case of dichromatic vision before considering trichromacy. Some more recent data have become available, more elaborate models from the literature are evaluated, and the symbols are different. But the approach is similar and the style the same. In keeping with its slightly different subject, the Newton Lecture goes on to discuss for the first time the more recent two-colour increment threshold results with test mixtures Stiles carried out at Ottawa (described in the previous section). It briefly sketches the feasibility of incorporating their surprising results in a line element such as that of Friele (1961), which includes one or more colour differencing terms. C.I.E. 1964 STANDARD OBSERVER Normal colour-matching functions The amounts of three reference primaries required by additive mixture to match monochromatic lights throughout the visible spectrum for normal eyes (i.e. the normal spectral colour-matching functions) are important data with both theoretical and practical significance. The best results available were pooled, transformed and recognized internationally at the 1931 C.I.E. Congress in Cambridge as the C.I.E. Standard 864</page><page sequence="50">Walter Stanley Stiles Observer. In the next two decades, inconsistencies of these matches with the visual perceptions of real observers came to light. This difficulty arose, in part at least, because the colour-matching functions were not measured directly but inferred from two sets of data. The first was the pooled measured unit (i.e. chromaticity) coordinates of the spectral colours of W. D. Wright and of J. Guild, whereas the second was the photopic luminosity curve, i.e. the inverse of energies of monochromatic lights throughout the spectrum required to produce equal sensations of brightness. The data set used in this latter case was the set adopted by the C.I.E. in 1924. Observers find the task of equating the brightnesses of two lights of different colours a difficult one, and it is not surprising that they differ substantially among one another in their responses to the identical set of instructions to this task. Moreover, the 1924 Standard Observer was shown to under-represent systematically the mean sensitivities of normal population samples in the short-wave extreme of the visible spectrum. Stiles was general secretary of the 1931 C.I.E. Congress and edited the proceedings of the meeting (16), but he played no substantive role in the adoption of the Standard Observer. Two decades later, with his research changed from glare and visibility to colour, he saw need for the determination of a new set of colour-matching functions based on direct radiometry of the energies involved with no recourse to the questionable assumptions that raised doubts about the validity of the Standard Observer. At its 1951 meeting in Stockholm, the C.I.E. demonstrated considerable interest in the redetermination of these functions, which had been measured with central fixation on a 2? test. At the same meeting the practical importance of measuring colour-matching functions with a larger field for industrial applications stimulated the request for a separate study with a 10? diameter field. Stiles was urged to undertake both. On his return to London, he found support, with backing by Professor W. D. Wright among others, and within the N.P.L., to construct the required colorimeter with fields uniform enough to make valid large-field matches and bright enough to permit direct radiometry of monochromatic lights in a 2? field. The design and the supervision of the construction of this instrument (not to mention its alignment and calibration) were, in themselves, monumental undertakings. No experimental apparatus as large and as complex as this dedicated to the study of human vision had ever before been constructed (74); nor has one been since. This device will be briefly described below. For the present purpose it suffices to point out that Stiles managed to design and oversee construction, alignment and calibration of this apparatus, and by August of 1954 measurement began. To obviate non-uniformities in the large field due to the photo-stable filter (so-called 'macular pigment') in the central area of the retina, subjects were asked to ignore the central 4? when completing 865</page><page sequence="51">Biographical Memoirs the 10? matches. With considerable assistance from Dr J. M. Burch, an interim report with mean results from a pilot investigation on 10 normal trichromats from both the 2? and 10? studies was presented to the 13th Plenary Session of the C.I.E. in 1955 in Zurich (76). It is hardly surprising that although small-but clear-differences between Stiles's small-field data and the 1931 Standard Observer were discovered, the discussion at the meeting evidently concentrated on the data obtained with the large field. The meeting recommended that the main measurements on a much larger group (50 normal subjects) be concerned only with the 10? field. Stiles followed this recommendation. Whatever the practical needs were for the large-field results, the small- field data with one fewer photoreceptor species involved were easier to analyse and are still of greater theoretical interest. In subsequent years the superiority of the pilot study small-field results (76) in the theoretical analysis of colour has become increasingly obvious. To this day they remain the benchmark standard for data of this kind and will remain so indefinitely. More than two decades after the Zurich meeting, poly- morphism of normal human cone visual pigments became a subject of some excitement and many of us were frustrated to learn that the data of each individual observer contributing to the pools comprising neither the 1931 C.I.E. Observer nor the mean 2? pilot data of Stiles &amp; Burch (76) were available for analysis. (Fortunately a more exhaustive search by Dr P. W. Trezona did uncover the individual sets of the 1955 2? data. She has processed them and made them available as an N.P.L. report (Trezona 1984).) The main experimental results with the large field were completed and published in a final report to the C.I.E. in 1958 (82). It provided means and standard deviations of the matches of 49 observers, of whom more than half had previous experience in colorimetric or photometric matching. Individual results for 20 of the most experienced of these are tabulated in Color science (93) and remain to this date the largest sample of individual normal colour-matching functions available. Unfortunately, a severe constraint on the value of these results for theoretical analysis is imposed by Stiles's discovery (74) that Grassmann's laws of linearity do not apply to these trichromatic matches. The difficulty is easy to identify: colour-matching with only three experimental degrees of freedom, undertaken by a part of the retina with photoreceptors whose outer segments each contain one of four different visual pigments, cannot be achieved by equation of the quantum catch in each species of pigment in the two fields to be matched, as with trichromatic matches which do not involve rods. Special effort had been made by Stiles &amp; Burch to reduce possible rod intrusion by keeping the luminance high. In 1959 Judd, acting for the C.I.E., averaged the Stiles &amp; Burch results together with the average of somewhat similar 10? data of Speranskaya on 18 observers done at much 866</page><page sequence="52">Walter Stanley Stiles lower luminance levels, after 'correcting' the latter for rod intrusion. In one field trial (87) these pooled data were used to predict the actual matches of 18 filter colours of real observers on a Donaldson colorimeter. The results were in some respects unsatisfactory; a second trial used the N.P.L. trichromator to perform a similar test on the N.P.L. white with the average Stiles &amp; Burch data (90) alone. Substantial differences between predicted and measured chromaticities were found in about one third of the 49 subjects, but 'fair agreement' was found between the predicted and measured chromaticities for the average of the whole group. Despite these obvious shortcomings, with the strong motivational force of D. B. Judd, the C.I.E. in 1964 adopted the pooled average data obtained from Stiles &amp; Burch's and Speranskaya's results corrected by Judd (1959) as the C.I.E. 1964 Supplementary Standard Observer. They remain so to this day. In 1973 Stiles, with Wyszecki, studied the extent to which rods contribute to the colour matches in a large 10? colorimeter field and outlined procedures that can be used in practice to decide if, and by how much, rods will participate in a given match (98). RETIREMENT Retirement broadened Stiles's horizons. His collaboration with Wyszecki working on the Canadian trichromator increased. Extensive correspondence with scientists throughout the world also increased. He typed out long letters to many of us on a battered typewriter when we wrote to him about a problem or sent a manuscript for his comments. A collection of these letters would be an invaluable contribution to the history of visual science in the 20th century. As he grew older, his health did not improve. Head noises in particular became much worse. On retirement, he and his wife moved to Richmond and sold the piano. Stiles virtually gave up music, turning to painting. He enrolled in classes (portrait painting, life painting) in the Richmond Institute of Adult Education. His log book includes a list of some of his work, together with the instructors' criticisms of it, statistics of various kinds of work appearing at exhibits he attended, as well as a half dozen pages of mathematics on perspective drawing. He became reasonably competent at sketching. Late notebooks contain the occasional pencil drawing of a colleague with whom he served on committee. Of those I know, the resemblance is caught well with a paucity of lines. Each afternoon after tea, Stiles and his wife would sit and work a crossword puzzle together. Mrs Stiles had arthritis, and when in their late years it became difficult for her to leave home or to stand at the stove, Stiles taught himself to cook. They had 'meals on wheels' at midday, but at night they would have more modest fare which he cooked. He regarded himself as 'a good plain cook', but Graham Fielder, his assistant during 867</page><page sequence="53">Biographical Memoirs his days in Ottawa, fondly remembers something more elaborate, a genuine 'proper meal' which Stiles prepared for the four of them when the Fielders visited London. But in retirement, his enthusiasm for study and interests in vision never slackened. When first proposed for Fellowship of the Royal Society, it was suggested to him that the way to become known among physicists as the authority on vision was to write a book on it, and his Journal for the ensuing few years is peppered with plans and procrastinations about a book on visual sensitivity. 4-11-45. I am fed up with the book hanging over me all the time. The proposal to put me up as a candidate for the R.S.-which I think will also certainly be without result-is a kind of blackmail. Indeed, he was incapable of writing with such motivation, and as long as he remained at N.P.L. no book on visual sensitivity or any other subject appeared. Once retired, there was no ulterior motivation and no way of stemming the flow of science from his pen, almost independent of his health. (The exceptions were due to attacks of extreme tinnitus, which destroyed his ability to concentrate.) Two important books then emerged; indeed the more important went through a second edition with sufficient changes to be regarded as yet a third. In 1978 he was persuaded by Dr J. D. Mollon to collect a dozen of his most important two-colour increment threshold papers and fit them together with a new essay bringing the subject up to date and publishing the collection as a book, Mechanisms of colour vision (102). This was by no means a redundant effort. Many of these papers were originally published in obscure and inaccessible places, and by the time the mainstream of the subject became aware of their importance and the need for them became widespread, they were generally unobtainable. Ten years later my personal copy has been so thoroughly used it badly needs rebinding. Color science In 1964 Stiles was appointed a Regent's Lecturer in the University of California, Los Angeles, and continued a three-month tour lecturing in Berkeley, St Louis and Rochester. He ended his North American interlude in Ottawa, mainly writing with Giinter Wyszecki a new book, Color science. This is arguably the most impressive achievement in his retirement years. It is a temptation to dismiss it too lightly as 'merely' a reprint of the cullings of the best produce of 40 years writing in his notebook. Roots of much that is found in the book-indeed, of nearly everything Stiles did-began in the notebook. But Color science has a life of its own. It is first of all an exhaustive authoritative summary of all that is necessary to know to do colour science, a handbook that no modern colour laboratory can be without. Much of what gives the book this 868</page><page sequence="54">Walter Stanley Stiles character is too trivial for his notebooks: the absorption spectra between 0.2 and 7.5 ptm of Corning, Schott and Chance-Pilkington glass, Wratten gelatin, and various miscellaneous filters obtained from specimens run in Ottawa; tables showing conversion of colour temperature to micro- reciprocal degrees; C.I.E. chromaticity coordinates of points on and off the Planckian locus that define lines of constant correlated colour temperature given for every microreciprocal degree from 0 to 660; tables converting internal transmittance to internal optical density for values of transmittance between 0.001 and 1.000 in steps of 0.001; internal transmittance in 10 nm steps of liquid filters for checking the performance of spectrophotometers; performance data of photomultiplier tubes suitable for photometry; distribution and dimensions of rods and cones in the human retina; conversion of photopic to scotopic trolands of monochromatic lights of different wavelengths; chromaticity coordinates (to five significant figures) and colour-matching functions (seven significant figures) of the 1931 C.I.E. Standard Observer in 1 nm steps in the spectral range from 360 to 830 nm; 1964 C.I.E. colour-matching functions weighted by the relative spectral energy distributions of fluorescent lamps of the following types: standard warm white, white, standard cool white, daylight, warm white deluxe, soft white and cool white deluxe; colour-matching functions of 20 individual observers (10? field) selected from experimental data obtained in N.P.L. colour- matching investigations of Stiles &amp; Burch (82); average discrimination ellipsoids for 12 observers, 10? observations, white surround (Brown 1957); field sensitivities of component visual mechanisms at the fovea (71,81) are representative of an endless list. But a handbook is more than tables, and this one has a good deal more than can be found in Stiles's notebooks, some of my favourite examples: a discussion of visual colorimetry including the Stiles trichromator, a penetrating analysis of the differences in colour matching between normal trichromats and colour-defective observers, factors modifying colour matching which include the only proof in print that the famous normalization of chromaticities introduced by Professor W. D. Wright obviates any influence of the prereceptor ocular media when chroma- ticities of monochromatic lights, but not when those of broad spectral distributions, are plotted, a masterly succinct summary (in 61 pages!) of Stiles's work on chromatic adaptation and increment threshold, and a brilliant discussion of the difficulties of quantifying the extent to which the colour-matching properties of normal trichromats differ from one observer to another. The review of empirical line element would certainly satisfy Silberstein's curiosity about Stiles's opinion of the Silber- stein-MacAdam (1945) criterion; the test of his inductive line element provided by the derivation from it of a network of geodesic lines and circles resembling lines of constant hue and saturation appearing in Color science has already been noted. Most important in the first edition is the 869</page><page sequence="55">Biographical Memoirs final chapter, a succint summary of 26 pages of important miscellaneous visual concepts and data which discusses briefly, but incisively, such topics as colour reversal of long wavelengths, the directional sensitivity, the Abney and Bezold-Bricke effects, dark adaptation and absolute threshold, the n mechanisms, and the comparison of visual response curves with the spectral properties of visual pigments. In all, it is a masterpiece. The first edition of this book appeared in 1967: its value to advanced students and investigators, as well as others who must deal with colour at a technical level, was immediately evident. It was soon out of print. The second edition appeared in 1982. Although the approach was the same. Wyszecki &amp; Stiles made a valiant effort to include the advances in their own thinking as well as in the subject in the decade and a half that intervened, and the result is almost-if not quite-a new book. It is half again as large as the first edition, with the final chapter greatly expanded and divided into two, one on visual thresholds, the other on theories and models of colour vision. Inevitably much of the writing of emendations of this final chapter fell to Wyszecki because of Stiles's failing health and two periods in hospital in 1978 and 1979. Still there is a good deal of Stiles that is new and important in the second edition. A case in point is the expanded discussion of trichromatic principles which now includes Maxwell's method of trichromatic matching. Another is the discussion of the visual pigment layers. In other places it is difficult to decide who is the primary author: the comparison of results from Maxwell's and maximum saturation-matching experiments and the discussion of the relation between the spectral absorption curve of visual pigments and colour- matching data are examples. The authors were not physiologists. Wisely, they avoided the enormously difficult task of analysing the explosion of knowledge about the electrophysiology of mammalian colour vision. In the first edition, this was the obvious decision on the grounds that neither they (nor, for that matter, anyone else) were equipped to do this at the level of rigour their readers had come to expect of them. But there are those who feel that the contributions they and others have made to understanding in the interval between the two editions are sufficient that this was no longer true for the second edition. Impartial readers will be inclined to share with me, I believe, the view that the original decision was still the most judicious one, even (one may substitute 'especially') for a book with the title of this one. Stiles was never one for meticulous reading of proofs; even so, the number of typographical errors in the second edition is unusually large. I soon became in the habit of jotting down those I discovered and sending them to Dr Wyszecki for correction in future editions. When he died in June of 1985 I sent them to Stiles. Now each time I discover a new one, 870</page><page sequence="56">Walter Stanley Stiles I am reminded again that there is no one to whom one can send them; there can be no third edition of Color science because no one is capable of filling the authors' shoes. STILES'S SCIENTIFIC STYLE AND HIS LEGACY I met Stiles first on my initial visit to England in 1958. Of course his name was familiar (the Stiles-Crawford Effect, the Holladay-Stiles equation), but it did not occur to me to include the N.P.L. on the short list of laboratory visits planned for the brief fortnight available in this country. Gerald Westheimer (F.R.S. 1985) suggested it. 'You must see the Stiles trichromator,' he insisted. 'It is the Cyclotron of vision research.' (The analogy was to the largest machine dedicated to experimental science then known to either of us, at least. Today it would be the Superconducting Super Collider, I suppose, and equally appropriate.) The trichromator was indeed impressive (74). Spectral stimuli for measuring human colour-matching functions were provided by three dispersive systems, each with a van Cittert double monochromator with cancelling dispersions in the two states. The three systems were mounted one above the other, each separated by 60 cm to form a three-tier structure which Rushton (1958) called 'Stiles's great trireme' tri- chromator. Vertically, it stretched from floor to ceiling and horizontally filled the space between the walls of a good-sized room. It was housed in its own suitably ventilated enclosure with removable hatches for access to key positions. Every component on each tier was kinematically mounted on steel balls. I still remember the demonstration Stiles provided on this occasion. Though I had seen a mixture of monochromatic red and monochromatic green many times before, this was the first in which it looked truly indistinguishable from a monochromatic yellow, without the slightest inhomogeneity to mar the field. There are now three such instrument in different parts of the world, the others descendants of this original instrument. Impressive as all this was, what stands out most in my memory of the event was the man himself. Soft-spoken, kind and restrained, with a keen intelligence and complete grasp of his subject. A modest man, he appeared to have an unusually dispassionate view of his own work and a genuine interest and curiosity about mine. Over the years, after getting to know him better, I said and wrote to him a good deal, not all of which had been carefully thought through. Yet his criticisms were always con- structive, sharp, to the point, and enormously rewarding. He was quiet and contemplative, above all else a thoroughly gentle man. The demonstration provided that day also introduced me to his style. The match of a mixture of red and green primaries to a yellow was upset 871</page><page sequence="57">Biographical Memoirs and required more red and less green to re-establish it when I displaced my head slightly so that the light passed into my pupil eccentrically. The effect was clear enough, but the few diffident remarks Stiles made at the time did nothing to contradict the impression that this was nothing more than another example of those curious subjective visual phenomena sometimes described by 19th-century authors, inexplicable (or poorly explained) at the time, which turned out to be of only passing interest. But when I thought about it long after it was too late to press for an explanation that afternoon, it was clear that something deeper was involved. I would soon learn that Stiles's work was never superficial. He would not turn the full power of the 'cyclotron of vision research' loose on a phenomenon likely to have a trivial explanation. I could not myself find a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon. When I pressed him for one in a letter written shortly after returning home, he responded with a lengthy learned discussion which pointed me to the scant literature of two papers, one by him (33), the other by Brindley (1953) (to which he added in three years a third (85), the preliminary work on which he was obviously involved during my visit). Only slowly and gradually did the fundamental quality of the problems they treated become apparent after immersing myself in these papers and thinking about them long and hard. They represent the major experimental concerns of my laboratory in the last decade. A similar depth is to be found in any of the more fundamental papers in his list. A feeling for this style can be gleaned from a letter to me from Professor Horace Barlow, F.R.S. dated 24 September 1987: ... I met him around 1953 when I was interested in thermal noise as a limit on vision, in which Stanley's absorption spectrum was crucially important. He had some criticisms, probably quite justified, of a draft I had written, but I also recall a funny impression I had at the time. As you know I tend to get enthusiastic about the explanatory power of an idea-' Aha, this explains everything'-but Stanley would have nothing of that. It was as if he was a strict Baconian and insisted that the explanations emerge from the facts; the possibility that the explanation might be imposed on the facts was so serious, threatening, even immoral, that one should hardly dare whisper such ideas. And yet he was a theoretician himself .... He was of course a perfectionist in both theory and experiment, and that possibly stopped him backing a theory unless it explained 99 % of the facts, while most of us are enthusiastic if it explains a mere 90 %! Perfection on the experimental side was, of course, responsible for the beauty with which his experimental results fell upon the theoretical curves. This is what Weale (1986) in a memoir for Nature called Stiles's 'legacy of precision'. But there was something more: a reliability of experimental results which had its foundation in a great integrity. Legacy of precision or no, Mollon (1986) in a memoir for Perception documents how carefully his papers include every firm experimental result, no 872</page><page sequence="58">Walter Stanley Stiles matter how little sense it may make in its contemporary mainstream of ideas. Enoch (1986) in his memoir in the American Journal of Optometry and Physiological Optics remarks how 'each reading of his paper reveals new insights, new depth of thought, new construct' as the reader himself matures. But it is not only the maturity of the reader that is responsible for the remarkable fecundity of fresh experimental ideas that the rereading of a Stiles paper holds in store for modern readers. Stiles has done his homework well and planted his experiments in a fundamental field in which the subject itself matures and grows rich. This makes it relatively easy for even a modern student of one of these papers to find in it an anomaly or 'minor inflexion' and, by using straightforward techniques developed by Stiles and those who followed his lead, to transform this anomally into an important phenomenon on its own, as Mollon (1986) observed. Professor Enoch provides a view of his work habits in his later years at N.P.L. in a personal communication to me of 21 September 1987: ... having shared his office for a year, his daily drill was to arrive promptly each morning and pick up his pen and start writing equations while quietly smoking his pipe. At coffee time he would pause for some 15 minutes to discuss matters with me and then he would pick up his pen and start writing equations again until noon. The same drill was followed in the afternoon with a tea break. Thus, each step in the laboratory was anticipated by extensive theoretical analysis and data was subjected to extreme and careful review. On rare occasions Stiles came to the laboratory. This caused a great flurry among the technical staff (he always put on a white coat). He had a good laboratory sense, i.e. a good practical bent. He had some fine tricks that I still use. The point is, he was both an excellent theoretician and a fine laboratory scientist... Kindness, gentleness and modesty were characteristic, but neither these nor even the apparent diffidence I remember from that first meeting imply a failure to recognize the power of his own work or tolerance of compromise in his views on the proper way of doing research, particularly from those taught to do better. Thus among the group working near or with him at N.P.L. as junior colleagues I discovered (in the preparation of this biography) that he had the reputation of an aloof austere man to whom one conversed about science only after being certain one had it right over every inch of ground to be covered. Observing this aspect of his personality in a different milieu, his niece wrote that he 'always saw through humbug and recognized people's hidden, and not always worthy, motives!' It is in this context that the final sentence of a posthumous note, left for me, by his wife of almost 60 years takes on significance: 'He did not suffer fools gladly'. It is this context too which explains his 'coolness' to a Dutch physicist, who published estimates of the three species of human foveal cone spectra 873</page><page sequence="59">Biographical Memoirs obtained by a corruption of the field sensitivity method carried out in occupied Holland during the war (de Vries 1946a-c). Originally the latter had made no reference to Stiles's seminal paper of 1939, repeating the omission (if Stiles's recollection (108) of the event 36 years later can be relied upon) at a meeting several months after Stiles set the record straight (48) (but see de Vries (1948, 1949)). To allow subjects to vary the radiance of the background for visibility of a fixed test in defiance of the principle that the background be used to set the adaptive state of the system while the test probes (but does not disturb) this steady state, was for Stiles an intolerable distortion of the two-colour method, yielding results that could not merit serious consideration. Anyone who would compromise this principle in the interest of quick results was a fool not gladly to be suffered. To infer a deeper personal significance to Stiles's attitude to de Vries (Mollon 1986) is to project an unnecessarily more complex perspective of Stiles's personality for which there is no evidence. But if Stiles did not gladly suffer fools, more than anyone I have known about, he allowed the occasional wild or 'far-out', if not foolish, ideas of junior co-authors, with which he did not always agree, to creep into a joint paper. Thus, that he was a strong supporter of the trichromatic theory required the following caveat in a paper written with Boynton and Ikeda (91) (p. 115): 'This interpretation rests on a four-mechanism scheme and is given as an illustration of the way summation results and spectral sensitivities may be related rather than as a commitment of all the authors to this particular scheme'. Professor Westheimer recalls the reply to a query about why Stiles tolerated a similar incident in another paper: 'In science it is only the residue that is important'. The 'residue' of Stiles's science is substantial. He made lasting and fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of illumination engineering and introduced the equivalence principle with far-reaching consequences for visual bleaching and field adaptation. With Crawford he discovered jointly the first, and alone the second, of the two effects that now carry their names. Granit (1955), a retinal physiologist who a dozen years later won a Nobel prize, singled out the Stiles-Crawford effect as the major discovery of visual psychophysics in the preceding three decades. It inaugurated an entirely new subject: photoreceptor optics. Nevertheless, Stiles's most important work was in the well-ploughed field of colour vision. He added a significant new dimension (i.e. thresholds) to the experimental analysis of cone photoreceptor action spectra at a time when speculation was the only alternative to matching. This achievement won him the praise of Brindley (1960) who singled out Stiles as representative of an approach tolerating only experiments with the (implicit) psychophysical linking hypothesis that equal optic nerve signals yield equal sensations. (But this characterization unfairly ignored the rich body of his experimental results and theory based on less plausible-and less rigorous-linking hypotheses.) On the other hand, 874</page><page sequence="60">Walter Stanley Stiles the threshold approach to colour vision was also excessively chastised by old hands in the subject. This latter attitude has been well captured in the same letter from Professor Wright quoted above in which he contrasts the two-colour experiments with my binocular matching technique as a means of studying colour adaptation. To me, our experiments had the immense advantage that we were measuring actual colour changes-quite dramatic ones. It always seemed to me a major weakness that Stiles would never take account of the subjective appearance of colours. This was the one disagreement when on one occasion I lost my 'cool' with him. He was giving an opening invited lecture on the Helmholtz line element at a meeting in the Netherlands (97), I think, and he never once referred to the colour sensations themselves as a factor in colour discrimination that had to be taken into account. Colour perception is more than mathematics! Stiles had a high regard for the advantages of Wright's binocular- matching method, as several entries in his notebook and the discussion of adaptation in the 1960 Madrid lecture (86) and more particularly in his elegant analysis of asymmetric matching in the 1967 Newton Lecture (94) attest. But he realized that a knowledge of how colours appear was not necessarily an advantage in inferring cone pigment absorption spectra from psycholophysical data, however useful it might prove in drawing inferences about more proximal stages in the complex physiology of the perception of colour. When Stiles took up the study of colour, no one had ever isolated a visual pigment except vertebrate rhodopsin in a test tube. After more than a half century of failure to isolate even one cone pigment, the study of the photoreceptor basis of colour vision was influenced-in my view, strongly so-by such ideas as one implicit in Hecht &amp; Williams (1922) that brightness and colour were coded separately at the very first stage of the process of vision, and Hecht's (1932) alternative that all three cone pigments had the same Amax and very nearly the same absorption spectrum. If the achievement that we now know these matters to be quite otherwise can be attributed to any one man, it must be to W. S. Stiles. He did this by the strength of his experimental research and by the cogency and penetrating logic of his deep theoretical papers. Some have done almost as well in theoretical contributions, others are nearly up to Stiles in quality and importance as well as the quantity of their experimental results. But he stands alone when judged in achievement in both categories, more often than not in the very same paper. What a marvellous style! It is never easy to appreciate a paper of his quickly, but its thorough study is invariably enormously rewarding. In addition to everything else, part of his legacy is a nucleus of younger scientists who strive to emulate his example. 875</page><page sequence="61">876 Biographical Memoirs When, in his lecture at Peniscola, he compares the backwater state of visual science in the 1920s with its flourishing state today, he says only that he is 'overwhelmed' (108). True to form, even in his final paper, one searches in vain to find the slightest hint how important his own seminal contributions were to bringing about the transition between these two states. He was the greatest colour scientist of the century. NOTE ON SOURCES, AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Stiles's Personal Record was returned to him at his request some time in 1966 for updating, but he never managed this; it was found at home among his papers after his death. He seems not to have changed anything since his original entries in it, which are scant. By far the most important resources are in his personal papers which are deposited in the library of the Psychological Laboratory at Cambridge University. (I am indebted to the librarian, Mr Robert Fishwick, and to its committee, Dr Paul Whittle and Dr J. D. Mollon, for the hospitality that made access to this material beyond the normal hours possible, and for many other kindnesses, including support for extensive copying.) This material is still only partly catalogued. There are some 83 items, two of which (covering the period 1 May 1979 to December 1981) I have yet to find. Most of this material (some 61 items) is serialized in bound notebooks and begin with lecture notes of S. Pollard on infinitesimal calculus (Michaelmas Term 1922) beginning 13 October 1922 at Cambridge and ending with a Journal current at his death. These include a Journal covering May 1928 to October 1931 and most importantly a much larger bound Journal volume covering the period from 4 February 1932 to 21 March 1957. In this memoir when quotation is otherwise unreferenced or given as a 'Journal', it is to this latter volume. In the late 1930s he decided to split off the science from the (often very) personal diary and there are then two additional separate notebooks, one devoted to mathematics and physics reading, the other related to his work in vision. After about the beginning of 1944 the Journal continues as his personal diary until 1957; then they become consolidated once more. Thus, on 17 February 1938 he began a notebook called 'Notes on vision'. Beginning 18 January 1944, these notebooks are standard bound size, 200 pages, and begin with a (18 January 1944 to 18 June 1944) through to QI (March 1961 to August 1962). The next is A (August 1962 to September 1963) and ends as the alphabet of Roman letters was exhausted with Z, which began on 10 April 1984 and was current at his death (the last entry, 24 November 1985, is a letter to J. D. Mollon). These notebooks also contain letters sent to him from scientists throughout the world. As they include nearly all the distinguished scientists of his generation active in this field, they are an additional valuable continuing resource which would have been even more precious</page><page sequence="62">Walter Stanley Stiles still if Stiles had been as meticulous in including his replies as he was in maintaining the letters he received. The unserialized material of about 25 items includes notes on reading and from lectures dating from his Cambridge days, but continuing even well into his retirement years. About ten of these are devoted to mathematics and physics. The others are more analytical notes bearing on visual theory, notes on visual and colorimetric theory, optical properties of scattering layers, measurements on the eye beginning in June 1956 and ending in 21 October 1959 devoted to reflection densitometer measurements of visual pigments in the living eye based on a different principle and to describing various snags with an apparatus he built to measure Haidinger brushes. There are also three file boxes of miscellaneous papers, including notes, correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, and lectures given to meetings and seminars. In my two brief visits to Cambridge in May-June 1986 and in September 1987, I have only been able to scratch the surface of this material. It merits exhaustive analysis. I am indebted to the Royal Society, and to Vice-President for Research Dr Linda Wilson and Dr John H. D'Arms, Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, both of the University of Michigan, for partial support which together made these visits possible. The late Mrs Walter Stanley Stiles and Dr Stiles's niece, Mrs James Wilson, submitted to exhaustive interviews and then added several written notes and reminiscences. Mrs Wilson's mother, Mrs Grace Etheridge, also wrote an extensive letter about her brother and about their ancestors. Dr B. H. Crawford, Professor R. M. Boynton, Professor W. D. Wright and Dr Patricia Trezona gave valuable time for personal interviews, and the last two followed this up with elaborations in letters. I am indebted to them all. For valuable comments on an earlier draft of this memoir, I thank Mrs Etheridge, Mrs Wilson, Professor Wright, Professor Gerald Westheimer, F.R.S., Professor Horace B. Barlow, F.R.S., Dr Mollon, Professor David Krantz, Professor Edward N. Pugh, Jr, Dr Kenneth Spring, Mr Graham H. Fielder and Dean Jay M. Enoch. These comments led to several improvements in the final version, including the personal observations of Professor Barlow, Professor Enoch and Professor Wright, and I thank them for allowing me to incorporate these quotations directly. I am grateful to numerous colleagues and warm Cambridge friends for many kindnesses which made my visits so enjoyable. I am also indebted to Ms Winifred D. Abbott, the librarian/archivist of the Polytechnic of Central London, who was most helpful in supplying background material on Stiles's old school and on his record there, to Professor Semir Zeki and Dr Stuart Shipp of University College London, and to the librarian of the University of London. This memoir was typed by Mrs Nancy Remaklus, and I thank her for patience with my 877</page><page sequence="63">878 Biographical Memoirs handwriting and with my temperament.
