Brunger POINTE BERNARD SHAW- IDENTIFICATION AND NAMING In June, 1983, the name Pointe Bernard Shaw was officially bestowed on an elongated southward-projecting peninsula on the southern end of the largest of the lies Radisson in the southwestern area of Ungava Bay, northern Quebec. The eastern shore of the peninsula possesses a rocky surface whose form - when viewed from the air 5,000 feet above - bears a close resemblance to the angular, high-browed profile of George Bernard Shaw as seen from his left hand side (Fig. 1). This effect is created by the chance arrangement of coast-line and adjacent cliffs and hills whose shadows accentuate the areas of Shaw's left eye, his nose and hirsute mouth and chin. The person who first identified Shaw's features on this tiny penin- sula in the vastness of the Canadian North is unknown. The word to describe the feature is topo-anthropomorph - a man-like place. I first became aware of its existence in October, 1973, during a field- trip with my class of Geography students from Trent University. We were in Ottawa inspecting the facilities of the Canadian Centre for Remote Sensing in which all aerial photographs and satellite images are pro- cessed and stored. Many examples of photographs were shown us, and I was informed by one of the gentlemen in the processing de- partment about the presence of the Shavian peninsula. He did not say if he had discovered it or indicate the name of the original discov- erer. I obtained a black-and-white copy from him although I did not, unfortunately, ascertain his identity. I retained the photograph for several years and found it useful as a class-room illustration of a novel kind. The point arrived, during an office move, at which I was in the process of getting rid of material. I resisted discarding the photograph and wondered what use it could have. The thought occurred to me that the Shaw Festival company might find it interesting. Consequently, I wrote them enclosing the aerial photograph in the fall of 1978.

The process of officially naming the peninsula was begun (in 1981) by Christopher Banks, the Shaw Festival General Manager. In that year, the photo which I had sent to the Festival in 1978 had been excavated from the drawer in which it had been placed. A long time passed while Festival authorities sought the proper government de- partment to which they had to apply for the official name. The ap- propriateness of the name needed justification before the two com- mittees concerned with toponymy: the federal Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names and the equivalent committee in the Province of Quebec - La Commission de toponymie du Quebec - within whose boundary the Pointe lies. Final approval occurred in June, 1983, although the Shaw Festival delayed announcement of newly named Pointe Bernard Shaw until July in order for it to coincide with the opening day of one of Shaw's spoofs of the British Empire entitled The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles.</page></plain_text>
