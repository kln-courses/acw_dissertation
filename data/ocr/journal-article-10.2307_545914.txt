Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Verhandelingen, Afd. Letterkunde, Nieuwe Reeks, deel 152. Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1992. Pp. viii + 306. 85 guilders [distributed by Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, POB 19121, 1000 GC Amsterdam. The Netherlands]. This volume is made up of papers presented at a symposium in Amsterdam in 1989 honoring Maurits van Loon on the occasion of his formal retirement from the University of Amsterdam. Most of the papers are in English, even though it is the native language of very few of the authors. The volume begins with a brief introduction "Natural Phenomena and Interpretation" by the editor, Diederik Meijer, followed by the other pa- pers arranged alphabetically by author, beginning with Pierre Amiet's paper on the storm god in the iconography of the cylinder seals from Ugarit, followed by Dominique Collon's paper "The Near Eastern Moon God." She points out the contrast between the ubiquitous representations of the</page><page sequence="2">244 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES VOL. 55 No. 3 symbol of the moon god in southern Mesopota- mia and the fairly rare depictions of the moon god in anthropomorphic form. She is able to point to a number of representations in northern Mesopotamia and Syria, however, including sev- eral quite recent finds. She suggests the possibil- ity that the myth of Sin and the Cow, used as a childbirth incantation, may have led to the rela- tive abundance of representations of the moon god in the first half of the first millennium B.C. G. van Driel's paper "Weather between the Natural and the Unnatural in First Millennium Cuneiform Inscriptions" is a wide-ranging dis- cussion covering such matters as the role of the weather and climate in the timing of Assyrian military campaigns. He stresses that ecological circumstance in ancient times differed somewhat from what we can observe now. J. D. Hawkins presents evidence to resolve the iconographic and graphic confusion regard- ing the logogram used in hieroglyphic Luwian to write the name of the Storm-god. In an appen- dix, he makes further contributions to reading epigraphs at Yazlllkaya. Philo Houwink ten Cate gives a very detailed discussion of the Hittite storm god according to the Hittite cuneiform sources, with densely packed footnotes-surely the definitive state- ment on the subject for some time to come. W. Orthmann publishes a wall painting (which includes human figures) from Halawa which he tentatively dates to the Early Syrian period (end of Early Dynastic I or beginning of Early Dynastic II in Mesopotamian terminology). Edith Porada publishes a cylinder seal from a private collection (of unknown provenance) de- picting a storm god which has striking similari- ties to one from Nuzi which she published many years ago. She has several proposals for eluci- dating some of the enigmatic elements in the new seal. Marten Stol's paper, "The Moon as Seen by the Babylonians" is one of the more intensely philological papers in the volume and displays his vast knowledge of cuneiform sources, includ- ing some of the most esoteric scholarly texts. He has a detailed discussion of the terms for the phases of the moon. He suggests that magurru, "boat," is the term for the moon when it is between half and full, that is, the gibbous moon. The term aga, he believes, refers to the gray part of the moon, that is, the old moon in the arms of the new. His article will repay a close reading for the new insights proposed. An example is reading bugin, "trough," rather than sug, "cane- brake," in a well known phrase in an inscription of Gudea (the cuneiform sign in question has both readings), based on an explicit reference in a Middle Babylonian boundary stone to the buginnu of the moon. Space limitations preclude even mentioning the many facets of the Baby- lonians' attitude and understanding of the moon which Stol elucidates. Something not touched upon is whether the Babylonians were aware of tides and the effect the moon has on them. This is a very fine volume and a superb tri- bute to Maurits van Loon from the pens of some of his outstanding colleagues. ROBERT D. BIGGS The University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
