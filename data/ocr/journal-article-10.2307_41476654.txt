<plain_text><page sequence="1">Situating Darsan : Seeing the Digambar Jina Icon in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century North India John E. Cort The 1981 publication of the first edition of Diana Eck's Darsan: Seeing the Divine Image in India marked an important watershed in the scholarly understanding and interpretation of visual interaction with and experience of three-dimensional temple icons in Hinduism (and by extension, South Asian religions more broadly). While there had been previous publications on ritual visuality in India (most notably Jan Gonda's Eye and Gaze in the Veda [1969]), and 1981 also saw the publication of Lawrence A. Babb's article "Glancing: Visual Interaction in Hinduism,"1 Eck's monograph, especially in its 1998 third edition, has remained definitively central in all subsequent discussions of darsan . In the words of Philip Lutgendorf (2006: 233), Darsan is now the "key text" on the subject. It is usually the first source on ritual visuality to which scholars of South Asia turn, and its prominence is equally evident in comparative discussions of icons and visuality by non-South Asianists.2 Due in significant part to Eck's thin volume, darsan has become what we can call - to import a term John Carman (1985: 117) used in a different context for the concept of the 'sacred' or the 'holy' - a "super-category" in the study of South Asian religion and visual culture. In this essay, following a review of the ways in which Eck's definition has become standard in studies of South Asian religious (and in some cases, secular) visuality, I argue that thirty years after the publication of her slim monograph, it is now time to revisit the broadly phenomenol- International Journal of Hindu Studies 16, 1: 1-56 ©2012 Springer DOI 10.1007/sl 1407-012-91 10-6</page><page sequence="2">2 / John E. Cort ogical theory of darsan that she advances. Instead of seeing dar san as functioning in the same way in all situations, regardless of such framing features as sect, region, time, gender and physical setting, this essay calls for a more multivalent understanding of darsan. It is not a single experi- ence in all of South Asia. Rather, people have experienced darsan in many ways. By way of example, this essay presents evidence from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century darsan pads (hymns) from the north Indian Digambar Jain tradition.3 A further argument in this essay is that the use of hymns that are sung on a regular basis, and thereby structure the oral experience and muscular memory of the singer, can give us insight into the subjective experience of darsan . The experience of darsan articulated and sung in these Jain hymns is quite different from that presented in Darsan . This example, in conclusion, is an invitation to other scholars of South Asian visual culture to revisit this central category and to begin to see it as a highly variable rather than singular super-category. Darsan in the Standard Academic View At the beginning of her essay, Eck simply and lucidly defined darsan as follows: "The central act of Hindu worship, from the point of view of the lay person, is to stand in the presence of the deity and to behold the image with one's own eyes, to see and be seen by the deity" (1998: 3). She noted that in addition to icons in temples and home-shrines, darsan can involve a living holy person, and that in many ways pilgrimage can be interpreted as travel for darsan of a sacred place. The multiplicity of potential objects of darsan is tied to what she termed the "polytheistic imagination" of Hinduism. The combination of visuality and polytheism has proven a difficult obstacle to understanding Hinduism for Western scholars (and especially those who are Protestant or Protestant-influenced), coming as they do from a more logocentric and monotheistic historical location. Eck cited the work of Jan Gonda (1969) and Stella Kramrisch (1976) on the Vedic and broader South Asian physiology of sight, as a process whereby sight goes forth from the eye and touches what is seen. Sight and vision are central to Indian ways of knowing, so she used the phrases "visual theology," "visual thought" and "visual scripture" in discussing the viewing of sacred icons. In this way icons can be instru- mental devices for concentration that moves beyond physical seeing.</page><page sequence="3">Situating Darsan / 3 They are also the site of "real embodiment" of the deity, as seen in an analysis of the consecration and subsequent ritual interaction with icons. Eck concluded the revised third edition of the book with an afterword on Hindu icons in their new geographical context of North America. Babb wrote, while making reference to Eck' s essay: "...Hindus wish to see their deities. This is, indeed, a fundamental part of what the wor- ship of a deity's image ( mürti ) is all about. At a minimum one goes to a temple to see, to have the darshan (sight) of, the deity housed within" (1981: 387; cf. 1986: 74-75). He then added, "...if it is clear that Hindus want to see their deities, there is another important point... Hindus want to be seen by their deities as well" (387; emphasis in original). Babb's discussion was based on fieldwork among two contemporary Hindu sectarian traditions, the Rädhäsoämls and the Brahma Kumäris, as well as an analysis of the popular 1975 film Jai Santoshi Ma. Whereas Eck focused solely on the auspicious aspects of darsan , Babb saw it as more polyvalent and even ambivalent. The auspicious compassionate glance of a living guru can be central to salvation, but the wrathful glance of a deity or guru can also be destructive. Babb expanded the field for under- standing darsan by also discussing the evil eye - usually known by the Persian-derived term najar or nazar in North India, but in the south significantly by the term disti , a cognate with darsan (Fuller 1992: 238). Babb applied a transactional analysis to darsan ,4 which allows us to see, at least in the two sectarian traditions he discussed, why darsan is so important: If seeing... is carried outward as flow, then what the gazing devotee is receiving, at least by implication, is an actual exteriorized visual awareness, one that is superior to his own. This means that quite apart from its more general benefit-bestowing characteristics, darshan has important... soteriological implications, for by interacting visually with a superior being one is, in effect, taking into oneself a superior way of seeing, and thus a superior way of knowing. Given the premises of the system, this makes available to the devotee the symbolic basis for an apprehension of himself as transformed. Since he himself is an object of his lord's seeing, by mingling this seeing with his own he can par- ticipate in a new way of seeing, and thus of knowing, himself (1981: 397; emphasis in original).</page><page sequence="4">4 / John E. Cort Another scholar who has taken darsan in its religious setting beyond Eck's formulation is Alfred Gell (1998: 1 16-21). He brought a discussion of darsan into his larger, cross-cultural theory of the active agency of 'art' objects (and by extension, any object that is the focus of a gaze). Gell also explored the mutual transaction involved in darsan, with the insight that darían therefore has much in common with prasäd. This is the food that a worshipper offers to a deity (whether in iconic or humanly embodied form) and then receives back and ingests, thereby effecting a beneficial and even salvific transformation of his or her innermost being.5 What most interested Gell, however, was not the possibility of darsan of and from a living holy person, but darían of and from an inert stone or metal icon.6 Darsan is an example of his broader theory of how inert objects become active agents. "Eye-contact," Gell argued, "seems to give direct access to other minds because the subject sees herself as an object, from the point of view of the other as a subject" ( 1 20). In darsan the devotee simultaneously sees the icon and sees him or herself being seen by the icon. The result, Gell said, "is a kind of optical oscillation in which idol's and devotee's perspectives shift back and forth with such rapidity that interpersonal boundaries are effaced and 'union' is achieved" (120). While the work of Gell and especially Babb has been cited by other scholars of South Asian religion, a third study that advances and compli- cates our understanding of darsan has received scant attention, perhaps because it is found in the context of media studies, rather than religious studies. Sophie Hawkins (1999) engaged in an important re-thinking of darsan in her study of the ways that darsan has changed in the transition of images of Sathya Sai Baba from older forms of portraiture (chromo- lithograph posters and photographs) through video to the internet. She picked up on an aspect of Eck's argument overlooked by most other scholars, the co-evality of seeing and touching, of darían and sparsan (Hawkins 1999: 143, quoting Eck 1985: 9), but then criticized the pairing of the two and the resultant "physicalization of darshan" as "a romanti- cized interpretation of the cultural specificity of darshan." She observed that for devotees of Sathya Sai Baba, his physical presence is necessary for darsan. If darsan occurs over the internet - what she termed "a qualified darshan of physical absence" - the mutuality is missing, and therefore "the represented figure of Sai Baba does not confer the energy</page><page sequence="5">Situating Darsan / 5 that his actual gaze would" (143).7 As mediated by the internet, darsan is transformed from a powerful two-directional visual interaction to a one- directional act of memory (147-48). Hawkins concluded that an undue emphasis on darsan as the central act in Hindu devotion misses the equal importance of other sensory interactions: "to posit a theory of the ocular- centricity of popular religious practice, or indeed of the aesthetic naiveté that darshan is often reduced to, would only serve to misguidedly privilege visuality in an arena where orality and tangibility are just as formative" (148). Hawkins's criticisms of a too simple theory of darsan were picked up and amplified by Christiane Brosius (2005: 108; Brosius was co-editor of the volume in which Hawkins's essay appeared). Brosius criticized Eck and Gell for limiting darsan to the 'seeing and being seen' relationship, and suggested that we place the act of darsan within political and other power relationships. Brosius invoked Michel Foucault' s (1979: 195-228) discussion of the panopticon, the device originally devised for prisons by Jeremy Bentham that would enable the all-powerful and all-seeing jailer to see every prisoner at all times, while the prisoners themselves would be isolated from one another and thereby visually disempowered. In contemporary religio-political settings, argued Brosius, darsan simulta- neously enforces visual connectedness between viewer and object and exerts control over ways of seeing. Most scholarship on South Asian religion and visuality, however, has simply repeated the 'seeing and being seen' formula, and usually cites only Eck' s monograph.8 We can see how this formula has now become apparently canonical in scholarship by turning to the discussion of darsan in some of the recent standard introductions to Hinduism. C.J. Fuller's The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India (1992) remains the best ethnographically based introductory monograph to Hinduism as lived practice. Fuller repeated the basic formula: "When Hindus visit a temple, just gazing on the images for a 'sight' or 'vision' {darshana) of the deities is one of the most important things they do.... But darshana is not merely a passive sight of the deity in its image form; the deity is also gazing on the devotee with eyes that never blink" (59- 60).9 It would be possible to cite many similar examples.10 The lack of subsequent theorization of darsan is even more striking when one turns to standard introductions to Hindu and South Asian art</page><page sequence="6">6 / John E. Cort history. Given the centrality of the concept of the 'gaze' in art history for the past several decades, one would expect art historians to engage in an extensive analysis of darsan when introducing South Asian art, archi- tecture and visual culture. This has not been the case. Several standard introductory texts make no reference to Eck' s volume, or any other scholarship on darsan, even if they discuss the concept in passing." Of the introductory studies I have surveyed, only two accurately describe Eck' s characterization of darían as involving being seen by the deity as much as seeing it, and only one cites any of the sources on darsan other than Eck.12 There is much of great value in Eck's short book, as well as the discus- sions of Babb, Gell and others. I continue to refer to all of them in my writing and to use them in my classes. However, nearly three decades after the first publication of Eck's book, it is time to move beyond this simple definition of darêan as seeing and being seen by the deity who is incarnate in the image. A strength of Darsan lies in its phenomenological approach, by which it aims to provide a sweeping overview of the ritual under discussion. This is also, I argue, its major weakness, as it lumps together practices and theories from many centuries, from all parts of India and from a wide variety of sectarian, theological and philosophical perspectives into what we can call a single 'darían experience.' Scholars have continued to echo Eck, and unproblematically join many practices, experiences and theologies together into a single experience by which the devotee and the image see each other in a form of mutual ocularity. Eck's monograph was originally written in conjunction with a series of handbooks on audio-visual resources for the teaching of religion at the college level. In particular, her book was conceived as an adjunct to Focus on Hinduism (McDermott with Dell 1981), an annotated guide to films, videotapes, slides, filmstrips and recordings. Nearly three decades later, the range of media from 1 98 1 reads as almost quaint, since they mostly involve technologies that are no longer supported by the technical services departments of American colleges and universities. The dramatic expan- sion of media used in both teaching and as sites for research is seen in a collection of essays from a decade-and-a-half later, Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia (Babb and Wadley 1995). In addition to two essays on aural culture, this path-breaking collection included essays on 'god posters,' comic books, commercial films, a</page><page sequence="7">Situating Darsan / 7 television series and video-taped sermons. The subsequent decade-and-a- half has seen a further expansion of ocular media that are included in studies of South Asian religion and culture. The Fourteenth Biennial Symposium of the American Council of Southern Asian Art was held at Denison University in October 2009 in conjunction with a conference entitled "New Darshans: Seeing Southern Asian Religiosity and Visuality across Disciplines."13 Papers at the joint conference extended an analysis of South Asian visuality into a wide range of media that are too little con- sidered in discussions of darsan : textile banners, town planning, museums, landscape, shoes, cinema, VCDs, the web, calendar prints, comic books, newspaper editorial cartoons, and dance. What I found disappointing was that none of the nearly three dozen papers at the New Darshans conference explicitly attempted to problem- atize the model of a straightforward mutual gaze between worshipper and icon that is found in Darsan and has been repeated and referenced dozens of times in the ensuing decades. Nor have any of the many books and articles published in recent years, publications that have otherwise done so much to extend our understanding of visuality in South Asia, revisited the basic assumptions and conclusions of Darsan}4 Revisiting and Re-Theorizing Darsan I argue that it is time for studies of visual experience of and practice with icons in (and from) South Asia properly to frame or contextualize - or, to use the language of this paper, situate - that interaction.15 Studies of South Asian visual culture outside of ritual locations in the past several decades have greatly enhanced our understanding of visual practices and ideolo- gies, and have moved analysis well beyond that originally presented by Eck. A necessary next step is to bring these fruitful recent studies to bear on a re-theorization of darsan in its religious settings. Outside of specifi- cally religious settings, scholars have advanced complex, multiple theories of visuality in South Asia, as a result of which we can now see that darsan encompasses a wide array of practices in South Asia; but this extensive theorization has not led scholars of South Asian religions to adequately revisit this super-category within their field of study.16 I am not alone in saying that it is time for scholarship on South Asia to engage in a more nuanced 'reading' (and seeing) of the concept of darsan .</page><page sequence="8">8 / John E. Cort In his Thus Have I Seen : Visualizing Faith in Early Indian Buddhism (2009), Andy Rotman wrote, after invoking Gonda (1969), Babb (1981) and Eck (1985): In light of more recent scholarship by anthropologists and art historians, as well as scholars of film, photography, colonialism, and nationalism, it is clear that vision and visual systems in South Asia, both past and present, are diverse; that they are socially and culturally constructed; and that they influence what one sees, what one believes, and what one does.17 While South Asia's visual systems share many common traits, the logic and practice of specific visual systems have yet to be worked out on an individual basis (5). Rotman then proceeded to an exquisitely detailed analysis of visual prac- tice in early South Asian Buddhism on the basis of a close reading of the Divyävadäna, a Buddhist Sanskrit narrative text dating from the early centuries CE. Another call for a re-theorizing of darsan has come from Richard H. Davis. In a short response on the strengths and problems in the emerging concepts of visual culture and material culture that was solicited by the editors of Material Religion , he wrote of Darsan , "this short work sorely needs to be supplanted by deeper explorations of the subject" (2009: 362). A third voice is that of Cynthia Packert. Her book, The Art of Loving Krishna (2010), is an exquisite study of the practice of ornamentation of Krsna images in select temples in Vrindaban and Jaipur. Although she makes the standard nod to Darsan , describing it as "The classic reference work on seeing" (210n25), her book in practice comprises an extended argument for the need to see darsan in much more manifold and complex ways. Darsan rarely involves a 'naked' image. Rather, the sacred image is almost always ornamented to enhance its beauty and attractiveness (see also Cort 2007; Waghorne 1992). Packert wrote: ...perhaps so much has been made of darshari s unique potency that the customary fixation on the process of looking has blinded us to other things. In presenting darshan as a directed activity - as a light- ning bolt of super-charged vision - one important aspect of the trans- action is consistently overlooked: what the devotee is looking at - the</page><page sequence="9">Situating Darsan / 9 object of all this looking - is rarely discussed.... From my experience in the Krishna temples I discuss in this book (and, I would suggest, in many other temples), how the deity looks is as important to the experi- ence of darshan as the act of looking itself. The almost exclusive focus on darshan as a singular, definitive moment of religious transaction thus neglects the other kinds of looking going on: the appreciating, all- over kind of looking that savors the details of the body, surface, and environment of the god. ..(2010: 13; emphasis in original).18 Finally, James McHugh (201 1) has recently observed that while "in many Hindu philosophies seeing is understood to involve physical contact, nevertheless this is not the case in Jain and Buddhist philosophies." He continued: "If seeing as contact is to be considered in an analysis of the Hindu context of darían, then arguably indigenous theories of seeing as not involving contact should be considered in these other religious contexts" (170n45). As I discuss below, the north Indian Digambar Jain understanding of darsan is precisely one in which seeing and being seen, and thereby being visually touched by the deity, is not the underlying theory. Taking my lead from the exhortations of Rotman, Davis, Packert and McHugh, let me now turn to a Jain example of what we can call 'situated darsan.' A few visual examples will suffice to indicate how the visual presentation of Jina icons themselves should alert us to some of the ways that Jains experience darsan in very different ways in terms of sectarian and geographical variations. Jain Darsan South Asian cultural practice traditionally emphasizes three frames of context for analyzing any gift exchange ( däna ): the place ( desa ), the time (kâla), and the person or people (pätra ) (Madan 1987: 48-72). This can fruitfully be expanded as a general tripartite hermeneutical tool for ana- lyzing ritual in South Asia. In the case of darsan, it calls on us to pay close attention, at a minimum, to the shaping roles of regional differences, historical differences, and sectarian differences.19 My first example is sectarian. When one goes to a Svetämbar temple for evening darsan, or darsan earlier in the day on a special ritual occa-</page><page sequence="10">10 / John E. Cort sion, one sees an elaborately ornamented icon. It is covered with a metal sheath, onto which pastes, colored powders and flowers have been affixed in a riot of colors. The icon is crowned as a king. The ornamentation is intended to attract the viewer's attention; it should be äkarsak, "attractive." Further, the icon itself usually has overly large glass or enamel eyes affixed to it, which serve further to draw the viewer into the sense that he or she is being seen by the icon as much as he or she is seeing it.20 Illustration 1 : Ornamented Svetämbar Jina Icon21 Patan, Gujarat, 1 996</page><page sequence="11">Situating Darían / 11 When one goes to a Digambar temple, on the other hand, one views an unornamented icon. While the stone or metal icon may be very attractive in its own right, and the temple as a whole may be richly ornamented with carvings, paint and gilding, there is no attempt to augment the attrac- tiveness of the icon through the use of external ornamentation. Nor are external eyes affixed to the icon.22 On occasions when I have visited both ávetambar and Digambar temples in quick succession for darían, the striking differences in the experience are quite palpable.23 Illustration 2: Unornamented Digambar Jina Icon Jaipur, Rajasthan, 201 1</page><page sequence="12">12 / John E. Cort My other example is regional. When one visits a north Indian Digambar temple for darían, one has to look up to view the icon. (This is also the case in Svetämbar temples.) After years of darían in North India, I was therefore startled the first time I visited Jain temples in Karnataka in 1999, and in many cases had to look down to see the icon. This difference is largely related to the much greater importance placed on lustration ( abhisek ) in the south (Cort 2001b), but it also results in a very different darían experience. Once again, the difference is palpable, reminding me, at least, of the value of bodily and sensory responses in fieldwork and analysis.

One scholar even goes so far as to say, "darshan... allows the devotee to relate to the deity... only through vision" (Brown 2009: 72). But darsan is rarely if ever an experience confined to the single sense of sight. It is, in the words of James McHugh (2011), "intersensorial." In many settings, there are flowers, perfumes and incense in the temple.24 The worshipper might receive and ingest either food offerings or water as prasäd.25 Touching the icon is restricted in many</page><page sequence="14">14 / John E. Cort South Asian ritual traditions, but there might be the feel of the cool stone of the temple floor under one's bare feet or as one prostrates before the icon. Finally darsan is rarely silent.. As Philip Lutgendorf has recently written: "Hindu devotees are seldom 'mute' during darsan' they pray, sing, petition, and express highly individual behavior" (2006: 234).26 While each person may choose his or her own hymn to sing (except in communal rituals, especially äratl , when the assembled congregation waves a flaming lamp in front of the icon and together sings a well- known äratl hymn), there are some hymns that we can identify as the most popular and widely sung. My methodological argument here is that hymns allow us access to a level of experience on the part of the worshipper that can be more spon- taneous and less ideologically mediated than many other sources.27 These hymns have been memorized by hundreds of thousands of Jains over the past several decades, and sung by them alone in household shrines and temples as well as collectively in congregational rituals.28 The term for 'memorized' in Hindi is kanthasth , literally "(firmly) located in the throat." Something that is memorized informs all utterances that pass through this metaphorical membrane of meaning located in the passage between inside and outside. In conversations with Jains on a wide array of topics, my queries about doctrinal matters have often been answered by a snatch of a hymn that spontaneously came to my informant as authoritative, yet seemingly unauthored, wisdom. In an earlier age, our European and North American forebears understood the world through extensive memorized passages from the Bible or Shakespeare, just as my students understand the world through memorized pop songs (and my own understanding of the world is mediated by passages from Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah band and other musical greats of the 1960s that are permanently inscribed on my tongue, in my throat and so in my memory). Scholars and practitioners in a wide range of fields, from music to biology to physiology, have discussed the concept of "muscular memory" or "muscle memory."29 The contemporary music teacher Eli Epstein describes it as follows: When we practice, we are developing muscular memory. Our bodies have all sorts of muscular memory. When we brush our teeth, pick up</page><page sequence="15">Situating Darsan / 15 food with a fork, and tie our shoes, our bodies draw on hundreds of muscularly remembered tasks.30... Muscular memory gives us the ability to let go in a performance, let our bodies do what we have taught them so well (2009: 50). The concept is sufficiently well-known among professional performers that it needs little explication (see, for example, Kayes 2000, Wilson 1986, among many others). The phrase itself goes back among music instructors to at least the late nineteenth century. On December 12, 1899, at the 26th session of the Musical Association, a British professional society, W.G. McNaught delivered a paper entitled "The Psychology of Sight-Singing," in which he referred to "the memory of muscular tension" (1899-1900: 48). The power of this memory can be so strong, said McNaught that it can result in "embarrassing" situations, when a singer's throat muscles "remember" a song in a different key from the one printed in the sheet music from which he or she is performing. One of the discussants of McNaught' s paper, a Dr. Shinn, expanded upon this concept as follows: With regard to the muscular memory referred to by the lecturer, this seems to coincide with the same form of memory employed by the pianist, and other instrumentalists, and commonly, though incorrectly, described as "finger memory." By frequent repetition one gradually acquires the power of performing a series of movements automatically. This power of automatic movement, due to mere sensory stimulation, has been known to have continued after the individual has become unconscious, as has been exemplified by a reporter in the gallery of the House of Commons who continued to take down a speech after he had fallen asleep (1899-1900: 53-54). Dr. Shinn was Frederick G. Shinn, an Associate of the Royal College of Music and a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists. Just a year earlier, in November 1898, he had published a small monograph entitled Musical Memory and Its Cultivation (Shinn 1 898). In his Preface he wrote, "as far as the author has been able to discover, no literature exists" on this subject, so he may be the person who first introduced the concept of "muscular memory" into print.</page><page sequence="16">16 / John E. Cort Shinn however applied the concept to piano playing, whereas McNaught's discussion of muscular memory in singing is more germane to my use of the Digambar pads to analyze darsan. Even McNaught was interested only in the way a singer's muscles remember musical features such as pitch, intervals, and key. He did not discuss the memory of lyrics. I would add, though, that in the case of a musical genre with words such as the pad (or hymn, the genre I use to translate pad), the lyrics cannot easily be detached from the musical form, and so the lyrics are equally embedded in the muscular memory. One of my Digambar Jain informants reported a similar situation to Shinn' s sleeping political reporter. For many years her elderly father had been devoted to studying and singing the pads of the Hindi poets which are at the center of my discussion. When I interviewed her, he had recently suffered a major stroke and could no longer walk or speak. She asserted that he did, however, spend much of his time humming his beloved pads. The memory of the pads was indeed kanthasth, located in his throat. Davis has also advocated using the texts of hymns to interpret the expe- rience of seeing South Indian Hindu icons. He cited the scholarship and translations on South Indian devotion by Indira Viswanathan Peterson, Steven P. Hopkins and Blake Wentworth. Davis pointed "to texts, par- ticularly devotional poetry, as a rich source for reimagining the religious expectations and desires of those contemporary audiences to whom the icons were originally displayed" (2009: 362). While Peterson explicitly referenced neither the concept of darsan nor the scholarship on it, she described how the sixth- to eighth-century Tamil Saiva hymns "focus on the person and nature of Siva as the poets... visualize them" (1989: 95). This vision was mediated by temple icons ( mürtis ) of Siva, and in turn the hymns have for the past millennium been sung in the temple as part of the worship of Siva in his iconic form. Hopkins (2002, 2007) has provided us with a detailed analysis of the hymns in Tamil, Sanskrit, and Prakrit of the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Tamil Srivaisnava poet and theologian Vedäntadesika. Vedäntadesika was also trained in formal aesthetics, and so for him " 'holy seeing' (&lt; darsana ) - seeing and being seen by God - is the experience of a beauty... that saves; for Desika, what we might term the 'aesthetic' and 'religious' mutually inhere in the vision of the body of God, both on a theoretical and on an experiential level"</page><page sequence="17">Situating Darsan / 17 (2002: 9, emphasis in original; cf. 2007: 7). The studies by Peterson and Hopkins of these hymns that were composed to be sung while gazing on a temple icon, and which have been sung in such a setting for centuries, give us valuable insight into two specific darsan experiences and take us beyond the more generalized use of darsan that permeates most scholar- ship. Davis could also have cited his own scholarship (1997: 37-44, 2006). He has analyzed the devotional hymns in Tamil of the Vaisnava and Saiva poet-saints that "were made an integral part of south Indian temple liturgy" in the tenth and eleventh centuries (1997: 38). He went on to say: "The poetry [what I am calling hymns] of these devotional saints both reflected and modeled a specific, influential way of looking at images and icons of Visnu and Siva in their medieval south Indian temples" (38). In an article on the mode of seeing the icon advocated by the seventh- or eighth-century Saiva poet Appar, Davis wrote that Appar "stresses both the localized presence of God within the icon, and the icon's translucent revelation of God's wholeness. Through the icon, the devotional eye is led beyond it to... broader vistas of divine presence, in the multiplicity of Siva's manifestation, his manifold deeds on earth and his ultimate tran- scendence" (2006: 88). This combination of divine immanence and tran- scendence, whereby through the icon the worshipper simultaneously sees God as fully present in the icon and is led beyond the icon to other aspects of divinity, is a distinctly medieval Tamil Saiva mode of seeing, which also shares much with other South Asian visual traditions. But this is not a simple 'seeing and being seen' mode of darsan . In many ways, a close reading of Davis's analysis of Appar's poems problematizes the consensus on darsan as mutual ocularity. While God is present in the icon, and due to His omnipotent, omniscient and omnivisual nature, can obviously see the devotee, this is not what the poems focus on. Instead, darsan in this specific devotional setting, much as it is for the devotees of Sathya Sai Baba discussed by Hawkins (1999: 148) who gaze upon his image in posters or on the internet, is much more of a one-way experience, in which the devotee's gaze upon the icon becomes a vehicle by which that gaze is directed beyond the icon. But whereas for the devotees of Sathya Sai Baba the act of darsan involves a sensory memory of a past transfor- mative experience, for Appar and the devotees of Siva it involves a present experience of something that in the end is suprasensory .</page><page sequence="18">18 / John E. Cort This use of hymns to understand the experience of darsan of an icon has also been fruitfully employed by Phyllis Granoff (1993, 2001), who has used medieval Jain hymns in Sanskrit and Prakrit to analyze medieval Jain and Hindu darsan experience of icons. An analysis of the Digambar Jain Hindi pads , therefore, allows an entrance into seeing what I call (borrowing from Michael Baxandall [1988] and Richard Davis [1997: 37, 2006]) a 'devotional eye' or 'devotional gaze' of Digambar Jains in North India in the past several centuries - a location of darsan that is specific in terms of place, time and sect.31 The Digambar Performance of Darsan In the remainder of this essay, I provide a case study of what can happen to our interpretive frames when we 'situate darsan .' I analyze the north Indian Digambar experience of darsan using two different literary genres. The first consists of modern manuals that state the proper way to perform the ritual of darsan . These are obviously ideological, prescriptive sources, which largely inform us of what Digambar ideologues say that the inten- tion and experience of darsan should be. These manuals are, however, found in many households, and their often well-thumbed condition indi- cates that they are read.32 They are inexpensive, mass-produced booklets, indicating that through them we are approaching darsan in what we can call a post-Gutenberg experience of visuality. My other sources are the three most popular vernacular hymns employed in the ritual of taking darsan of a Jina icon in a temple or home shrine. Each of these hymns, by Bhüdhardäs (fl . 1724-1749), Budhjan (fl . 1 778- 1838) and Daulaträm ( d . 1866), is known as Darsan Path (Darsan Reci- tation). They are found in dozens of locally published hymnals, and known by heart by thousands of Jains who sing them on a daily basis.33 While these also come originally from the pens (and voices) of knowledgeable ideologues, I argue that through the operation of muscular memory, they allow us some insight into the actual experience of darsan . As Cynthia Packert has argued: "Poetry has long fueled visualizations of divinity, and it serves as an active partner to the darshan experience" (2010: 13). Digambar Jains most often go to a temple for darsan in the morning. The other popular time for darsan is in the early evening, although far fewer people go to the temple then. Darsan may be a stand-alone ritual,</page><page sequence="19">Situating Darsan / 19 or it may be part of a larger ritual (püjä ) involving the offering of physical objects, either on the altar before the icon or, if the worshipper is seated on the floor, into a metal tray. In general verbal usage, however, darsan and püjä frequently blend into one another. The performance of püjä also involves the singing of additional hymns in Sanskrit or the vernacular. There is no prescribed set of hymns to be sung, and so each worshipper can personalize his or her ritual performance. Illustration 5: North Indian Digambar Jina Icons on Altar Jaipur, Rajasthan, 201 1 Most Digambar temples have multiple altars so that many people can perform their individual rituals at the same time without unduly disturbing each other. Each altar has multiple icons: standing and seated stone and metal icons of Jinas, metal yantras (sacred diagrams), five cone-shaped objects that embody the five Mount Meras of Jain cosmography, and perhaps also stone and metal icons of other, non-liberated deities.34 The altars are also found in multiple rooms of the temple and in some cases on the temple veranda as well, which further allows the undisturbed</page><page sequence="20">20 / John E. Cort performance of rituals. Most altars are built into a wall, but some that enthrone the more important and beloved icons of the temple, including the main icon (mül näyak , literally "root Lord") after whom the temple is sometimes known, will be placed in the center of a room so that worship- pers can circumambulate it. People may perform darsan of just the icons on the main altar or more likely focus on the main altar but then quickly perform darsan of all the other icons in the temple as well. Darsan in the Manuals I base my discussion of the prescription for darsan on two Hindi booklets I have purchased in recent years from shops that sell religious literature to Digambar Jains in Delhi and Jaipur.35 Dainik Jain Dharm-Caryä (Daily Jain Religious Practice) was originally published in 1955; I have a copy of the sixteenth printing, from 1997. The author, the late Pandit Ajlt Kumär Sästri was, as his two titles {pandit , Sästri) indicate, a lay intellec- tual. He also served as the editor of Jain Gazat (Gazette), an important north Indian Digambar magazine that is published from Delhi. The pub- lisher writes that its books are sold in Delhi, Songiri, Mahavirji, Tijara (Alwar), Surat, Sagar, and Bombay - in other words, in a suitably repre- sentative range of Digambar population and pilgrimage centers in northern and western India. The other book, Jinendra Darsan : Jinendra Püjan (Seeing the Jina- King, Worshipping the Jina-King), is more recent, published in 1993. Its author is a Digambar monk, Äcärya Virägsägar. While Svetämbar monks have been writing such vernacular 'how to' pamphlets for a century, this is a recent practice among Digambar monks. It is only in recent decades that there have come to be a number of monks who hail from North India and who take dlksä (initiation into monkhood) at a younger age and so follow a career path of becoming the gurus to the urban Jains of North India, the Jain equivalents to the gurus for urban middle-class Hindus studied by Lawrence A. Babb in his Redemptive Encounters (1986). Earlier in the twentieth century, Digambar monks tended to come from South India, to be initiated later in life, and to focus largely on their own individual path toward salvation. They did not serve extensively as gurus for large lay followings, and as a result were much less involved with writing for the edification of the laity. Michael Carrithers wrote that as of</page><page sequence="21">Situating Darsan / 21 the 1980s many Digambar monks had only a rudimentary education and only a minority were "reasonably well educated in both religious and secular terms" (1989: 224). There has been a noticeable demographic shift in Digambar mendicancy in the two decades since Carrithers wrote, with more monks coming from North India and more taking initiation at both a younger age and a higher level of education; nonetheless, it is still the case that Digambar monks on the whole are not as engaged in literary activities as their Svetämbar counterparts. While the distribution for Virägsägar's booklet is not indicated, it was published by the bookstore located next door to Läl Mandir (also known as Urdu Mandir, or Fort Temple, since it is located near the Red Fort, and was patronized by Jain officers in the Mughal army and other officials in the Mughal administra- tion) in Chandni Chowk in Delhi. Pilgrims from all over India visit this temple. The prescription for darsan is largely the same in the two booklets.36 While it is expanded in these modern sources, the prescription goes back in its basic form to medieval manuals of lay practice ( srävakäcära ). The most authoritative of these for Digambars is Pandita Äsädhara' s Sanskrit Sägäradharmämrta (Nectar of the Householder's Dharma), which he finished in 1240.37 In common with the modern authors, Äsädhara and the other medieval authors described darían as the first stage in the per- formance of püjä. They do not describe darsan as a separate and distinct ritual, in contrast to much academic understanding of darsan. (In contem- porary practice, however, many Digambar Jains do perform darsan with- out moving on to püjä and abhisek. Darían is often performed quickly, while püjä and abhisek require more time and a stricter observance of ritual purity.) Äsädhara enjoined the worshipper to enter the temple and thrice circumambulate the icon on the altar while reciting a hymn ( stuti ) that would cause the influx of meritorious karma (punya). While doing so, the worshipper was to imagine that the temple was actually the Jina's samavasarana (universal preaching hall), that the icon was actually the Jina himself preaching, and that he or she and the other worshippers were actually the assembly listening to the sermon (Äsädhara 1976: 63; Sägära- dharmämrta 6.9-10). Äsädhara then instructed the worshipper to continue with the rest of the performance of püjä. According to the older of the two modern sources (Ajlt Kumar 1997: 60-63), the worshipper should stand in front of the icon holding pure,</page><page sequence="22">22 / John E. Cort unbroken grains of rice in his or her hand, and with great humility recite first the Namaskär Mantra and then a hymn.38 The term Ajlt Kumär uses for humility is vinaya , to which I will return when I analyze the darsan recitation texts. Following the recitation, the worshipper is to prostrate in veneration of the icon. The worshipper then folds his or her hands before her in salutation and thrice slowly circumambulates the altar of the icon, reciting a Sanskrit or Hindi hymn while doing so. This is followed by another prostration. The author admonishes the worshipper to keep several things in mind. He or she should keep his or her gaze fixed on the icon while circumam- bulating it. He or she should be so absorbed ( nimagna ) that nothing else can disturb the worshipper's conjoined focus of mind, speech, and body. Further, he or she should aspire for the dispassion ( viträgtä ) demonstrated by the icon to arise in his or her own soul and to be able to renounce all the glories of the illusory world of samsär in the same manner that the Jina ignores the royal symbols that surround him on the altar. The author then instructed the worshipper to perform ablution ( abhisek ) on the icon. Äcärya Virägsägar (1993: 3-20) devotes much more attention to a discussion of the meaning of the various actions within darsan . This concern for the 'meaning' of Jain ritual, and that the worshipper should, in the words of Caroline Humphrey and James Laidlaw (1994: 21 1-26), "mean to mean it," is characteristic of the writings and sermons of many modern Jain exegetes on ritual. They are writing for an increasingly modernized and globalized audience, for whom Protestantized forms of religiosity - in which intention and therefore meaning are central - have become the norm. The booklets themselves, as well as modern styles such as televised sermons by mendicants, have contributed to this new emphasis on 'meaning.' Virägsägar adds to Ajït Kumär's prescription that upon entering the temple the worshipper should thrice ring the temple bell. He specifies that the worshipper should first recite the Darsan Path of Budhjan. He also adds the interesting feature that the worshipper should recite this hymn with his or her eyes closed. While Virägsägar does not use this formula, one often finds in writings, sermons and conversation that Jains prioritize inner spiritual sight over external physical sight, in line with the Jain dualistic valuation of the soul and devaluation of the body and senses. 'Real darsan ,' according to this</page><page sequence="23">Situating Dar s an / 23 interpretation, is inward, not outward. The hymns themselves provide a sufficient prompt for this spiritual vision. Nonetheless, it is striking that for this Digambar author, a key element of the performance of darían actually involves the very negation of the visual act. Darsan in the Darsan Hymns All three of our authors, one medieval and two modern, instruct the person performing darsan to sing a suitable hymn as part of the ritual. Only Virägsägar recommends a specific hymn, by Budhjan, and provides the text. Fieldwork in temples, and looking at the hymnals that are ubiqui- tously found in north Indian Digambar temples, however, allow us to identify which hymns are most commonly in use today. The presence of hymnals in the temple for the use of worshippers is a distinctly north Indian practice. The well-worn condition of many of them indicates that these hymnals are widely used.39 Let me therefore tum to the texts of the three hymns that thousands of north Indian Digambar Jains recite daily as part of darsan. Each is known as Darían Päth, or "Darsan Recitation." These are not the only hymns that people recite during darsan. Many of the hymnals include other darsan hymns.40 There is an anonymous thirteen-verse hymn in very simple - and probably not very old - Sanskrit.41 While it is found in many hymnals, no one with whom I have spoken has of his or her own accord indicated that it is regularly recited. Some hymnals also include a four-verse Darsan Stuti in Modern Standard Hindi by Amarcand.42 The three hymns that I discuss - all of them in older, pre-Modern Standard forms of Hindi - are the most widely published, and also the ones most commonly found in practice among Digambar Jains in Jaipur, where I conducted fieldwork.43 The earliest of the three authors was Bhüdhardäs. He lived in Agra in the first half of the eighteenth century.44 He was both a poet and a pandit (that is, a layman who was adequately versed in the orthodox Digambar literature in Sanskrit). He regularly gave sermons at the Syähganj temple in Agra. He composed at least eighty-five independent pads, a Pärsva Purän, which he finished in 1732, and a Jin Satak, a collection of 107 verses in various metrical genres. He wrote in the literary Hindi of his time, what we now call Braj-bhäsä.</page><page sequence="24">24 / John E. Cort Budhjan was active in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and first third of the nineteenth.45- He lived in Jaipur, where he was a member of the small, local Gumän Panth, a strict style within the Digambar Terä- panth. He worked for one of the Jain dîvâns (ministers) in the Jaipur royal court. He must have been a fairly successful businessman, as he commissioned a temple to Candraprabh, which was consecrated in 1807. He composed more than 250 pads, and wrote and translated a number of other texts. He wrote largely in the Dhundäri-bhäsä that is the local ver- nacular of the Jaipur region. The last of the three was Daulaträm. He lived in the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century.46 He was born in a village near Aligarh, lived for many years in Mathura, and then in Lashkar, near Gwalior. He undertook the ritual of willed death known as samädhi maran in Delhi in 1 866. He was the author of one of the most influential vernacular Digambar texts of the nineteenth century, the ninety-five verse Chahadhälä, which is still read by many Digambar Jains today as a fundamental primer of Jain doctrine.47 His Daulat Viläs collects his 124 pads. His language is Braj- bhäsä, mixed with Kharï-bolï. All three of the poets were trained in Sanskrit. They possibly knew some Prakrit as well, although most north Indian Digambar Jains in the period before the introduction of a more modern curriculum into the traditional schools relied largely on Sanskrit commentaries and trots to access Prakrit texts. All three of them wrote translations of earlier Sanskrit hymns, and their writings are peppered with tatsam linguistic forms (that is, forms directly from Sanskrit) and extensive technical vocabulary from Jain doctrine.48 The first thing that strikes anyone hearing or reading these hymns is that they are not detailed descriptions of Jina icons. One might expect a darsan recitation to involve a lovingly detailed description of the iconic body of the deity, as one finds in many ávetambar and Hindu darsan hymns. This is not because these three poets did not write hymns that described icons; in fact, all three of them, in common with almost all the hundreds of Hindi Digambar poets in the past several centuries, wrote a number of such hymns. Many of the hymns that describe icons - what we might have expected to be a Digambar darsan hymn - explicitly reference the seeing of the icon by beginning with an imperative verbal command for the singer to look. Bhüdhar, for example, wrote:</page><page sequence="25">Situating Darsan / 25 Look brother! The God who is pure soul is enthroned here. He reigns in this temple, three-and-a-half hands high, the very form of freedom.49 In a similar vein, Daulat wrote: Look, sir, at Ädlsvar Svâmï, at how he meditates. He is enthroned auspiciously, hands folded on his legs sitting firm in the [lotus] posture.50 Budhjan also wrote hymns devoted to the description of the Jina icon: I have seen your peaceful form - from that vision comes joy. Attached to neither inside nor outside, your gaze is fixed on the tip of your nose.51 There are very many more such examples. The Darsan Päth hymns are not totally devoid of references to icons. Daulat (verse 12) refers to the good fortune to have attained the darsan of the Jina, as does Budhjan (verse 4), although it is intentionally not clear if they refer to the Jina himself or an icon of him. Elision of the difference between deity and icon, between prototype and icon, or signifier and signified is common in many South Asian traditions of hymns to icons. Verse 5 of Budhjan' s hymn clearly describes an icon of the Jina, seated in meditation with eyes focused on the tip of the nose and surrounded by the attendant wondrous objects (prätihärya ).52 Description of icons, however, is not a dominant theme in these hymns. Another indication that the Digambar darsan päths are intended to be something different from the more widespread hymns describing icons is the lack of any reference to a specific Jina, such as we find in the verse I quoted from Daulat. Many darsan hymns in South Asia have been composed to be sung in front of a specific icon or deity. The darsan päth hymns, on the other hand, are addressed to the Jina as generic. The darsan päth is intended for a generalized, context-free dar§an experience, not the context-sensitive experience of a specific icon.</page><page sequence="26">26 / John E. Cort What, then, is the focus of a darsan päthl This is indicated by the alternate title for two of them. The hymns by BhQdhar and Budhjan are also called vinati. This is a widespread genre in the vernacular religious literature of North India, in non-Jain settings often known as vinaya. These are poems written in the first person, that display, as John Stratton Hawley describes them, "a personal, petitionary stance on the part of the poet" (2005: 236). Elsewhere Hawley describes them as "compositions... apart from any narrative context; songs in which [the poet] offers some combination of praise, petition, and self-remonstration" (1984: 121 ).53 F.R. Allchin gives a similar sense of these poems when he defines them as "prayers, supplications or petitions" (1966: 42). These poems are addressed not so much to a personalized form of the deity, but to the supreme lord of compassion who is also "the Lord of salvation" (Hawley 1984: 130). The standard meaning of vinati or vinaya in Hindi is 'humility,' but this term does not fully convey the spirit of a vinaya poem. While the poet in a vinati poem humbly recognizes his own shortcomings and failings, he more strongly emphasizes the drastic nature of those short- comings in a tone closer to self-abasement. As a result of his sense of being worthless and impotent, the poet has approached a superior lord for assistance - assistance which because of those very shortcomings the poet does not deserve. This, however, gives the lord the opportunity to show his grace and mercy by bestowing spiritual and material favors on his unworthy supplicant. As Hawley describes the portrait of the sixteenth-century Hindu poet Sürdäs that emerges in his vinaya poems, the poet is a worthless sinner and the God to whom he addresses his poems is "the Lord of sinners" (1984: 148). According to the hymnists, this is the attitude with which the Jain wor- shipper should approach the icon of the Jina and recite or sing a darsan path , and therefore, is the interior experience a Digambar Jain should have in the presence of the icon. I argue - and many Jains have indicated as much in conversation - that the normative intention of these hymns, through the operation of muscular memory, does indeed inform the expe- rience of many north Indian Digambar Jains as they stand before a Jina icon and engage in darsan. Bhudhar's twelve-verse hymn begins with a verse of praise to the mightiness of the Jina. He describes the Jina as the guru of the world</page><page sequence="27">Situating Darsan / 27 { jagat-guru ) and as a lord who is compassionate towards the poor (dïn- dayäl). In this the Jina presents a complex personality: he is at once a distant, magnificent lord and an active, compassionate one. He is, in the words of John Carman (1994), writing about Hindu, Christian and Buddhist conceptions of divinity, the simultaneous embodiment of majesty and mercy. These and other epithets for the Jina are shared with the other contemporaneous religious traditions of North India, but are then located within a distinctly Jain theological framework. In the first half of each foot of the initial verse, Bhüdhar addresses the Jina, while in the second half he expresses his own pitiable condition. His status is such that he must come to the Jina with a petition (araj), and in the final part of the verse he clarifies that he suffers in the round of rebirth ( maim dukhiyä samsärl). The bulk of the hymn then details his suffering. From beginningless time he has wandered in the forest of rebirth and experienced only pain, not joy (verse 2). The source of this suffering and wandering is karma , his mighty foe (verse 3). He has been reborn in all four realms of Jain cosmography, those of hell-beings, humans, gods and plants-and-animals, and thus has "danced the dance in many ways" (verse 4). He then intro- duces the matter of Jina' s wisdom into the picture. While Bhüdhar is subject to the workings of karma , the Jina in his omniscience knows all that has happened to the poet (verse 5). Bhüdhar in his suffering and limited human capacity cannot recount all his wrongdoings from even a single lifetime, but the Jina knows everything that he has done (verse 6). In a move that is common among north Indian bhakti poets of all tradi- tions, Bhüdhar then emphasizes his failings in order to underscore his own dependence upon God and to emphasize the grand compassion of a God who would deign to save such a flawed person. Bhüdhar characterizes himself as an orphan ( anäth ), a term with a strong resonance in Jainism, as the term -näth concludes the names of most of the Jinas (verse 7). Bhüdhar has done much that is unwise (verse 7). He has allowed his treasure of wisdom to be looted, and so has fallen into an impoverished state that is simultaneously spiritual and financial. He has allowed himself to become separated from the Jina (verse 8). He is stuck in the worldly dualities of merit and demerit, of good and bad, and thus become impris- oned in his imperfect body (verse 9).54 Through his misdeeds he has made many enemies in the world (verse 10).</page><page sequence="28">28 / John E. Cort By now the faults of Bhudhar - faults which the person performing darsan has acknowledged as his or her own through singing the hymn - have become manifest. In his despair he has come before the Jina to narrate his failings. He counts on the Jina as an all-knowing judge to be just to him (verse 11). He beseeches the Jina to free him from his bodily afflictions and to impel him to do what he should. Bhudhar expresses a vision of the Jina as compassionately active in the world when he says: "Free my body from these afflictions." At the same time, he affirms the orthodox Jain position that the Jina does nothing, and so the person himself or herself must take responsibility for his or her karmic condition, as only he or she can "do what is good." Bhudhar concludes his petition by urging the Jina not to delay in saving him. Budhjan' s shorter, eight- verse hymn follows a similar pattern to Bhudhar' s. In his first verse he expresses both his own inadequacies and the glory of the Jina, using an epithet - "purifier of the fallen" (patit pävari) - which is similar to Bhudhar's praise of the Jina for being compassionate towards the poor. Budhjan also describes the Jina' s simultaneous majesty and mercy, for he has come to gaze on the Jina' s glory ( virad) and to fall at his feet for shelter. Budhjan spends only two verses cataloguing his own shortcomings. Due to his ignorance, he has worshipped other gods, and so has not known his own soul. He has thus caused his own rebirth (verse 2). He also describes the braided noose of karma and rebirth, and using a meta- phor similar to one of Bhudhar's, tells how karma has stolen his wealth of knowledge (verse 3). Somehow or other, however, Budhjan has come to have darsan of the Jina in the temple (verse 4). This leads to a descrip- tion of the icon of the Jina in verse 5: The naked form of the dispassionate Lord is beautiful as he gazes intently on the tip of his nose. The accompanying wondrous objects are resplendent. You are joined with endless virtue, destroying [bad karma] like a million suns. He celebrates the fact that darsan of the Jina, of the Jina' s icon, destroys his wrong faith (mithyätva) and causes him great joy (verse 6). Budhjan then sings a description of the act of darsan , in which he joins his hands</page><page sequence="29">Situating Darsan / 29 and bows his head to the feet of the Jina, of the Jina's icon (verse 7). In his final verse he expresses a sentiment that is again widely shared with Hindu devotees. Instead of attaining liberation - which, in the Jain understanding, is the eternal and ultimate isolation (kaivalya) of the soul - he asks to be granted the boon of being able to continue to perform devotion to the Jina in future lives (verse 8). Daulaträm's longer, eighteen-verse darsan päth hymn follows a differ- ent pattern, with more description of the virtues of the Jina and less atten- tion given to his own failings. Daulat's hymn is less of a vinati hymn and more in the form of an extended praise of the Jina. This is indicated by its alternate designation in many hymnals as a mahgaläcaran, an auspi- cious benedictory hymn to be sung at the commencement of a ritual. He begins with a couplet ( dohä ) describing the Jina as omniscient, blissfully self-absorbed, ever victorious, and free of the various forms of karma . The next two verses are vocative praises of the Jina, in which the singer proclaims the victory (jay ) of the Jina and further enumerates his virtues: he is dispassionate, wise, all-knowing, incomparable, and peaceful (verses 2-3). The next five verses continue the catalogue of the Jina's virtues, adding up to a full description of the Jain definition of God. The Jina is supremely peaceful, virtuous, an ornament of the world, uninterrupted pure consciousness, supreme, incomparable, free of all faults, dwelling in the infinitudes (of knowledge, awareness, potential and bliss), and the only true savior. It is not until the ninth through eleventh verses that Daulat introduces a subjective note. He explains that in his karma- induced wandering in rebirth he forgot the Jina, that he is ignorant, and that he has lived in great suffering. In a verse reminiscent of Budhjan, he celebrates that he has now come for darsan of the Jina. Seeing the Jina, and the inner reflection that is prompted by singing the Darsan Päth in the presence of the Jina, gives him peace and an end to suffering (verse 12). The next three verses are the only ones in which Daulat makes requests. Like Budhjan, he asks to remain at the feet of the Jina. He asks to dwell absorbed in his own soul and to attain the three jewels of faith, knowledge and conduct. He asks the Jina to liberate him (verses 13-15). He again praises the Jina's virtues for two verses, here metaphorically describing the Jina as the peace-giving moon, curative milk and a boat to cross the ocean of suffer- ing and rebirth (verses 16-17). He concludes with a vefse in which he</page><page sequence="30">30 / John E. Cort expresses his own inadequacy and repeats that he praises the Jina (verse 18). Situating Darsan Neither the prescriptions for darsan found in the manuals for lay conduct, nor the hymns that thousands of north Indian Digambars sing daily during the performance of darsan , fit the oft-repeated descriptions of darsan that I cited at the beginning of this essay. It is not a case of mutual ocu- larity in which the worshipper sees and is seen by the icon. The sight of the icon provides the poet and then the worshipper with the impetus and means to focus on his or her karmic failings at the same time that he or she gazes upon the icon as the very embodiment of the perfections of the Jina. In none of the hymns is there a strong sense that the Jina 'sees' the worshipper. This is not to say that the icon is devoid of the presence of the Jina. I have written elsewhere (Cort 2006) of the ways in which Svetämbar icon installation rituals and hymns both clearly indicate the theological assump- tion that the Jina in some not fully specified way is present in the icon. The same is true in the case of the Digambars. Digambar icon consecra- tion rituals invoke the Jina to reside in the icon. This is repeated in the liturgies of almost every one of the longer püjä s performed by thousands of Jains on a daily basis. They commence with the invocation and estab- lishment of the Jina in the icon and then conclude by the ritual performer dismissing the Jina.55 The darsan päth hymns, however, do not focus on any such presence. Bhudhar asks the Jina to "hear my petition" ( suniyo araj hamârï), to "listen" ( suni ), to "free my body from these afflictions" (&lt; dustan dehu nikär ), and finally to "make me do what is good" (sädhun ko rakhi lïje). The tone of the poem makes it clear that Bhudhar assumes that the Jina can and will actively respond to his petition. The other two darsan päth hymns demonstrate similar attitudes and assumptions. But the Jina' s grace is not conveyed through a visual interaction. Darsan in the normative north Indian Digambar Jain setting involves the worshipper gazing upon an icon of the Jina, the Jain perfected religious ideal. This ideal is of complete, perfect dispassion ( viträgtä ) and absorp- tion in pure soul. As Budhjan describes in verse 5 of his hymn, and as the</page><page sequence="31">Situating Darsan / 3 1 other poets describe in other hymns, this ideal is visually depicted by the Jina seated in meditation. His gaze is not outward, interacting with that of the worshipper. Instead, it is focused on the tip of his nose, and so is situated inward on his own liberated soul. By not interacting visually with the worshipper, the Jina forces the worshipper to realize that his or her own karmic faults have led him or her to this situation of suffering. The north Indian Digambar Jain experience of darsan - which one author even advocates should happen with the eyes closed - is performed in front of the icon of the Jina and involves an acknowledgement of the visual form of the icon. The interaction between worshipper and icon, however, as informed by the Darsan Päths , is more a petitionary interior monologue that the worshipper addresses to the Jina, than it is a visual interaction.56 An analysis of these Digambar prescriptions and hymns shows us that darsan is more varied and complex in South Asian ritual and devotional cultures than the frequent simple invocations of 'seeing and being seen' would indicate. The visual examples I mentioned at the start of this essay, between ornamented Svetämbar icons and unornamented Digambar icons and between looking up at north Indian Digambar icons and down at south Indian Digambar icons, indicate that even within the Jain tradition there are different 4 darsan experiences.' If we expand our gaze beyond the Jain tradition, yet keep it focused just on three-dimensional icons, we can see that there are many, if not countless, darsan experiences in South Asia as mediated by place, time and person. I have already commented on the difference between orna- mented and unornamented icons; this distinction is found in various Hindu traditions as well. The distinction between icons with and without external eyes is also found in some Hindu traditions. There is the distinc- tion between icons that have identifiable iconographical markers (, saguna , säkära) and those devoid of such markers ( nirguna , niräkära ), between 'iconic' and 'aniconic' icons. When one engages in darsan is significant: most Jain and Hindu temples are open for darsan only in the morning and evening, not at midday; and the crowds of people coming for the more powerful and auspicious darsans on the first day of a month or year are much larger than on other days. Among iconic icons, there is the distinction between those that embody an anthropomorphic deity and those that embody non-anthropomorphic or theriomorphic deities. The</page><page sequence="32">32 / John E. Cort many Vaisnava, Saiva, Goddess and Buddhist schools all have their distinct theologies of the icon, and therefore theologies of the gaze. Icons are seen in temples, home shrines, and public spaces; these differences shape different darsan experiences. Whether an icon is a familiar one, seen daily or weekly, as opposed to an icon one has never seen before, is significant. Seeing an icon when one is alone, and can indulge in a pro- tracted gaze, is different from seeing an icon in the midst of a large crowd or as part of a 'speed darsan ' when one barely has time to register that an icon is even there. Distinctions among viewers such as gender, caste, class, age, education, and prior experience of icons are significant. If the viewer accompanies his or her gaze by singing a hymn, the language and other linguistic features of the hymn are important. Singing, as we have seen, is an act of 'muscular memory,' in which a form of embodied, almost pre-conscious memory informs the experience of seeing the icon. Singing a darsan hymn in a 'father tongue' such as classical Sanskrit, Prakrit or Tamil is different from singing a hymn in a 'mother tongue' such as a vernacular language. Darsan of icons of god embodied in stone or metal is not the same as darsan of god embodied in a living human (or non-human) form. The involvement of the other senses in darsan varies from temple to temple and among different ritual traditions. The range of factors that we need to take into account further expands when we move beyond icons to the many two- and three-dimensional objects I mentioned above that have become the subject of recent scholar- ship, as well as when we bring in other media such as paintings, photo- graphs, posters, decals, comic-books, film, video, television and the internet. It is time for scholars of South Asian religious, material and visual cultures to look at the performance and experience of darsan with a new, contextually situated gaze. Notes Versions of this essay were presented at the symposium "Jain Art and Ritual: From Antiquity to Modernity," organized by Phyllis Granoff and held at Yale University on November 13-14, 2009; the Oriental Institute, Oxford University, March 15, 2010; and Amherst College, March 2, 2011. The Yale symposium was held in conjunction with the exhibition "Victorious Ones: Jain Images of Perfection," at the Rubin Museum of</page><page sequence="33">Situating Daršan / 33 Art, New York City, September 28, 2009-February 15, 2010. See Granoff (2009) and Gough (2010). In addition to the audiences and questioners at the three presentations, I thank the following for feedback and suggestions: Alan Babb, Richard Davis, Diana Eck, Maria Heim, Padmanabh Jaini, Whitney Kelting, Natalie Marsh, Sam Morse, Hampana Nagarajaiah, Andy Rotman, Kavita Singh, Bob Zydenbos, and the anonymous review- ers for IJHS. Two Senior Short-Term Fellowships from the American Institute of Indian Studies funded the research on which this essay is based, in 1999-2000 and 2007-2008. Travel to Oxford was assisted by a grant from the Denison University Research Foundation. 1. Significant parts of this article were reprinted, albeit not all in the same chapter, in Babb (1986). 2. Let me cite just four examples. Morgan's path-breaking The Sacred Gaze devoted three pages to daršan (2005: 48-50), and while he also quoted Huyler 1999, in his endnote he directed the reader solely to Eck' s book as "an excellent discussion of Hindu visual piety" (271nl). Nelson (2000: 13), in the introduction to the volume of excellent essays he edited on visuality in a wide (both historically and geographically) range of cultures, first cited Eck when addressing visuality in South Asia, adding to it only a reference to the 1997 doctoral dissertation of Woodman Taylor. Brown (1989: 206n7) cited only Eck as the source for a reference to "the observation that the central act of much popular Hindu worship is seeing - and being 'seen' by - the image of the deity present in the sanctum of the temple" (114). Finally, a passage from the third edition of Daršan is the first of four entries in the section " Darshan : Seeing the Hindu Divine Image in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" in a recent cross-cultural anthology of readings on religion, art and visual culture (Plate 2002: 171-75); the other three passages were taken from the writings of Davis (1997), Hawley (1996) and Lutgendorf (1995). 3. Implicit in my use of north Indian Digambar materials to problematize the standard 'view' of daršan is a premise that underlies most contempo- rary scholarship on the Jains: to separate 'Jainism' from 'Hinduism' is a false distinction, one that ignores the complicated ways Jains and Hindus (as well as Buddhists, Muslims and secular materialists) have interacted in South Asia for millennia. Daršan is not a 'Hindu' concept and practice; it is a South Asian one. See Cort (1998).</page><page sequence="34">34 / John E. Cort 4. Central to Babb's analysis here was the theoretical work of Marriott (1976). 5. Babb (1986: 79-80) made a similar connection between darsan and prasäd , as both involve complex ontological exchanges between the partners in the transaction. It is perhaps not a coincidence, therefore, that the Jains reject the concept of prasäd (Babb 1996: 61-62, 93-96), since according to Jain ideology the Jina cannot respond to or in other ways interact with the worshipper. As we will see, a similar model of non- reciprocity underlies the Digambar Jain ideology of darsan. 6. Gell worked from a positivism that reveals a dependence upon the materialist presuppositions of the Western Enlightenment scientific method. From this perspective, of course icons are inanimate, and of course, all Hindus share this assumption: "The devotee does know that the image of the god is only an image, not made of flesh and blood" (Gell 1998: 118; emphasis in original). In contrast, see Davis's articula- tion of his own attempts in his scholarship "to make a... case for an alter- native way of constructing the world" and thereby write "as if icons are really alive" (2000: 92). Gell would also have done well to consider the árivaisnavas discussed by Narayanan (1985), who say that an icon in which Visnu is incarnated is transformed at the atomic level from metal or stone into a substance known as suddha sattva . In the Srivaisnava understanding, "what appears to non-Hindu eyes as the most gross and material representation of the deity is understood by the Srivaisnava to be a divine, auspicious form, composed of a non-material substance that exists only in heaven and in the Srivaisnava temple on earth" (Narayanan 1985: 62). In recent years scholars of 'indigenous knowledge,' among other fields, have come to argue that the Western scientific distinction between what is alive and what is inert, and therefore the basic under- standing of 'life' itself, is itself tied to complex genealogies of history and culture (Berkes 2008: 11, citing Ingold 2006). 7. Whether the mutuality of darsan is possible through the internet has been the subject of extensive theological reflection by globalized Hindus. For example, Raymond Brady Williams has written of the Swaminarayan tradition: "One of the early Internet sites contained beautiful pictures of the images in a popular Swaminarayan temple, but it contained the warn- ing that the images could not be used for darshan in exactly the same way as images in the temple. Virtual images do not possess the powerful</page><page sequence="35">Situating Darsan / 35 presence of god that was installed in dedication; hence they do not give darshan" (2001: 194). In the decade since Williams wrote, there has obviously been some rethinking of the theological possibility of on-line darsan , as many Swaminarayan websites now advertise daily darsan . See Marsh (2007) for an extensive discussion and analysis of on-line darsan. 8. While she made no reference to the work of Eck and others on darsan , the anthropologist Sara Dickey in a study of film-watching in Tamil Nadu indicated one way in which the "seeing and being seen" formula can be reductionist. Calling on the work of Debord (1983) on spectacle, she wrote, "Spectacle - the importance of seeing and being seen - is central to much of public culture" (Dickey 2006: 418). This reminds us that darsan and "being seen" operate very differently in a religious setting than in other contexts. In the former, the devotee is seen in a very direct, individual and intimate way by God, whereas in a public culture setting a person is the object of an impersonal and collective gaze. 9. Fuller also discussed negative visuality, that is, the evil eye, but in a different chapter than the one in which he discussed darsan . 10. To cite just a few examples that are readily at hand, see Elgood (1999: 232-33, 2008: 15-16), Huyler (1999: 36), Lorenzen (2004: 195), McClymond (2008: 317), Michaels (2004: 230-31), Mines (2008: 140). To be fair, some of these authors cited more sources than Eck' s book, and gave more than just passing attention to a discussion of darsan ; nonetheless, all of them treated darsan as a single, pan-South Asian experience of seeing and being seen. This literature survey deals only with English-language scholarship on visuality in South Asia. The influence of the universalized 'seeing and being seen' formula is not limited to English scholarship, however; for just one example each from French and German, see Pinard (1990) and Mallebrein (1998). 11. Examples are Huntington (1985) and Mitter (2001). Other authors who refer to Eck miss the central element of her argument (and one that I problematize in this essay), that darsan is an interactive experience, and instead reduce it simply to the act of seeing a deity, ruler or any other superior being: Chaturachinda, Krishnamurthy, and Tabtiang (2004: 65), Dehejia (1997: 137), Guy (2007: 96-99), Michell (2000: 32, 218). An</page><page sequence="36">36 / John E. Cort unhelpful and even confusing variant is found in Craven, who describes darsan as "a mysterious ecstasy generated by being in the presence of a holy person or place" (1997: 169). 12. Blurton (1993) refers in several places to darsan as something the worshipper takes or receives; and Dehejia cites Eck on the ritual of darsan as "a purposeful act of seeing the divine image, and receiving in turn a transfer of grace" (2009: 21); only Brown (2009) fully refers to the mutu- ality of darsan in multiple places, and cites Fuller (1992) in addition to Eck. 13. Information on the conference can be found on the home page of the American Council for Southern Asian Art: www.acsaa.us. See also McDermott (201 1). 14. Again, let me cite just a few recent, representative examples, from sources that are in many ways theoretically stimulating in their treatment of visual culture: Flood 2009: 177 (on material culture and medieval Hindu-Muslim interactions); Freitag 2001: 39 (on the public sphere); Jacob 2009: 246 (on cinema); Lutgendorf 2006: 231-34 (on cinema); Mankekar 1999: 200 (on television); McLain 2009: 15-16 (on religious comic books); Pinney 1997: 106, 109, 2001: 168, and 2004: 193 (on photography); Prasad 1998: 74-75 (on Hindi film); Rajagopal 2001: 93 (on television). The work of Christopher Pinney has been especially important in theorizing South Asian modes of seeing. 15. 1 discuss 'context' and 'frame' in Cort (2010: 13-16). 16. A further problem with the valorization of one theory of darsan as a pan-Indian theory is that it often extends a theory of the religious gaze to all contexts, whether those contexts are religious. This is a good example of the problem which Pollock (1998: 28-31) and others have criticized, of many scholars unreflectively privileging religion as the lens through which they view all aspects of Indian society and culture. 17. He here cited thirty recent sources on South Asian visuality. 18. A fuller analysis of the north Indian Digambar practice of darsan would follow Packert's lead and devote attention to the visual appearance of the icons themselves. As I indicate below, there are significant differ- ences between north Indian and south Indian Digambar icons and temples and between Digambar and Svetämbar icons and temples. 19. In this essay, I do not engage in an analysis of how north Indian Digambar experiences of darsan have changed over time.</page><page sequence="37">Situating Darsan / 37 20. 1 forego a fuller analysis of contemporary Svetambar darsan in this essay; but see Cort 2007, forthcoming. 21. All photographs are taken and copyrighted by the author. 22. One sometimes hears that the eyes of Svetambar icons are carved so that they actively look straight out, while those of Digambar icons are carved so that they are downcast in meditation. My observation of hundreds of Digambar icons in Jaipur, however, does not bear this out; a great many of them, perhaps even a majority, are carved with eyes looking out. I thank Kristi Wiley for asking the question that drew my attention to this matter, and also for joining me in visiting many temples in Jaipur in pursuit of answers to this and related questions. 23. As I was finishing the first draft of this essay for presentation at a symposium at Yale University, word came of the death on November 12, 2009, of the Svetambar Mürtipüjak Jain monk Muni Jambuvijayjl in a road accident in Rajasthan. In a blog posted on November 13, the Digambar Jain writer Manish Modi wrote of the one time he had visited Jambûvijayjï, in 2004. Modi wrote that this Svetambar monk spoke "in a light vein" of his many visits to Digambar temples in the decades of his travels by foot around all of northern and western India, and said, "pitâjï to pitâjï hote haim , ähkh lagäo to, nahïm lagäo to bht ': "My father is my father, whether he is fitted with external eyes or not." (I have added dia- critical marks to Modi's post.) This alerts us to be careful not to allow the visual and material evidence to over-determine our interpretation of a worshipper's visual experience. 24. Whether flowers, incense, and other offerings are allowed in the temple is a matter of sectarian disagreement between the Blspanth and Teräpanth Digambars in North India. 25. Pinard criticized Eck at some length for what he termed her "visual reductionism" (1991: 221), that is, over-emphasizing sight at the expense of the other senses in her analysis of Hindu or South Asian culture, and thereby "ignoring the importance the pilgrims themselves attach to the gustatory dimension of the experience of the sacred" (222). While the Jains explicitly reject the ritual exchange economy of prasäd , Picard' s article points to the problems of analyzing darsan as only visual. See also Pinard 1990. 26. See also the comments by Hawkins (1999: 148) on the need to include orality and tangibility in any analysis of darsan .</page><page sequence="38">38 / John E. Cort 27. My argument here is in direct contradiction to that of Humphrey and Laidlaw, who wrote, in their analysis of the Svetämbar Mürtipüjak rite of worship, "in many cases the prayers and mantras are themselves in any case meaningless, or in languages which the worshipper does not understand" (1994: 194). Most Jains among whom I have conducted field- work for the past three decades would be puzzled by this statement, which is integral to Humphrey and Laidlaw's theory of ritual. Most Jains do understand what they recite and sing to a degree far beyond that for which Humphrey and Laidlaw give them credit. See also Cort (1997: 107-8). 28. In an e-mail letter on December 19, 2009, in response to an earlier draft of this essay, Padmanabh Jaini wrote: "I was reminded of my school days in Karanja (ashram) as I read the words ' patit pävari ...' used to know these by heart!" 29. I thank Whitney Kelting, a singer as well as a scholar, for drawing my attention to this concept and the relevant literature. Her study of the performance of hymns by Svetämbar Mürtipüjak women in Pune, Singing to the Jinas (2001), has centrally informed this essay. I could also have advanced a defense of studying the hymns people sing to help us understand the experience of darsan by calling on Bourdieu's concept of the "habitus," what he terms "the durably installed generative principle of regulated improvisations... which tend to reproduce the regu- larities immanent in the objective conditions of the production of their generative principle, while adjusting to the demands inscribed as objective potentialities in the situation" (1977: 78). I have foregone that route for reasons of space. 30. The cultural specificity of Epstein's examples, none of which is fully applicable to India, reminds us of the extent to which muscular memory is culturally situated. This applies equally to the muscular memory power of hymns, which are specific to cultures and religious practices. 3 1 . Again, a fuller analysis would take into consideration the extensive changes in the performance of darsan due to the forces of colonialism, and colonial and post-colonial globalization. While the lyrics of the Digambar darsan hymns inform a worshipper's experience of darsan through the effect of muscular memory, it is unlikely that there is a complete overlap in intention and experience between the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century hymnists and contemporary worshippers and viewers. 32. See the similar methodological argument made by Babb (1996: 19-</page><page sequence="39">Situating Darsan / 39 20) in his study of Svetambar Mürtipüjak ritual. He wrote: "Anyone who would understand Jain life must read what... [they] read" (20). 33. In this essay I do not extend my analysis of the hymns to a consid- eration of the non-oral qualities of the music itself. While the written sources do not indicate rägs for any of the hymns I analyze here, they do give rägs for many of the other hymns by these poet-composers. Here again we are reminded that darían is an intersensorial experience. 34. The worship of non-liberated deities is accepted by the Digambar Blspanth, but explicitly rejected by the Digambar Teräpanth. 35. See Cort (2001a: 85) for a discussion of a prescription for darían in the Gujarati Svetambar Mürtipüjak setting as given in three similar pamphlets. 36. In this essay I do not present a full analysis of the ritual performance of darsan in north Indian Digambar temples. On some occasions it is a stand-alone ritual, and on others it is combined in various ways with other rituals such as püjä and abhisek. While the performance of darsan by itself is, as we see, an inward looking reflective rite that involves withdrawal from the physical senses in favor of a spiritual inner vision and transfor- mation, when it is coupled with other rites it inevitably involves the person in a much more complicated embodied intersensorality. 37. See Williams (1963: 26-28) on this influential lay author, members of whose family served as royal advisors in Rajasthan. 38. The Namaskär Mantra is recited daily by millions of Jains. It is an ancient statement of obeisance to the five most revered figures in Jainism: the arhats (Jinas or Tfrthañkaras, the enlightened teachers), siddhas (all other liberated souls), äcäryas (mendicant leaders), upädhyäyas (mendi- cant preceptors), and all other sädhus (Jain mendicants) in the world. 39. I have observed no Kannada hymnals in Digambar temples in Karnataka. I therefore cannot speak about whether there are similarly popular darían hymns in Kannada. The devotional and ritual cultures of the Digambar Jains in North and South India are quite different. The very layout of a south Indian Digambar temple and the reliance upon a Jain priest mean that less responsibility for ritual falls upon the individual worshipper than in a north Indian Digambar temple; on this crucial geographical difference, see Cort (2001b). 40. I have used twelve hymnals in this analysis. They range in length from 80 to over 1,100 pages. Seven were published in Delhi, three in</page><page sequence="40">40 / John E. Cort Jaipur, one jointly in Delhi and Jaipur and one in Hastinapur, although the few that attribute the volumes to named editors give evidence of a wider range of origins, including Madhya Pradesh. Digambar hymnals rarely signal sectarian affiliation very clearly, indicative of the way that Digambar sectarian identities in North India, especially in terms of hymns, are not very rigid; 'sect' in the north Indian setting refers more to a style of religiosity than a bounded social identity (Cort 2009: 39). 41. darsanam devadevasya darsanam papanasanam. This is found in nine of the twelve hymnals. 42. at i punya uday mam äyä prabhu turnará darsan päyä. I have not been able to ascertain anything about the author. His hymn appears in only three of the hymnals in my collection. All of them are published in Delhi. This geographical fact, coupled with his language, indicates that Amarcand is or was probably from the Delhi area. One hymnal (Bansal 1998) with Amarcand's hymn, co-published by the Todarmal Smârak Trast in Jaipur, a highly sectarian organization that is the headquarters of the Jaipur branch of the Kânjï Svâmï Panth (R. Jain 1999: 101-17), also includes two hymns found only in another hymnal published by the same organization. These are an anonymous eleven-verse Darsan Dasak, written in twentieth-century Hindi with some pre-Standard forms; and an eleven- verse Darsän Päth written in Modern Standard Hindi by Jugal Kishore Mukhtar, a highly influential twentieth-century lay intellectual, whose Merl Bhävnä (My Aspirations) has become a signature hymn in contemporary globalized ecumenical Jainism. 43. Each of these hymns is found in eleven of the twelve hymnals. Four hymnals include another hymn by Budhjan as a darsan path, his turn nirakhat mujhko' since it contains twenty-five verses, it is also known as Darsan Paccïsï. 44. Based on the three known dates for his compositions - 1724, 1732 and 1749 - N. Jain (1997: 1 1 1-19) has estimated that he lived from about 1699-1700 to about 1765-66. T. Jain, in the introduction to his edition of Bhudhar's pads, estimates his dates as 1693-1749. 45. Texts by Budhjan date from 1778 to 1838. On this basis, Mülcand Jain Sâstrî (1986) has estimated that he lived from about 1763 to about 1838. On Budhjan, see also Cort (2009). 46. Both V. Jain and T. Jain in their introductions to their editions of his works give his birth as about 1798-99 and his death as 1866, but do</page><page sequence="41">Situating Dar san / 41 not indicate the sources for these dates. They give a specific date for his death, but only a range of years for his birth. 47. See Daulaträm (1993) for an English translation and commentary of this oft-printed text. 48. The significant amount of technical Jain vocabulary in their hymns presents a particularly difficult challenge to translation into poetic English, as contemporary American verse is not a medium which philosophers choose to use. I apologize to the readers for the resulting rather wooden quality of the translations. 49. Bhüdhardäs 1999: 74, dekho bhai atamadev birajai . 50.

These are the eight wondrous objects that appear to mark the enlight- enment of a Jina, and so are often found surrounding a Jina icon: (1) an asoka tree, (2) a celestial drum ( deva-dundhubhi ), (3) flowers falling from heaven (puspa-vrsti ), (4) a triple parasol ( chattra-traya ), (5) fly- whisks ( cämara ), (6) a lion-throne (simha-äsana), (7) divine music ( divya - dhvani ), and (8) a solar halo ( bhä-mandala ). 53. Hawley (1984: 120-61) devotes an extended discussion to the genre of vinaya in the poetry of the Hindu poet Sürdäs. He argues that the vinaya poems of Sürdäs overlap with his viraha poems, or poems that express the absence of God: "These [ vinaya ] poems are in spirit much less expressions of satisfaction at the divine presence than they are laments at its absence" (121). We will see that the Digambar vinaya poems do not express dismay at the absence of God, but rather a recognition that the presence of the divine ideals in the icon underscore the poet's many failings. On the vinaya poems of Sürdäs, see also Bryant (1978: 205-8). Sürdäs also seems to have been a pioneer in one feature of the Hindu vinaya poems, in which the poet berates God for his apparent absence from the world and indifference to the suffering of his fallen devotee, and "demands that the Lord follow through on promise and precedent and save him, a sinner, or relinquish any claim to being known as the savior of the fallen" (Hawley 1984: 130). While the Jain poets use this same title to describe the Jina - Budhjan, for example, refers to the Jina as the "purifier of the fallen" (patit pävan) - the Jain poets do not criticize the Jina for his dispassionate ( vïtrâg ) attitude toward his devotees.</page><page sequence="42">42 / John E. Cort 54. According to Jain soteriology, while it is necessary for the person in the world to make ethical distinctions between good and bad karma, even good karma is a form of bondage of the soul, and so the person in pursuit of liberation must transcend this ethical duality (Cort 2001 a: 90). 55. See, for example, the text of the most popular north Indian Digambar püjä, the Dev Sastra Guru Püjä of Dyänaträy (1676-1726), which I have translated at Cort 2002 (284-90). 56. The Digambar hymns I analyze here are quite different from Svetä- mbar darían hymns in Gujarati and Hindi, which tend to emphasize the eyes and the beautiful ornamentation of the icon. Svetämbar hymns are usually composed in front of specific icons, and even when sung before other icons, as is usually the case, they still instruct the singer in a power- ful ocular experience. The grace of the Jina in a Svetämbar hymn is con- veyed visually. See Cort 2006, 2007, forthcoming. 57. This follows the reading in the hymnals ( aho jagat-guru dev). T. Jain gives a slightly different reading (aho jagat-guru ek), which would be in English "Aho, you are the only guru of the world. / Hear my petition." 58. According to Jain biology, nigods are the lowest form of life. They are microscopic beings, possessing only the sense of touch. They lack individual bodies, and so exist in clusters that exist only for a moment (Jaini 1979: 109). 59. See Cort (2009: 41) for an earlier translation of this hymn. 60. See note 52. 61. V. Jain (Daulaträm 2000: 28nl), following Vïrasena's Dhavala 1.1.1 (see Puspadanta and Bhütabali 1973), says that there are three instrumental causes ( nimitt käran) for obtaining the suffering of karma: (1) delusion ( moha ) is called the foe (an), (2) the metaphorical karmic dust that obscures knowledge (jñána ) and worldview ( darsana ) is called dust (raja), and (3) the karma that blocks effort (antaräya-karma) is called mysterious (rahasya). 62. See V. Jain's notes 1 and 2 (Daulaträm 2000: 29) on the eighteen blemishes (dosa) and the nine attainments (labdhi) of enlightenment. The four infinitudes, which comprise liberation, are those of knowledge (jñána), perception (daráana), conduct (caritra), and potential (vïrya). 63. Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. 64. According to both V. Jam and T.

The accompanying wondrous objects are resplendent.60 You are joined with endless virtue, destroying [bad karma ] like a million suns. (5) The darkness of my wrong faith is destroyed, the sun of my soul has arisen. My heart is gladdened like a pauper who finds a wishing stone. (6) I join my hands, bow my head, and venerate your feet, Sir. You are best of all, lord of the three worlds, Jina, saved and savior! Listen, Sir: (7) I ask for nothing more - not a home in heaven, nor to be king of men, Sir. Budh asks only this: to do your devotion in birth after birth. Please grant this, lord of liberation. (8) Daulaträm (2000: 27-28, 2001 : 1-2), Darsan Path / Mahgaläcaran (sakal jñey jñayak tadapï) Couplet (dohä): You know everything there is to be known.</page><page sequence="46">46 / John E. Cort You are absorbed in the taste of the bliss of the soul. Jinendra, you are always victorious. You are devoid of foes, dust and mysteries.61 (1) Verses: Hail to the dispassionate lord, the city of wisdom. Hail to the god who removes the darkness of delusion. Hail to the abode of endlessly endless knowledge. You are incomparable, crowned with vision, bliss and energy. (2) Hail to the lord who displays the supremely peaceful form, who causes the faithful to experience their souls. The faithful are fortunate to be united with your words. They hear you speak and wandering is destroyed. (3) You contemplate the virtues, and so are awake to self and other. All obstacles are destroyed in this illumination. You are the ornament of the world, you are devoid of faults. All greatness is yours, you are freed from errors. (4) Your innate form is undisturbed pure consciousness. You are supreme soul, supreme purifier, incomparable. You are above all effects of good and bad karma. Your innate nature is unchanging. (5) You are free from the eighteen faults. You are firm. You dwell in the four infinitudes. You shine deeply. You are served by the monks, pontiffs, and others. You grasp the Laksmï who is the nine attainments of enlightenment.62 (6) Your teachings save countless souls. They go to liberation and reside there forever. There is no other savior like you for those drowning in the sorrow of the ocean of rebirth. (7) You are the medicine that is the instrumental cause</page><page sequence="47">Situating Darsan / 47 to remove the suffering on my soul. I know this, so I've come for shelter. I proclaim that you instantly remove the suffering on my soul. (8) In my wandering I forgot you. I've acquired all the fruits of sin and virtue. I thought that others were the causes. I attributed to them what I did and didn't want (9) Due to my ignorance I became agitated just as a deer is entranced by its desires. I thought that I was this ephemeral body. I never experienced the essence of my own being. (10) I didn't know you, so there was only pain. You know all this, Jina Lord. I lived in the realms of animals, hell-beings, humans, and gods. I took birth again and again, dying endless times. (11) From the passage of time, compassionate lord, I've obtained your darsan , and am glad. My mind is at peace, I've overcome all dualities. I see the essence of my soul - my suffering is uprooted. (12) Lord, please arrange that never again am I not at your feet. God, may I never be distant from all your virtues. You are famous for saving the world. (13) Sense-objects and passions are bad for the soul. May their transformations not overcome me. May I dwell absorbed in my soul. Make me firm in my soul. (14) I don't want anything else, Lord. Grant me the treasure of the three jewels,63 lord of monks. I am the doer, but you are the cause.</page><page sequence="48">48 / John E. Cort Liberate me, take away the burning of my delusion. (15) Just as the moon brings peace and relieves burning, You yourself give happiness. Just as a person cures illness by drinking milk so experiencing you destroys birth. (16) In the three worlds and the three times none other than you gives me happiness. Today my heart is settled: you are the boat to cross the ocean of pain. (17) Couplet: The pontiffs could not count the gems that are your virtues. Daul says, my mind is still inadequate, so I praise you carefully in three ways.64 (18)</page><page sequence="49">Situating Darsan / 49 References Cited Ajlt Kumär Sästii, Pandit. 1997 [1955].
