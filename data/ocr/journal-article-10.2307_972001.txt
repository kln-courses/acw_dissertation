<plain_text><page sequence="1">Long-distance exchange of exotic preciosities, while it can occur in any sociopolitical context, may be associated with both chiefly formation and state hegemony. In the south central Andes, shared stylistic elements in early complex societies of Para- cas-Nasca on the Peruvian south coast and Pukara in the altiplano suggest their contact via intermediate areas. Unfortunately, interpretations of the interaction of these great traditions tend to neglect indigenous sociopolitical development in regions between the two culture areas. Recent systematic survey in one such intermediate region, Peru's Moquegua Valley, has shed light on an indigenous pre-Tiwanaku culture with distinctive regional settlement patterns, complex mortuary practices, and a local ceramic tradition known as Huaracane (385 cal B. C-cal A.D. 340). Surface collections and test excavations confirm a minimal pres- ence of exotic Pukara and Paracas-Nasca ceramics and textiles in association with elite local residential contexts and a late Huaracane mortuary tradition known as "boot tombs" that appears after 170 cal B.C. As there is no general emulation offor- eign styles, domestic activities, or practices, an agency-oriented local perspective is favored over globalist colonial or client- age models to explain the role of exotica in a climate of competitive sociopolitical development. El intercambio de larga distancia de objetos preciosos se considera importante como indicador de la formacion de cacicazgos y de la influencia estatal. Elementos compartidos entre las tradiciones Paracas-Nasca y Pukara han sugerido contactos entre ambos por regiones intermedias. Lamentablemente, los procesos de desarrollo social y polftico de las poblaciones indfgenas en las regiones intermedias han sido casi olvidados por los arqueologos. El reconocimiento sistematico del Valle de Moquegua, Peru nos ayuda a entender el patron de asentamientos agro-alfareros pre-Tiwanaku, sus tradiciones habitacionales y mortuorias, y la distribu- cion de un estilo cera'mico local conocido como Huaracane (385 cal a. C-340 cal d. C. ). El patron de asentamiento se compone de aldeas pequenas ubicadas muy cercana a los recursos agrfoolas, con pocos sitios habitacionales de mayor rango. La tradicion mortuoria de entierros en tu'mulos se aumenta a partir de 170 cal a. C. con la introduccion de "tumbas botas ", con of rendas lujosas de caracter elite. Este sugiere una sociedad al nivel de cacicazgos locales. Recolecciones superficiales y excavaciones comprue- ban una presencia mfnima de ceramica y textiles Pukara y Paracas-Nasca. Se considera el papel de tales objetos exoticos en el desarrollo social y polftico segun modelos coloniales, de influencia polftica, y de la manipulacion de intercambio exterior en un contexto de competencia local.

The goods are treasure, objects of elite circulation.... [Polanyi et al. 1957:262]. Exotica and Chiefly Power Ever since Polanyi sketched his enormously influ- ential model for elite nonmarket trade, debate over the role of precious-goods exchange has been a perennial favorite in the archaeology of early chief- doms and states. As political currency, sumptuary objects have been described as one of the most effi- cacious ways to "materialize" ideology (Earle 1997:154). Because they are highly esteemed and cherished for their rarity and for the intensive invest- ment of labor, skill, or technological process in their manufacture and importation (Brumfiel and Earle 1987), sumptuary goods are convertible to prestige and power that surpasses their use value (e.g., D'A1- troy and Earle 1985; Earle 1987,1994:445; Paynter 1989; Rowlands et al. 1987; Wolf 1982:82-83). In particular, craft items of exotic origin are considered to have an almost talismanic role in structuring the political interactions among geographically distant elites. 335 EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHTFFS: LONG-DISTANCE EXCHANGE AND INDIGENOUS SOCIOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN l HIt SOUTH CENTRAL ANDES Paul S. Goldstein</page><page sequence="2">336 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 1 1, No. 4, 2000 Exotic goods, or exotica, as I will term valuable imported craft items, are by definition strikingly, excitingly, or mysteriously different or unusual. Exotica that are stylistically identified with the "great" traditions of state societies have attracted particular interest in discussions of the spread of sociopolitical complexity. Perhaps because these arti- facts are easy to trace archaeologically, their distri- bution is often read as an indicator of the dissemination of political and economic concepts from state centers to less complex peripheral soci- eties (Helms 1993:6). Unfortunately, the intermedi- ate areas where many of these interactions took place are often seen as blank spaces on the map that lie between the great traditions. The prehistoric elites of these areas are marginalized as mere passive recip- ients of exotic influences from distant centers. Recent theoretical discussions of ancient sump- tuary exchange networks may be dichotomized along a continuum from globalist approaches, notably world systems models, to agency-oriented models that stress individual interests and power aggran- dizement at the local level. These represent two fun- damentally different perspectives on exotica. Do we view the movement of sumptuary foreign-trade goods from above, as a powerful donor society's means of projecting power globally? Or do we see the same goods from below, through the eyes of local actors who accept and use them selectively, as a means to create power at home? For the case study presented here, I suggest that the contextualization of exotic finds demands a full understanding of indigenous settlement patterns and sociopolitical development. In the light of new data on Huaracane (385 cal B.C-cal A.D. 340), a forma- tive indigenous tradition of the Moquegua valley of southern Peru, I will discuss that culture's limited, selective, and context-specific adoption of exotic objects from more complex societies of the Pukara and Paracas-Nasca regions in southern Peru. I will argue that the role of exotica in pre-state sociopolit- ical development in "peripheries" can best be under- stood from an agency-oriented local perspective, rather than from the globalist perspective of distant state cores. Acting Globally The Primacy of the Core Under what I will call a globalist perspective, the exchange of precious exotica is one method for the projection of power by the "cores" of early states or complex chiefdoms. Following Schneider's (1977) adaptation of Wallerstein's (1974) formulation of uneven development, many archaeologists have con- sidered ancient long-distance exchange of preciosi- ties within a construct of pre-capitalist "world systems" (Abu-Lughod 1989; Algaze 1993a,1993b; Chase-DunnandMann 1998;Kohl 1987,1996;Pere- grine and Feinman 1996; Rowlands et al. 1987; Whitecotton 1992), "macroregional systems" (Wilcox 1999:137), or"core-periphery systems" (Paynter 1989:380). Regardless of the terminology, these analytical concepts imply strategies of power that, like the empowered preciosities that stand as their proxies, flow from the top-down. Cores inte- grate peripheral societies into a coherent division of labor, articulating peoples with different relations of production and social reproduction within an over- arching dominant political economy (Patterson and Gailey 1987:78). In short, cores enact, while periph- eries react. Implicit in globalist conceptions is a characteri- zation of peripheries as politically weak societies with less complex organizations or institutions than cores (e.g., D'Altroy 1992: 15). This is not to say that globalist views of elite exchange all ignore local con- ditions in the peripheries. Indeed, recent reconsid- erations of archaeological world systems acknowledge indigenous resistance to external dom- ination, and the "distance-parity" phenomenon of diminution of power with distance-related costs of control (Stein 1998). Even these critiques, however, fall back on a calculus that balances core interests against costs. Typically, this is done by contrasting "territorial" and lower cost "hegemonic" systems of control (D'Altroy 1992; Hassig 1985; Luttwak 1976). By tolerating compliant local leaders as priv- ileged clients, hegemonic early states could integrate distant peripheries through elite acculturation and consent-building rather than naked intimidation. Even at great distance, hegemonic cores could sub- vert local political hierarchies and ideologies by seducing regional leaders into the core culture's sys- tem of values. Seduction entails gift giving, and from the glob- alist perspective, strings could be attached to gifts. In hegemonic core-periphery systems, gift giving is seen as a political act that reifies the core's domi- nance and the submission of peripheral elites. Exotic gifts could cement the ties between patron and client, assuring the cooperation of potentially disruptive</page><page sequence="3">Goldstein] EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 337 ulating the display and consumption of exotic pre- ciosities and esoteric information can be one effec- tive way for "aggrandizers" to compete for followers and forge coalitions at home. "Effective competition at the community level requires aggrandizers to traf- fic outside their home communities and establish significant ties to individuals elsewhere, preferably other aggrandizers.... The physical and social resources and knowledge thus gained allow an aggrandizer to compete more effectively within his own community. . . " (Clark and Blake 1994:19, emphasis added). From this perspective, exotica's association with distant power centers is relevant not because of the power politics of core hegemony, but only because of the high value of the exotic in the community setting. This is not to say that distance does not matter. Writing of early sixteenth-century Panamanian chiefs located midway between the complex politi- cal organizations of Mesoamerica and northern Andean SouthAmerica, Helms (1993) has described how their exotic origins add an "aura of esoterica" to precious items imbued with aesthetic qualities closely associated with political ideology. Thus the exquisitely worked Quimbaya and Sinu gold arti- facts, once accepted by Panamanian elites, were material symbols not only of wealth and power, but of even scarcer commodities of esoteric knowledge and chiefly sanctity: "[T]he geographically distant and the supernaturally distant were closely related.... [T]his association was succinctly stated by the acqui- sition from distant geographical regions of elite pres- tige items . . ." (Helms 1979: 110). The importance of precious exotica thus resided in the possessor's ability to construct power out of an outside/inside dichotomy (Helms 1993). Even if some of the salient symbols of power came from "outside," long-distance exchange relations were most significant for their role in constructing local preeminence. Local factions or individuals partici- pated in extra-local networks because this gave them an "insider" status, as political and spiritual power could be reified through control of empowered and empowering exotic goods. Ironically, then, even as elites used exotica to sep- arate themselves from their own people, they created "networks" that joined them to fellow elites else- where. Elites could transcend political and social boundaries, building shared class identities by employing exotic prestige objects as "mutually rein- frontier groups. Indeed, the statement of this princi- ple was essential to the formulation of archaeologi- cal world systems: "Pitting some against others, gift giving promotes the co-optation of class enemies, making the patron-client relationship a forceful polit- ical adjunct to energy capture" (Schneider 1977:23). Bearing the imprimatur of the giver, exotic gifts from a distant and empowered core carry an intan- gible association with a cosmopolitan elite, and can thus be a catalyst to social stratification. Renfrew has described the effect of exotica on sociopolitical change as a process of "emulation": External trade brings exotic prestige artifacts which confer status on those individuals con- trolling the supply. A prominent hierarchy can thus emerge in what was formerly only a partly stratiEled society. In this case, the society sup- plying the goods is already highly organized and stratiEled and with the goods comes infor- mation, a set of values and social procedures which are more readily adopted because of the sophistication of the source society's products and the prestige in which they are held [Renfrew 1975:33]. In this interpretation, the allure of luxury goods and ideas from the core, rather than the whims of peripheral tastes, define the value of exotica and, ultimately, stimulate ranking in peripheries. Cores are still seen as the protagonists of history, and transac- tions between core and periphery are a one-sided relationship of dominant to subordinate. It is the core that calls the shots. Thinking Locally An Agency-Oriented Perspective What I will call agency-oriented local perspectives distance themselves from globalist frameworks like the world systems approach by differently inter- preting the role of prestige trade in sociopolitical change. By focusing on trade's role in local processes of factional competition and coalition building, these views privilege individual agency over pan-societal analyses (Brumfiel 1992, 1994:3). Peripheral agency models nevertheless ascribe considerable importance to precious exotica in the construction of local lead- ership. Again, competitive gift giving is seen as one way of seducing clients or followers. Unlike global- ist perspectives, however, agency-oriented perspec- tives focus on the political potency of things in a strictly parochial local arena. Where generosity, pres- tige, obligation, and power can convert freely, manip-</page><page sequence="4">338 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 forcing, visible symbols of identity membership unit- ing dispersed local rulers" (Schortman 1989:58). By creating a common symbolic vocabulary and an "international style" that crosscut cultural bound- aries (Blanton et al.1996:4), even distant elites could share an immediately identifiable identity, creating a "network of chiefdoms from a network of inter- acting chiefs" (Clark and Blake 1994:20). The basic tenet of this network theory-that cer- tain kinds of exotica can travel in culturally tran- scendent elite exchange networks is intuitive to modern life. After all, Rolex is Rolex, whether in New York, Delhi, or Nairobi. The conception that elite trade networks can transcend cultural bound- aries has long been a component of archaeological exchange theory as well. In northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, where discoveries of Mesoamerican imports such as mirrors, bells, and parrot feathers display a strong correlation with indi- viduals of high rank, Nelson (1994) suggests that these exotica traveled in a status-selective "prestige sphere" that was qualitatively different from the sub- sistence and local artifact exchange spheres. Simi- lar concepts are implicit to a long line of elite long-distance exchange constructs ranging from "peer polity interaction" (Renfrew 1996) to "multi- national cultures" (Willey 1973:158-159) to "inter- action spheres" like the Hopewell burial cult of the Eastern Woodlands (Caldwell 1964). Nonetheless, an agency-oriented local perspective on networks can help focus analysis on exotica's role in both regional and local sociopolitical development and remind us that some sumptuary exchange networks can form from the "bottom-up" without centralized intervention. Regional Interaction in the South Central Andes Discussions of early sociopolitical complexity in the Andes often tend to favor globalist perspectives on interregional integration over considerations of local agency. During periods of coalescence known as horizons, it is generally accepted that powerful cult centers or cities culturally or politically integrated diverse geographical regions. In the south central Andes, for example, recent research has emphasized the projection of power to several regions by the state core at Tiwanaku during the Middle Horizon (ca. A.D.55s1000). As might be expected, the periph- eries most distant from the Tiwanaku core appear to reflect hegemonic control articulated through the manipulation of elite clients (Berenguer and Dauels- berg 1993; Browman 1997; Kolata 1993; Mujica 1996; Mujica et al. 1983; Rodman 1992). In some particularly productive regions, however, Tiwanaku migrants established an "archipelago" of permanent colonial settlements, building canals, storage and processing facilities, cemeteries, and provincial ver- sions of monumental architecture (Blom et al.1998; Cespedes 1993; Goldstein 1989, 1993a, 1993b, 1996; 2000; Moseley et al. 1991; Murra 1972; Rice et al. 1989; Van Buren 1996). Until recently, it has been difficult to evaluate the importance of similar exogenous processes in pre- Tiwanaku societies of the south central Andes. This was largely due to the lack of concrete research on the small-scale societies that may have interacted with the earliest complex societies of the Peruvian altiplano and south coast. l Did these formative states of the Early Horizon and Early Intermediate Period colonize or "clientize" these peripheral regions? Or did indigenous societies remain autonomous as they adapted to wider and more complex spheres of inter- action? The Pukara and Paracas-Nasca Cultures Much discussion of the origins of social complexity in the south central Andes has focused on the alti- plano Pukara culture area of the northwest Lake Tit- icaca Basin and the Paracas-Nasca region of the Peruvian south coast (Figure 1). Both the Pukara and Paracas-Nasca phenomena represent dramatic in- situ growths in complexity, with the appearance of status differentiation, public construction of monu- mental architecture, site size hierarchies, craft spe- cialization, and widespread artistic traditions. While each may be considered independent regions of Andean state formation, the contemporaneity and proximity of the two phenomena highlights the importance of intermediate regions in developing complexity in the south central Andes. The Pukara culture (250 B.C.-A.D.380) was cen- tered at the eponymous-type site near the village of Pucara, located in the Ayaviri-Pucara valley of the Peruvian altiplano at an elevation of 3950 m asl. The Pukara site's monumental pyramidal platforms indi- cate an advanced degree of planning and labor orga- nization, and with an area of 6 km sq Pukara can also be described as one ofthe altiplano's firsturban sites (Chavez 1992; Kidder 1943; Mujica 1990:162).</page><page sequence="5">EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 339 Goldstein] Figure 1. The south central Andes and the Peruvian south coast. fiber-tempered, polychrome incised ceramics during the Upper Formative period" (Stanish and Steadman 1994:55). From a globalist perspective, the outward transfer of these stylistic ideas could reflect the polit- ical power, ideological importance, or economic privilege of Pukara as a state core. At approximately the same time as Pukara's rise, the Paracas-Nasca traditions were developing on the Peruvian south coast. Discussions of social com- plexity on the south coast tend to focus on the astounding technological and artistic achievement evident in Paracas and Nasca textiles and polychrome ceramics, which suggest early craft specialization and status differentiation in burials (Carmichael 1995; Dawson 1979; Dwyer 1979; Engel 1966; Men- zel et al. 1964; Paul 1979, 1982, 1986, 1991; Peters 1991; Proulx 1983; Tello and Mejia Xesspe 1979). Recent findings from more comprehensive excava- tion and settlement-pattern studies indicate that the Paracas and subsequent Nasca traditions were char- acterized by a long period of continuous cultural development. Political unification began around small residential sites on the Paracas peninsula and in the Ica valley in Ocucaje Phases 3-4 (DeLeonardis 1997; GarciaandPinilla 1995:55,61).2Demographic Regionally the Pukara site has been seen as the apex of a three-level site size hierarchy with populous sec- ondary centers at nearby Taraco, Maravillas, and Incatunuhuire supported by raised field-intensive agriculture (Erickson 1987; Mujica 1990:171). Pukara was the source for the diffusion of the Pukara style in ceramics and stone sculpture. Pukara iconography, which includes motifs such as trophy heads, felines, and staff-bearing decapitator figures, enjoyed a wide influence in the highlands (Browman 1980; Chavez 1976, 1981, 1992; Conklin 1983; Cook 1983; Mujica 1990), and resemblances between Pukara pottery and early ceramics from the Vilcanota andApurimac valleys suggest Pukara con- tact with Cusco at a very early date (Mujica 1990:176). If the "zoned incised" Pukara ceramic style of the Pucara site dates roughly between 100 B.C. and A.D. 100 (Chavez 1992; Franquemont 1986:2), the subsequent appearance of similar traits in traditions to the south, notably the Kalasasaya/ Tiwanaku I style of Tiwanaku (Ponce Sangines 1976) and the Sillumocco style of the Juli region (Stead- man 1995), suggests that Pukara decorative tech- niques and vessel forms were emulated throughout the altiplano as a "pan-Titicaca tradition of non-</page><page sequence="6">340 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 growth and resource competition led to chiefdom- level polities in the Lower Ica Valley in Ocucaje phases 5-8, with expansion throughout Ica and Nasca in Ocucaje Phases 8,9, and 10 (300 B.C.-A.D.100) (Cook 1997; Silverman 1996), when a three-tier site- size hierarchy and the construction of a ceremonial center at Animas Altas suggest the emergence of a regional political authority (Garcia and Pinilla 1995:62; Massey 1990, 1991). Continuity in settle- ment patterns, iconography, and material-culture styles can be seen after bearers of Paracas material culture colonized the southern valleys of the Nasca drainage (Schreiber 1998:262). By the early Nasca phases, the south coast societies embarked on some of their most impressive public works with the con- struction of the Cahuachi ceremonial center and the Nasca geoglyphs (Silverman 1993). From these ori- gins developed the famed Nasca polychrome ceramic style and mortuary tradition (Carmichael 1995; KroeberandCollierl998;Proulxl983),and,even- tually, a highly hierarchical settlement system in the valleys of the Nasca drainage (Schreiber 1998). Regional Interaction between the South Coast and the Altiplano Technical and stylistic affinities shared by the Pukara and Paracas-Nasca traditions suggest contact between the two toward the end of the Early Hori- zon (Ocucaje sequence) and early in the Early Inter- mediate Period (Nasca sequence). It is believed that Pukara shared ceramic technology with Paracas Ocu- caje Phases 9 and 10, notably the technique of delim- iting zones of color with incisions to create painted motifs (Chavez and Chavez 1976:66; Lumbreras 1974:88), and incised styles ofthe southern highlands mark a potential link in this relationship (Schreiber 1992:138). Paracas-Nasca artisans made extensive use of highland alpaca wool, as well as tropical bird feathers, cochineal dye, spondylus, and other exotic materials, suggesting extensive exchange relation- ships (Paul 1991:5, 34). Even widespread cultural practices like seated flexed burials have been cited as another measure of cultural unity throughout the south centralAndes (Moseley 1992: 152), while other areas of potential resemblance, notably in ceremo- nial architecture, have yet to be explored. Iconographic resemblances between Pukara and Paracas ceramics and textiles may represent common origin or culture contact. Particularly diagnostic is the appearance in both Pukara and late Paracas of feline depictions with the face turned toward the viewer and the body in profile, often with distinctive lozenge-shaped pelage markings (Benson 1972, 1997; Chavez 1992; DeLeonardis 1997; Fujii 1994:257; Lumbreras 1974:90; Menzel et al. 1964; Peters 1991:275; Sawyer 1972:108). OtherlatePara- cas textile motifs resemble stone carvings of the pre- PukaraYaya-Mama style of the altiplano, suggesting contact between the IcaValley and the Lake Titicaca Basin between Ocucaje Phase 8 and Nasca 4 (Chavez 1981; Chavez and Chavez 1976:66), and stelae of the altiplano have been cited as the direct source for emulation by Paracas weavers (Silverman 1996:125-126). Motifs may have been transmitted via trade textiles, as is suggested by the discovery in Ica of an altiplano-style interlocked tapestry bear- ing complex Pukara iconography (Conklin 1983:2). Despite these suggestions of shared iconography, evidence of overlap between the Pukara and Para- cas-Nasca culture areas is scarce and the nature of interaction between the two regions is obscure. Most sites of the Paracas-Nasca tradition are found between the Canete and Nasca valley systems (Paul 1991:8, Silverman 1991:374; Schreiber 1998:262) with occasional finds in coastal valleys as far south as Acari (Brown and Baraybar 1988:301), Yauca (Dwyer 1979; Gayton 1961), Camana and Sihuas (de laVera Cruz 1996: 145; Haeberli 1999; Proulx 2000). In the highlands, Lumbreras has associated Paracas pottery with the Chupas style in Ayacucho (Garcia andPinilla 1995:64; Lumbreras 1974), and Schreiber has noted Nasca 4 imports in assemblages of the Kancha ceramic style of the Carhuarazo Valley (Schreiber 1992: 139). Pukara ceramics reported in the puna of Las Salinas and high valleys of Arequipa (de la Vera Cruz 1996:149; Mujica 1990:174) and the aforementioned textile from Ica are among the few Pukara finds in close proximity to the south coast traditions. It has been suggested that, like Tiwanaku, Pukara polities might have colonized coastal valleys to access lowland ecological resources (Mujica 1990; Mujica et al. 1983). In Chile's Azapa Valley, the appearance of burials with prepared trophy heads, turban headdresses, and copper-working have all been attributed to Pukara influences from the south- ern altiplano in the valleys of Azapa, Loa, and Iquique in the Alto Ramirez Phase (500 B.C.-A.D. 300) (Focacci and Erices 1971:50, 59; Mujica 1990: 174; Munoz Ovalle 1983,1986:305,1996: 121;</page><page sequence="7">Goldsteinl EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 341 Rivera 1976,1985:42,53; 1991). SomeAlto Ramirez artifacts, notably wool tapestry textiles with repre- sentations of profile trophy heads, felines, and stepped motifs similar to those of Pukara stone sculp- ture, are seen as a direct transmission of Pukara cul- tural traits. Altiplano-related textiles are rare, however, and no evidence of Pukara residences or ceramics has been reported suggesting that the Alto Ramirez Pukara elements should be interpreted as exotic mortuary offerings associated with local tra- ditions, ratherthan colonization (Mujica 1985: 111). A phase of Pukara colonization, named the Trapiche Phase, has also been proposed for the MoqueguaValley of southern Peru (Feldman 1989). Pukara-style zoned incised polychrome sherds were collected at the Chen Chen site and perhaps else- where in the Moquegua valley in the early 1960s (Disselhoff 1968:215; Vescelius 1960). In 1984, Robert Feldman noted Pukara-style ceramics and paired warp-tapestry fragments in an area of looted stone structures at Cerro Trapiche (M7) (Feldman 1989:215). Judging the sherds to represent " a per- manently resident population that was in contact with the altiplano center," Feldman suggested that the "Trapiche Phase represents an occupation in Moquegua by people making variants of Pukara pot- tery and textiles" (1989:213). Does the appearance of Pukara pottery as exot- ica in the Moquegua Valley represent foreign hege- mony or colonization? To answer this question requires an understanding of the local context of exotica within Moquegua's indigenous settlement and sociopolitical patterns. The Huaracane lEadition of the Moquegua Valley Investigation of the scope and character of indige- nous early agrarian societies has been an important goal of the Moquegua Archaeological Survey (MAS), a regional settlement pattern study begun in 1993. The Moquegua valley of southern Peru, a river- ine oasis well-suited for temperate crop agriculture, provides an excellent test case for the interplay of the exogenous and indigenous factors in Andean sociopolitical development. The valley's role as a complementary resource zone for highland popula- tions may have originated in the late Archaic with seasonal camps of hunter-gatherers in the upper reaches of the valley. The Moquegua Valley was included in a seasonal round by the time of intro- duction of llama pastoralism at about 4500 B.P. (Aldenderfer 1998; Kuznar 1990:65). The origins of agrarian occupation and the begin- ning of an indigenous ceramic tradition in the Moquegua Valley were first identified with prelim- inary reconnaissance of the valley under the Con- tisuyo Program in 1983. This tradition, known as Huaracane (385 cal B.C.-calA.D.340), was defined at the type site of Pampa Huaracane and other sites with a similar ceramic assemblage of neckless or short-necked ollas and fine serving bowls (Feldman 1989; Goldstein 1989). Most Huaracane neckless ollas (Figure 2) are categorized as "Huaracane Arena," a paste with coarse sand temper. "Huaracane Vegetal," a paste with grassy fiber inclusions, typi- fies fewer than 20 percent of the olla sherds at most sites, and appears to be associated with larger and thicker vessel forms. Although fiber temper is char- acteristic of some early ceramics of the altiplano and Chiripa features such as "stuccoed" surfaces appear on a few Huaracane Vegetal sherds, (Bandy 1995; Cohen et al.1995; Feldman 1989:216; Ponce Sang- ines 1970; Steadman 1995), neckless ollas also dom- inate ceramic plainwares of the far south coast from AricatoIca(e.g.,Bolanos 1987;DeLeonardis 1997; Massey 1991:333; Owen 1993a,1993b; Rivera 1976, 1991; Tello 1987). Overall, the Huaracane utilitar- ian ceramic assemblages might be considered indige- nous to Moquegua, with generic resemblances to both altiplano and coastal styles. "Huaracane Fino," the third Huaracane-ware cat- egory, consists of serving vessels with a hard, extremely dense, well-fired paste. Vessels are typi- cally slipped in orange and highly burnished, with a minority black reduced variant. Virtually all Huara- cane Fino vessels are shallow rounded bowls of approximately 20 cm rim diameter (Figure 3). "Huaracane Fino" ware is found in association with both Huaracane Arena and Huaracane Vegetal ceram- ics, although, as shall be seen, its representation varies from site to site. The Huaracane Fino ceram- ics do not closely resemble the fancy ceramic styles of any neighboring region, and appear to represent a local high-fired serving ware. Preliminary evidence on Huaracane subsistence suggests a diverse diet and nonspecialized agrarian subsistence strategy.

Results for the Huaracane individuals indi- cate substantial dietary input of C3 plant foods (approximately 50 percent) and marine resources (23 to 50 percent), while maize and C4 plants made only a minimal contribution (three to 18 percent) (Sandness 1992:49). The surprisingly minimal role of maize or fermented maize beverages, commodi- ties that would become ritually, politically, and eco- nomically significant to subsequent chiefdom and state-level cultures in the valley, is supported by the absence of corn toasters, drinking goblets, or spe- cialized liquid storage vessel forms in the Huaracane ceramic assemblage. Instead, Huaracane diet relied on a generalized agricultural base supplemented by herding, hunting, and marine resources. Huaracane Settlement Patterns Between 1993 and 1996, the Moquegua Archaeo- logical Survey (MAS) completed a full coverage pedestrian surveyofthe 146 squarekilometers ofthe Moquegua Valley, the section of the Osmore River drainage between 900 and 2000 m asl (Figure 4). The MAS systematic reconnaissance demonstrated an extraordinary density of sites marked by surface scat- ters of Huaracane pottery, lithic artifacts, and textiles. Huaracane habitation sites typically consisted of semicircular residential terraces without stone fac- ing, with evidence of superstructures of organic materials. Village sites seldom had defensive walls or substantial public architecture. Represented by 169 habitation components, the Huaracane domes- tic occupation totaled 73.5 hectares in residential area, with an additional 70 Huaracane cemetery sec- tors covering 20.2 hectares (Table 1). Site size is quite uniform, with a mean area per domestic com- ponent of only 0.44 hectare. All but five domestic components were under two hectares (Figure 5), and even the largest Huaracane settlements are sherd scatters not distinguished by public architecture. Huaracane's notably convex rank-size relationship suggests the absence of a single primate center and a generally low level of political and economic inte- gration (Goldstein and McAndrews 2000). The most remarkable aspect of Huaracane set- tlement patterns in Moquegua was the high pre- dictability of settlement location. Huaracane habitations were found on virtually every hilltop or slope along the rim of the valley in the study area.

This close relation to the floodplain indicates a reliance on agriculture fed by simple valley-edge canals that distinguishes Huaracane's agrarian strategy from those of subse- quent, politically more complex societies. Tiwanaku's large colonial enclaves were located far from the valley and associated with the reclamation of desert pampas through extensive canals or sup- plementary ground water sources, while Late Inter- mediate Period sites correlate closely with terraced field systems in up-valley zones (Stanish 1992). In contrast, Huaracane's lack of corporate agricultural works like canals and terraces and the absence of spe- cialized processing tools and storage features at Huaracane sites suggest little agricultural intensifi- cation or surplus production.

As there does not appear to be any paramount village consonant with a valley-wide chiefdom, Huaracane villages may have been largely autonomous. Nonetheless, slightly more elaborate residential architecture, fancier ceramic assemblages, and mor- tuary elaboration have been noted at some Huara- cane sites. Indeed, there is evidence for the emergence of a locally constituted ranking system in the later Huaracane tradition, and it appears that elite factions were based at several competing cen- ters in the valley.

Like most Huaracane habitation sites, the 0.6 hectare sector D of the site (M73D) that was selected for systematic collection was characterized by small, informally arranged, residential terraces without retaining walls or any other stone construction, and a moderate to light ceramic scatter. Incontrast, the 1.1 hectarehabitation site of Mon- talvo (M103) was located on a high hilltop with com- manding views of the valley's juncture with a likely</page><page sequence="12">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 346 o .C o .S - 'e E-° o c) S .,&gt;/ &lt; , C %'bs fS;s wFF l - = &lt; o ,^^^ SOmeters r Figure 7.

Although itself only slightly larger than : the norm for Huaracane village sites, M103 was &gt; located centrally among several adjacent Huaracane 2 settlements, including a 1.3 hectare habitation site at &gt; M102, 190 m to the south and the largely destroyed = site M104,300 m to the north. Unlike its neighbors, ° M103 was highly unusual among Huaracane sites in O that it was surrounded by a perimeter wall and trench.

Nonetheless, the col- n lections support a marked disparity between the two Ev sites, with a far higher ceramic density at M103 (Table 2). More tellingly, the proportion of"Huara- cane Fino" serving bowls was considerably higher at M103 than at M73. As these high-fired serving vessels represent a separate and more sophisticated process of manufacture within the Huaracane ceramic tradition, their distribution may correlate with elite residences.  co 'e o o z = o N c) - 'e 'e 'e = o v c) 'e c) 'e cz Y o o *; 8 'e c) 'e = s Y o o m oo F o oo oo o oo vo ^ @ . . oo .

Pukara sherds from Moquegua valley sites. Goldstein] EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 347 ( I  =7 i. @ 1 2 4 Most intriguing at the M103 domestic site was the discovery of small numbers of exotic imported ceramics. These include a zoned incised Pukara-style sherd and fragments of a Nasca flaring bowl (Fig- ures 8 and 9). Not only is this the southernmost find of a Nasca vessel, but it is also the only case in which Pukara and Nasca pottery have been associated in the same site, and both appear to represent trade pieces found at the far limits of their respective long- distance exchange networks. The ranty of these exot- ica, in association with an architecturally elite domestic site of Huaracane affiliation, suggests that everyday domestic access to these exotic imports was limited indeed. With the results of full-coverage survey, it is now clear that Pukara and Nasca polychrome sherds and textiles represent a minority trade component within a predominantly local ceramic assemblage. The con- text of these exotic imports in relation to Huaracane settlement pattern points away from direct colo- nization by highland groups. No site component with a Pukara residential occupation has been encoun- tered, and no Pukara plainware ceramic assemblages demonstrated. Instead, Pukara-style sherds or textiles were encountered at only nine sites, seven of which had Huaracane majority assemblages.3 Most impor- tantly, five of the Pukara finds were associated with Huaracane cemeteries, three of them with a rare inter- ment type known as the "boot tomb." It is necessary to examine the development of this indigenous elite mortuary tradition in Huaracane before considering its relationship to exotic wade goods. Huaracane Mortuary Tradition Recent considerations of long-distance exchange in the Andes suggest that exotic ceramics and other offerings are more likely to be found in mortuary than in domestic contexts. The inclusion of foreign funer- ary ceramics among otherwise local offerings usu- ally represents the curation of foreign objects as status signifiers within a local mortuary tradition (Browman 1997:232; Mujica 1985:1 1 1; Stanish 1989:7).

Such a sit- uation in the Huaracane Mortuary tradition might be easier to discern than the minimal representation of foreign imports in elite residential sites like M103. The Huaracane mortuary tradition was complex, with a variety of burial types represented. Isolated burials found in some Huaracane habitation sites consisted of individual and multiple interments of flexed individuals in simple pits or cylindrical cysts.4 No pottery offerings have been found in any of these tombs, though a variety of bone or shell beads do appear. Given the informality of the graves them- selves and the absence of offerings, these informal pit burials appear to be the least elaborate and per- haps lowest status of Huaracane interments. Tumulo or mound burials were found at 44 ceme- tery components. As at M73, most tu'mulo cemeter- ies were immediately adjacent to Huaracane terrace habitation areas, suggesting their contemporaneity Figure 10. Tumulo profile, site M17.</page><page sequence="15">Goldsteln] EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 349 as community burial grounds. The Moquegua tumu- los are clustered circular or irregular mounds of sand and loose stone, measuring between 2 and 7 m in diameter and up to 3 m in height. Cross sections exposed in 1998 test excavations at M73 and else- where in road cuts and looter's pits indicate a con- struction technique of alternating layers of sterile sand and gravel fill with layers of grasses, reeds, sticks or other vegetal matter (Figure 10). The dis- covery of a clearly secondary interment in the M73 tumulo suggests that construction layers could cor- respond to sequenced additions of interments over time and the careful reburial of ancestral remains in family burial mounds. Tumulos examined to date included no ceramic offerings. Test excavations at M73 tumulo 1, and surface finds at sites leveled by bulldozing in the late 1980s, indicate that tumulo offerings were limited to textiles, including garments, mats, and containers of Z-spun twined vegetable fiber, cotton, wool, human hair, and composites. Some of these appear to have a "warp-turn twined" end selvage, similar to those known from the Paracas culture area in the Early Horizon (Wallace 1979:35, 1991:65). While these features suggest an early date for this site, other tu'mulo sites have yielded loom-made warp-face plain weaves, which could indicate a later date. Samples from the 1998 excavation of Tumulo 1 at Tres Quebradas M73 yielded uncalibrated radio- carbon ages of 2220 + 42 B.P. for the foundation log and 2112 + 42 B.P. for sticks associated with the sec- ondary burial (Table 3). With an additional date of 2140 + 50 B.P. for a post sample collected from a bulldozer-exposed tumulo at site M17, the 2-sigma ranges for Middle Moquegua Valley tumulos extend from 385 cal B.C. to cal A.D. 2. In form and con- struction, the Moquegua tumulos resemble those of the Alto Ramirez tradition of Chile's Azapa Valley, which has been dated from 500 B.C. to A.D. 300 (Munoz Ovalle 1987:93,1996:121). Dates between 100 cal B.C. and cal A.D. 380 have been reported for tumulo components associated with neckless ollas at the Algorrobal site in the coastal Osmore Val- ley (Owen 1993a, 1993b). This would indicate that the Moquegua tumulos are roughly contemporane- ous with both traditions. Huaracane "boot-shaped" shaft and chamber tombs, unlike tumulos, have not been reported else- where in the south centralAndes, and only eight such cemeteries have been located in Moquegua.

Omo M1OY boot tomb cemetery plan. the tumulo cemeteries, the boot tomb cemeteries are separated spatially from the Huaracane habitation sites, typically on bluffs with commanding views of the valley. These cemeteries are all heavily disturbed, and have the surface appearance of jumbled piles of large stones that stand out above the desert surface. Despite this distrbance, Huaracane boot tomb ceme- teries are distinguished from other sites in the valley by circular stone rings 2-3 meters in diameter and conical depressions of loose gravel fill and voids (Goldstein 1989). Excavations in the Huaracane boot tomb ceme- tery at Omo M10 (M1OY) conducted in 1987 offer some insight on these surface remains. Like the other boot tomb cemeteries, the M1OY cemetery compo- nent was located on the edge of a bluflD directly over- looking the irrigated valley (Figure 11). Although it was later overtaken by a sprawling Tiwanaku settle- ment, the cemetery was isolated at the time of bur- ial, with no contiguous Huaracane domestic area. The tombs were "boot-shaped" in profile, consisting of unlined shafts up to 3.5 meters in depth with rounded</page><page sequence="17">EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 351 Goldstein] Figure 12. Omo M1OY boot tomb 5 profile. chambers off to one side at the shaft's base (Figure 12). Wooden sticks and layers of cane-impressed mud plaster found in and around the excavated tombs indicate the presence of sealed roofing over the shaft, and perhaps a wattle-and-daub superstructure over the surface stone ring. Most interments were origi- nally placed in the basal chambers, or "toe" of the boot, apparently in a tightly flexed position. In tomb 2, one infant burial with a necklace of malachite and lapis lazuli beads was placed in the upper super- structure, perhaps awaiting secondary interment in the chamber below, or as a dedicatory offering to the principle interment. Roofing wood from boot tombs at Omo M1OY and Trapiche M7 has been dated to 1990 + 70 B.P. (2 sigma 170 cal B.C. - cal A.D. 140) and 1860 + 70 B.P. (2 sigma cal A.D. 5 - 340) (Table 3). The available dates indicate that the boot tomb type appeared toward the end of the longer-lived tumulo tradition, and may have either supplemented or replaced it. Although the "boot tomb" type is reminiscent of the "bottle-shaped" "Cavernas" tombs of Cerro Col- orado on the Paracas Peninsula (Paul 1991:13, 23; Tello andMejiaXesspe 1979:119-120), eventhis for- mal similarity is tenuous, as the Huaracane boot tombs are considerably more recent. Neither is there a precedent for this type of tomb construction in any of the altiplano cultures. The shaft and chamber con- struction of the boot tomb crypts also contrasts sharply with earlier Huaracane interments. Unlike the tumulo and cyst burials, the boot tomb's deep shafts and chambers were roofed over, possibly for future access, and capped by substantial surface structures that may have served as charnel houses for a staged burial process or as antechambers for the family crypts. Because boot tombs are rare, and appear only late in the Huaracane sequence, these features suggest the introduction of new mortuary traditions that sepa- rated elites from the rest of late Huaracane society. In another break from the tumulo tradition, boot tombs were designed to accommodate large numbers of offerings. The M1OY interments were accompa- nied by Huaracane pottery, elaborate polychrome basketry, textiles, carved wooden lime dippers, and anthropomorphic spoons and elaborate beads of bone, wood, shell, rolled copper sheet, and green and blue polished stone (Figure 13). Most of the Huaracane boot tombs were disturbed</page><page sequence="18">l - l- l - - - l --- - : v&lt;52 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 11, No. 4, 2000 il0S2t27 i10t2r30 Figure 13. Omo M1OY boot tomb offerings in antiquity. In the M1OY excavations, construction rubble, human bone, ceramic fragments, textiles, and other artifacts were distributed both within the tomb shafts and in surrounding spoils on the surface. Stratigraphy indicates that this looting took place long before the volcanic ash fall of Huayna Putina on February 19, 1600. The preservation of articulated feet cemented by silts to the floors of some tombs suggests that the tombs were sacked after the bod- ies had been in place for some time in mummified state. In addition, an articulated male adult was interred in the loose backfill of the tomb shaft at some time after the destruction and scattering of the original contents of the chamber, butbefore the 1600 ash fall (Figure 14). The interloper's seated flexed position and east-facing orientation suggest that the inter- ment dates to the Tiwanaku occupation, although no offerings were associated with this intrusive burial (Goldstein 1989). Tiwanaku reuse of pre-Tiwanaku cemeteries has been noted in the Azapa valley, where Tiwanaku burials or offerings are often located adja- cent to Alto Ramirez tumulos (Focacci and Erices 1971 ; Goldstein 1996). ForTiwanaku, ancestral bur- ial places could have been both targets for wrathful destruction and a touchstone to local sources of polit- ical or cosmological power. With a physical presence at high status Huaracane or Alto Ramirez cemeter- ies, Tiwanaku colonists could have appropriated the heritage of local leaders to legitimize control of newly colonized regions. Ironically, the looting and reuse of boot tombs by the Tiwanaku may have been the ultimate compliment paid to the elites of late Huaracane. Ihe appearance of this relatively elaborate and richly fumished tomb type late in the Huaracane tra- dition may represent the development of an entirely new form of elite mortuary practice and status dis- play. Indeed, the boot tomb cemeteries' small num- ber, preferred locations, and the high labor investment in their construction indicate that they were family crypts of local elites and attest to a level of complexity to funerary ceremony hitherto unseen in the region.

Exotic Funerary OJ%erings and Huaracane Elites In 1998, the MAS project returned to the Cerro Trapiche site, to conduct systematic surface collec- tions. Cerro Trapiche (M7), located on the slopes, peaks, and saddles of a high hill with commanding views of the Middle Moquegua Valley, is a multi- component site with occupation sectors of Huara- cane, Wari, and late Tiwanaku afliliation. Although originally interpreted as a "rockpile" of destroyed Pukara public architecture (Feldman 1989), Cerro Trapiche's sector C (M7C) is now understood to con- sist of destroyed "boot tombs" with a moderate-to- dense surface scatter of ceramic sherds, human bone, and stone and shell beads. At 1.06 hectares, M7C is the largest "boot tomb" cemetery in Moquegua. As expected, the Trapiche M7C cemetery pro- duced the strongest minority representation of Pukara pottery in systematic surface collections. Pukara sherds accounted for 2.31 percent of the Early Inter- mediate Period collection at Trapiche, the majority component being "Huaracane Arena" neckless olla sherds (Table 2).5 Pukara imports were far more prevalent than at M103 or any Moquegua habitation site, suggesting that the ultimate destination of Pukara polychromes was to accompany the other- wise local offerings in Huaracane boot tomb burials. The excavated boot tombs of Omo M1OY have produced only local Huaracane ceramics. Nonethe- less, a small number of extraordinary textile artifacts from the M1OY Huaracane cemetery are diagnostic of exotic origin. Following such a surface find, a 3 x 4 test excavation was located to expose part of Bur- ial structure 1, an area of destroyed surface mortu- ary architecture bounded by a ring of massive stones. Although this burial structure was ravaged by the pre- 1600 looting, textiles, other offerings, and the disar- ticulated remains of at least 3 adults, one juvenile</page><page sequence="20">, e 2s w s 7 w {l,teil-g Figure 15.

Textile fragments in a remarkable variety of camelid wool, cotton, and composite fabrics were also recovered. These included embroidered fringes, gauze-like balanced weaves, and twill reminiscent of the Paracas-Nasca tradition of the south coast of Peru, and fragments of interlocked tapestry. Careful matching of textile fragments suggest that all of these exotic textiles were from a single looted boot tomb (Burial Struc- ture 1, tomb 1), which contained disarticulated remains of a juvenile of 12-18 years, a young adult of 2 W25 years, and an older male adult. Most remarkable in this reconstructed assemblage were the remains of a composite garment consisting of a balanced-weave cotton cloth surrounded by a border of elaborate wool tabs embroidered around a foundation of loosely twisted cotton threads (Figure 15). The tabs were embroidered with "I"-shaped geo- metric designs executed in alternating combinations of red, blue, brown, green, and yellow. Composite garments with this type of embroidered tabs are asso- ciated only with the Paracas and early Nasca textile traditions (Silvernan 1991:382-392).This particu- lar garment may have been a rectangular, gauze-like turban with embroidered border edges (Paul 1979: 17-18). Seriations of Paracas-style textiles sug- gest that the embroidered tabs developed in Epoch 2 of the Early Intermediate Period between 300 and 150 B.C., and continued in use through the early phases of Nasca (Etowe 1979; Sawyer 1997), con- sistent with the dates reported for the boot tomb finds. Examples of identical embroidered tab gar- ments from Cabezas Achatadas and other early Nasca sites in the Sihuas valley, are in the collection of Universidad Nacional San Agustin, Arequipa. The Omo M 10Y cemetery finds represent the southern- most known example of this highly diagnostic Para- cas-Nasca textile technique. This same tomb lot also included the remains of an interlocked tapestry garment of an altiplano tex- tile style (Figure 16). Design reconstruction ofthese fragments reveals a zoomorphic "leashed" camelid motif in blue, red, green, yellow, and brown colors. This motif, although also associated with Tiwanaku, has Pukara antecedents (Chavez 1992), while the interlocked tapestry and loop stitch embroidered sel- vage techniques are highly diagnostic of both alta- plano traditions (Conklin 1983; Oakland 1985; Etodman 1992). The discovery of both Paracas-Nasca and Pukara- Tiwanaku style from within the same tomb is extra- B..t t.;&gt;;.'1g4g! WS. ,, t n Xi , ,,,,, h. # tf v; X ::; wi't ' 'W.'f,i!gt ou ,*, , t a.

Altiplano style tapestry textile, M1OY boot tomb 1. negotiated their way through a web of reciprocal obligations, kin and marriage ties, bonds of mentor- ship, expersence and authority, and control of the transmission of esoteric information. NonethelessS along with local status signifiers, the trade and dis- play of exotic preciosities could be a tangible man- ifestation of the genesis of chiefly power. Perhaps even before chiefs could monopolize resources and finance their own crafts specialists, access to scarce, imported and highly valued "special wealth' (Earle 1996:185) could legitimize leadershipS attract fol- lowers, and thwart competing political coalitions. Tracking exotic exchange can be one of our most important entrees to the local origins of chiefdoms. In cases where less complex polities interact with complex societies, globalist perspectives assume that exchange and power relations were asymmetrical and externally imposed, remaking peripheries as client dependencies. This does not seem to be case in Huaracane. The few Pukara and Paracas-Nasca ordinary. The boot tombs, although built in an entirely local style of mortuary architectureS were fur- nished not only with local ofTerings of exceptional materials and craftsmanship, but garments brought from the faraway state centers of the Perllvian Pacific coast and the Titicaca basin of the altiplano. If these were the family crypts of an emerging cohort of everyday chiefs, how, and more importantly, why did they seek, procure, and display such exotic apparel along with their local finery? Conclusion: Exotica and the Origins of Andean Chiefdoms The circulation of exotic preciosities among elites is often emphasized as a key element in the construc- tion of early power relations in small-scale societies. This emphasis is not because exotica alone govemed these relations. We must assume that the origin of chiefly power was rooted in control over critical resources of land and labor, and that emergent chiefs</page><page sequence="22">356 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 47 2000 elements discovered in Moquegua do not meet the criteria for globalist models of clientage or colo- nization directed by foreign polities. There is no evi- dence that the Huaracane tradition adopted foreign settlement patterns, public or domestic architecture, cuisine, or domestic economy, nor indeed that the emulation of foreign-state styles brought about any significant culture change. The small number of both Pukara and Paracas-Nasca-style artifacts in Moquegua, and their association with a small sub- set of Huaracane sites, instead supports an agency- oriented local perspective on exotica. Their primary distnbution at elite mortuary sites and, to a lesser degree, at domestic sites with high proportions of fine local pottery signals an emerging cohort of empow- ered individuals or families within a tradition of oth- erwise local character. The genesis of an entirely local signifier of sta- tus is manifested in the first century B.C. appearance of the unique Huaracane burial type known as the boot tomb. The precious nature of the boot tombs' predominantly local offerings and the substantial labor investment in the tomb construction indicate that these burials were reserved for elite individuals and their families. This conspicuous mortuary dis- play marks a dramatic addition to the long-standing tradition of tu'mulo burials in the area, and may rep- resent the symbolic separation of chiefly lineages from the local population. Exotic grave goods would have been tangible symbols of the special privileges of such a lineage. The eclectic nature of these exot- ica which included ceramics and textiles imported from both the Peruvian south coast and the alti- plano suggests that exchange ties were not the exclusive clientage relationships suggested by glob- alist models. Most archaeologists view imported prestige goods as an index of intensity of long-distance eco- nomic interaction among elites. From outside, elite interaction spheres can be seen as networks that employed material cues to build patron-client rela- tionships between leaders in distant lands. Yet even if elite interaction networks reified new trans- regional social identities, their primary puipose was to consolidate power on the local scene. The small number, specific context, and, above all, the eclecti- cism of the exotica found in Huaracane suggest that their significance was not to unite peer elites across geographic space, but to separate elites from com- moners across local social space. Exotica like Pukara or Paracas-Nasca clothing, jewelry, or pottery found in intermediate regions like Moquegua were sym- bols that distinguished early chiefs from their own people. It is customary to think of elites living on the peripheries of states as the receivers, rather than the makers, of history. This view must expand to accom- modate the peripheries' own "aggrandizers." Even as these emergent chiefs of intermediate areas learned to manipulate a wide nexus of cultural, economic, and political contacts, the exotica they collected were more important as local displays of power than as any marker of allegiance to a foreign power. The archaeological evidence in the south central Andes suggests that emerging elites ventured into the com- plex landscape of long-distance trade for their own parochial interests. This pattern of autonomous con- tact flounshed for centunes, ending at some time before the valley's incorporation into the Tiwanaku state system. Future research will shed light on the fate of the everyday chiefs of these intermediate areas, and their ancient roles as cultural brokers. Acknowledgments. Robert Feldman and Michael Moseley dis- covered the CerroTrapiche (M7) and Huaracane sites in 1983 and posed some of the key questions that ultimately led to this arti- cle. Initial research at the Omo M1OY cemetery was conducted in 1987 under a Fulbright-Hays Dissertation Fellowship. The Moquegua Archaeological Survey (MAS) was supported by 1993-1994 grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation and the J M. Kaplan Fund and in 1998-1999 by the US/ED Fulbright-Hays Faculty Research Abroad Program, NSF Standard Grant Award 9809720, a Dartmouth College Junior Faculty fellowship, and an H. John Heinz III Fund Grant for Archaeological Research, and conducted in agreement with the Instituto Nacional de Cultura under INC 003-94-CNTCICMA/INC, INC C/060-98 and 415/INC. I am indebted to the Omo and MAS projects' field crew, including Augusto Cardona, Antonio Oquiche, Adan Umire, Amanda Cohen, M6nika Barrionuevo, Matthew Bandy, Timothy McAndrews, Kayoko Toshihara, Ernesto Lazaro, Antonio Gamonal; to Dartmouth students Christine DuRocher, Sidney Carter, Allison Davis, and Ruby Chan; and to the Asociacion Contisuyo and the Contisuyo Museum staff. Analysis by Amy Oakland Rodman determined the importance of the M1OY tex- tile finds, and William Conklin and Mary Frame have offered valu- able advice on textile artifacts. I appreciate the constructive responses of colleagues to prior versions of parts of this article presented at the 1 8th Midwest Conference on Andean and Ama- zonian Archaeology and Ethnohistory, Chicago, and at the 59th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Ana- heim. Deborah Nichols, Katharina Schreiber, Anita Cook, Helaine Silverman, Jana Fortier, and six anonymous reviewers offered valuable comments on versions of this manuscript; remaining errors are, of course, my own.</page><page sequence="23">Goldstein] EXOTIC GOODS AND EVERYDAY CHIEFS 357 References Cited Abu-Lughod, J.

Following convention, I use "south coast" to refer to the Paracas-Nasca culture area. I use "extreme south coast" in the absence of an accepted term for more southerly sections of the Peruvian and northern Chilean coast. 2. Using Tello's terminology, Paracas style reached its apogee on the peninsula in the Cavernas (500 B.C.-100 B.C.) and Necropolis (100 B.C.-300 A.D.) Phases (Garcia and Pinilla 1995:5S59)- 3. Pukara-style sherds were found in association with Tiwanaku majority assemblages at two sites. 4. An extended burial at M73 has not been dated and may pre-date the Huaracane occupation. Extended burials in Moquegua are usually associated with Preceramic occupations (Torres et al. 1984; Wise et al. 1994). 5. A total of 1776 sherds were collected in a 50% area TSP at M7C. Counts were augmented by 50% of 234 sherds from the unprovenienced collections made of the same sector in 1983 by Feldman and Moseley. This M7C collection also included 784 Middle Horizon plainware, 115 Wari Chakipampa serving ware, 87 Tiwanaku red slipped, and 1 Tiwanaku black ware sherds, which are not included in Table 2. These were associated with Tiwanaku cist tomb cemeteries and Wari stone architecture located adjacent to the "rockpile" cemetery.</page></plain_text>
