<plain_text><page sequence="1">A New Bronze Lar and the Role of the Lares in the Domestic and Civic Religion of the Romans A Roman male divinity known as a "Lar" is represented in this bronze stat- uette in a private European collection (fig. 1-7) (')• Although many images of this protective spirit have come down to us from antiquity, few are of as high quali- ty as this figure. In the art of the imperial period the Lar usually appears as a beautiful androgynous youth wearing a tunic and high boots or sandals and car- rying various objects with sacral significance. In keeping with this iconography, our Lar has a girlish hairdo and wears a sleeveless tunic bound at both shoulders with simple round brooches and a large overfold of cloth completely concealing the belt (fig. 4). The lower part of the tunic billows out behind, indicating motion. On his feet are thin-soled open-work sandals ( crepidae ) (fig. 7), influenced by Greek models (2). With the heel of his right foot lifted fairly high off the ground and the heel of his advanced left foot slightly raised, this figure is represented dancing, a common pose for a Lar. The statuette is remarkably well preserved, aside from missing part of the raised left arm and the objects that were once held. The figure was hollow cast in one piece, with an opening in the bottom of the tunic revealing the interior. The surface is patinated in both light and dark shades of green. Earth and brown- ish incrustations are evident all over the surface of the figure, especially in the locks of hair, in the folds of the garment, on the sandals, in the creases of parts of the body, and in the small pock holes from the casting process. A small hole in the sole of the right sandal indicates that the Lar was once attached by means (1) For the Lar (pl. Lares), see F. Boehm, Lar in RE , XII. 1, 1924, col. 806-833 ; M. F.

Recently made file marks on the back of the right leg have exposed the original color of the bronze. The dimensions of the figure are as follows : Total height 28 cm Width at waist 6.2 cm Width of lower tunic 7.3 cm Height of head (from chin to top of head) 3.7 cm Width of head 4.0 cm Depth of head 3.5 cm The Lar's tunic-clad body, face, and hair are exquisitely rendered in a classi- cizing manner. The face is round and smooth, with individual features that are beautifully modeled (fig. 5). The brows and nose are sharp ; the lips are full and inlaid with copper. The corneas of the eyes have been silvered, and the irises, rendered as two deep holes. The hair is parted down the middle, and the head is completely ringed with plastically modeled locks that are soft, thick, wavy, and curly. By contrast, the individual strands of hair at the top and back of the head (fig. 6) are incised in a linear fashion. The fingers of the preserved right hand have been carefully articulated. The flowing and agitated folds of the tunic are crisply and naturalistically rendered, with narrow inlaid strips of copper running vertically down either side from the shoulders, on both the front and back of the garment. The leather work of the open-toe sandals (fig. 7) has been carefully depicted with great attention to detail, as evident in the representation of the indi- vidual straps and wide leather tongue on the front part of the sandals. In Roman religion there were two kinds of Lares, the Lar Familiaris , or Familial Lar, and the Lares Compítales , or Lares of the Crossroads (from com- pitimi , literally "the place where two roads crossed"). Lares were propitious spirits that guarded the home and fields, the boundaries of which were usually defined by crossroads, which they protected in country and city alike (3). Because of their association with Mars, who is both an agricultural and a military god, the Lares were venerated in the Roman army, which early on was made up of citi- zen farmers (4). In Roman homes the Lares were usually accorded daily worship, in which household slaves played a prominent role that bound them closely to the master of the house {dominus). As part of the extended Roman familia, slaves (3) See M. C. Waites, The Nature of the Lares and their Representation in Roman Art in AJA 24, 1920, p. 241-261, which also deals with the scholarly debate on whether the Lares were associated specifically with places or individuals.

Legend has it that the Lares' festival, the Compitalia , went back to King Servius Tullius, who was of servile origin (5). By the late Republic the Lares came to represent the souls of departed ancestors. The cult of ancestors and of the compita were related through chthonic worship, that is, the worship of gods of the earth with fertility associations (6). The Lares Familiares were wor- shiped in special household shrines (larario) along with the genius , the divine procreative spirit/force of the father of the family ( paterfamilias ), and other gods of the home (7). Among the household divinities associated with the Lares are the Penates, literally the protective spirits of the pantry, who - unlike the Lares - were not represented in anthropomorphic form in domestic contexts (8). The word Penates came to refer to all the gods worshiped at home (9). The other type of Lar, the Lar Compitalis , is usually not represented as a sin- gle figure, but as a pair of figures, hence the usual plural designation Lares Compítales. Their principal temple in Rome, the Aedes Larum , was located on the Velia, a spur of the Palatine Hill at the far southeastern end of the Roman Forum. Between 12 and 7 B.C. Augustus revived and reorganized the cult of the (5) Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiquitates Romanae IV, 14, 3-4 ; Pliny, Naturalis Historia XXXVI, 204. Cf. Varro, De Lingua Latina VI, 25. (6) M. С. Waiths [П. 3], p. 241-242. (7) Sometimes the Juno , the divine spirit of the mother of the family ( materfamilias ), was likewise worshiped : Pliny, Naturalis Historia II, 16. Cf. also Tibullus III, 6, 47-48. 12, 19-20 ; Petronius XXV. For a woman's Juno in domestic worship, see D. G. Orr [n. 4], p. 1570 ; T. Fröhlich [n. 1], p. 25. For the genius, see especially D. G. Orr [n. 4], p. 1569-1575. (8) For the Penates, see S. Weinstock, Penates in RE XIX, 1, 1937, p. 417-457 ; R. Mambella, Penates in LIMC VII, 1994, p. 288-291. Unlike the domestic cult, the Penates Publici of the state cult are often likened to the Castores (Castor and Pollux) in certain respects (i.e., they appear as two youths holding spears), though they were not worshiped with the Castores (Latin version of the Greek Dioskouroi) in the Aedes Castoris in the Roman Forum, but in their own temple, the Aedes Penatium , on the near- by Velian Hill. The Velia was the location, too, of the Temple of the Lares, the Aedes Larum. See further E. Simon [n. 1], p. 37. The Dioskouroi are also guardians of doorways, hence their association with the domestic deities of the Romans, the Lares and Penates. Before their iconography became more fixed by early imperial times, the Lares and Penates can sometimes be confused, especially since the Penates came to be represented like the Dioskouroi/Castores : See, e.g., the coin of L. Caesius in 112 or 111 B.C. on which the Lares are represented as two seated semi-nude youths holding spears with a dog, another guardian figure, between them : M. H. Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage , Cambridge, 1994, p. 312 (no. 298) ; see further M. C. Waites [n. 3], p. 251-253. The Penates are represented seated, without the dog, in the porch of their temple in the Aeneas panel of the Ara Pacis Augustae : E. Simon, Ara Pads Augustae , Greenwich, Conn., 1967, pl. 24. (9) See D. G. Orr [n. 4], p. 1562-1563 ; T. Fröhlich [n. 1], p. 23. Servius (adAen. II, 514) states explicitly : Penates sunt omnes dii qui domi coluntur.</page><page sequence="4">394 J. POLLINI Lares Compítales and had shrines with marble altars set up to them at the com- pita of the 265 vici ("districts") of the City of Rome (,0). To their worship he added his own divine procreative spirit, the Genius Augusti , as a result of which - by a conflation of sorts - these public Lares came to be called the Lares Augusti. In this way the populace of Rome, especially the lower classes, became bound through religion to Augustus, since as Pater Patriae he became in a sense the paterfamilias of all Romans. Besides having Lares altars erected in the numerous vici of the City, Augustus distributed statuettes of his own Genius and Lares to those appointed to the cult of the Lares. Each of the vici was adminis- tered by four vicomagistri , usually freedmen, who were in turn assisted by four slaves called vicoministri (n). The administering of the Lares cult of the vici by former slaves again demonstrates the prominence accorded the servile class in the worship of the Lares. On several of the Augustan Lares altars that have come down to us, the Lares Compítales are represented. On one of these, the "Belvedere Altar" in the Vatican Museum (fig. 8) (12), Augustus himself is shown handing over to the vicoministri two Lares statuettes that appear to be about the size of our small bronze Lar. Since so many figures were needed for the vici , they were undoubtedly also made of bronze, which lends itself to mass production. The strong connection of the Lares with domestic worship and the prominent role of slaves in that worship (13) help to explain the iconography of the Lar. It is likely that the youthful, idealized, rather effeminate-looking appearance of the (10) For Lares altars, see in general P.

Simon, Augustus : Kunst und Leben in Rom um die Zeitenwende , Munich, 1986, p. 97-103 and fig. 127 for the "Belvedere Altar" in the Vatican showing Augustus handing over the two Lares statues to the vicoministri. The relief broken in two parts commonly known as the "Vicomagistri Altar" ("Smaller Cancelleria Relief') shows a procession in which three youths wearing unbelted tunics carry statuettes of two Lares Augusti and the Genius Augusti. In my opinion this relief may have once formed part of the inner altar of the monumental Ara Providentiae Augustae, set up by Tiberius. This altar probably stood opposite Augustus' Ara Pacis, to which it would have been a pendant, and at the same distance as the Ara Pacis from the Via Lata : J. Pollini, Divine Providence in Early Imperial Ideology : The Smaller Cancelleria Relief and the Ara Providentiae Augustae (forthcoming in J. Pollini, From Republic to Empire : Rhetoric, Religion, and Power in the Visual Culture of Ancient Rome , Norman, Oklahoma). (13) The Lares cult helped to bind slaves to the paterfamilias. Slaves also swore by his genius , the divine procreative spirit closely associated with the Lares that is connected with fertility and the ancestors of the paterfamilias : see M. C. Waites [n. 3], p. 246 et passim.</page><page sequence="5">A NEW BRONZE LAR AND THE ROLE OF THE LARES 395 Lar reflects actual delicati , adolescent slave-boys who were prized for their androgynous beauty and who served their masters at table, at sacrifices, and in bed (,4). In Roman society, which was highly influenced by Greek customs, these youths were regarded as the embodiment of ideal adolescent beauty and were objects of sexual desire. This type of androgynous-looking young slave is repre- sented in an idealized, under life-size bronze statue of early imperial date in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome (fig. 9-10) (15). Delicati were present at sacri- fices, where they served their masters as sacrificial assistants (, ministri ), reflect- ing the Roman belief that the altars of the gods should be surrounded by the most beautiful things. The fact that our Lar and others like it are shown dancing is also important, since in ancient Rome dancing was generally considered a servile activity. In this regard there may be some influence from the Greek Corybantes, divine figures who danced (,6). That Lares are often represented pouring wine from a rhyton (a horn-like serving vessel for wine) into a patera (a libation bowl) or a situla (a sacrificial bucket) suggests some connection also with the Greek god Dionysos (17), a god of fertility. Like the rites of Dionysos/Liber, the feast of the Lares was an occasion of joy and merrymaking. Modern scholarship has divided the Lares into two general types, based on their iconography (18). Type I, or the "Dancing Type", shows the figure dancing, with an upraised left hand holding a rhyton that usually terminates in a decora- tive animal protome. In the lowered, outstretched right hand the Lar holds vari- ous objects, often a patera or situla , but sometimes a palm or laurel branch. By contrast, Type II, or the "Static Type", is usually shown as a standing figure, holding in the lowered left hand a cornucopia (,9), a symbol of fertility, and in the (14) For these slave-boys in general, see F.

POLLINI lowered right hand a patera. These two attributes are typically carried by the genius of the paterfamilias or the Genius Augusti , both of which we have seen to be closely associated with the Lares in cult worship. Our Lar clearly belongs to Type I, the "Dancing Type". The position of his raised left arm indicates that he would have once held a rhyton in his now miss- ing hand. His lowered, outstretched right hand with palm upward shows that he originally held a separately fashioned and attached patera (20). In some painted versions of this type of Lar, a thin stream of wine flows from the raised rhyton in an arc, often over the head, into a situla or patera (2I). Sometimes the stream of wine is only implied. The symbolic gesture of pouring wine into a patera sig- nifies that the Lar is to be the recipient of a real libation of wine made by the worshiper. The two vertical copper inlaid strips that run down either side of his tunic represent the angusti clavi , or narrow crimson stripes (22), that were worn on the short-sleeved tunics of members of the ordo equestris (23). The majority of surviving Lares figures - especially the poorer quality ones - usually lack any stripes. Some scholars are of the opinion that they were only an added decora- tive element, especially in higher quality statuettes (24). Alternately, the angusti clavi on Lares figures may have originally signified the equestrian status of the family to which the Lares belonged (25). That distinction may have become blurred when Augustus, who came from an equestrian family, gave his Lares to the urban cult. Augustus' own Lares were probably represented with angusti clavi on their tunics. The mass production of these figures for the 265 vici of the City undoubtedly came to exert an enormous influence on the Lares figures cre- ated for domestic cult worship, whether the families who included them in their lararia were equestrian or not. In the past, the "Dancing Type" (Type I) has been called the "Lares Compítales " type ; the "Static Type" (Type II), the " Lar Familiaris " type. These typological designations create the false impression that only the "Dancing Tempelschatz von Weißenburg i. Bay, Mainz, 1993, p. 58-60 (no. 14), color plate, and pl. 43-45. See also E.

When holding a situ- la , the hand is normally held down, with the back of the hand facing us and with fingers bent to clasp the loop-handle of the bucket. In holding the laurel or palm branch, the hand is also held down. (21) See, e.g., T. Fröhlich [n. 1], pl. 1. 4, 2. 10, 2. 14, 2. 35, 1. 36, 2. 40, 3. 44, 2. 49, 3. 50, 2. 53, 1.

Both types are in fact commonly found as both statuettes and painted figures in domestic contexts, as we know from a wealth of evidence, especially from Pompeii and Herculaneum (27). Interestingly, the "Dancing Type" is more common than the "Static Type" in domestic lararia - further testimony to the impact of Augustan iconography and religious ideology in Roman society as a whole (28). Because we do not know the provenance of our Lar, we cannot determine whether it was once set up in a domestic lararium or a public shrine in some city or town. The size of the figure and its high quality make either context possible. The lack of any provincial stylistic elements suggests that it was produced in some Italian workshop, probably in central Italy (29). Whether it was then exported elsewhere is unknown on the basis of our present knowledge. Most bronze Lares figures date to the imperial period after the time of Augustus' reform of their cult. In the careful and detailed treatment of the forms and drapery, especially the deep valleys of the sinuous folds of the billowing skirt, our Lar resembles works produced in the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods, such as the high quality bronze Lar with angusti clavi from Nagydém in the Bakonyer Museum in Veszprém (Hungary) (fig. 11-12) (30) and a Lar in the Musée de la civilisation Gallo-Romaine in Lyon (fig. 13-14) (31). Both these figures are also very much like our Lar in the treatment of the facial features (32) (26) See, e.g., the discussion in E. B. Thomas and V. Tran Там Tinh (n. 18 above). (27) See, e.g., D. G. Orr [n. 4] ; S. Adamo Muscettola, Osservazioni sulla compo- sizione dei larari con statuette in bronzo di Pompei ed Ercolano in Toreutik und figürliche Bronzen römischer Zeit , edited by U.

The mirror-reverse locks at the corners of the forehead curl down toward the eyes, like the outer contours of a Lesbian kymation. However, in our Lar, unlike the other two, the ends of these locks turn up again like little fish-hooks. The feminized hairstyle of this and similar Lar figures ultimately goes back to Classical models for both young males and females. These Classical coiffures greatly influenced an Augustan and Julio-Claudian female hairstyle with hair parted in the middle - the so-called "Mittelscheitelfrisur" (33). Also recalling our Lar in the treatment of the folds of drapery, facial features, and clas- sicizing hairstyle, though on a larger scale, is the statue of an idealized, androg- ynous slave-boy ministrant in the Palazzo dei Conservatori mentioned above (fig. 9-10). The Conservatori Ministrant, which has been dated to the Claudian period, also sports a classicizing hairstyle, but the ends of the long sinuous locks over his forehead do not turn down toward the eyes, as they do in our Lar and those from Nagydém (fig. 12) and Lyon (fig. 14). The Lesbian kymation-like for- mation of locks over the forehead of our statuette finds something of a parallel in the hairstyles of portraits of Agrippina Maior that date to the principates of her son Caligula (37-41) and her brother Claudius (41-54) (34). Even the little upturned fish-hook curls at the ends of the long sinuous locks over the forehead are found in some of her portraits (35). Based on these stylistic considerations, our Lar was probably produced some time in the second quarter of the first century A.D. and would therefore not have been contemporaneous with the Lares shrines set up by Augustus in the 265 vici of Rome in connection with the revival and reorganization of the cult in 12-7 B.C.
