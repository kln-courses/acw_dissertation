Lestrelin Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics Peugeot- Renault Association (France) J. Hureau Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris France C. Got, F. Guillon, and A. Patel I.R.B.A. Raymond Poincaré Hospital Garches, France ABSTRACT Accidentological étudiés show?f irstly, what kind of injurieą are sustained by seat- belt weaęeęą in frontal collisions , to abdomen, luiņbar spine and lower members and, secondly, how to determine their frequencies and severities» Corresponding data are presented. Then, a synthesis is made &gt; in which the re- suits of extensive cadaver testing -»more than 300 human subjects^ are examined with particular empha sis on the abdominal injuries, and on the associa- tion of injuries, such as lumbar spine injuries. Causation is particularly looked at, This experi- mental survey is completed by the results of spe*- cialized testing in abdominal tolerance when sub- marining occurs. These two surveys enable the development of protection. Finally, former attempts for defining an ab- dominai protection criterion are reviewed and a final definition for such a criterion is presen- ted and justified. ABDOMINAL PROTECTION IN AUTOMOBILE ACCI- DENTS IS A SUBJECT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EX- PANDED UPON IN LITTERATURE ON ACCIDENTOLOGY AND BIOMECHANICS. It is true that the head, thorax and lower members were the areas where those sustaining multiple injuries were the most frequently and most severely injured, Injuries in these areas we- re often evident (coma, breathing problems and fractures of long bones) whilst the possible sha- re of abdominal injuries is more difficult to as- certain. In fatal accidents in particular, the au- topsy is too often incomplete and only indicates the main injuries which are enough to account for the cause of death. Here again, abdominal inju- ries are often ignored in the same way as spinal injuries which require long and tedious research work before they can be detected. In the 1970?s, the wearing of seatbelts be- came general practice, especially in Europe, A new approach to regulation from the USA is gra- dually making headway. It is known as the global approach and sets out to appraise the secondary safety provided by a car, by simulating the most frequent and most deadly accidents and by measu- ring performance on one or more anthropomorphi- cal dummies . The first proposal for this type of regula- tion dates back to 3 9.71, The American Administra- tion wishes to appraise the protection provided by the vehicle in a frontal collision. The per- formance to be measured on the dummy concerns ac- celeration of the head and thorax and the load through the main axis of the thigh bone. It is not surprising that the head, thorax and lower members are privileged areas we wish to protect. Indeed, methodological tools exist which we are not challenging. It is easy to mea- sure the resultant acceleration of almost rigid models (head and thorax) by installing a three directional accelerometer at their centre of gra- vity. Difficult research work is being conducted to determine the thresholds beyond which occupant protection cannot be ensured (to eliminate, for example, the risk of irreversible injuries) .These thresholds must be based on human impact toleran- ce. For 30 years, data have been progressively gathered and refined, Curiously, the abdomen was overlooked. Until. 1979, the first tolerance values (load-deflec- tion) of a human abdomen loaded by a seatbelt in static test conditions was presented(l) .Because the tolerance could not be measured by accelero- meter techniques, a specific methodology was used to define abdominal tolerance and translated into a measurable performance on a dummy. To make the distinction between values which are specific to the human being and their applications to a dum- my, we employ the term "tolerance" for the former and "protection criterion" for the latter. The protection criterion may be different if the dum- my itself changes definition. The purpose of this publication is to esta- blish a consolidated version of the most recent work devoted to abdominal protection in frontal 3521 0096-736X/83/91 04-3521 $02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3522 Y.

Becau- se submarining is the most involved mechanism, the analysis is enlarged to all injuries induced, by submarining that is to say lumbar, lower mem- bers, pelvic as well as abdominaļ/ injuries. An analysis is presented fdr the abdominal injuries observed in a sample of 1542 subjects wearing 3-point seatbelts and involved in fron- tal impacts. This is followed by a corresponding analysis of abdominal injuries observed in the tested cadavers which were divided-up into two independent samples groups, one composed of 70 subjects, and the other 211 subjects, correspon- ding to the observations supplied by different research groups. After having specified the relative impor- tance of the risk of lumbar, lower members and abdominal injuries, the study goes on to analyze and consider the prevention of abdominal inju- ries caused by the mechanism the most often in- volved, well-known under the name of "submari- ning" (factors which influence the occurrence of submarining and in particular the definition of a protection criterion to eliminate the risk of submarining by means of principles of a well- designed vehicle). By discussing all available information, it is possible to estimate the extent of protection provided by currently available criterion. (x) Numbers between parentheses are references at the end of paper (xx) Other publications cover a similar study on abdominal protection in side impacts« SUBMARINING INJURIES IN REAL-LIFE ACCIDENTS The accident survey file contains 1017 fron- tal impacts in which drivers wearing three-point seatbelts were involved. The impacts are selected based on the follo- wing body injury criterion ; at least one of the occupants involved in the accident was taken to the hospital. SEVERITY OF SUBMARINING INJURIES IN RELA- TION TO OVERALL RISK - The population of seriou- sly injured among the 1017 drivers (H.AIS 3? 4 or 5) is slightly less than that observed among the 525 passengers. Respective proportions of those killed are not significantly different. (Table 1), (See also Appendix I) From among the severely injured front occupants, 1 driver out of 5 and 1 passenger out of 3 sustai- ned severe injuries to abdomen and dorso- lumbar spine fractures (Table2) .

Injuries to lower members very largely dominate at level 3 . (Table 3) . One of the advantages of the adoption of re- tractor belt systems which are fitted to cars pro- duced since 1978 has been to reduce the slack with which static belts were habitually worn. Fur- ther, their geometrical lay-out in the car is a great improvement j the central mounting systems do, in particular, eliminate any further risk of initial contact of the adjusting buckle against the abdomen. This progress accounts for the very great difference in the risk of abdominal injury bet- ween those wearing static and those wearing re- tractor belts (Table 4) . """ The improvement to seat belt has, therefore, approximately halved the share of abdominal inju- ries However, they are still dangerous and some progress should be made. A precise description of the injuries and their most probable mecha- nisms may help to throw some light on the sub- ject.

C. LEUNG, ET AL. of viscera which certain authors thought could be described by specific features (2). 2 - A variant of these cases on which the seatbelt firmly fastens the pelvis and where we could still observe abdominal injuries, would correspond to another mechanism, that is a very important flexion of the trunk around the pelvis. This flexion can be clearly observed in experi- mental impacts (Figure 1), and the head can come into contact with the knees, A great kinematics was produced possibly within the certain car mo- dels, in which the superior anchorage was very behind that favored the sliding of the shoulder under the shoulder belt. Abdominal injuries would not be the result of the deceleration of the vis- cera in relation to the belt restrained skeletal frame, but would be induced by very high pressure in the viscera, and even compression between the trunk and thighs. The stout persons are more expo- sed than others to this type of compression. If here is a submarining process, the lap-belt still increases the pressure in viscera, 3 -The belt is worn i*j such a way that, when the slack is taken up, the lap-belt presses a- gainst the abdomen, penetrating through even as far as the spinal column when deceleration is high (Table 6), This second configuration, where play is a major factor, is frequent when the seat belt anchorage installation is faulty. Its conse- quences are aggravated when the restraint system on the oldest static belt models includes a buck- le for adjusting belt tension, located on the end of a flexible stalk anchored to the centre of the car. This system has significantly deteriorated seat belt performance in numerous accidents which have occurred over the past ten years. 4 -The lap-belt is correctly positioned a- gainst the pelvic bone but, when the occupant is displaced forward, loading conditions of the res- traint system are such that the lap-belt, under tension, runs up over the iliac crests and com- presses the abdomen. This is submarining in the strict sense of the term. The last two configurations have the most adverse effects on the abdomen. The injuries they cause have no specific typology whereby it would be possible, from a review of the medical file, to determine whether the case in point falls into configuration 3 or 4. Amongst the re- levant indications capable of distinguishing between them, we can name the presence of cuta- neous erosion in the pelvic region, particular- ly below or above the anterior superior iliac spines : the distance over which the belt shows signs of friction compared to occupant stopping distance. In the last two configurations, the pressu- re exerted on the abdomen is the risk to be a- voided. Whether it be at the just beginning of occupant displacement or after slipping from the pelvis, that in no way obviates the need to design restraint systems and their installation in such a way that restraint acts only against the pelvis throughout the whole of the occupant s deceleration phase. The share of the shoulder belt as a direct cause or aggravating factor in injuries to tissues or organs in the upper abdo- men region (liver, spleen, in particular) is not negligible but the results of an analysis indi- cated in Table 7 show that, when it exists, it is most often accompaning the preponderant ac- tion from the lap-belt.

The 26 drivers and 21 passengers who sus- tained severe submarining injuries (A£§^3¡) equipped with seatbelts almost half of which had a geometrical defect and were worn too loose. The presence of one or other of these two factors or both combined, was noted in more than two out of three cases (Table 8). CONCLUSIONS 1 . The process described by the term of submarining of the lower part of the trunk (pel- vis-abdomen-lumbar- spine and the lower thorax) under the lap-belt is a mechanism fairly frequen- tly encountered among belted occupants in fron- tal impact. Submarining is considered to be the mecha- nism most probably at cause in the vast majori- ty of cases involving the seriously injured (AIS-^3) sustaining injuries to the abdomen, the lower members, the pelvis or the dorso-lumbar column. One of the original aspects of this in-dep th cases analysis is that it shows how submari- ning can cause severe injuries to the lower mem- bers (legs-knees-femurs), the pelvis and the dorso-lumbar column (fracture-compression of the first lumbar vertebraes or fracture of the trans- verse processes) as well as to the abdomen, There are besides often combinations of these diffe- rent injuries. Other injuries may more exceptionally be combined, such as wounds or injuries to the neck and occasionally rib fractures. 2. The lap-belt is certainly the cause of 68% (32/47) of cases of victims of abdominal (AIS^ 3) and/or dorso-lumbar column (AIS ^2) injuries.</page><page sequence="5">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3525 to a; tO «o 0 *-■ ii i cm A co HH &lt; tO .2 'C 3 •r-&gt; C HH a c 'N Í5 1 3 Ò to s. s I 10 a&gt; M jQ c co +-&gt; i- &lt;D U C Z3 -P U h- a&gt; O 'i - &gt; &lt; -Û Ûu o z ►- I S- a: ° 5 C S- -Q lu a) co C£ C7) -Q . c ° . i - a&gt; S- O CO CL LU CO C£ fö »- I CL O S- cö a&gt; s- co cu 5 is ►-•CO «T- z &lt; □I o LU s: 00 ~ LU i-t c Š * is Z = Z (2J - CO S (2J ■P * co ca &lt;D cl u I s i 5 5 £ ^ &lt;c .a ^ S «O -K u § "g CM " ^ g C a; =j cu £ = ^ * CM - .5 O) C - 4J CO co &lt;u co a) &gt; , w *r eu &lt;o co co co ¡t) , B q |O I C ai J- S- tr u_ p cm S- co cu u a&gt; co ff! o H I *- CM S - Û CO &gt; O &gt; D) ^ 1 o CJ co a; d) co S- co co - 1 &lt;{ CT&gt; Q _J - l-Q-POC a c W ^ ES-OCO co ' - •» pt&lt; d a; i.

The role of the shoulder belt is unquesr- tionable j.n 1 out of 47 cases as complementing the action of the lap-belt and is possible in one other case. In 4 cases there is some doubt. 3. It is difficult to strictly specify the mechanism causing abdominal injuries as it means taking into consideration all the medical, an- thropometric and technical data in the acciden- tology files. Two analysis grids have been es- tablished and they are given in Appendices I and II. Submarining is evident when contributory factors such as poor geometry of the restraint system and (or) slack in the belts (one or other or both these factors combined are present in 74% of cases) are observed with the following; a) Seat-tracks damages in 38% of cases b) Knee or leg impact under the instrument panel with very obvious deformation of the lat- ter in 83% of cases. v c) Violent impact ( 50kph and ö^lOg in 58% of cases where submarining is certain or very probable) . 4. It should be noted that apart from sub- marining and the auxiliary role played by the shoulder belt, the responsability of the instru- ment panel and/or the steering unit is exceptio- nal in the occurrence of abdominal or lumbar in- juries (one probable case and one doubtful) , 5. The additional load from the rear pas&lt;- sengers is an aggravating factor (in 2J% of ca- ses where submarining is certain or probable), 6. Fractures of the pelvis are seldom but could be the result of submarining (8% of cases where submarining is certain or prob ab le) whether by knee impact or by direct action of the lap- belt. FIG. 1 . DIAGRAM OF A CADAVER TEST. 7. Another Sub-mar ining consequence al- ready noted in a previous publication (2) is the great frequency (23%) of dorso-lumbar vertebraes fractures (D12-L1-L2) by direct impact of the lap belt or (and) hyperflexion of the trunk a - round the lap-belt penetrated in the abdomen. 8. The lower members injuries (legs, knees and femurs fractures) are not specific ; however they are observed in 45% of cases of sub-mari- ning sure or most probable and could be conside- red as another consequence of this process, ANALYSIS OF ABDOMINAL INJURIES OBSERVED IN EXPE- RIMENTS CONDUCTED ON HUMAN CADAVERS FOR 281 FRON- TAL IMPACT TESTS, Two test samples with cadavers simulating frontal collisions with three-point seatbelts provide a total of 281 observations. All the sub- jects were fresh cadavers conserved at a tempe- rature of around 0° and experiments were conduc- ted a few hours or days following their death. An initial sample known as "APR" groups 70 subjects, A second one, the "Heidelberg" sample groups 211 subjects, ABDOMINAL INJURIES OBSERVED IN THE "APR" SAMPLE - The most frequent injuries are fractu- res of the rib cage and littérature already ex- ists on this subject. In this paper, ttye injuries indicated are only the abdominal injuries or the lumbar vertebra injuries which can be produced by the same mechanism, in particular submarining. Out of the 70 frontal impact tests using cadavers, there were 4.7 cases with injuries, 23 with lap-belt submarining and 24 without lap-belt submarining. The rest were cases where no injury was sustained and there was no evidence of sub- marining, The appended Table 9 illustrates which of the tested cadavers sustained only the inju- ries observed in the liver, the spleen, the lum- bar vertebra and other abdominal injuries , inclu- ding the intestines, mesentery, colon, iliac crest and abdominal muscles. Cases with only ili- ac crest fracture or abdominal muscle injury are alsopresented in this Table which contains 24 cases, 6 of which are non-submarining and 18 sub- marining, Table 8~ Quality of Restraint System Geometry and Belt Wearing Among Victims of Abdominal in- juries and Dorso-Lumbar Fractures POOR GEOMETRY YES NO TOTAL YES 8 8 16 NO 12 13 25 EXCESS SLACK UNCERTAIN 336 TOTAL 23 24 47</page><page sequence="8">3528 Y.

Liver is injured in 16% of cases for the passenger and 3.5% for the driver. The mean sled deceleration was exceeding 16g. These results confirm the absence of speci- ficity regarding liver injuries which would, as for spleen injuries, seem to be sustained more often by the passenger. This does, therefore, consolidate the findings of the APR sample ana- lysis. DISCUSSION 1. Out of 2 3 cases of liver injuries, 7 were drivers. 2 of them were non- submarining ca- ses, 5 were submarining cases. This is not suf- ficient to ascertain that the shoulder belt is responsible for liver injuries in non-submari- ning cases, as we could see similar results for the front passenger. 16 cases of liver injuries were observed among front passengers (or right rear passengers), and they were submari- ning cases. The possible effect of the shoulder belt on liver injuries was relatively small in this group of the sample, 2. All of 5 spleen injury cases were obser- ved in the front passengers. Two of them occur- red in submarining cases. 3. As observed for the spleen, or for the liver, any sustained injury cannot be automati- cally due to the shoulder belt. It would be mo- re suitable to say that the shoulder belt fa- vours submarining on the buckle (interior) side, In certain cases, the shoulder belt could play a role in provoking such injuries without the occurrence of submarining. 4. No intestine, colon, mesentery injuries were found in non sub-marining cases (except one case where a light mesentery injury oc cured) . 5. In our previous submarining studies (4), it was found that submarining began, in most casei on the interior side, for both cadaver and dummy tests. Two cases were found where submarining was limited to the interior side only, This illustrates the statement made in 3. to the effect that "the shoulder belt favours submari- ning on the buckle (interior) side". CONCLUSIONS 1 , Abdominal injuries occurred rarely in non Submarining cases, 2, Dorsorlumbar vertebra fracture was never fop nd in nonTSubmarining cases , But lumbar ver- tebra fractures are often associated with subma- rining and, sometimes, without abdominal injury. 3, Spleen and lever injuries are possible consequences of laprbelt submarining, Liver in- juries are not specific to anyone occupant seat, Spleen injury is found particularly to the right passenger (front or rear) , 4, The possible effect of shoulder belt is rather low. The shoulder belt could favour the submarining process on the buckle interior side. 5, All submesocolic injuries (except one) are consequences of laprbelt submarining, DEFINITION OF SUBMARINING (MECHANISM) Ą definition problem regarding the word"sub- ^Fining" vas experienced on several occasions these last years r in particular with I, S.O. (ISO TÇ22/SC32/GT 6), Corresponding to a personal communication of G,M. NYQUIST, several types of submarining re- ferred to by various authors in the past are : - Laprbelt submarining r Shoulder belt submarining r Air bag submarining r Instrument panel submarining. He stressed the fact that abdominal injuries are not the only consequences of a submarining and that knee injuries due to impact following submarining should be considered as submarining injuries. We also agree with this point of view. One should note that, in practice if lap belt submarining is avoided, the risk of knee impact is very much reduced. For the wearer of a three point safety belt, submarining is reduced to the relative mo- vement of the body in relation with the belts . The submarining can only take place through re- lease of the iliac crests passing under the lap belt, A slanting displacement of the pelvis ta- kes place downwards and frontwards .This movement of the pelvis corresponds to a simultaneous move- ment of the whole trunk which could be named tho- racic submarining relating to the thoracic belt. However, no thoracic syndrome specific to subma- rining has yet been described. Some cervical in- juries could be due to this whole trunk submari- ning as we have seen in our accidentological sample. So as not to complicate things, at least as regards the wearer of a three point safety belt, one should avoid talking of submarining regar- ding the body as a whole. To make things clear</page><page sequence="10">3530 Y. C. LEUNG, ET AL. one should talk about pelvis submarining rela- ting to the pelvis belt. This usually causes ab- dominal injuries, injuries of the dorso-lumbar vertebra, of the knee-femur-pelvis axis, all these injuries which can either be isolated or associated . It is difficult to distinguish, within this category, the difference of the submarining oc- curred with the initial positioning of the lap- belt on abdomen and with the initial positio- ning on the pelvis. In real accidents, in most cases, it is impossible to know exactly the ini- tial positioning. This depends on the care taken by the wearer in placing correctly the safety- belt (however does the wearer know that the lap- belt, sometimes called "abdominal11, should real- ly restrain the pelvis ?) The placing of the belt depends firstly on the restraint geometry but also of the posture and slack in the belt, FACTORS INFLUENCING THE OCCURRENCE OF LAP -BELT SUBMARINING "Submarining11 is a complicated problem be- cause its occurrence is associated with many pa- rameters, for example the geometry of the seat- belt system, orientation of the pelvis, dynamic characteristics of the seat and vehicle, impact velocity, etc... These are the external parame- ters determined by test conditions. An internal parameter is the pelvis shape; the area in ques- tion is the upper half of the notch below the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine CA.S,I,S,), Here as in previous publications (4) (5) , this pelvic area situated just below the ASIS is given the name "Sartorius" and has a length of A1A2 (see figure 2) . FIG. 2 . DIRECTION OF THE UPPER HALF NOTCH (A1A2) "SARTORIUS" DEFINED IN THREE DIMENSIONS. In fact, to avoid any confusion, it is necessary to state that Sartorius is the original name gi- ven to the muscle attached to this referred bone area in Gray's Anatomy (pp. 228, 492). INFLUENCE OF LAP-BELT ANGLES - During fron- tal impact, the load applied to the "Sartorius" on one side of the pelvis is the resultant of lap-belt tensions on the corresponding side. This load can be resolved into two components : one is parallel to the "Sartorius", the other is perpen- dicular, The parallel one orients downward and backward along the "Sartorius"; it can be defined as a load to keep the pelvis in a favorable posi- tion necessary to prevent the process of submari- ning, This load is related to the orientation of the "Sartorius" and the geometry of the lap-belt as well as to lap-belt tension. The coefficient of the load can be used as an indicator of the efficiency in reducing the submarining tendency. A brief technical term referring to "anti"-sub- marining scale was used in a previous paper (4) . If the orientation of the Sartorius is consi- dered as a constant, the anti-submarining scale is only a function of the geometry of the lap- belt defined in three dimensions. Since some ex- perimental results cannot be explained by the traditional geometry definition of the lap-belt given in two dimensions, a complete geometrical definition of the lap-belt determined in three dimensions was developed, Thanks to the anti-submarining scale curves established on the basis of the present theory and the submarining tendency as a function of lap-belt angles ß' , ß 2 , determined in experimen- tal results, an anti-submarining scale Js=0.63 is proposed for a limit of submarining risk on lap- belt geometry, Hence, this paper shows that the graphs of the anti-submarining scales can be used for checking the submarining risk in the seat- belt system. Theoretical s tudy: using a geometrical model of the lap-belt during impact (Fig. 3), the fol- lowing equations can be found: F3 = F cos 0 F4 = F sin6 where load F is the resultant of lap-belt tension applying to the "Sartorius" (A1A2) on one side. When the magnitude of F is known, F3 and F4 depend only on the angle 0 which is formed bet- ween the direction of Sartorius and the resultant load F, F3 is a load parallel to the Sartorius, preventing the lap-belt from riding-up over the A.S.IfS, and keeping the pelvis in a correct po- sition, Therefore, it is a load that plays an important role in reducing the submarining ten- dency, In contrast, F4 is a load which rotates the pelvis backward and downward, i.e. it increa- ses the risk of submarining. F3 could be used as an indicator of the efficiency in reducing the submarining tendency, By a mathematical study (4) , load F3 is gi- ven by another expression, F3 =ÇF1</page><page sequence="11">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3531 Lap-belt tension in this equation depends on collision velocity, seat and vehicle dynamic characteristics, mass of the belted occupants, etc... If Fl is determined, F3 is a function of the coefficient Ç . Since F3 is defined as an in- dicator of the efficiency in reducing the subma- rining tendency, the coefficient Ç can be desi- gnated as an anti-submarining scale indicating the efficiency to prevent the process of subma- rining for a given configuration. The coefficient Ç depends, on one part, on the direction cosines of the "Sartorius" and, on the other part, on the lap-belt geometry designa- ted by angles ß' , &gt;62 . It is presented precisely by the following equation: Ç=cos $1. cos [tan * (cos/8l . tanyÔ2)] .cos0^5&lt;+ £cosl/2tan * (cosjSl . taiyS2)-sinl /2tan ^ (cosyôl . tanß2)1 ^ . cos ö(/y+siiy5l .cos[tan 1 (cosßl . tanýfc)] . coscC2 Since o('x, o(!y ando(Tz were threes-dimensions defined previously for the "Sartorius" of an occu- pant within a car (5), anti-submarining scale could be determined as a function of lap-belt an- gles)Sl,/32. By using above equation, the relationship between the coefficient Ç and the lap-belt angles (£i , ß2) can be obtained, as illustrated in Figu- re 4 for human subject (male) and for Part 572 dummy (Figure 5) .

Experimental study - In order to put into practice and examine this theoretical study and the results, a series of sled tests was perform med with human cadavers, the Part 572 dummy and the modified dummy. Three different bodies of European car models were used and mounted on the sled for the tests. The lap-belt angles ß' , ßl were measured with the tested subjects in the initial position the test conditions and the complete experimental results were given in reference (4) , The details of the conservation of human cadavers can be consulted in reference (6) , Bri- efly, the cadavers were fresh and non-embalmed. Death occurred less than 4 days before the test. They were put in a cold box and then taken out a few hours before the test. Following the experimental results, submari- ning consequences in relation to the lap-belt an- gles jSl, ßl are illustrated generally in Fig, 6 for the human subjects, Part 572 dummy and modi- fied dummy. Based on both the theoretical study and ex- perimental results, the anti -submarining scale Ç can be traced between the groups of submarining data points corresponding to the 0,66 curve on Figure 4. It can be found in this figure: firstly that the submarining data points locate at the area which is formed by the smaller angles ß' and the greater angles ßl corresponding to the lower anti- submarining scale zone. Secondly, non- submarining data points locate inversely at the other area where ß' , ßl are respectively greater and smaller, corresponding to the higher anti- submarining scale zone. Thirdly, two non-subma- rining data points for a cadaver test and a modi- fied dummy test are situated in the submarining zone. This may be explained once more by the fact that the cadaver and the modified dummy are less inclined to submarine than the Part 572 duma- my. The figuration and location of the curve in- dicate that for the same anti-sùbmarining scale, the decrease of ß' should be associated with the decrease of ßl, i.e. if angle ß' is favorable to submarining (smaller), it is necessary to associa- te a good angle ßl (smaller) to reduce the subma- rining tendency if other conditions remain un- changed. This case corresponds to the highest da- ta points (circle). On the other hand, while an- gle ß' is great enough, according to previous beliefs, it seems to be unfavorable to submari- ning. Unfortunately, the submarining process occurred. In Figure 6, the three or four lowest black data points correspond to this case and it can be explained by the fact that these data points have greater angles ßl , Experimental re- sults reveal that the geometrical definition of the lap-belt designated only by angle ßl is in- sufficient to define its submarining tendency. The traditional geometrical definition is used in two dimensions given as the angle formed by the lap-belt and the X-axis from side view, specified as angle ß' . A wide range of this angle had been proposed as an unfavorable angle to sub- marining by the previous researchers, There were, for example, 45-50° proposed by Haley (7), 45° by Patrick (8) , 50-70° by Adornei t (9) , Hont- schik (10), and 69° by Billault (11). These refe- rence angles are represented in Figure 6 for a comparison.

THE RESULTS GIVEN IN THREE DIMENSIONS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE GIVEN IN TWO DIMENSIONS ($-!) PROPOSED IN LITERATURE. Angles ß' proposed in the above references cover almost all the submarining and non- submari- ning data points in the Figure 6. This variation was caused certainly by the variable angles ßl which had been used but not observed by the au- thors of the references. Indeed, it is difficult to state what is the unfavorable angle ß' to sub- marine if angleyÔ2 is not given. Actually, the submarining tendency cannot be indicated when using the traditional definition of the lap-belt geometry as determined by angle Ai alone. It is according to our theoretical and experimental study, INFLUENCE OF SEAT DESIGN - Seat design is another parameter influencing the submarining consequence. Necessary motions of the pelvis are the forward and downward displacements which pro- voke probably a lap-belt submarining. To limit these two displacements, there is the conception for the creation of an "anti-submarining" seat. Adorne it and Heger (9) proposed an energy-ab- sorbing seat constructed with the front wall of the seat metal pan. On the forward area of the seat pan, a density of foam of 53 kg/m3 was used (Figure 7), Lundell et al, (12) presented a seat which had a contourned floor pan with a pronounced rid- ge at the front end. The seat cushion had a grea- ter thickness which decreased gradually to the front edge of the cushion (Figure 8), In compari-</page><page sequence="13">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3533 son with their flat seat tests, it showed that the new seat design gave both reduced injury criteria and low risk of submarining. On the previous study (4) , a comparison of submarining tendency was taken for the front occupant in the passenger seat and rear occupant in the bench. It was shown clearly that the rear occupant submarined more easily than the front occupants. It can be explained by, firstly, a bad fi- xation system of the lap-belt on the interior side, corresponding to a smaller ant i-submar in- ning scale; secondly, no ridge support under the rubber foam at the front end of the bench. These two parameters played together a role in the greater submarining tendency of rear occu- pant. INFLUENCE OF "INTERNAL" PARAMETERS - Seat- Belt geometry, seat design, impact violence are external parameters. Others could be called "in- ternal" parameters, such as anthropomorphic data (size and weight, relative bigness and shape of the pelvic bone, volume and stiffness of soft tissues in front of the "Sartorius", direction in space of "Sartorius" and direction of the pelvis in sitting position. As indicated in the ant i-submar ining scale equation, if the lap-belt angles (jSl , jÔ2) are determined, we can see how the direction of "Sartorius" affects the submarining tendency, A comparison of the anti-submarining scales can be shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 for human sub- S^eeO FIG. 7.

In (5), it was shown that the direction of the Sartorius varies with the sex of the indivi- dual and with the different pelvic models. For example, the angle o(fx (Fig. 2) is the most cri- tical angle for indicating the tendency to sub- marine. This angle varies from 85° for males to 79° for females and to 109° for Part 572 and 83° for the FAA-USAF-NHTSA pelvic model. The submari- ning tendency is stronger when this o(fx is hi- gher (4) (5) . Flexibility of the soft abdominal tissue is greater for human subjects than for Part 572 dummy (5) . An attempt was made in order to have a more human-like dummy. A Part 572 dummy modi- fied at the level of "Sartorius11 and abdominal tissue was defined (Fie. J]) and evaluated (4), The theoretical approach still applies to these evaluations and experiments already widely described (4) have shown that the frequency of submarining is very similar for the modified dum- my and the cadavers (65 % and 62.5 % respective- ly), smaller than for Part 572 (75 %) , It was al- so observed that submarining occurs in a shorter time for the Part 572 (67.8 ms against 74.5 and 73.5 ms for the human subject and the modified dummy) . This constitutes another reference for the justification of submarining tendency. The direction of the "Sartorius 11 depends not only on the pelvic shape of the individual but also on the orientation of the pelvis in sitting position. It is known that the lap-belt submarining performance depends significantly on pelvic orientation. The submarining tendency in- creases with the rearward rotation of the pelvis. This rotation was defined for a sitting position within a car in relation to a standing position. An angle of 36.7° was recommended by Nyquist (13); it was determined an X-ray-radiograms -study on the ï&gt;asi s of two volunteers from his study (14) and 5 volunteers from reference (5) , STUDIES BY MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN OCCUPANT PARAMETERS ON THE RISK OF SUBMARINING OCCURRING. A study by mathematical model of occupant related factors was conducted in 1979 with the financial backing of the French Government, as part of the Programmed Thematic Action "Vehicle Safety - Submarining Criterion", The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of pa- rameters such as stiffness of the lumbar column, hips and knees, or mass distribution adjacent to the pelvis, on the tendency of a dummy to subma- rine (15). MODEL - The model used, "Prakimod", is a two-dimensional one. It has ten degrees of free- dom and offers the advantage of being a sophis- ticated and tried method of simulating a belt restraint system (16). REFERENCE TEST - An experimental test - 50th Percentile Part 572 dummy in front passenger po- sition, restrained by a 3-point-inertia-reel- belt type on a sled (Renault 5 configuration wi- thout instrument panel), catapulted at 50 kph against a 30° inclined rigid wall - was reprodu- ced by mathematical modelling, to act as a refe- rence. OUTPUT PARAMETERS - Actual submarining is not simulated by the model, but it does provide, at each moment, an output of the angle formed by the inboard and outboard webbings of the lap-belt with the pelvis projected along the sagittal pla- ne (Figure 12)» The maximum value of this angle during impact, together with its value when maxi- mum forces in the lap-belt occur, make it possi- ble to identify the risk of submarining. Maximum head, thorax and pelvis accelerations are also recorded as well as the maximum tensions of the different webbings and resultant forces applied to the dummy, SIMULATIONS FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES - After the reference simulation, eleven other simula- tions were carried out using the same set of data but modidying each time the value of one of the input parameters to be tested, RESULTS (Table 11) - Stiffening of the lum- bar &lt;-column would greatly reduce the risk of sub- marining which is natural. A major increase in head accelerations would be observed simultane- ously, along with a significant decrease in the longitudinal displacement of the centre of the head. Stiffening of the hips generally heightens the risk of submarining, reduces head and pelvis accelerations and increases thorax accelerations. Moderate stiffness of the knees is of very little consequence. Significant stiffening tends to slightly re- duce the risk of submarining, as well as diminis- hing all maximum accelerations and belt forces. Transferring load from the thigh to the trunk tends to reduce the risk of submarining, especial- ly if the load is transferred to the abdomen and not to the pelvis. Furthermore, a reduction in forward movement of the head and maximum accele- ration of the pelvis and an increase in shoulder belt loading were recorded. FINDINGS OF STUDY - Two possible orienta- tions emerged from this study to reduce the ten- dency of the Part 572 dummy to submarine, inde- pendently of any change to the shape of the pel- vis : -Pending accurate accurate and reliable an- thropometric data, displace load from the thighs to the pelvis, or better still, to the abdomen. This would entail modidying the dummy build. -Or simply modify the adjustment of hip and knee friction torques, by requiring that these torques balance not the weight of the members as specified in Standard 208 (Figure 13A) but the weight of the whole body, realistically positio- ned in line with the working of the muscles of these members (Figure|3 B) , This gives a smaller hip torque (61Nm against lOONm for both hips) , but a knee torque more than seven times greater ( 1 4 6Nm agains t 20Nm) , Two further simulations confirmed the accuracy of this solution regarding the change in output parameters (risk of submarining, accelerations..) but also showed that excessive blacking of the</page><page sequence="15">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3535 (/&gt; ■P 1 Si s •H 1ö řH 1 CO IO 0 p p £ cS ť S 1 *- OJ 2 i2 łuauifes je^ni jaddn ojuo fofr* 2 5 $ ¡g g g g. io 3 00 S - o sßai jaddn ujojj ß^- 2 ¿ _• ^ _• ^ ^ § - g «5 § § IOI^sn-LOPs,.

DEFINITION OF AN ABDOMINAL PROTECTION CRITERIA Past publications have described the comple- xity of the factors influencing the occurence of submarining and concluded that it was impossible to avert it by a single geometrical criterion as exists in Regulation 14, for example. That is why a great deal of work had been carried out with the object of seeking an abdominal protection criterion. These different approaches have in common the de- termination to eliminate the risk of abdominal injuries induced by submarining under the lap- belt, AN ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS MADE TO DEFINE AN ABDOMINAL PROTECTION CRITERION To our knowledge , the first attempt at defi- ning a protection criterion for abdominal organs was published in 1973 (17), It stated that the "protection of abdominal will be satisfactorily guaranteed if any rising of strap -in dynamics- (during test) above anatomical reference marks materializing the limit compatible with a satis- factory rest on pelvis is forbidden" (Figure 14) "Compliance with the criterion is checked by cinematographic observation". This first method successfully used in research could not be retained for the regulation test as the presence of doors ^and unmodified doors- precludes filmed observation of the pelvis. FIGURE 14. The following year, in June 1974, at the ESV Con- ference in London, Citroen proposed fitting the dummy with optical transducerslocated on the pel- vis beneath the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (A, S. I, S.) .These transducers would allow movement of the lap belt in relation to the A.S.I.S. to be detected, (18) ļņ the same year, a Ford patent dated 15th October J 974, proposed an almost identical system of» detec</page><page sequence="17">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3537 tion in which the optical transducer was replaced by force transducers. (19) .This solution was also to be retained by Citroen in 1977 (20) . A criticism which can be levelled against two above solutions is that abdominal danger cannot be stated to exist by the mere fact of the belt running up over the iliac crests. Indeed, the belt may be positioned against the abdomen at the end of impact without there being the risk of the occupant sustaining abdominal injury, if belt load is zero or low. Experimental work on human subject showed that certain cases of submarining proved to be of little danger provided that belt penetra tion into the abdomen as well as belt load '-these two variables are obviously interdependent- were lower than a given limit .Moreover , the abdominal tolerance which justifies the abdominal protect tion criterion presented in following chapter is based on such values. Three other ideas were formulated which would ena ble the detection of submarining: -measure the angle of rotation of the pelvis (21) -measure the pressure in the abdominal air bag with which dummy Part 572 is equipped (22) -measure the pressure exerted on a set of pressure transducers arranged over the anterior face of the dummy (abdomen and thorax) (23) . These ideas are still in the early proposal stage. With the lack of experiments on dummies and refe- rences to the tolerance of human beings, they have not been able to be transposed into a protection criterion determining a limit which must not be exceeded if the non-occurence of abdominal inju- ries is to be guaranteed, EXPERIMENTAL WORK CONDUCTED ON CADAVERS TO DEFINE THE ABDOMINAL TOLERANCE IN THE SUBMARINING CASE. To define this abdominal tolerance in the event of submarining under the lap-portion of a three-point belt, 10 cadaver tests were performed. Results have already been published as an ISO document (24) . METHODOLOGY USED IN CADAVER TESTS Ten human cadaver tests were first and last per- formed with a current Renault 18 and Renault 20 car body mounted on a sled, The maximum sled dece- leration and impact velocity were 21-30g and 50 kph.The fresh cadavers were placed on the front passenger seat (Nb 2) or on the rear bench seat at the right side (Nb 4) .Three-point retractor belts were used. Because the car occupant is more like- ly to submarine in the rear seat than in the front seat, owing to different seat-belt geometry (4) , most of the fresh human cadavers were placed on the rear bench seat at the right side (seat Nb 4), Eight cameras (velocities 500 or 1000 pictures/ second) were used for this study,The positions of these cameras are shown in figure 15, For two subjects (Nb 246 and 247) , accelerations were recorded for the thorax at D1 ,D4,D7,D12,the ribs and the pelvis (on sacrum), No head decelera- tion recordings were taken because of recording capacity. Two shoulder belt loads (upper and lower) two lap-belt loads (inboard and outboard) were also recorded.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The acceleration recordings are presented in Table 12, The anthropometrical data of the human cadavers and the results of the dissections are shown in Tables 13 and 14. In five recently conducted tests ,Nb 244 and Nb 245 were normal cases of submarining. This means that the lap-belt firmly restrained the pelvic bone^region below the Anterior Superior Iliac Spi- nes, It then rode-up over the iliac crests and pe- netrated into the abdomen, In this case, the tenr sion time curve appeared as a distinct "saddle shape", In precise terms, the first peak of lap- belt tension was always greater than that of the second peak which corresponded to a lower compres sion load penetrating into the abdomen (Fig. 1 6) . That is why no dangerous abdominal injuries were found. Heavy submarining occured in the remaining tests, The lap-belt rode-up rapidly over the ASIS and tension increased continuously (Fig. 1 7) .The tension was usually greater at the second peak applied to the abdomen than at the first peak, to the pelvic bone region. Therefore, abdomen AIS&gt;3 were found in the cadavers. Penetration of the lap-belt into the abdomen was measured using the same method as described in reference (l).By means of kinematical studies, this penetration was taken into account together with the fact that the lap-belt rode-up over ASIS. Because no significant difference in abdominal injuries between left and right hand sides was ob served, either in the autopsies or in the real- life traffic accident, the severity of the abdomi- nal injuries is specified for the whole abdomen as given by the anatomo-pathologists .The average lap-belt tension was taken from both sides.

A formula given by Eppinger is used in this study, which has been described in referen- ces (24) (25). In figure 18, a parabolic curve can be drawn as a relationship between the standardized tension of the lap-belt and abdominal penetration. The scatter of the data points is due to the differences in the anthropometric data of the cadavers, A similar curve can be found also in figure 19 for the stan- dardized lap-belt tension (after submarining) and the abdomen AIS. Previous results are also presen- ted in these figures.lt can be seen that Nb 243-4 is the lowest point (5KN) in the new group with dangerous injur ies, This value is smaller than that (5.7KN) of Nb 182-2, the lowest one in the old group of previous results. One datum point (without test number) given by ONSER is also presented in these two figures. Specific comments on the severity of abdominal in- juries (AIS) concerning cadavers Nb244 and 245 are given below: * Submarining with dangerous abdominal injuria*.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED TENSION OF THE LAP-BELT (AFTER SUBMARINING) AND THE ABDOMEN AIS. Nb 244 sustained only pelvic fracture with an A.IS-3 but no abdominal injuries. An abdominal AIS=0 was given to this case. It implied that if no pelvic fracture has occured,the lap-belt would probably have penetrated into the abdomen, with greater force and caused abdominal injuries , which</page><page sequence="22">3542 Y. C. LEUNG# ET AL. in real-life could be a dangerous situation.lt is an ambigous case difficult to interpret and we prefer to avoid underestimating the abdominal risk. -Nb 245 sustained abdominal AIS-1 and was the only subject situated between the group with dangerous injuries (AIS ^3) and the group with injuries (AIS=0) . Since the severity of the abdo- minal injuries due to submarining is probably in- fluenced by the "relative bigness" defined as "weight/height " (kg/cnP) in reference (24), a fur ther study of this factor is described here. The "relative bigness" of the human cadavers versus their abdomen AIS is illustrated in figure 20 where the previous results are also presented, Ca- daver Nb 245 had the greatest "relative bigness" in all results. We made the assumption that this subject would sustain a greater AIS if his bigness had been so to speak, smaller . It may be for this reason that the only fissure of the abdominal adi- pose tissue was found in this subject, n * o i 1 1 o 1 1 U y 0 v itťi-k c 2*7-* 1 Ua-&lt;, ^ • a**-* I ^ 2&lt;i6 -kl »182-2 J 10 - «W _° 1 5* ^ « « I . • ia I « . f . 1 2 3 4 5 6 AIS AlHiOMUN FIG. 20 . "RELATIVE BIGNESS" VS SEVERITY OF THE ABDOMINAL INJURIES (AIS) . The abdomen AIS is certainly influenced by other parameters, for example rib cage strength, which are not discussed in this study. In general, no big difference can be found between previous and re- cent results. But the limits between the groups with and without injuries are closer due to the recent results; therefore the latest determination of the abdominal tolerance will be more accurate. The determination of critical lap-belt tension should be considered more carefully. As just men- tionned above, the case with Nb 244 cadaver produ- ced no injuries , yet it is nevertheless a dangerous situation. On the other hand,Nb 243 (5KN) produced the lowest datum point in the group with injuries in recent results ;Nb 182-2 (5,7'KN) was the lowest one in previous results , Based on previous and re- cent available data points presented in figure 18 and figure 19, the critical standardized lap-belt tension was reconsidered, A value of 3 KN can be contemplated, which is smaller than the previous value of 4.4 KN which had been proposed (25 ,26 ,27) , EXPERIMENTAL WORK WITH DUMMIES INSTRUMENTED WITH "ILIAC CREST TRANSDUCERS" SCHEDULE OF RECENT RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR DUMMY TESTS -J[irst series - Dummy tests with a Renault 20 car body and seat - The same car body and sled used in cadaver tests were employe^, for the dummy tests. The sled dece- leration and impact velocity were similar to tho- se registered in cadaver tests. The Part 572 dum- my was equipped with short (40mm) or long (55mm) APR submarining transducers and placed in the front passenger seat (Nb 2) or in the rear bench seat on the right side (Nb 4) . Three-point retrac- tor seat belts (60mm width) and different posi- tions of lap-belt were used in these tests. Stan- dard recordings were made, Test conditions were si- milar or more severe with respect to test Nb 5 given in reference (28). -Second series - Dummy sled tests with Re- nault 20 seat directly on the sled - This series of tests was performed by T.N.O.The test conditions were similar to those used in re ference (28). Some tests were performed under ex- cessive test conditions (with the seat back set at an angle of about 30° from the vertical for example. Classical recordings were taken. -Third series - Dummy sled tests with Citroen Visa seat directly on the sled - This series of tests was the reconstruction of test NB 10 in reference (29) .Briefly, the test con dit ions were: -front passenger Citroen Visa seat -Part 572 dummy without fore-arms -3-pt static seat belts (50mm width) -sled deceleration and impact veloci- ty about 20g and 50kph respectively -inclination of seat back 28° -weakened seat frame -slack of the lap-belt and shoulder belt about 25 mm Recordings were made for pelvic deceleration, shoulder belt tensions (upper and lower) and lap- belt tensions (inboard and outboard) .Citroën transducer and APR short or long transducers were used, RESULTS -First series - Dummy tests with Renault 20 seat. The results of this series of tests are presented in Table 15, The first three tests (Nb 1013,1014, 1015) are cases of non-submarining with the lap- belt positioned correctly .Tests Nb 1018,1019 and 1021 are submarining cases with the lap-belt posi tioned 1 cm higher than in the first three tests. The compression loads recorded by the submarining transducer are in the range between 463N and 798N. Tests Nb 1016,1017 and 1020 are cases of excessi- ve submarining in which the lap-belt rode up over the submarining transducer s,Nb 1016 and 1017 are tests in seat Nb 2 with the worst position of the lap-belt, Nb 1020 is a test performed in seat Nb 4 with a correct position of the lap-belt and using short transducers (Figure 21).

In order to make a comparison with cadaver tests, a new research program is being prepared to per- form the dummy tests under these same conditions. It can be recognized from the above analyses that the responses of the transducer to the submari- ning process were in accordance with the different test conditions. -Second series - TNO sled dummy tests - The results of this series of tests are presented in Table 16. No submarining occurred in the first three out of a total of nine tests, even with the lap-belt located 15 mm higher than the correct po sition.In the rest of the tests, a submarining phe nomenon could only be obtained by placing sheets of double plastic foil between the dummy and the car seat in combination with a 25 mm "higher than correct" position of the belt on the pelvis, Exces sive submarining in tests Nb 454,456 and 457 could only be obtained by additionally inclining the seat back to about 30° from the vertical, The excessive submarining cases all resulted in a short peak loading of the transducers (duration 6 ms), followed by an overtrading of the transdu- cers .Consequently , the lap-belt was loaded again by the lumbar spine, In all tests, a reasonable symmetrical loading of left and right lap-belt and transducers was found, -Third series - Dummy tests with Citroen Visa seat In table 17 tests Nb 5363 and 5364 correspond to non-submarining cases, The lap-belts were positio- ned correctly. Tests Nb 5360,5361 and 5365 are nor mál submarining cases, Their descriptions are s imi lar to the ones given for the first series of dum- my tests, The positions of the lap-belts are relati vely worse than in the non-submarining group. Both short and long transducers work correctly in these three tests. The long transducer is used in test Nb 5361; the lap-belt tension and transducer load as function of time for the outboard side are illus- trated in Figure 22.

Test Nb 5362 corresponds to a submarining case in which the lap-belt rides-up oyer the transducer. The position of the lap-belt was the least desira ble one observed in this series of tests .However , a significant load of 253 IN was recorded by the short transducer .This sample again illustrates how the submarining transducer can provide a cor- rect response :when the test is performed under more severe submarining conditions, a greater com pression load can be recorded by the transducer, so indicating that it would be a more dangerous submarining case, The lap-belt tension (t) and transducer load (f) for outboard side in the test Nb 5362 are illustrated in Figure 23. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAP-BELT TENSION AND THE SUBMARINING TRANSDUCER LOAD All data points obtained from the recent re- sults of dummy tests are illustrated in Figure 24 The two parameters are the maximum transducer load and the corresponding lap-belt tension at the same points in time. The previous results are also pre- sented, A linear correlation between lap-belt ten- sion and transducer load can be proposed. Since the standardized critical lap-belt tension (3000N) is already determined in Figures 18 and 1 9 a corresponding transducer load of 800N can be found in Figure 24, Based on previous and recent results obtained from cadaver and dummy tests, a submarining transducer load of 800N is proposed as an abdominal protec- tion criterion in the dummy tests, CONCLUSIONS</page><page sequence="25">SUBMARINING INJURIES 3545 00 oc IdÜ o ZD O 00 z &lt; oc H- CD MH Z MH ûc: &lt; 3E CÛ h- =&gt;&lt; 00 UJ 00 û£ CL O &lt; CM Li- h- O -J =D Z &lt; oz »-I LÜ h- ÛÉ &lt; ZD X -I H- &lt;*-&lt; LÜ &gt;- h-X 00X UJ ZD h- Q O CM UJ fV - J on 00 h- •ÛC o&lt; • Q.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LAP-BELT TENSION AND THE COMPRESSION LOAD RECORDED BY THE TRANSDUCERS. 3. With a dummy in the front passenger seat (Nb 2) and a correctly positioned lap-be It, non-subma- rining cases were usually obtained. 4, Submarining cases were obtained at the front passenger seat (Nb 2) by deliberately positio- ning the lap&lt;-belt at an excessive level on the abdomen or by increasing backrest rake, only weakening the seat frame. 5 «In all submarining cases, the short (40 mm) and long (55 mm) transducers were able to detect the submarining phenomenon. 6. The values recorded by the short or long subma- rining transducers corresponded to the diffe- rent conditions used in the dunrniy tests. 7 «Based on recent critical lap-belt tension deter mined from the cadaver tests and, al so the data points concerning a relationship between the lap-belt tension and the transducer load found in dummy tests, the abdominal protection crite- rion of 800N is proposed for dummy tests. 8. The short transducer can usually be used in sub- marining tests for the abdominal protection cri- terion } the long transducer can be used success- fully in tests performed particularly under ex- cessive submarining conditions. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS J «LAP --BELT SUBMARINING in real-life accidents is a process inducing severe injuries in a relati- vely high proportion of severe frontal crashes (27%) - but it is too often underestimated in previous studies-, Reasons of underestimation were for example that dorso-lumbar spine frac- tures, or lower members fractures, or above meso- colic injuries were not often considered as sub marining consequences. Present findings constitu te an attempt to clarify the whole pattern of such lap^-belt submarining. From a whole sample of 1423 three-point belted front occupants involved in 958 frontal car cra- shes ?a sub-sample of 45 cars have been selected in which, at least one of the 77 front occupants sustained either a severe abdominal injury (AIS ^3) or a dorso-lumbar column fracture (AIS^2). Among this survey s ample, 47 injured people sus- tained a lap-belt submarining which was sure or most probable (61%). These submarinings induced three main types of injuries; -abdominal injur ies (sub-mesoco lie but also above mesocolic) (AISJ^3) -dorso-lumbar spine fractures (mainly T12, LÎ ,L2) (AIS &gt;2) -lower members fractures (mainly legs, knees and femurs fractures) (AIS ^2) 2, Among submarining cases, 68% of cases of abdomi- nal injuries (AIS ^3) and (or) dorso lumbar spi ne fractures (AIS ^2) were SURELY induced by the lap^belt section, The percentage reached 94% if we considered the cases where the lap-belt influence was sure or only MOST PROBABLE. 3, The influence of shoulder-belt plays only as an</page><page sequence="28">3548 Y. C. LEUNG, ET AL. aggravating factor - complementary to the lap- belt- for less than 10% of cases. 4. Poor geometry and (or) slackly worned belts were present in 74% of submarining cases. 5. Mo st of the submarining cases were observed in high violence crashes (AV &gt;50 kph and mean}f&gt; 10g occured in 58% of cases). 6. In real-life accidents , the most frequent severe consequences of lap-belt submarining are accor- ding to a decreasing order: -sub-mesocolic injuries -lower members fractures -dorso- lumbar spine fractures -above-mesocolic injuries -pelvic fractures 7. Taking into account the severity of above-meso- colic injuries (liver and (or) spleen), it is no- ticeable that 3/5 of such victims sustained a lap-belt submarining which is sure or most pro- bable (of course these lesions are often associa ted to sub-mesocolic injuries) . 8. In cadaver tests (with blood pressure restored at normal level) , submarining process is checked by special in-board camera which shows then all these above described injuries which could be induced by lap-belt submarining, even for above- mesocolic injuries (liver or spleen injuries) or dorso-lumbar spine fractures e These experiments also confirm the possible aggravating influence of shoulder-belt section. 9. Abdominal or dorso-lumbar spine TOLERANCE to lap-belt submarining is low. Injuries are ob- served for lap-belt tension higher than 3000N . 10. A PROTECTION CRITERION - ANTI-LAP-BELT SUBMARI NING CRITERION - has been proposed.lt consists in the record of lap-belt loading against spe- cific ILIAC-CREST TRANSDUCERS symetrically ins tailed on the pelvis of the dummy. Based on re- cent critical lap-belt tensions determined from specific cadaver tests and - also - the data points concerning a relationship between the lap-belt tensions and the IliacHJrest-Transdu- cer loads found in dummy tests, the LAP-BELT- SUBMARINING PROTECTION CRITERION of 800N is pro- posed for dummy test.
