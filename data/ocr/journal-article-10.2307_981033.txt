<plain_text><page sequence="1">The United States and Cuba: Hegemony and Dependent Development, 1880-1934. By Jules Robert Benjamin. (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1977. Pp. xii, 266. Notes. Bibliography. Index. $14.95.) Since the second world war, two strong currents of intellectual concern have flowed into the broad field of international affairs. One, known as dependency,</page><page sequence="2">612 BOOK REVIEWS focuses upon the distortions of capitalist development in the third world resulting from unequal distribution of power among nations. The second, known as revisionist historiography, deals with the manner in which the American capitalist system conditions this country's foreign relations. Despite the fact that both currents profess interest in international economic and political relations, until recently both have been inward looking and provincial. Dependency writers, for all their preoccupation with the hegemonic center of the capitalist system, have shown themselves all too often to be remarkably ignorant of the workings of the U.S. economy and of the policy formulating process in the U.S. For their part, revisionists, emphasizing the impact of the American economy on international relations and on the development of other countries, have studied this interaction almost exclusively from the perspective of the U.S. In the past few years there has been evidence of a healthy approximation of these two currents. More and more Latin Americanists are studying the U.S. system in detail, including the U.S. foreign policy process as it affects Latin America. (See for example, the volume edited by Julio Cotler and Richard Fagen, and the courses taught at CIDE in Mexico and at Sim6n Bolivar in Caracas.) This monograph demonstrates the efforts being made by revisionist diplomatic histo- rians in the U.S. to combine their perspective with insights from dependency writings. Professor Benjamin has set for himself the complex task of describing precisely how U.S. hegemony affected (distorted) the political process in Cuba, its economic development, and even the relationship among social groups on the island. It is an important project and, in my opinion, the author has achieved a laudable degree of success. The bulk of the narrative covers the relations between Cuba and the U. S. in the early days of the New Deal, especially the role of Summer Welles in the overthrow of Machado and the rise of Batista. This is fascinating episode and Professor Benjamin displays considerable skill in marshalling his evidence and telling a story. The chapters on the period leading up to the revolution of 1933 set the stage for the drama in which American hegemony was tested. The author chronicles the buildup of the US stake in Cuba, beginning in the nineteenth century, how the Platt Amendment served as an instrumentality of American economic penetra- tion and how the reciprocal trade agreement blocked Cuban development. He then describes how the U.S. presence and the threat of intervention or the reality of hegemony itself created an "invisible hand" in Cuban politics which under- mined the viability of pluralistic democracy. It is a bit of a surprise, thereafter, to learn that in the crisis of 1933 it was not an anthropomorphic phantasma that bedeviled Cuba, it was the flesh and blood Ambassador of the U.S., Sumner Welles. More than any other person, Welles is the protagonist of the narrative, giving an example of how an articulate strongwilled diplomat with access to the president could frustrate the intentions of the Department of State and deny the will of the Secretary of State. In this context, I might offer some disagreements I have with Benjamin's analysis of U.S. policy. In my opinion, he does not pay</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 613 enough attention to the Department of Commerce, focusing too exclusively on the State Department, and he misses the importance and implications of Dwight Morrow's role in Cuban finance in the 1920s. Limitations of space and fears of pedantry prevent me from extending the list. The major weakness of the volume is that Benjamin has latched on to a static concept of dependent capitalist development. He allows for little or no variation in space or over time, and his prose tends to be littered with monolithic anthropomorphic generalities. Recent writings by O'Donnell and Cardoso, among many, have expanded our understanding of the development process by exploring the dynamic interaction between dominant power groups (plural) and the various elements (also plural) of dependent power structures. Why, for example, should all nationalisms be progressive? Are the options open to dependent economies determined merely by the existence of hegemonic domi- nance? On balance, therefore, the strength of this volume is diplomatic history- nothing to be ashamed of by any means-and, in addition, it represents a signal effort to explain U.S. policy in terms of Latin American development. As such it will contribute materially to our understanding of inter-American relations. JOSEPH S. TULCHIN University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, North Carolina</page></plain_text>
