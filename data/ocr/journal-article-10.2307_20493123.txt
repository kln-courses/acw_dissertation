Etienne Rynne This book, copiously illustrated with gen erally relevant maps and other illustrations, and with a most attractively coloured dustjacket showing Pouluabrone Dolmen to great advantage, is like the proverbial curate's egg. Though clearly not aimed at the specialist, nor even at those already au fait with Irish prehistory, it nonetheless contains much of interest for such readers, though the more general reader might find some of it a little confusing. The book, particularly in Part 2, has many thought-provoking, often almost throw-away statements or questions, as for instance on p. 39-40 where Flanagan tells us that the outside of Neolithic pottery vessels was often polished or burnished, 'which would have had the effect, in the absence of glazes, of making the pot more watertight', or on p. 154 where he asks if the inclusion of the highly decorated flint mace-head in the mound at Knowth, 'which could be interpreted as a symbol of power, [might] imply not merely the death of a priest-king but the end of a dynasty?' or, in other words, was the mace-head a personal or a communal status-symbol? He does, however, occasionally fly a kite too high, as, for instance, when on p. 161 he offers a glib (his term) but just about possible explanation for three Earlier Bronze Age burials at Sonnagh Demesne, county Westmeath: two of the burials were of adults, both in pits, both headless, one extended, the other crouched, and buried with them was a cremated child in a cist; the headless adults, Flanagan spec ulates, may have been 'put to death -as pederasts, the child - of whatever sex - their victim.' An interesting, if not very nice, thought, though it smacks of mod em-day tabloid joumalism. Speculation, though of a more thought provoking and justifiable kind, occurs elsewhere in the book too, as for instance when the manufacture of the Tievebulliagh axeheads is discussed on pp. 185-6, or ten pages later when he discusses the 'cost' of producing a typical axehead of the Earlier Bronze Age, the 'cost' being the time, food and up-keep of all those involved in sup plying ore, wood, etc., for about twenty days' labour. Indeed, the chapters on 'Manufacturing' and 'The Food Industry' are among the most interesting in the book; how many are aware, for instance, that during the Earlier Bronze Age pigs were slaughtered lying down and opened up from the rear? And that between smoking the bacon and making sausages, the killing of one pig would involve at least two people for between seven and twelve days? One finds much to question in the book and much to comment upon, but regret tably one also finds much to fault. There are some minor sins of commission and some major sins of omission such as the 1 58 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS anthropomorphic carving popularly known as 'The Clown' or 'King Tut' in the passage tomb at Fourknocks, Pygmy Cups, an important type of funerary vessel, and the extraordinary richness of the Later Bronze Age in North Munster. There is no mention anywhere of the outstanding and relatively numerous gold gorgets, biconical hair ornaments, etc., from the area, and the 'Great Clare Find', the largest prehistoric gold hoard ever found north of the Alps, only receives cursory mention, while neither it nor the Gorteenreagh Hoard are even mentioned on p. 165 when the author briefly dis cusses gold hoards of the Later Bronze Age. All-in-all, Ireland's marvellous and important collection of prehistoric gold gets very short shrift in this book. Perhaps most annoying, however, are many of the illustrations. They are almost all taken from previously-published sources and are all so acknowledged, but most of the references as to where they were originally published are not given in the bibliographies on pp. 240-251, but maybe the less said about these bibliogra phies, the better... they look impressive anyway! Ah woll, the curate's egg, after all, was (good in parts'. ETIENNE RYNNE is Professor Emeritus in Archaeology at the National University of Ireland, Galway.</page></plain_text>
