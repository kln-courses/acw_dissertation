<plain_text><page sequence="1">About This Issue This issue's cover theme, "Robot Musicians," concerns a longstanding but frequently overlooked area of computer music. The cover of Com- puter Music Journal Vol. 10, Number 1 (Spring 1986) displayed an early musical robot, the Sumitomo imple- mentation of the WABOT-2 (dis- cussed further in CMJ 10:2). That keyboard-playing robot, replete with a conversation system and a video camera for optical recognition of sheet music, issued from an exten- sive development project at Waseda University in Tokyo. In more recent years, researchers at Waseda have cre- ated successively improved versions of a robot flutist. Like the WABOT-2, this robot flutist, which is called the WF-4II in its current incarnation, is anthropomorphic in design and func- tion: It mimics not just the superfi- cial appearance of a human, but also the requisite body parts for flute play- ing (lungs, lips, fingers, etc.). In this issue, Jorge Solis, Atsuo Takanishi, and their colleagues at Waseda dis- cuss the evolution and current design of the robot flutist. To prepare a par- ticular piece for performance, a MIDI file of the composition is ana- lyzed along with an audio recording of a professional human flutist's ren- dition of the piece, and control data for the robot are generated. The robot then performs the solo part while a MIDI synthesizer plays the accompaniment. The article de- scribes results of an experiment to evaluate how well the robot emulates a human performance. The other article on this theme, by Gil Weinberg and Scott Driscoll, fo- cuses less on elaborate mechanics and more on musicianship: Their ro- bot plays a simpler instrument, a drum, but it can improvise based on what it hears a human percussionist playing. The robot, named Haile, in- teracts with human musicians in six different modes: imitation, stochastic transformation, perceptual transfor- mation, beat detection, simple ac- companiment, and perceptual accompaniment. After describing the robot's design, the authors discuss two compositions written for Haile plus human percussionists, followed by a report on musicians' experiences of playing with the robot. The article concludes with a look to the future of robot musicianship. The DVD that accompanies this issue includes videos of both the WF-4II and Haile in action. Bob Sturm's article describes his implementation and exploration of automated micromontage. His soft- ware for adaptive concatenative sound synthesis (ACSS) uses a pre- existing sound as a template. A frame-based analysis of this sound produces feature vectors that are then used to retrieve similar frames from a large database of sounds. The con- catenation of these retrieved snippets can yield a sonic collage whose tem- poral evolution imitates that of the original. Audio examples, including excerpts of a composition by the au- thor, can be heard on the DVD (and more can be found at his Web site). Our Fall 2005 issue presented an article about a visual sound-synthesis language called PWGLSynth. PWGLSynth is part of a more general visual environment, PWGL, written in Lisp. Another component of PWGL, called Expressive Notation Package (ENP), provides a "front end" in terms of music notation. (ENP was mentioned in last year's ar- ticle, and an example of its use can be seen on the cover of that issue.) In the present issue, Mika Kuuskankare elaborates upon the concepts and ca- pabilities of ENP. In general, ENP of- fers deep access to its notational objects, whereas some notation soft- ware tends to treat objects on a more superficial, graphical level. For ex- ample, ENP's scores can be generated algorithmically; scores can be auto- matically analyzed and annotated; custom expression markings can change their appearance dynamically according to the musical context; and scores written in the optional propor- tional (non-mensural) notation can have their notes dragged to any posi- tion in time, with expression mark- ings following along (instead of a fundamentally metric approach that simply hides the bar lines). Front cover. The two musical ro- bots discussed in this issue: WF-4II (left) and Haile (right). Back cover. To generate this anno- tated score excerpt, the Expressive Notation Package automatically ana- lyzed the music and added the con- nected triangles, circles, and squares to indicate music-theoretical rela- tionships.

About This Issue 1</page><page sequence="2">This issue's final article, by Rui Pedro Paiva et al., describes a pro- gram for extracting the melody notes from an audio recording having both a melody and a chordal or polyphonic accompaniment. The sequence of op- erations consists of: multi-pitch de- tection at the level of 46-msec frames, determination of notes by constructing and segmenting pitch trajectories, elimination of "ghost oc- tave notes," selection of the most salient notes, resolution of temporal overlaps between notes, handling of abrupt changes of register, removal of accompaniment notes (remaining less-salient or too-short notes), and restoration of previously truncated notes. The authors present their algo- rithms and then show experimental results that evaluate their system in comparison to others. The reviews in this issue critique various recent compact discs, two software packages for audio restora- tion and noise reduction, and a music theorist's book on the perceptual foundations of meter. Longtime readers of the Journal may recall the vinyl soundsheets that were bound into an issue approxi- mately annually. Like the later an- nual CDs or DVDs, these flimsy phonograph records provided a means to disseminate compositions and sound examples that augmented the Journal's articles. All the issues con- taining soundsheets have long been out of print, and that collection of au- dio has never before been available in digital form, except for the tracks from Volumes 15-18, which were reissued on the Volume 19 CD. We are therefore delighted to announce, in celebration of 30 years of Com- puter Music Journal, that the DVD accompanying this issue includes a re-release of all the heretofore un- available soundsheet material. We appreciate the help of Curtis Roads, former Editor of the Journal, who possesses many of the lacquer mas- ters and who facilitated the transfer of the analog recordings to digital au- dio expressly for this DVD. James Harley produced the DVD. The DVD also contains, as scannec images embedded in PDF files, not only the original program notes for these soundsheets, but also various feature articles that corresponded to the tracks. In addition to this histori- cal material, the DVD includes video and audio, playable on standalone DVD players, to accompany nine cur- rent or recent articles, such as the previous issue's interview with com- poser Francis Dhomont. Finally, the DVD-ROM part of the disc includes the pDM software by Anders Friberg that was discussed in the Spring is- sue.
