Wing, curator of zooarchaeology, and Lee Ann Newsom, doctoral candidate in paleoethno- botany at the University of Floria, are conducting re- search at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the plant and animal remains excavated from several West Indian sites. Their research concerns all aspects of resource exploitation, including (1) plants and ani- mals used for food and for the manufacture of tools and other objects, (2) woods used for fuel, (3) intro- duced captive animals and wild cultivated plants, and (4) introduced domesticates. Thus far, materials have been identified from sites in Barbados (excavated by Peter Drewett) and from the site of En Bas Saline, Haiti (excavated by Kathleen Deagan). Work has begun on sites in Antigua (excavated by Bruce Nodine), in St. Martin (excavated by Jay Haviser), and in Nevis (ex- cavated by Samuel Wilson). Sites still to be studied are from Saba (excavated by Menno Hoogland), the Virgin Islands (excavated by Ken Wild and Mr. and Mrs. Philip Caesar), and the Bahamas (excavated by Wil- liam Keegan). In January 1990, the Bullen Research Library of the Florida Museum of Natural History (FMNH), Gaines- ville, published the first volume of a Bibliography of Caribbean Archaeology, which is over 100 pages long with more than 1,500 references and is available on 3.5-inch diskettes free of charge to anyone who in- cludes a self-addressed stamped envelope with their request. From 1987 to 1990 Osvaldo Garcia-Goyco (Univ- ersidad Compultense de Madrid) conducted doctoral research on the lexicon and morphology of the Arawak linguistic family of South America and the West Indies. Using the "Swadesh" 100-word noncultural list, he has obtained a high percentage of possible cognates (de- fined as words with common affixes and the same meanings) between the Guajiro Arawak of Venezuela's Coast and some Mayan languages. The preliminary percentages of possible cognates be- tween Guajiro Arawak and the following languages are: Maya (Yucatec, Itza, Mopan) 44-52 percent, Tzotzil 34 percent, Chuj 33 percent, Tzeltal 30 percent, Chorti 30 percent, Tojolabal 28 percent, Mopan 28 percent, Quiche 23 percent, Cakchiquel 22 percent. Compar- ing Guajiro with 25 Mayan languages, the percentage of possible cognates rose to 85 percent. These per- centages are very high taking into account that the affinity of the Guajiro with the Warrau of Venezuela and the Karina of Surinam was only 12 and 11 percent, respectively, despite the geographical proximity. Garcia-Goyco has found about 650 possible cog- nates between Guajiro and Maya, including 295 verbs, 213 nouns (37 body parts, 18 kinship terms), and 123 adjectives. The Mayan words collected after 1797 were 143</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY identified because of the presence of an Arawakan- speaking colony moved from San Vicente Island to Honduras Bay in that year, but the results did not change significantly. In 1988 and 1989 Sebastian Robiou-Lamarche car- ried out comparative analyses of the mythologies of the Quich6 Maya (based on the Popul Vuh), the Tainos (based on the treatise of Fray Ramon Pan&amp;), and the Island Caribs (based on Breton's Dictionaire Caraibe- Franqais). He encountered symbolic parallels between several deities-the Hurakan of Mesoamerica, the An- acacuya of the Greater Antilles, and the Iaboura of the Lesser Antilles. From his analyses Robiou-Lamarche feels that these deities are related to the hurricane, to the center of the universe or axis-mundi, to a hero with one leg or foot, to a mythical canoe voyage, to the North Star and to the constellation of the Great Bear (or Big Dipper). The researcher postulates that the place where the Great Bear constellation rises, relative to the North Star, could serve as a calendric device for both the Antilles and Yucatan. The disappearance of the constellation below the horizon in April would signify the beginning of the rainy season, while its reappear- ance above the horizon in August would mark the beginning of the hurricane season in both regions. BAHAMAS. In December 1989, William Keegan and Maurice Williams (FMNH) conducted an archae- ological survey of Grand Turk, Turks, and Caicos is- lands. The survey was done at the request of the Ba- hamian government, in an attempt to strengthen its claim as the island of Columbus's first landfall. A small Lucayan village site of approximately 80 x 30 m was found, but excavations were not conducted. Future in- vestigations will examine the structure of the site and will seek to establish the dates during which the site was occupied. GREATER ANTILLES. Jamaica. E. Kofi Agor- sah (University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica [UWI]) and Candice Goucher (Portland State Uni- versity) have been excavating at Morant Bay, St. Thomas Parish, an important metal-working industrial site. The research is part of Goucher's ongoing African- Caribbean Technology Project, which aims at the iden- tification and study of African technological continu- ities in the Caribbean. Their excavations are intended to collect archaeological data to complement docu- mentary data for reconstructing the history of an iron and brass foundry established by the Englishman John Reeder in the late 1770s. Research so far indicates that the range of interactions between African and Euro- pean technologies included industrial settings in which African metallurgists, referred to in documentary sources, contributed considerable skill and expertise. The foundry site demonstrates with its excavated fur- nace and cast iron and brass artifacts, that technology transfer was an inevitable consequence of the African Slave trade. E. Kofi Agorsah also is investigating the settlement patterns of historical sites in Jamaica, with special em- phasis on Maroon settlements. The research uses ar- chaeological, ethnographic, and historical evidence to identify sociocultural elements of African traditions that have been lost by societies of African descent. Data are being analyzed in the context of the social and physical environments to which such societies had to adapt. Several sites have been identified in and around the Blue and John Crow mountains, particularly around Moore Town, Nanny Town, and in areas around the Snake, Rio Grande, and Dry rivers, all in the eastern part of Jamaica. Investigations also are ongoing in the Cockpit country in the west, near the present town of Accompong in St. Elizabeth Parish, around the burial grounds of Cudjoe, the popularly known Maroon lead- er. Remains of house foundations, local and imported ceramics, smoking pipes, wine bottles, and metal ar- tifacts have been recovered. Further reconnaissance and excavations will be carried out. Douglas V. Armstrong (Syracuse University [SU]) and Kenneth Kelly (University of California, Los Angeles) carried out archaeological and historical research at Seville Plantation from May to July 1989. The project is cosponsored by the Jamaica National Heritage Trust. The 1989 season focused on an area of the estate's slave village that was occupied ca. 1670-1760. An en- tire house foundation and yard area (HA 16) was ex- cavated. The house dates to the founding of the plan- tation and has a mean ceramic date of 1730. Postholes and post molds indicate wattle-and-daub construction with an interior partition dividing the house into two rooms. Artifact deposition patterns indicate an outside cooking area attached to the back of the house. Cleared areas in the yard suggest social activities outside the house but within a house and yard compound. An east- facing burial of a male of African descent was recovered beneath the house and burial is under analysis by Mark Fleischman (SU). Material remains from HA16 in- clude refined earthenware from England as well as a variety of locally made coarse earthenware yvbba bowl and pot forms. Several ground cairo-shell beads were recovered; these items probably were brought from Africa by the slaves. Research at Seville Plantation continues with the goal of relating changes in house- yard compound layout to internal developments with the emergence of an Afro-Jamaican community. Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Juan Jose Ortiz Aguilu (Temple University [TU]) and Froelich G. Rai- ney (The University Museum, University of Pennsyl- vania) conducted excavations in 1982-1984 at Bois Neuf, near the central-western coast of Haiti, under the sponsorship of the Huguette F. Mevs Foundation of Port-au-Prince. The prehistoric site is on the west bank of Ravine Seche, 200 m from the sea. Both intensive surface collection and detailed topographic mapping were conducted on a 5-m grid covering approximately 200 x 500 m. The topographic map revealed two flat rectangular areas, low relief mounds, and smaller flat areas. When viewed in conjunction with density plots of ceramics and cryptocristalline stone artifacts, an ap- proximation of the subsurface structure of the site was apparent. The top component of the Bois Neuf site was dated to the fifteenth century A.D. Uncorrected radio- carbon dates from the site's most recent component are A.D. 1500 ? 80 (Beta-6306) and A.D. 1430 ? 50 (Beta-7146, based on charcoal). A ceramic sherd of Bois Neuf curvilinear (BNC), a Carrier-like style, pro- 144 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH vided a thermoluminescence (TL) date of A.D. 1375 ? 115 (Alpha-802). A sherd from Bois Neuf rectilinear (BNR), a Melliac-related style, also was TL dated to A.D. 1450 ? 100. Both BNC ceramics and BNR ce- ramics were present in the same late-dating excavated contexts. Lithic material at the site was profuse, con- taining large quantities of short blades and backed, single-edged knives. Beneath the relatively short-lived late prehistoric or protohistoric stratum (A. 1) of Bois Neuf were three distinct aceramic components. The uppermost, A.2, provided radiocarbon dates of A.D. 1310 ? 60 (Beta- 9199) and A.D. 1390 ? 60 (Beta-9200). Artifacts in- cluded a few small blades and chipped-stone tools, Strombus sp. containers and Cittarium sp. remains. The artifacts in lower component B are similar to those in A.2, but the component dates to the early first mil- lennium A.D. Radiocarbon dates are A.D. 500 ? 290 (Beta-7144); A.D. 400 ? 50 (Beta-7147); A.D. 235 ? 115 (Beta-7148); and A.D. 230 ? 100 (Beta-7145). Component C is buried under nearly 3 m of undis- turbed clayish silt. A Strombus celt, a small flint blade, and two small hearths were recovered in limited test- ing. Charcoal from the hearths was radiocarbon dated to 790 ? 65 B.C. (Beta-7142) and 905 ? 55 B.C. (Beta- 7141). Kathleen Deagan (FMNH) is completing analysis and synthesis for a final report for the site of En Bas Saline, in northern Haiti. Excavations at the site were carried out by the FMNH from 1983 to 1988. The site is a Carrier-period oval-shape village measuring ap- proximately 250 x 350 m. Work has included prepa- ration of a topographic map of the entire site, a 100 percent surface collection, a 100 percent electromag- netic survey of the site, and the excavation of 45 3-x- 1.5-m units. At the site, research has focused on what is thought to be the contact period town of the Taino chief Guacaranic (it was in Guacaranic's town that Columbus built the fortress of La Navidad in 1492). Radiocarbon and TL dates indicate that the site dates to between A.D. 1250 and 1500. Faunal analysis is underway by Elizabeth Wing, floral analysis by Lee Newsom, analysis of survey and reconnaissance ma- terials by Maurice Williams, and excavation interpre- tations by Kathleen Deagan (all FMNH). In 1988, Kathleen Deagan and Jose Cruxent com- pleted a survey of the site of La Isabela, Dominican Republic. The work was done in conjunction with the Dominican National Park Service and the FMNH. The work was intended to delineate the settlement of La Isabela and included topographic mapping and a com- plete systematic subsurface test program on a 10-m grid over the site. The site covers approximately 4 ha and reflects the very sparse Spanish occupation that took place there from 1493 to 1498. Excavations will be continued in the summer of 1990. In April 1990, Joaquin Nadal, Fernando Morban Laucer, Alejandro Peguero G., and members of the Department of Archaeology of the Museo del Hombre Dominicano (MHD) conducted test excavations at the site of Manoguayabo, 14 km west of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The site is located 800 m north of the Rio de Manoguayabo. The site contained Chi- coid ceramics and large quantities of burin fragments from cassava griddles. Faunal remains were not pres- ent. Palynological analyses indicate the presence of yuca (Manihot sp.), guayaba or guava (Psidium guajava) and hobos or mombin (Spondias sp.). None of these species are growing in the region today. Fernando Morban Laucer, Plinio Pina P., and Luis A. Peguero (MHD) conducted excavations from 1986 to 1988 at the site of Los Corrales (Talanquera), on the southeast coastal plains of the Dominican Repub- lic. The site is in the Guayacanes area in the province of San Pedro de Macoris. The site contained burin fragments from cassava griddles and abundant faunal remains. Analyses indicate that people at the site fished and caught small game, but the abundance of net weights and the faunal sample itself suggest that fishing was more important. The presence of mushroom spores and freshwater algae and palynological research suggest that climatic and ecological change has taken place since the site was occupied. Ceramics appear to be similar to styles as early as Hacienda Grande from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico. Juan Jose Ortiz Aguilu (TU) has con- ducted investigations at the site of Cucharal-Tecla, in Guayanilla, less than 1 km from the south-southwest coast of Puerto Rico. The site consisted of a surface scatter of more than 10 ha, most of which had been plowed for sugar-cane cultivation for 200 years. Inten- sive surface collection and density mapping have been used to suggest that the long-term impact of plowing had not destroyed the horizontal structure of the site. The density maps showed nonrandom patterning of shell and ceramics, with ceramics predominating in the center of the site, and shell debris being most prev- alent on the periphery. J. J. Ortiz Aguilfi also conducted investigations at the site of Las Flores, Coamo, in south-central Puerto Rico, 6-7 km from the sea. Detailed topographic map- ping was used to reveal what the investigators termed the cultural topography of the site-the topographical remains of prehistoric house middens, plazas and pub- lic areas, paths, and other features preserved in the microtopography of the site. By recording elevations on a 2-m grid and using computer-assisted extrapo- lations, detailed topographic maps were produced that revealed the existence of a plaza or ball-court area of 1,000 square meters, 6 middens, and several areas that are interpreted as house locations. These interpreta- tions have been verified with subsurface testing. The site has multiple components from early Puerto Rican Saladoid (Hacienda Grande) to late Puerto Rican Os- tionoid, with the most concentrated occupation oc- curring from A.D. 700 to 1300. Radiocarbon samples taken from material removed during the construction of a plaza suggest a date for the construction of the plaza not later than A.D. 650. A sample dating to A.D. 570 ? 45 (P-2607, based on charcoal) was recovered two levels above the plaza construction backfill, and a sample from a context deposited in another location after plaza construction was dated to A.D. 770 ? 45 (P-2596). Both samples were associated with a tran- sitional ceramic assemblage interpreted as falling be- tween Puerto Rican late Saladoid and early Ostionoid. Radiocarbon dates from the larger Ostionoid occu- pation at Las Flores are A.D. 950 ? 45 (P-2598); A.D. 145</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 890 ? 45 (P-2729); A.D. 960 ? 50 (P-2595); and A.D. 1350 ? 45 (P-2599). Several burials were encountered in these later deposits. A 3-4-year-old child was buried in a stone-lined pit in the northwest corner of the plaza. Another burial of a 3-4-year-old child, found on the southwest periphery of the plaza, provided evidence that the feet had been removed postinterment, and a triangular arrangement of stones was found next to the face. The location and configuration of these burials may suggest some status ascription in mid-to-late Os- tionoid times. Ceramic analyses still are incomplete, but small numbers of modeled-incised adornos suggest a late Ostiones or Santa Elena association. Ceramics with 1-cm rounded indentations on the outer surface, which excavators termed cerdmica hoyuelada or pock- marked ware, were common in the later component of the site. Miguel Rodriguez and Virginia Rivera have con- ducted excavations at the site of Punta Candelero, in southeast Puerto Rico, since 1987. The research has revealed two periods of occupation, a La Hueca or early Saladoid component and a later Cuevas component. The investigations have been directed toward recon- structing the paleoenvironments at Punta Candelero and the patterns of resource utilization through time. Preliminary faunal analyses suggest that during both occupation phases, coastal species were used heavily. During the La Hueca occupation the rocky coasts were exploited heavily, and during Cuevas times, greater attention was paid to areas of Thalasia sea grass. Coral reefs, sandy beach. mangroves, freshwater environ- ments, and interior terrestrial environments also were exploited. Reconstructions of the hydrography of the region suggests motivations for seasonal shifts in re- source exploitation. Edgar J. Maiz, of the Centro de Investigaciones Folk- lo6ricas de Ponce and the Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe has conducted excavations at the site of Hernmndez Colo6n in south-central Puerto Rico. The site lies at 77 m asl, approximately 13.5 km from the sea, on the east bank of the Cerrillos River. Radiocarbon analyses date the site to ca. A.D. 400- 700. Fine-mesh screening procedures have provided abundant zooarchaeological remains associated with Hacienda Grande, Cuevas, and Ostiones ceramics. S. Olson of the U.S. National Museum of Natural His- tory, D. A. Hensley and C. Cutress of the Department of Marine Sciences of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez., G. K. Pregill of the San Diego Natural His- tory Museum, and Renato 0. Rimoli of the MHD are involved as specialists on the project. The analyses of remains from Hernandez Colo6n in- dicate that a greater diversity of species was exploited during the Saladoid occupation of the site than in the succeeding Ostionoid occupation. There is a remark- able lack of terrestrial fauna such as rodents and ter- restrial reptiles throughout the sequence. Also, the rel- ative abundance of manioc griddles (burenes) is greater in Ostionoid strata than in Saladoid strata. Preliminary ceramic analyses suggest that the change from a Cue- vas-associated style to an Ostiones-associated style may have occurred within a relatively short time span (50- 100 years). Radiometric dating of samples associated with ceramics suggests that Hacienda Grande ceramics were in use until ca. A.D. 450. Since 1987, Angel Rodriguez Alvarez and his col- leagues have been conducting a petroglyph survey on the island of Puerto Rico. The goal of the research is to gather information concerning the different artistic motifs, types of rock, and engraving techniques used by Amerindians. So far, the survey has centered on the northeastern Puerto Rican coast and its surrounding highlands. Nine different artistic patterns and five styles of rock engravings have been identified to date. Among the motifs are abstract geometric designs, long zig-zag lines (Coronarize-Capa styles), representation of faces (simple, developed, and complicated), sun symbols, swaddle figures, squatting female figures, Yocahu male figures, zoomorphic, head-on-rectilinear-body feet, and hand-holding anthropomorphic. Several engraving techniques were found such as plain lines, grinding, pecking, modeling, and leveling. Measurements were taken of the size of the figure as a whole unit, and of the width and depth of the grooves. In addition, the compass orientation of the figure was recorded. Future research in other areas of the island will be aimed at locating new artistic styles, and at identifying patterns and techniques of pictographic representation. Investigations were carried out at the site of Las Planas, in the municipality of Cayey in the mountains of southeast Puerto Rico. J. J. Ortiz Aguilu and Hector Gonzalez Moret organized a preliminary survey in 1986 with the help of the Centro Cultural de Cayey and the Cayey University College of the University of Puerto Rico. Andres Principe, Jose Rivera Mel&amp;ndez, Car- melo Rivero, Michelle Lavergne, and Marisol Melen- dez participated in the investigations, with Jerome Ar- ledge of the Soil Conservation Service for the Caribbean acting as a technical consultant on agricultural terrac- ing. Las Planas is an extensive Ostionoid village site with a plaza or ball court at about 440 m asl, and over 300 stone-faced terraces on the slopes to a level of about 530 m asi. The dry-stone terrace walls range from .5 to 3 m in height and extend from 10 to 40 m in length. Test excavations were carried out, and these reveal that both the site and the terraces contain ceramics from middle to late Ostionoid in the local chronology. Al- though more testing is needed, the possible existence of terraces at Las Planas dating from the late first mil- lennium A.D. suggests that the intensification of hor- ticultural production in the Caribbean may have begun in some areas many centuries earlier than is commonly held. LESSER ANTILLES. In connection with a survey of northeastern South American petroglyphs, C. N. Dubelaar conducted investigations made of Lesser An- tilles rock engravings in June-July 1989. A manuscript entitled "Petroglyphs of the Lesser Antilles" based on this and earlier research is ready for publication. Pre- liminary results indicate the following: (1) with the exception of the intricate anthropomorphic engravings on ball-court slabs in Puerto Rico and some other Greater Antilles islands, there exists no marked dif- ference in shape, technique, localization, etc., between Lesser and Greater Antilles petroglyphs; (2) a marked difference exists between Antillean and northeastern South American petroglyphs; (3) rock paintings occur 146 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH in northeastern South America and in the Greater An- tilles, but they are absent in the Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands; (4) simple or elaborate faces comprise two-thirds of Lesser Antilles petroglyphs; and (5) Less- er Antilles petroglyphs do not show a preference for a special orientation (compass bearing). Virgin and Leeward Islands. David R. Watters (Carnegie Museum of Natural History) and Jack Don- ahue (University of Pittsburgh [UP]) conducted point- count analysis of thin sections from 44 sherds (Saladoid and Post-Saladoid) from eight prehistoric sites on four Lesser Antilles islands (Montserrat, Barbuda, Anguilla, and St. Martin). The study confirmed that all sherds from the totally limestone islands of Barbuda and An- guilla contain volcanic inclusions, which suggests that either temper or pottery was imported from volcanic islands in the vicinity. James B. Peterson (University of Maine, Farming- ton) and David R. Watters identified 29 different ce- ramic vessels, 27 of which are undecorated, from three test pits in Fountain Cavern, Anguilla, using Peterson's vessel-lot analysis technique, a method developed for northeastern United States pottery that is now being applied to Caribbean ceramics. During the period April-June, 1987, and Novem- ber-December, 1989, J. M. Baart and a team of ar- chaeologists from the Archaeological Department of the City of Amsterdam, in association with the Ar- chaeological Anthropological Institute of the Nether- lands Antilles, carried out excavations and surveys at the sites of Fort Amsterdam, Frontstreet 120 (Philips- burg), and the Bishop Hill plantation (Belle Pleine) on the isle of St. Martin. The excavations of Fort Am- sterdam were carried out to uncover the remaining wall constructions, to document them, record their condi- tion, to collect information concerning the material culture of the native Indian, European (Dutch, Spanish, French, and British), and African occupants from 1631 to the present. The Frontstreet 120 site excavation was carried out to expand our understanding of the history of the eighteenth-century civil settlement of Philips- burg and to locate the remains of Precolumbian and Postcolumbian Indian culture. A survey at Bishop Hill provided remains of eighteenth-century European and African material culture. In contrast with the known sources, preliminary results indicate that there were Indians living on St. Martin at the time the island was discovered by the Spaniards in the late sixteenth cen- tury. Further, the process of acculturation and the start of modern Afro-Caribbean culture can be traced by means of the study of the excavated material culture. A binational French/Dutch archaeological excava- tion was conducted in October and November 1988, at the Hope Estate site (SM-026), St. Martin. This proj- ect was codirected by Jay B. Haviser from the Ar- chaeological Anthropological Institute of the Nether- lands Antilles and Henri Petitjean-Roget from the Direction des Fouilles et des Antiquities, Guadeloupe, with field assistance from the Centre d'Etudes Regional des Antilles (CERA). Test excavations were conducted to determine general subsurface stratigraphy at the site and acquire radiocarbon samples. Stratigraphic evi- dence indicated both vertical and horizontal separation of a distinctive artifact assemblage prior to and during the early Saladoid occupation at the site. This assem- blage is characterized by ceramics with a lack of painted decoration and a focus on incised lines and modeled- incised lugs on very thin, vitreous sherds; numerous eared axes were noted among the lithic tools. The ra- diocarbon dates, based on charcoal, associated with this component of the site, range from 560 ? 40 B.C. (PITT-0450) to 300 ? 40 B.C. (PITT-0220). From February to May 1990, Menno Hoogland and Corinne Hofman (University of Leiden [UL], Neth- erlands) carried out excavations at the sites of Spring Bay and Kelbey's Ridge on the island of Saba. At Spring Bay excavations were carried at two of the three sites located in 1987 (Spring Bay 1 and 3). At Spring Bay 1 excavations were conducted to determine the geolog- ical setting of the site. A ghut (gully, arroyo) system had been filled up with midden material over a long period. Radiocarbon dates from the lower levels are A.D. 885 ? 30 (GrN-16771, based on shell) and A.D. 745 ? 30 (GrN-16772, based on charcoal). Pottery analyses suggests continual use of the dump area until the thirteenth century. The Spring Bay 3 site on Saba is a small midden. Both pottery analysis and radiocarbon dates confirm habitation until the end of the thirteenth century. Ra- diocarbon dates of A.D. 1295 ? 30 (GrN- 16773, shell) and A.D. 1305 ? 30 (GrN-16774) were obtained. Excavations were carried out at the Kelbey's Ridge site, a habitation area dating to the fourteenth century. Excavations revealed postholes of a concentric or oval structure, a burial of an adult woman together with the cremation of a child, and pottery of the Chican Os- tionoid subseries. Radiocarbon dates of A.D. 1355 ? 30 (GrN-16032, charcoal); A.D. 1340 ? 30 (GrN- 16775, charcoal); A.D. 1320 ? 30 (GrN-16777, char- coal); and A.D. 1325 ? 35 (GrN-16776, shell) were obtained. Preliminary results suggest a small-scale, continuous occupation on Saba in the fourteenth cen- tury under the direct influence of the Virgin Islands (Spring Bay 3) and the Greater Antilles (Kelbey's Ridge 2). A. H. Versteeg and a team from UL carried out excavations at the Saladoid Golden Rock site on St. Eustatius. The research is designed to provide complete documentation for a Saladoid period settlement. A midden and 6 round houses were excavated from 1984 to 1990. Some of the houses are large malocas-com- munal houses for 15-40 people. Many calibrated ra- diocarbon dates demonstrate occupation from ca. A.D. 550 to 750. Zone-incised-crosshatched and red-on- white pottery is associated with all levels of the midden. The Leiden team, under the direction of A. H. Ver- steeg also carried out test excavations at the post-Sa- ladoid Godet and Smoke Alley sites on the leeward coast of St. Eustatius in 1988 and 1989. A large oval structure was excavated near the midden at Smoke Alley. Both sites are dated to ca. A.D. 1100-1200. The Godet and Smoke Alley sites are the only known pre- historic archaeological sites on St. Eustatius that post- date the Golden Rock site. Another Leiden team, also under the direction of A. H. Versteeg, carried out excavations at two preceramic sites on St. Eustatius-Corre Corre 1 and 2. The sites are located near the windward coast. Both sites are dated to ca. 500 B.C.

Watters, Jack Donahue, and Robert Stuck- enrath (UP Radiocarbon Laboratory) report that Bar- buda's aceramic River site (BA4) is the first confirmed Archaic site on the island, based on a radiocarbon date of 1700 ? 35 B.C. (PITT-0717) derived from a shell celt. Palmetto Point, a large peninsula near BA4, did not exist during the Archaic occupation of the River site, a finding that resulted from their study of the Strombus line, a lithified beach ridge marking a paleo- shoreline. Dave Davis (University of Southern Maine) has re- ceived new radiocarbon dates for the sites of Indian Creek (PA3) and Nonsuch Bay (PH 11) on Antigua. The Indian Creek dates are of the oldest levels and are associated with ceramics of the early Saladoid Indian Creek complex, with broad-line curvilinear incision, modeling and white-on-red painting, but no zone-in- cised-crosshatched decoration. The dates are A.D. 170 ? 70 (Beta-37223); A.D. 190 ? 70 (Beta-37224); and A.D. 270 ? 70 (Beta-37225). Three dates also were run from the site of Nonsuch Bay (PHI 1) on Antigua's eastern coast. The ceramics from the site are stylistically homogeneous throughout the site and fall stylistically around the transition from terminal Saladoid (late Mill Reef Complex) to Elenoid (Marmora Bay Complex). The assemblage is domi- nated by red-slipped wares that commonly take the form of wide shallow bowls, often with beveled rims. Poorly executed white-on-red material is present but not common. Incision is slightly more common but equally shoddy in execution (by comparison with ear- lier complexes). The dates from Nonsuch Bay (PHI 1) are A.D. 640 ? 130 (Beta-37226, charcoal) and A.D. 930 ? 110 (Beta-37228). A date of 1660 ? 80 B.C. (Beta-37222) was obtained from a Cadokia shell in a basal level of the site almost devoid of ceramics. Malcolm Weiss (Northern Illinois University) has completed a map of the modern reefs and sediments of Antigua. He is continuing to research the recent changes in Antigua's reefs for the period 1941 to the late 1950s. Bruce Nodine is continuing doctoral re- search on the aceramic occupations of Antigua. JWindward Islands. Researchers from CERA Mar- tinique, under the direction of F. Rodriguez-Loubet, have conducted investigations at four prehistoric and historical-period archaeological sites on Martinique. Collet Leton (CERA) directed excavations at the his- torical-period sugar plantation of Fond Saint-Jaques from 1988 through 1990. Structures dating from 1659 to 1930 were identified. Within the structures several phases of reconstruction were isolated, particularly in the distillery, where a succession of construction phases marks the evolution of sugar-processing and rum-dis- tilling technology since the end of the seventeenth cen- tury. In summer 1990, excavations were extended into other structures used in the refinement of cane sugar. Physiochemical studies of excavated materials cur- rently are underway. Jean-Baptiste Barret (CERA) has conducted exca- vations at the sugar plantation of Creve-Coeur from 1988 through 1990. The site is a large sugar plantation with residential structures representing the socioeco- nomic spectrum of the plantation community. Exca- vations have revealed a seventeenth-century animal- driven mill that was replaced by the only known steam- driven mill on Martinique. The English equipment used in sugar production, along with the particular alloys used in the machinery, permits precise dating of each of the technological modifications. At the prehistoric site of Diamant, Colette Leton and Nathalie Vidal (CERA) conducted excavations from December 1989 to February 1990. The site dates be- tween the third and seventh centuries A.D. and cor- responds to the Saladeroide phase of the island's chro- nology. Geological studies on the island and physicochemical analyses of the ceramics using spec- trometry and X-ray diffraction suggest local manufac- ture of the Diamant pottery. Radiocarbon- and TL- dating projects are underway. The site will be inves- tigated extensively with large-scale horizontal exca- vations over the next five years. The historic city of Saint-Pierre was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Pel6e in 1902. Serge Veuve has conducted excavations in the ruins from 1988 to 1990. Because the historic records of the city were destroyed by the volcano, the historic development of the city is little known. The investigations are designed to recon- struct the sequence of construction of Saint-Pierre, as well as the functions of the parts of the city and the principal known structures. Excavations have been conducted at the old Maison Pecoul, which became known as the Hospice Civil after 1802, and the Bureaux du G6nie et des Ponts et Chaussees thereafter. Future research will focus on the area of the Fort and the Rue Levassor. In August 1989, William Keegan (FMNH) and An- nie Cody (San Diego State) carried out excavations at the Pearls site on the island of Grenada. The site is the product of at least one post-A.D. I Saladoid occupa- tion, but also may contain later components. Exca- vations, supported by grants from the Center for Field Research, served to delimit the boundaries of the site. The site apparently covers more than 40 ha, four times the original size estimate. The excavations also re- vealed a household midden that extended more than I m below ground surface and contained utilitarian pottery and substantial quantities of seeds and animal bones, especially land mammals (dog, opossum, agou- ti, and armadillo). Excavations will continue in June and July of 1990 at which time topographic and elec- tromagnetic maps will be made and excavations will focus on a looted area from which "green-stone" pen- dants and complete pottery vessels have been removed. In August 1989, Peter L. Drewett and the Field Ar- chaeology Unit of the Institute of Archaeology, Uni- versity College, London, carried out excavations at Sil- ver Sands on the south coast of Barbados. The excavations were undertaken to provide information on the economic basis of a late Suazoid population. The site is to be developed as a Heritage Park by the 148 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH government of Barbados. Excavations revealed part of a rectangular posthole structure and midden of conch, together with human and dog burials. The site may date to ca. A.D. 1200-1400.The Silver Sands exca- vation is part of a wider research project examining the prehistory of Barbados. Since 1986 field survey has located 64 sites and four have been sampled by ex- cavation. For the past five years Mary Hill G. Harris has been analyzing the ceramic material found by the Barbados Archaeological Survey, in a joint London Institute of Archeology-Barbados Museum project led by Peter Drewett. A field survey revealed 58 sites and excava- tions have been carried out at four: Chancery Lane, Silver Sands, Hillcrest, and Heywoods. Microscopic analysis of ceramic sherds has so far revealed no vari- ables that can be used as cultural indicators. Macro- scopic sorting has indicated that Barbados pottery fits into the general Lesser Antilles ceramic sequence, but with so far relatively little early Saladoid material and a greater quantity and diversity of material of the Trou- massoid style. Suazoid ceramics particularly are rep- resented richly and are well developed in Barbados. Interim reports have been published in the Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 [in press]) and an Institute of Ar- chaeology Monograph due to be published in 1991. NORTHEAST SOUTH AMERICA AND COAST- AL ISLANDS. Mario Sanoja Obediente and Iraida Vargas (University Central de Venezuela [UCV]) have been carrying out archaeological surveys along the Par- ia and Cariaco gulfs, and in the San Juan River basin in eastern Venezuela. The research is designed to in- vestigate the presence of preceramic shell middens along the Atlantic and Caribbean coasts of eastern Venezue- la. The research has revealed a relation among sea- level fluctuations, expansion of mangrove forests, and human occupation along the old littoral line, located several miles inland, between 6,000 and 2,600 years B. P. Agricultural tools are present in sites located on littoral lagoons by ca. 4500 B.P. Parallel research pro- jects by UCV marine biologists have revealed and dated similar sequences of marine transgressions in other ar- eas of eastern Venezuela. French Guiana. A diachronic study of the occupa- tions of the Vallee du Fleuve Sinnamary is being di- rected by Philippe Nowacki-Breczewski and Olivier Puaux (Direction des Antiquites, AFAN). They con- ducted a large-scale survey of the area. Both prehistoric and historical-period sites were discovered, and chron- ometric studies are underway. Ongoing research is di- rected at obtaining a sufficient sample of sites with which to reconstruct the human adaption to fluvial changes in prehistory. Three projects are being conducted by the Centre ORSTOM (Institut Frangais de Recherche Scientifique por le Developpement en Cooperation of Cayenne and French Guiana, under the direction of Stephen Ros- tain. The projects are investigating the prehistory of the coast of French Guyana. Two rockshelters-Abri Marcel and Carbet Mitan-are the subject of intensive archaeological investigation near the Baie d'Oyapock. Preliminary analyses show the influences of the Arist6 d'Amapa phase as far as the Ile de Cayenne, while Koriabo-phase material from the west is present in- termittently on the coast. Radiocarbon dating and the quantitative seriation of ceramics are being used to establish the chronology and settlement history of the Guyanese littoral. Jay B. Haviser of the Archaeological Anthropolog- ical Institute (AAI) of the Netherlands Antilles has conducted test excavations at seven archaeological sites on Bonaire, from March to September 1987. These relate to Archaic Age, Ceramic Age, and historical- period Amerindian settlements on the island. Exten- sive excavations were conducted at the Wanapa (B- 016), Amboina (B-001), Sorobon (B-008), and Lagun (B-021) sites. Radiocarbon dates from this study in- dicate the Archaic Age spans from 1370 ? 20 B.C. (PITT-0258) to 155 ? 75 B.C. (PITT-0261, shell), and the Ceramic Age from A.D. 470 ? 25 (PITT-0267) to A.D. 1445 ? 35 (PITT-0266, charcoal). Amerindian historical settlements on Bonaire have been identified from the early sixteenth century, with mixed popula- tions continuing until into the early twentieth century. The AAI presently is conducting an archaeological survey in the historic Willemstad district of Punda, Curacao, which has been nominated for the World Heritage List. This project, under the direction of Jay Haviser and Nadia Simmons-Brito, includes mapping and subsurface testing with 74 test-excavation units over the entire Punda peninsula. It is planned that detailed maps of the historical development of the His- toric Willemstad district of Punda will be compiled with this study. A. H. Versteeg (ULN) and J. Tacoma (University of Amsterdam), and the staff the Archaeological Museum of Aruba carried out excavations at Malmok on the island of Aruba. Malmok is a late preceramic (ca. A.D. 300) burial site or formal disposal area. Forty burials were excavated, and the locations are known for an additional 18 interments excavated from 1966 to 1972. The burials occur in clusters, and all graves are covered by large stones. Most have a mineral-based red dye at the skull. Different species of shells have been found in the burial pits. Approximately 10 percent of the dead were buried on top of large sea-turtle carapaces. No midden refuse was found in the area of the burials, but north of it, a small, shallow shell midden is found. Dating results indicate that the midden and the burials are contemporaneous. The Malmok investigations will be published in the Archaeological Museum of Aruba's publication series. Versteeg and the staff of the Archaeological Museum of Aruba will carry out a survey of all known prehistoric sites on Aruba in September, 1990. Approximately 100 sites are known from previous research. Survey results will be published in the Archaeological Museum of Aruba's publication series. Samuel M. Wilson THE AMAZON, EASTERN BRAZIL, AND THE ORINOCO BRAZIL. Bahia. Carlos A. Etchevarne (Univ- ersidade Federal da Bahia) reports that research is be- 149</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ing carried out in the lower middle Rio Sao Francisco. Both colonial and precolonial sites are being studied in this semiarid region of Bahia as part of a larger project designed to investigate the entire coarse of the Rio Sio Francisco, an important route between the cerrado, the caatinga, and the coast. Ethnohistoric re- search into the public and church archives of Salvador and Rio de Janeiro has revealed much information on colonial life at the end of the seventeenth century. Two activities dominated the colonial history: cattle ranching and the establishment of missions by Capu- chins, Jesuits, and Franciscans. Records of the mission of Rodelas, now a city in the aldeia of Tuxa, has shed much light on the missions and the life of the Indians of Bahia. Along with some minor groups, three large groups of Indians are mentioned in the written records. These are the Kariris, the Procas, and the Pankararu. Before this ethnohistoric work was carried out, little information existed on the material culture of these groups. Details of this will be published at a future time. Archaeological work continued to be focused on the settlements found on the sand dunes in the localities of Cabeca do Boi, Surubabel, Jac6, Outeiro, and Porto da Missao (municipalities of Glo6ria, Rodelas, and Chorroch6). All of the sites are in open areas. Lithic material predominates proportionately over ceramic remains. Lithic material is comprised primarily of flaked and chipped stone. Great quantities of archaeological material are found in clearings on the surface of sites, but only rarely is there any depth to the refuse. Sites seem to be linked by small elevated causeways, and little cultural variation or significant environmental variation can be recognized among sites. The ceramic industry is technically well developed and functionally adapted to the processing of manioc. Gardening ap- pears to be the economic base, but hunting, fishing, and collecting must have supplemented the diet of the prehistoric people. Decorated ceramics are represented by only a small proportion of the pottery found. By far the most common pottery found was plain ware. Dec- orative pottery included the following types: rocker stamped, incised (with lines, discontinuous lines, and lines and dots), excised, corrugated, and red painted. The occupation of a dune area between the vdrzeas and the plateau suggests that an articulation with these ar- eas must have been part of the role of the dune oc- cupations. Maria Beltrao (Museo Nacional) continued with her study of the Pleistocene occupations at La Toca da Esperanca, in the interior of Bahia. Her study focuses on possible associations of man and extinct fauna in addition to changes of the paleoclimate. She reports finding a pictograph that may be a representation of a mastodon (Carta Mensal 35(419):29). Mato Grosso do Sul. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz (In- stituto Anchietano de Pesquisas [IAP]), Ellen Vero- neze, Marco Aurelio Nadal da Masi, and Jos6 Luiz Peixoto finished surveying the archaeological sites on the Fazenda Pedra Branca (Paraiso) in the Municipality of Pranaiba on the upper Rio Sucuriu. Four rockshel- ters with petroglyphs and pictographs and one ceramic site of the Tupiguarani tradition have been located. The occupation of the cerrado of the Brazilian Planalto, began in the early Holocene and continued through the climatic optimum. The oldest dates obtained from the largest shelter site are from 10,340 ? 110 B.P. (Beta- 22635) and 10,090 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-22634). These dates probably correspond to the Itaparica tradition in the state of Goias at a distance of 100 km. In a smaller cave, uncorrected dates of 7430 ? 65 B.P. (SI-6955) and 6710 ? 100 B.P. (SI-6956) were obtained earlier. The Tupiguarani occupation has not yet been dated, but it is thought to be recent. The pictographs are similar to the Sio Francisco tradition of Minas Gerais, but at least two painted styles exist. One corresponding to the earliest occu- pation of the area is geometric with one or two colors. The second style, which has not been dated, is repre- sented by stylized biomorphic designs in a single color. The petroglyphs are simple compositions of small cir- cles, rectangles, and curves, and are representative of a widespread tradition found throughout southern Bra- zil. Goids. Ignacio Schmitz also reported on work un- der the direction of Maira Barberi Ribeiro (Instituto Goiano de Pre-Hist6ria e Anthropologia) with the col- laboration of researchers from the IAP. An area of the Rio Araguaia was surveyed where the Rio do Peixe hydroelectric dam will be built. The aim of the research is to understand the settlement pattern of both the preceramic and ceramic cultures in an area where there are few rockshelters. Special attention will be given to comparing the cultures of this area with related ones in Serran6polis, Caiap6nia, and the Alto Sucurifu where there are numerous large rockshelters. A few small shel- ters with simple petroglyphs were found, but generally the area lacks natural habitations. Two sites were found with Caiap6nia-style painting. The most ancient oc- cupation of the small shelters is recent preceramic, 2500 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-33462). The occupations that are most recent were associated with petroglyphs and are ceramic sites of the Uru tradition (1420 ? 70 B.P. [Beta-33463] and 850 ? 60 B.P. [Beta-33461]). Also found were two surface sites of the Uru ceramic tra- dition and a site of the Aratu ceramic tradition that is typical of central Northeast Brazil. Pard. Under the coordination of Klaus Hilbert (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi [MPEG]) research was continued on the cave site of Gruta do Gaviao in the Serra do Carajaids. This salvage project has been fi- nanced by the MPEG and the DVRD Mining Com- pany, which extracts iron ore in the Serra do Carajas. Systematic and extensive excavations of 110 m2 were undertaken between July and August of 1989. The main focus of the work has been on the preceramic occu- pation of the site dated by '4C between 8140 ? 130 B.P. and 2900 ? 90 B.P. (no lab numbers given). Two preceramic occupations have been identified, and a ceramic component has been found near the surface. Lithic artifacts from the preceramic layers include small laterally retouched scrapers and simple utilized flakes. No bifacially modified tools have been found. Raw material for the artifacts, mainly amethyst and quartz crystals, comes from a source 40 km from the site. Due to the crystalline form of the raw material, a bipolar- flaking technique is dominant in the Carajas area. Bones and carbonized seeds were found nearby and inside 150 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH fireplaces that were located in small niches outside the cave. These remains represent the food of the hunters and gatherers. Analysis of the bones and seeds is not yet completed, however preliminary study shows a wide range of species from tropical forest and savanna en- vironments. A five-year international, multidiscipli- nary archaeological project is to begin in the Carajas area at the end of 1990. On May 13, 1990, anthropology (especially anthro- pologists with an interest in the Amazon Basin) lost one of its most dynamic scholars. Donald W. Lathrap died from complications related to intestinal surgery on that day. His studies on the Central Ucayali dem- onstrated that the Upper Amazon was occupied very early by agriculturists and proved that the tropical ba- sin was not merely a backwater to receive influences from refuges of the andean area. He demonstrated that in the Formative period the tropical-forest zone was of substantial influence in South American cultural de- velopment. His book, The Upper Amazon (1970), is the only summary of tropical forest development that exists to date. Amazonian studies surely will miss his ability to see the larger picture and develop compre- hensive models capable of explaining the dispersed data. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA The past year has been a memorable one for andean archaeology. The unearthing of additional tombs of the Moche elite at Sipan, the unexpected discovery of rich Early Horizon burials at Kuntur Wasi, the highly pub- licized initiation of investigations at T6cume, and the continuing revelations of the magnitude of pre-Chavin cultures in Peru all attracted public attention. Rarely has andean archaeology received so much attention from the popular press or has public awareness of the ongoing scientific research been greater. Legal ques- tions concerning the plunder of andean archaeological sites and the illegal trafficking in antiquities from these activities also has come under increasing scrutiny, par- tially as a result of the seizure in California of gold artifacts from a looted Sipin tomb and the resulting litigation for their return to Peru. Meanwhile, a mul- titude of less-publicized investigations have been proceding in Ecuador, Bolivia, and those portions of Peru least affected by guerilla activity. The first half of 1990 also witnessed the death of one of the most influential figures in the field-Donald Lathrap. It is not an exaggeration to say that every scholar working in andean South America felt the im- pact of Lathrap's ideas on Chavin and the relation between the eastern lowlands and the andean high- lands. In the 1970s, his work on the formative cultures of Ecuador helped to revitalize the archaeology of the northern Andes. The breadth of Don Lathrap's knowl- edge, the originality of his ideas, the force of his per- sonality, and the passion he felt for andean prehistory will not soon be forgotten. In addition, I have been informed of the deaths of Carlos Radicatti, best known for his work on the quipu, and of Domingo Torero Arrieta, a pioneer in the pro- tection of the archaeological patrimony of the Huacho area. Torero discovered the important late Preceramic center of Bandurria when it was damaged by the con- struction of a new canal, and its subsequent investi- gation by the archaeologists from the University of San Marcos largely was due to his efforts. After completing this research section, I learned of the tragic automobile accident on August 8, 1990, in which Martha Anders and Margarita Perez lost their lives. Anders had just completed a season of excava- tions at the Middle Horizon site of Maymi in the Pisco Valley and, at the age of 40, was one of the most im- portant investigators of the Huari empire. A meticu- lous and devoted scholar, Anders pioneered the ap- plication of structuralist theory to archaeological remains in Peru. Her publications on Pampa Grande, Azangaro, and Maymi will continue to have a lasting impact on the field. Margarita Perez was an advanced student in the archaeology program at San Marcos Uni- versity and was involved in supervising the excava- tions of the Huaca San Marcos in Lima. ECUADOR. Between August and November of 1989, a project investigating prehistoric agriculture and population growth was initiated by J. Stephen Athens (International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc.) in northern highland Ecuador. Working with Jose Echeverria (Instituto Otavaleno de Antropologia) and Lisa LeCount (University of California-Los Angeles [UCLA]), excavations primarily were conducted at the La Chimba site near Olmedo, though more limited work also was undertaken at the Im- 11 site near Ota- valo and at a site in the Chota Valley. The La Chimba tests revealed an area with 3 m of stratified refuse containing 19 burned occupation surfaces. A 2-x-2-m test pit in this area yielded 63,766 pottery sherds, 13,965 animal remains, 14,085 pieces of obsidian flake debris, 316 fragments of marine shell, 7.7 kg of charcoal, ev- idence of gold working, volcanic ash and cangagua layers, and numerous remains of cultigens and other plants, including maize and various tubers. The ceram- ic sequence confirms that originally proposed by Ath- ens in 1978 with the addition of several new types and subtypes and related information. A basal radiocarbon date of 2330 ? 70 B.P. was obtained. Athens and Echeverria supplemented their archae- ological investigations with the recovery of two cored sediment samples from Lake San Pablo near Otavalo. These were taken in 2.48 m of water near the southwest shoreline. Core 1 penetrated to 5.1 m below the lake bottom and Core 2 went to a depth of 6.15 m. A total of 11 volcanic-ash units were observed in the peaty sediment, with the thickest being 28 cm at 2.6 m depth. A '4C date on top of this ash yielded an age of 2400 ? 130 B.P. Pollen analysis by Jerome Ward (California State University) identified Zea mays at the 6.00-6.05 m depth as well as in the several upper samples. In- terestingly, the deep sample also contained dense con- centrations of charcoal particles that were present in only small amounts in the upper samples. Several lens- es of snail shells also were present below 6 m. Taken together, this information strongly implied forest clear- ance and the practice of maize agriculture at a sur- 151</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY prisingly early date in northern highland Ecuador. John Isaacson (University of Illinois-Urbana [UI]) is work- ing on the identification of the ash layers from this core and correlation with known volcanic events and de- posits in northern highland archaeological sites. Depth soundings and bottom dredge samples also were taken in a transect across Lake San Pablo. In 1989, James A. Zeidler (University of Pittsburgh) initiated a regional archaeological survey of the Jama River valley in northern Manabi Province as part of an ongoing archaeological-ethnobotanical project in collaboration with Deborah M. Pearsall (University of Missouri-Columbia). The study area comprises a 750 km2 area covering the central axis of the drainage, and cross-cuts three distinct physiographic zones including "semiarid coastal plain," "subhumid coastal cordille- ra," and "humid upland valley." A probabilistic survey currently is being carried out that employs stratified random cluster sampling with differential coverage of high- and low-density areas of archaeological occu- pation. This involves 100 percent coverage of all al- luvial areas and sampling of the nonalluvial areas with randomly placed 1 -ha quadrats. The first survey season was concentrated in the middle reaches of the valley where some 115 sites were documented. Several sites were tested, adding six new radiocarbon dates to the regional chronology established during the previous field season. All dates pertain to the Jama-Coaque II occupation of the valley and range from A.D. 420 to 1320.A "rescue" excavation also was carried out on a large bell-shaped pit exposed in an arroyo at the site of Pechichal (M3B4-01 1), a local satellite community of San Isidro located on the main channel of the Jama River. Flotation of the 19 distinct fills of this feature yielded a rich array of artifactual and ecofactual re- mains, as well as two 14C assays averaging A.D. 520. Other field activitiies included topographic mapping of several sites having artificial earthworks including mounds (tolas) of habitational and ceremonial function and long paired ridges (cordones) of unknown function. John Isaacson (UI) reports that tephra samples from archaeological contexts have been collected for the te- phrostratigraphic analysis of the Jama River drainage and sites on the northern Manabi coast. These samples have been recovered from three stratigraphically sep- arate tephra units throughout the Jama Valley repre- senting three periods of volcanic activity spanning the last 4,000 years. The earliest tephra unit dates to ap- proximately 1500 B.C. and seals Valdivia VIII mate- rials in the valley. The middle tephra unit is super- imposed on Chorrera period ceramics representing the valley-wide Late Formative period occupation. The most recent tephra unit occurs in the middle of the long Jama-Coaque sequence. Recent radiocarbon dates place this eruption sometime between A.D. 400 and 500. At this stage of the research, the post-Chorrera tephra is best understood. It is probably a member of the tephra unit representing the eruption of Pululagua Vol- cano at 355 B.C. This material has been recovered from highland and foothill archaeological sites in Pichincha Province. Correlation of this tephra deposit with the highland samples, using trace element analysis of the glass fraction, is currently underway. If successful, a time-stratigraphic horizon will be established that cov- ers a large portion of northwestern Ecuador at the end of the Formative period. This volcanic eruption was of considerable magnitude and may have played a sig- nificant role in the settlement history of this region. In 1988 and 1989, John E. Staller (Southern Meth- odist University [SMU]) directed the Lower Arenillas- Tembladera Survey Project [LATSP], an archaeolog- ical research program including systematic regional set- tlement survey in El Oro Province along the eastern banks of the lower Arenillas River and large-scale ex- cavations at a late Valdivia site in southern coastal Ecuador. The large (11.3 ha) late Valdivia site of La Emer- enciana is situated on a fossil beach ridge directly ad- jacent to the Rio Buenavista-a topographic setting that permits direct access to maritime resources and good arable land. A total of 143 m2 were opened in area excavations exposing a Valdivia VIII floor. In order to obtain information on site chronology, four trenches were dug to sterile soil, and a 32 m profile was cut in a disturbed portion of the site just northeast of the main excavations. The stratigraphy reveals a post-Valdivia occupation floor (floor 1, stratum 1) ex- tending to 10 cm in depth, overlying a layer (stratum 2) of alluvial overburden representing abandonment of the site and extending to various depths. Beneath the alluvium is a layer of a fine gray ashy loam (stratum 3, floor 2) that represents a Valdivia VIII occupation floor. A charcoal sample found in association with this level has a date of 1679 ? 303 B.C. (SMU-4549). Stratum 3 overlies a fine white sand layer (stratum 4), which is interpreted as the result of abandonment and dune encroachment. Below the white sand levels, a pink sand stratum (stratum 5, floor 3) has been iden- tified between approximately 115 and 124 cm below surface. In these pink sand levels portions of wall trenches or foundations have been identified from at least five habitation structures and numerous post molds. A charcoal sample found in these levels has given a date of 2159 ? 215 B.C. (SMU-4259), which corresponds to the initial occupation at the site. The gray ash layer (stratum 3) represents the primary occupation of the site. During this time a natural em- inence of sand was modified to create a platform mound. The Valdivia VIII platform mound is 1.5 m high and measures approximately 74 m north-south by 45 m east-west. Over 130 archaeological features (including four burials, bell-shaped pits, etc.) have been identified in the excavations. The architectural features encoun- tered on the summit include two asymmetrical oval or elliptical burnt-clay platforms constructed of cane-im- pressed daub. The north platform measures approxi- mately 5 m north-south by 4 m east-west, while the south platform measures 3 m north-south by 2 m east- west. Hard-packed clay lenses underlying both burnt platforms had been set on a substructure of large trunks and posts. The platform mound was oriented to the north, facing the sea and offshore mangrove islands. Additional architectural features associated with the mound construction include a series of terraces de- scending to the north, west, and south. The terraces were constructed of packed clay held by retaining walls of vertically set posts set in a hard yellow clay mixed 152 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH with crushed shell. The mound construction involved a much larger investment of labor than previously known architecture of the Valdivia culture. The preliminary analysis of terminal Valdivia ce- ramics from the survey and excavations have been shown to contain ceramic diagnostics not reported pre- viously. Particularly significant are attributes that ap- pear to represent the stylistic and technological evo- lution between the Valdivia and Machalilla ceramic complexes. New Valdivia features include stirrup spouts, various kinds of straight-necked single-spout bottles with elaborate geometric motifs, double-spout- and-bridge bottles, and small elaborately decorated cups. The preliminary evidence points to a possible ninth phase in the Valdivia ceramic sequence, filling an apparent hiatus (ca. 1500-1200 B.C.) in the ar- chaeological record of coastal Ecuador. PERU. Archaeological investigations were initi- ated by Thor Heyerdahl at the 203-ha site of Tficume in collaboration with archaeologists Hugo Navarro and Alfredo Narvaes of the Universidad Nacional de Tru- jillo [UNT] and Daniel Sandweiss (Cornell University). The site includes some 26 major pyramids and many mounds of lesser size. Excavations at one of the pyr- amids has revealed that the summit was reached by a long ramp and that some of its rooms were painted with bird motifs and geometric designs. Evidence of late Prehispanic domestic refuse and metalworking was found at the foot of one major pyramid. Sandweiss reports that several structures in the northern and southern portions of the site were buried during the Late Horizon. In 1989, Tom Dillehay (UI) and Jack Rossen (Uni- versity of Kentucky), in conjunction with Herbert Eling (University of Texas), continued limited excavations at single-component middle Preceramic period (ca. 7000-5000 B.P.) sites in the Nanchoc area of the upper Zafia Valley. A wide range of grinding stones, unifacial stone tools, cultigens (e.g., peanuts, squash, coca, tu- bers, fruits, and unidentified types), and native-copper items (burned and unburned ore, pendants, beads) were recovered from habitation floors inside of elliptical- shaped architectural structures. These remains were associated with large quantities of fragmented burned and unburned human bones and with small portions of fractured animal bones, including deer, snake, and small game. Additionally, Eling excavated a 5-m-deep cut in sediments below a Prehispanic irrigation canal laid out immediately above a pampa near the valley floor and at the base of a series of small alluvial fans where the excavated sites are located. The cut revealed a stratigraphically superimposed sequence of four small irrigation canals, the deepest of which was buried about 3.5 m below the surface canal. Extensive survey and testing suggest that the canals originated upstream. Based on stratigraphic context alone, a Preceramic date is estimated for the deepest canals. These data provide further substantiation of a horticultural lifeway in the upper Zana Valley during the middle Preceramic. Limited reconnaisance and test excavations also were carried out by Eling, Dillehay, and Rossen at selected late ceramic sites in the lower Jequetepeque Valley. Eling was able to refine and extend his study of irri- gation canals. Excavations in remnant agricultural ter- races (yardangs) in sand dunes and aerial photographic and on-ground mapping of dune fields produced new information on the construction and abandonment of large Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon sites. Research conducted in yardangs located at Can- oncillo revealed stratigraphic data on discontinuously used agricultural fields and on the varieties of crops produced. Radiocarbon dates to be obtained from charcoal recovered from yardangs will provide a chro- nological sequence of long-term land-use patterns and of short-term agricultural adjustments made to shifting dunes in the lower valley. Archaeologists Carlos Elera and Jose Pinilla (Museo de la Naci6n [MN]) and Peter Kaulicke (Pontificia Universidad Cat6olica) visited the site of Pu6mape near Pacasmayo in the Jequetepeque Valley. Located near the shore, the site includes the remains of cemeteries, monumental architecture, and possible habitation ar- eas. Looted tombs produced fine ceramics of the Cup- isnique culture, a disc-shaped copper object possibly with a gold surface, and a pyroengraved gourd with feline motifs. Investigators from the MN plan to ini- tiate field work there in the near future. Miguel Cornejo (UNT) has provided information on some of the recent investigations on the north coast. Research has been conducted at La Poza de Huancha- co, a site with a major Gallinazo occupation, and the malacological analysis by Victor Vasques (UNT) iden- tified 60 species of mollusks, 6 species of crustaceans, and 25 types of fish. Among these remains were crabs whose native habitat are mangrove swamps. This may imply the presence of a strong El Nifio event during Gallinazo times. Jose Bautista, Victor Pefia, and Or- lando Angulo (UNT) have documented an Initial pe- riod center with U-shaped architecture-La Carbo- nera-located in the Moche Valley. Historical archaeology was carried out in the city of Trujillo by Miguel Cornejo at the Iglesia de Belem and the Iglesia de Huaman, with the collaboration of Lorenzo Huertas (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos [UNMSM]) and Jorge Zevallos (UNT). Segundo Vas- quez (UNT) directed excavations at another colonial building in Trujillo, the Casona del Mariscal Orbegoso. Santiago Uceda (UNT) and students from UNT con- tinue to carry out investigations in the areas to be affected by the Chavimochic hydraulic project. Their principal objective is to inventory, register and, where necessary and feasible, excavate those sites endangered by this massive project. Heidy Fogel (Yale University [YU]) is currently in Trujillo studying the Gallinazo materials recovered by the Chan Chan-Moche Project to determine the relationship of the Gallinazo occu- pation in Moche to that in Viru and Santa. Warren Church (YU) has returned to Peru in order to continue his excavations at Manachaqui Cave, a rockshelter lo- cated in the headwaters of the Montecristo Valley in the Rio Abiseo National Park. The 1988 excavations there yielded a stratified sequence of Preceramic, Initial period, and Early Intermediate period materials. Work has continued at Sipin under the direction of Walter Alva (Museo Bruning) in collaboration with Luis Chero and Susana Meneses. A major discovery was made in 1989 of an elaborate burial dubbed by 153</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Alva as "El Viejo Senior de Sipin." This interment comes from the earliest period of the mound (Level 6) and is believed to be several centuries older than the burial ("El Senor de Sipan") reported here two years ago, which came from Level 1. The tomb looted in early 1987 that originally drew attention to Sipan is intermediate in age (level 4) between the two scientif- ically documented tombs. All three tombs contain Moche-style artifacts and Alva tentatively dates the use of the Sipan burial mound between A.D. 100 and 300. "El Viejo Sefior de Sipan" was buried with a gilded-copper funerary mask, and spear throwers and spears that had been broken before burial. He wore a gold nose piece in the form of a stingray, a solid-gold backflap, and six large gold and silver necklaces. Also found with the burial were sets of gold and silver ear spools, and fan-shaped rattles showing a supernatural holding a ceremonial knife (tumi). The gold artifacts recovered in 1989 are remarkably high in quality, par- ticularly the gold necklace with pendants depicting spi- ders in the center of fine golden webs. Christopher Donnan (Museum of Culture History, UCLA) made a related find in Jequetepeque Valley at the site of La Mina. Donnan, in collaboration with Alfredo Narvaez (UNT) investigated the looting of a Moche tomb at La Mina and were able to document a disturbed Moche burial similar in grave goods to the looted tomb at Loma Negra in Piura. The La Mina burial was in a ca. 3-x-2-m shaft tomb whose interior walls had been decorated with polychrome painting. The burial chamber was dug into bedrock and had been roofed ca. 2 m above its clay floor before being covered with tons of gravel. Although the burial already had been looted, the investigations were able to recover six ceramic bottles, three of which had inlaid eyes of cut shell. Gold and silver sheet and bangles also were en- countered. The 1989 fieldwork by the Archaeological Mission of the University of Tokyo (UT), directed by Yoshio Onuki, concentrated on the sites of Huacaloma and Kolguitin in the Cajamarca Valley and Kuntur Wasi in the upper reaches of the Jequetepeque Valley. The fifth season of investigations at Huacaloma were su- pervised by Tyozo Matsumoto and Tsuyoshi Ushino. Two corners of the principal perimetric wall were lo- cated in order to establish the dimensions of the temple construction, which is now known to be 124 m east- west and 108 m north-south with a maximum height of 8 m on the northern side. Principal access to the temple was provided by a 1 0-m-wide staircase located in the center of the western side. In front of this stair- case was a low platform with stairs leading down into the artificially leveled floor of "the great depression." Numerous fragments of polychrome wall painting have been found in the rubble at the foot of the northern, western, and eastern walls at Huacaloma, in contrast to their apparent absence at the adjacent mound of Loma Redonda. Onuki interprets this difference as in- dicating Huacaloma's preeminence as the main temple complex. Investigations at Loma Redonda yielded abundant Cuzco polychrome Inca sherds. The site of Kolguitin is located near Las Ventanillas de Otuzco on the northern side of the Cajamarca Val- ley. Two trenches there, supervised by Yuji Seki, re- vealed abundant Middle Cajamarca architecture and pottery. Beneath this occupation were buildings and artifacts belonging to the Early Cajamarca phase, and artifacts of the Late Huacaloma phase. The formative materials (Late Huacaloma and EL) were buried 2-3 m beneath the surface, making it difficult to study these occupations without destroying later constructions. Nevertheless, a good sample of EL phase pottery was recovered for comparison with similar materials found at Kuntur Wasi. The second season of excavations at Kuntur Wasi were supervised by Tasutake Kato, Kinya Inokuchi, and Masato Sahai and students from UNMSM. A long north-south trench was excavated across the central part of the summit and a broad areal exposure was carried out on its northeast portion. The investigations confirmed that the site was abandoned during the So- tera (i.e., Layz6n) period, and that this final episode was characterized by widespread destruction of earlier architecture. Although substantial amounts of Layzon- style pottery has been found on the central part of the summit, no associated buildings have been located. The earliest major construction at Kuntur Wasi is a rectangular building built in the central part of the site that is associated on the south with a white-clay floor and on the east with a 2-m-high platform. Pottery with incised decoration and post-fire paint, reminiscent in some respects of Late Huacaloma ceramics, are found with these features. During the second period at Kuntur Wasi, a thick layer of earth and stone was used to bury the early complex and retaining walls of large stone were erected. The ceramics associated with the con- structions of the second phase include stirrup-spout bottles, cups with exterior beveling, highly polished gray and black wares, incised curvilinear designs, and other attributes related to the Cupisnique style. Most of the constructions and artifacts at Kuntur Wasi belong to the third period, which is characterized by pottery related to the EL phase ceramics of the Cajamarca Valley. During this time, the northern part of the summit was composed of three platforms ar- ranged around a sunken rectangular plaza and left open on the north, thereby achieving a U-shaped layout. On the eastern side of the plaza was a staircase 2.5 m in width that leads from the plaza to the platform. A carved stone, possibly reutilized, showing two feline faces in profile with eyes ringed by the tail of a snake was incorporated into this staircase. This sculpture, is very similar to a carving of unknown provenience re- covered in Carri6n Cachot's 1946 excavations, with the principal difference being that the UT monolith is carved in white stone, while the 1946 monolith was hewn from a reddish stone. On the eastern summit platform were stone rect- angular pillars covered with a layer of thick plaster and finished with a white veneer. Among the other discov- eries on the top of this mound was a small sunken plaza measuring 10 m on a side. Additional subsurface canals were documented on the summit of Kuntur Wasi. The trench across the southern portion of the summit revealed what appears to be a sunken plaza covering an older staircase. This plaza had a yellow clay floor and was built on top of a layer of fill that contains pottery and mural fragments dating to the site's second period. Near the end of the field season at Kuntur Wasi, 154 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH three tombs were discovered intruding into the white floor of the central building of the first period. The cylindrical shaft tombs reached a depth from the floor level of approximately 250 cm. The individuals were buried in a kneeling position, and above and below them were traces of a red or vermillion pigment, pos- sibly cinnabar. One tomb (ATm-2) included the skel- eton of an adult male buried with a gold crown, two ceramic bottles, one ceramic cup (compotera), three large strombus shells, two polished stone ear spools, two polished stone pendants, and stone beads. The grave goods in the second tomb (ATm-3) consisted of a gold crown with a decoration of feline heads, two gold pectorals with elaborate hammered designs, two gold rectangular plaques, a decorated ceramic cup, and a badly damaged undecorated cooking pot. The third tomb (ATm-4) contained two gold ear ornaments, two stone ear ornaments, a stirrup-spout bottle, and an undecorated ceramic cup. Shelia and Tom Pozorski (University of Texas-Pan American, Edinburg) spent several weeks during June and July of 1989 excavating at the site of Bahia Seca, located just north of the Casma Valley. Excavations showed that the site was occupied from the Cotton Preceramic period through the early part of the Early Horizon; it is estimated to date between about 2200 and 800 B.C. The Cotton Preceramic period remains consist mainly of midden deposits similar to other contemporary sites in the area. The main occupation of the site was during the Initial period, and was contemporary with the large inland center of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke and the settlements of Huaynuna and Tortugas. The U-shaped mound at Bahia Seca is a virtual duplicate of the aligned mounds at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, and the ar- tifacts recovered there are identical to those from Pam- pa de las Llamas-Moxeke. The Pozorskis believe that Bahia Seca may have been a coastal administrative center for the larger inland site as well as a control point for the exchange of coastal fish and shellfish for inland agricultural produce. The investigations at Bahia Seca also revealed the remains of an Initial period circular building with a central hearth ventilated by four horizontal subfloor shafts. The circle is about 4 m in diameter and is formed by a stone-lined trough some 30 cm deep and 10 cm wide. Though the form of the building is different, the idea of a central ventilated hearth within a relatively small building is reminiscent of the ventilated hearths of the Kotosh religious tradition. In 1989 Helaine Silverman (UI) completed a nine- month, 100 percent pedestrian survey of the middle Ingenio Valley. This surface reconnaisance covered some 70 linear miles from 200 to 1400 m above sea level and identified more than 500 archaeological sites from the Early Horizon to the Late Horizon. Two- hundred sites of the Nasca culture were recorded, most- ly concentrated in the upper valley. However, a densely agglutinated urban settlement (#165) was discovered in the middle section of the valley on the north bank. This site includes hundreds of habitation terraces, sev- eral rectangular compounds, and a few mounds. Judg- ing from the surface pottery, it was occupied during Nasca 1, 2, 3, and 5, and it appears to have constituted a major urban center. Site #165 is located due north of Cahuachi and is connected to it across the pampa by a geoglyph. David Browne (Royal Commission on Archaeological Monuments in Wales) finished his sur- vey of the Palpa Valley, which has documented some 250 sites. Bruce Owen (UCLA), a member of the Programa Contisuyu, has mapped and carried out both random and purposeful surface collections at El Algodonal in lower Moequegua. He also has carried out small-scale excavations at various parts of the site and cleaned an area of the looted cemetery there. Tiawanaku-related ceramics, baskets, wooden spoons, textiles, and human remains were recovered from the burial area. Exca- vation of floors, cane, and stone walls and other oc- cupation features at El Algodonal revealed that all but one appear to postdate the introduction of Chiribaya ceramics. Directly across the valley from El Algodonal and Loreto Viejo are abandoned field systems and ter- races with storage pits, which may be contemporary with the Tiwanaku-related sites in the valley. Jesus Gordillo and Manuel Garcia (Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Tacna) have identified a mid-elevation Ti- wanaku-related site associated with an intervalley road and a similar complex of cylindrical stone-lined sub- terranean silos. Karen L. Mohr Chfvez and Sergio J. Chavez, with the assistance of geologist Kwo-Ling Chyi (Central Michigan University) conducted a geological survey in the northwestern portion of the Titicaca Basin. This project attempted to locate the clay and temper sources employed in the pottery of the Early Intermediate pe- riod, Late Intermediate period, and Late Horizon in the region, as well as the stone for the sculpture and temple at Pucara. Numerous rock samples were thin sectioned for petrographic analysis by Chyi to be com- pared with previously analyzed thin sections of pottery. During the same season the same investigators, in col- laboration with Manuel Chavez Ballo6n (Universidad Nacional San Antonio de Abad), surveyed the basalt outcrops at Waq'oto, Rumiqolqa, and Raqch'i in Cuz- co as possible source(s) for the biotite vitrophyre used by the Initial period/Early Horizon inhabitants of Mar- cavalle. A lithic workshop with preforms and chipping debris was found near Rumiqolqa. Explorations at Waq'oto, which still has a small resident population of stone cutters, encountered Inca-style pottery asso- ciated with walled enclosures. Subsequently, Karen L. Mohr Chavez continued the study of south-highland pottery production and dis- tribution at the major centers of Raqch'i (Cuzco), Mer- cedes, and Pucara (Puno). Additionally, Sergio J. Cha- vez continued to study the traditional corbel-vaulted structures associated with dispersed settlements in the province of Huancane, Puno. A collaborative effort by three investigators, Richard L. Burger (YU), Karen L. Mohr Chavez, and Sergio J. Chavez has resulted in the analyses by neutron acti- vation and X-ray fluorescence of an extensive sample of obsidian, most coming from the south highlands of Peru, but also from far south coastal Peru, northern Chile, and highland Bolivia. Samples come from the surface and excavation of sites, including those sub- mitted by other archaeologists. A synthesis will focus on changing patterns of obsidian use and regional in- teraction from Preceramic to Late Horizon times. 155</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In June 1989 excavations were begun at Pikillacta, Cuzco, under the direction of Gordon McEwan (Dum- barton Oaks). Three large units excavated in a midden deposit yielded abundant ceramic materials, including sherds in Huari, Qotakalli, Cajamarca, and Nasca-re- lated styles. One rare sherd may be in the Tiahuanaco style. McEwan also recovered bronze pins and needles, obsidian points and blades, spondylus shell beads, and bone tools and ornaments. Major portions of four large structures and a portion of a fifth were excavated, but they produced few artifacts that could resolve questions of room function. However, evidence was found of collapsed second stories and well-preserved white-gyp- sum-plastered floors, staircases, and walls. Three small chambers were excavated in the north- ern corner of the largest structure in Pikillacta. Two were triangular-shaped rooms measuring ca. 2 m on a side. In each room there was a door opening about 1 m high with in situ fragments of wooden lintels. Twenty wooden beams were discovered on the floor of one of these rooms. McEwan interprets this find as evidence of storage. The third chamber was rectangular and measured 3 x 7 m. The unusually fine white-gypsum- plastered walls of this room were preserved to the level of the first-story supports, approximately 3.5 m above the ground floor. The excavations encountered pottery, metal objects, and obsidian points and flakes. The fill material in all three chambers included charred grass and wood suggesting the remains of a burned roof. BOLIVIA. During the 1989 field season, the Proy- ecto Wila Jawira, a multidisciplinary archaeological project directed by Alan Kolata (University of Chicago [UC]) and Oswaldo Rivera (Instituto Nacional de Ar- queologia [INAR]) continued research at Tiwanaku and affiliated settlements. The project is investigating the nature, scope, and variability of Tiwanaku's domestic occupation, the spatial and structural associations be- tween Tiwanaku's domestic and monumental archi- tectural complexes, and the relations between this city and its contemporaneous settlement network in the Valley of Tiwanaku. Ongoing interrelated research in- cludes: valley-wide survey and small-site mapping sup- plemented by test excavations, a systematic surface survey and collection within the metropolitan zone of Tiwanaku itself, and an intensive mapping and broad horizontal excavations of both elite and vernacular res- idential architecture and areas of craft production in the city of Tiwanaku. To date, the entire middle and lower Tiwanaku Val- ley (ca. 480 km2) has received 100 percent survey cov- erage and over 900 sites from the Paleoindian through Inca periods have been located. Nearly 40 percent of these sites are the product of the Tiwanaku occupation of the valley, and many are associated directly with features related to agricultural intensification. The middle valley survey is under the direction of James Mathews (UC), while the lower valley survey is being conducted by Juan Albarracin-Jordan (SMU). Ap- proximately 25 percent of the estimated 8 km2 of Ti- wanaku has been mapped, and 10 percent of the surface has been intensively collected employing systematic aligned and random sample collection techniques. Ma- jor excavations were initiated in an "elite" (Putuni) complex under the direction of Howard Earnest and Kathryn Sampeck (UC) and in "commoner" (Aka- pana-east complex) domestic architecture under the supervision of John Janusek and Martin Giesso (UC). Excavations at the ceremonial structure of Akapana were directed by Linda Manzanilla and Maria Renee Baudoin (Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de Mexi- co). Materials analysis of surface ceramic collections by Cheryl Sutherland (UC) is nearing completion and will be reported in a forthcoming technical report. Paleoecological research by Michael Binford (Har- vard University) and Mark Brenner (University of Florida) continued to focus on the Tiwanaku agricul- tural landscape with an emphasis on laboratory anal- ysis of sediment cores obtained in 1986-1988. Kolata, Rivera, and Jorge Guzman (INAR) continued with in- vestigations of rehabilitated raised fields in the Pampa Koani zone. The Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) sponsored an on-site course in archaeological conservation at Ti- wanaku during the 1989 field season. The course brought together eight staff members of INAR for theoretical and practical training and practicums in archaeological site conservation at Tiwanaku. GCI's collaboration with INAR will continue in an expanded format of technical analysis of monuments, environmental monitoring, and a second training course at the site during the 1990 season. Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE ARGENTINA. Northwest. Under the direction of Ana Maria Lorandi (Universidad de Buenos Aires [UBA]), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cienti- ficas y Tecnicas [CONICET]), archaeological and eth- nohistorical work continued on Inca occupation at sev- eral sites in the Quire-Quire and Chicona Valle2 s (Tucuman). The main objectives of the project are to identify the kinds of linkages established between the Inca and local groups, state use of unoccupied lands, archaeological correlates of the ethnicity of intrusive state populations, and intergroup relations and mech- anisms of group mobility to achieve state goals. Eth- nohistorical investigations carried out by Lorandi have determined that some mitmaquna were local people of Tucuman. Others probably were imported from the altiplano and from Cusco. One Cusco group, the Pac- ciocas originally from Sicuani, coexisted with the Cal- chaquies in Tolomb6n. In the southern Calchaqui Val- ley were the ingamana, an informal name given to the camayos oficiales del Inca. As part of Lorandi's project, Milena Calderari (UBA, CONICET) is investigating Puerta de la Paya, a large Formative-Hispanic habitational site and Guitian, an Inca tambo (Salta). Various ceramic types (Cusco pol- ychrome, Casa Morada polychrome, La Paya polished blackware, La Paya black-painted ware) were recov- ered, suggesting the presence of mitimaes from the Yavi puna and from the Quebrada de Humahuaca (Jujuy). 156 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH Calderari also is seriating ceramics recovered from ex- cavated tombs in order to provide new data on local chronological sequences and on social stratification and ethnic identification. Future research is planned at La Paya and other sites in the middle Calchaqui Valley. Also affiliated with Lorandi is Veronica Williams (UBA, CONICET) who is excavating the Potrero Chaquiago site located in Quire-Quire (Catamarca). Independent ceramic analysis carried out by Williams and by Maria Beatriz Cremonte (UBA, CONICET) has determined a possible mitimae enclave of altiplano and local Tu- cuman-Santiago groups. Investigations at Potrero Cha- quiago also have identified several activity areas, in- cluding ceramic and textile workshops. Another site under study is the Tambo Ingenio del Arenal Medanos, where metallurgical activities are identified. Cremonte (UBA, CONICET) also reports on her analysis of clay sources of Formative and Inca ceramic types from sites in Quebrada de Humahuaca and Pu- cara de Tilcara. She is focusing on mineralogical com- position and manufacturing methods, as well as on ethnographic techniques of production. Different tech- niques are reported for Inca, Famabalasto black-on- red ware, Yocavil, and other puna-based types from the altiplano. She believes that different ceramic types represent coexisting mitmaquna ethnic groups. Myriam Noemi Tarrag6 (UBA) is involved in sev- eral projects. She continues her study of late Prehis- panic sociocultural developments in three Calchaqui valleys. Survey in the Santa Maria Valley has resulted in a better understanding of the spatial distribution and correlation of Santamariana ceramic types and resi- dential sites. Emphasis is given to intrasite variability of Loma Rica types and to locating and mapping in- terrelated sites in Rincon Chico. Analysis of faunal and vegetal remains from excavated urban sites also is un- derway. As part of Tarrag6's research team, Lidia Baldini (UBA) is investigating resource content and structure and the use of organization of space in the Molinas and Calchaqui valleys, particularly at the Molinas I site (A.D. 800-1000). Maria Cristina Scattolin contin- ues her settlement- and subsistence-pattern studies of Formative village sites on the western slopes of Acon- quija (Catamarca). She has identified copper technol- ogy at the Ingenio del Arenal-Faldas del Cerro site. Wild beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, var. aborigineus) were recovered from the Lomo Alta site suggesting possible complementarity between the highlands and lowlands. Interdisciplinary research on late prehispanic settle- ment-subsistence patterns in Quebrada de Humahuaca also is under investigation by Tarrag6 and her asso- ciates. Limited excavations are in progress at Pukara de Tilcara, a late Preceramic period site. Participating in various aspects of Tarrag6's research are Susana Renard de Coquet, M6nica Pineiro, Maria Fernanda Torres, Ines Maldonado, Milena Calderari, Marcelo Magadan, Marta Ruiz, Estela Ferrazzano, Susana Bas- ilico, Maria Beatriz Cremonte, Maria Ester Albeck, Sergio Aleksandrowicz, Maria Clara Rivolta, Gabriela Sica, Sandra Sanchez, Maria Asuncion Bordach, and Osvaldo J. Mendonca. Beatriz N. Ventura (UBA) is comparing ceramics excavated from the Antiquito site (Salta) with those from sites in the Quebrada de Humahuaca and in Tier- ras Bajas (Jujuy). Ventura also is surveying Ceramic period sites in the Cordillera de Zenta. In the northwest puna region of Antofagasta de la Sierra, Elizabeth Pintar (University of Tulsa) and Car- los Aschero analyzed two different lithic assemblages from Quebrada Seca 3, one radiocarbon dated ca. 7220 B.P. and the other ca. 4700 B.P. The older materials probably are indicative of ephemeral hunting camp- sites and specialized activities, as suggested by a high frequency of fractured projectile points (mainly stems) and tool types. The younger assemblage is character- ized by more tool diversity, more nonlocal cherts, and less diversity of types, representing temporary occu- pations by both hunters and herders. More research is planned on lithic changes associated with the transition from hunting to herding camelids and on the analysis of bone remains and animal-hair fibers. Dolores Etkin (CONICET, INA) is continuing her analysis of faunal remains from the Quebrada Seca 3 site. Seventeen occupational levels, representing a time span from 9000 to 4500 B.P., have been excavated. Faunal species from the upper levels primarily consist of camelid remains, most of which are Lama vicuna, though osteometric analysis also suggests the presence of Lama glama. Other taxa represented are rodents (Lapidium viscacia and Ctenomys sp.) and one bird species (Phoenicoparrus andinus). The lower levels have not been excavated. Both the long time span of occu- pation and the excellent preservation of the faunal ma- terial permit a detailed zooarchaeological study of ca- melid exploitation, including butchering patterns, age profiles, and frequency counts of different anatomical elements. She also is carrying out a bulk-density anal- ysis of camelid, rodent, avian, and pinniped skeletons, in order to understand differential preservation of an- imal bones in the archaeological record. Archaeological, ethnographic, and experimental studies were conducted by Maria Isabel Hernmndez Llosas (CONICET, Instituto de Antropologia e His- toria Hispanoamericana) and her team of students from the Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires, the Univ- ersidad Nacional de la Plata, and the Universidad Na- cional de Rosario, on local and regional stylistic pat- terns in rock art and in textile, wood, and ceramic iconography from various sites in Jujuy. Limited ex- cavation has been carried out at 20 rockshelter sites. In the Quebrada de Pintoscayoc, rock-art styles, par- ticularly at Pintoscayoc 1 (Alero de las Circumstan- cias), date from late Pleistocene to historic times. Parana-Pampa. Nora Flegenheimer (Comisi6n Nacional de Investigaci6n Cientifica y Tecnolo6gica [CONECYT]) continued her Paleoindian research at Cerro El Sombrero in the Tandilia Hills. Excavations at Abrigo I and a nearby open-air site have yielded a large lithic assemblage, including 70 Fell's Cave fishtail and stemmed projectile points, in addition to aborted bifacial blanks and preforms, numerous thinning flakes, and utilized broken bifaces. Geoarchaeological and ar- chaeological site-formation-process studies are under- way at five other Paleoindian sites. Maria Jos6 Figuerero (UBA) surveyed the northern margin of Rio Colorado, the southern portion of the Pampean region.

A burial site was located on an eroded, stabilized sand dune containing the remains of a secondary burial in association with surface finds of horse, guanaco, rhea, and armadillo bones. Burial treatment and physical characteristics are similar to the North-Patagonian burial sites known from the Peninsula San Blas and from the Rio Negro areas farther south. The artifacts include pottery, lithic debris, Pampean and Patagonian projectile points, and colonial materials. Valliserrana, Mendoza, and Neuquen. The Insti- tuto de Investigaciones Arqueolo6gicas (IIA) y Museo de la Universidad Nacional de San Juan, under the direction of Mariano Gambier, investigated archaeo- logical materials dating to the middle and late Ceramic periods (ca. A.D. 660-1300) in Cerro Calvario de Cal- ingasta. Excavations were initiated at Alto Verde de Calingasta, an Inca site where 27 cylindrical caverns were cut into a stone cliff. The caverns are 6 m deep, with 6-m-long entrances and 7-m-wide internal cham- bers, which were used as tombs. The entrances of some caverns are sealed by stone slabs. Maize, corn, wool and cotton textiles, human long bones, and other ob- jects were recovered. Under the guidance of Mario Consens, the IIA is also surveying rock art sites in the San Juan Valley. The IIA has published several mono- graphs on prehistoric and historic research carried out in various areas by Gambier, Catalina Teresa Michieli, and Maria Cristina Krause Y. Working on the effects of Holocene volcanic activity on human settlement in Neuquen (Rio Negro), Jorge Fernmndez (CONICET, INA) reports on macroscopi- cally distinct tephra layers at several sites in Lago Tra- ful. Building on the tephra chronological sequence worked out by Auer in the 1960s and 1970s, he has excavated a cultural layer stratigraphically juxtaposed between two volcanic lenses, dated ca. 7000 and 4500 B.P., respectively. The cultural layer yielded triangular projectile points, obsidian flakes, grinding stones and pottery dated ca. 1370 ? 70 B.P. (A-4878). Interbed- ded peat layers from two ash lenses also yielded youn- ger radiocarbon dates. Fernmndez explains the strati- graphic discrepancy as a result of poorly defined tephra processes and of different interbedding sources of vol- canic activities. He believes that more mineralogical and petrographic studies will clarify the problem and notes that Auer's tephra chronology should be used very cautiously. Patagonia. In 1990, Cristina Bellelli (CONICET, INA) initiated excavations in the Campo Cerda I rock- shelter in Piedra Parada (Chubut). The lowest levels contained flake tools; the upper levels yielded stemmed projectile points and pottery (Tehuelchense II). Gua- naco (Lama guanicoe) and vegetal remains were re- covered from all levels. Rock art appears inside the shelter. A silex quarry and open-air site were discov- ered nearby. Julieta G6mez Otero (Centro Nacional Patag6nico) is examining coastal and interior relations in Bahia Camarones and Punta Bustamente (Chubut). Resource distribution (including plant species exploited by the historic Tehuelche) and routes of migration are em- phasized. She reports that various species of bird, mol- luscs, fish, terrestrial and maritime mammals, and plants were available along the coast. Sources of fresh water and lithic raw materials were scarce along the coast and occur 20-30 km inland. Several large coastal mid- dens are characterized by numerous lithic types, in- cluding knives, scrapers, stemmed perforators, projec- tile points, bolas, grinding stones, and various species of marine shells. Patagonian ceramic grayware also was recovered. Otero concluded that shell middens are temporary campsites of interior hunters who occa- sionally exploited littoral resources. Vivian G. Scheinsohn (CONICET) sends new in- formation on her morphological and functional anal- ysis of bone tools from sites in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. She notes that the mechanical properties of different types of bone elements are selected for dif- ferent tool types. Intra- and intersite comparisons are made to determine diachronic development and change in bone-tool manufacture and use. Hugo G. Nami (UBA, Programa de Estudios Pre- hist6ricas [PREP], CONICET) carried out research ini- tiated by Sanguinetti de Bormida in the Gallegos-Chico valleys (Santa Cruz). Nami is working with an inter- disciplinary team to study changing technological and economic adaptations during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. Sanguinetti, Curzio, and Nami also are excavating the Piedra del Aguila II rockshelter and studying lithic-manufacturing techniques, partic- ularly of cores and microblades. Replicative and ex- perimental research on bifaces, blades, and microb- lades from Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and northwest Argentina also form part of their research program. Cecilia P&amp;rez de Micou (CONICET, UBA) is in- volved in two archaeological projects in Patagonia. One is a salvage project in Lago Posadas-Rio Belgrano (Chubut). The other is an ethnoarchaeological project focused on the caloric values and economic uses of plant species recovered from residential sites in Villa Cerro Castillo (Chile) and in the Valle de Piedra Parada (Argentina). Luis Alberto Borrero (CONICET) is studying diver- gent evolution in the deep south of South America. In 1989, he examined the distribution of lithic debris on the north coast of Lago Argentina (Santa Cruz). Ta- phonomic investigations of regional fauna also were carried out in San Pablo (Tierra del Fuego), and in Lago Argentina, Rio Santa Cruz, and Piedra del Aguila (Neuquen and Rio Negro). As part of the ongoing urban salvage program of the Museo Territorial, Maria Jose Figuerero (Universidad Nacional de La Plata [UNLP]), excavated two sites in Bahia Golondrina (Beagle Channel). Rio Pipo 17, a small midden on a glacial morraine, has yielded abun- dant debitage, bifacial artifacts, and projectile points made of local raw material. Debora Kligman (UBA) is studying lithic-manufacturing techniques. One radio- carbon date of 1080 ? 85 B.P. (GX-14317) has been obtained from Rio Pipo 17. Tolkeyen, a large midden partially eroded by wave action, contains two depo- sitional units separated by 50 cm of culturally sterile sand. The upper unit has a basal charcoal date of 490 ? 80 (GX-14316) and lies on the present beach level. The underlying unit is level with the present low tide mark and has a charcoal date of 760 ? 80 (GX- 14315). 158 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH Both units contain artifacts characteristic of late period occupations in the Beagle Channel. BOLIVIA. Cochabamba. In 1988, the Cocha- bamba Formative Period Project continued with sur- vey and stratigraphic excavations, supported by the National Geographic Society. David Pereira, Ram6n Sanzetenea, and Maria de los Angeles Munioz (Uni- versidad Mayor de San Sim6n [UMSS]) and Donald Brockington (University of North Carolina) visited 70 sites and excavated in four: Aiquile, Villa Granado, Khopi, and Yuraj Molino. Research primarily focused on recovery of ceramic sequences that were defined and related to surrounding regions. The earliest ceram- ics, best represented at Yuraj Molino, are believed to have entered the Cochabamba highlands around 1150 B.C. (GX-15145). Later local traditions are regional manifestations. Anthropomorphic figurine fragments from Khopi, dated to 675 B.C. (GX- 14637), show strong affinity to later ones in northwest Argentina, suggesting influence upon that region from southern Bolivia. There seems to be a general paucity of Formative materials in southern Cochabamba after 200 B.C., possibly due to dispersal of formerly sizable villages into smaller sites or, more likely, a considerable decline in popu- lation. The latter inference agrees with findings in the Cochabamba Valley in 1985 that indicate a sharp de- cline in population there between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200. Richard S. MacNeish (Andover Foundation for Archaeological Research) and Ricardo Cespedes (UMSS), with Mufioz and Brockington, excavated a small Archaic-Formative-Inca rockshelter at Kayar- ani, recovering lithic remains with strong similarities to those found by MacNeish in Ayacucho. In 1989, Pereira, Sanzetenea, Munioz, and Brockington returned to Yuraj Molino for further excavations, supported by the Instituto para la Educaci6n y el Desarrollo Rural, recovering additional ceramic evidence of Initial pe- riod traditions as known in Peru and Ecuador. CHILE. Atacama. Francisco Gallardo Ibanez (Museo Chileno de Arte PreColombino [MCAP]) and Alvaro Roman Berenguer and Angel Deza Turiel (Universidad de Chile [UC]) head a research team studying regional chronological sequences and settle- ment patterns in the oasis of Quillagua in the Atacama desert of Tarapaca. They report a high density of large habitational sites and cemeteries. Excavations in La Capilla (Late Intermediate period and Inca), Ancachi (Middle Tiawanaku period, A.D. 300-900), Cemen- terio Oriente (Inca), Cementerio Oriente Alto (Late Intermediate period), Cementerio Poniente (Late In- termediate period), and in large village sites have yield- ed abundant evidence of middle Tiawanaku, post-Tia- wanaku, and Inca occupations. Settlement patterns are reconstructed from controlled surface collections of ce- ramics and intersite stylistic analysis. Thermolumi- nescence (TL) dates on redwares and brownwares were processed from A.D. 200 to 1275 (UCTL Lab). Maize, snuff tablets, polished redwares, and coiled basketry- recovered from Ancachi were dated at A.D. 270 ?+ 160 (UCTL). Leather shirts, algarrobo beans, slipped red- wares, and textiles were datedat A.D. 680 ?+ 110 from the Cementerio Oriente Alto. Dated materials from the Cementerio Oriente and Cementerio Poniente sites presumably reflect cotraditions of Pica-Tarapaca and Lasana-Loa Medio groups, respectively. In 1989, Jane E. Flaherty and Thomas F. Lynch (Cornell University) returned to the Punta Negra and Atacama Basins, to work at previously discovered sites and survey parts of the Quebrada del Agua Colorado, Quebrada Guanaqueros, and the Rio Grande de San Pedro. They also examined and photographed collec- tions and studied manuscripts at the Instituto de In- vestigaciones Antropolo6gicas (Universidad del Norte) in San Pedro de Atacama. Lynch selected obsidian samples from 10 percent of the sites identified in his 1983-1988 survey of the Punta Negra region, three of these sites having well-controlled soil-temperature data obtained from Ambrose-type cells of polycarbonate resin. Christopher M. Stevenson (Archeological and Historical Consultants) developed a hydration rate, un- der experimental conditions of high temperature and pressure for one of the obsidian types in the collections. While only 16 hydration-rim measurements have been made, the results calculate to ages of from 8275 B.C. to A.D. 1418, conforming very well to the expected settlement history. Valles Transversales-Central Valley. Maria Teresa Planella (Sociedad Chilena de Arqueologia) is working with Ruben Stehberg, Hans Niemeyer, Blanca Tagle, and Carmen del Rio at Cerro Grande de la Compania, an Inca fortress located on a strategically located hilltop in the Rio Cachapoal (Rancagua). An unpublished six- teenth-century document describing a large architec- tural complex in the area led the research team to the site. A series of stone walls, built at different elevations, skirt the hillside. Inca provincial architectural in the form of rectangular and circular compounds, towers, and colcas are located in an internally segmented plaza on the hilltop. Below are circular residential structures constructed in a local architectural styles. Cerro Gran- de de la Compania and two previously excavated sites, Pucara de Chena and Cerro Tren-Tren de Donihue, have provided information on the southern Inca fron- tier along the Rio Maipo. Research at Cerro Grande de La Compania is carried out under the auspices of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Museo Re- gional de Rancagua, and the Fondo Nacional de Cien- cias y Tecnologia. Stehberg also participated in a long-term project study of Inca roads in Norte Chico. He reports finding var- ious lateral roads and architectural sites in the upper Rio Huasco. The longitudinal road connecting the Co- piapo Valley to the north and the Elqui Valley to the south passed through the Huasco Valley at Portezuelo Canzarito (4,000 m asl). From there, the road turns eastward into the higher and deeper andean mountains at Laguna Chica and Estero Valeriano. Several Inca provincial sites were discovered along the road, in- cluding Portezuelo Cantarito, Laguna Chica, Tambil- los, and Vicunita. Two lateral segments of the road connect the coast and highlands. One descends from the upper Rio Huasco, through Encierro Canyon in Transito Carmen, Vallenar, Freirina, and Puerto de Huasco, to the coast. An important tambo was dis- covered at Encierro. The other road enters about 20 159</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY km north of Paso del Inca, extends through Rio Gran- de, and follows a hill line to Pcrtezuelo El Abra, where it reaches Vallenar. Although this latter road passed through unpopulated areas, it was shorter in distance. Stehberg postulates that the Inca occupation of the Huasco Valley centered primarily on the extraction of gold and copper and on vicuna herding, and second- arily on agricultural and marine products. Additional work is planned in the Elqui Valley to the south. Araucania. Am6rico Gordon (Universidad de la Frontera) carried out his third field season at the six- teenth-century Spanish settlement of Casa Fuerte near Puc6n. He reports finding the architectural foundations of several residencial structures, in addition to burials, two varieties of corn, and Mapuche and Spanish ce- ramics. Gordon believes that Casa Fuerte was the res- idency of the first encomendero in the Villarrica area. Tom D. Dillehay (UI) and Am6rico Gordon discov- ered a large and extensive Prehispanic earthen-mound complex in the precordillera of Region 10. The com- plex consist of more than 40 mounds ranging in height from 2 to 12 m and in diameter from 15 to 35 m. Surface ceramics recovered from erosional cuts and nearby habitational areas pertain to the twelfth through seventeenth centuries. Archaeological and ethnoar- chaeological research is planned in the future to de- termine the nature and age of the complex. Ximena Navarro Harris (Universidad Austral de Chile) directed a settlement and subsistence pattern study of the Mehuin coast near Valdivia. Preliminary results of excavations at two playa sites, Pichucullin and Cheuque, revealed intact stratigraphy of cultural layers. Both sites have yielded marine shells (Concho- lepas concholepas, Tegula sp., Fisurella sp., Nucella sp., and M. donaciumn), faunal remains of birds and of maritime and terrestrial mammals, lithic industries, and ceramics. The upper levels of Pichucullin con- tained Spanish and late Mapuche pottery types. The Mapuche ceramics are utilitarian and characterized by smooth and slipped surfaces, and red and brown wares (some possessing Spanish attributes). The lower levels yielded a polished blackware of the Pitren type. Ra- diocarbon dates of 780 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-33317) and 840 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-33316) were calibrated for the deeper deposits in Pichucullin, corresponding roughly to the Pitren phase. A date of 470 ? 120 B.P. was processed for the level above the Valdivia ceramics, suggesting that this type dates before the Colonial pe- riod, as previously hypothesized by the Argentine ar- chaeologist Osvaldo Menghin. Canals. Patricia Curry (Cambridge University) completed the second phase of her field work at Puerto Eden in the Chilean fjords, with the assistance of Pedro Cardenas (Instituto de Patagonia [IP]) and sponsorship from the L. S. B. Leakey Foundation. Trenches were excavated in two of the shell middens located in the first survey of 1988. The sites chosen for study were in a protected area of an inner harbor and the other on Morton Island, bordering the Messier Channel. These sites were selected on the basis of their contrasting locational characteristics, in order to assess intersite variability. Deposits consisted of soft, very compacted shell with a present depth of 2 to 3 m. Water screening of this material produced large faunal samples; analysis indicates significant exploitation of both terrestrial and marine mammals, birds, and fish, in addition to marine molluscs at both sites. Artifacts found included bone tools, generally resembling those known from the Straits area, but with apparent local variation. Evidence of lithic reduction also was found, consisting of flakes and cores of imported materials. Coring in the areas sur- rounding both midden sites revealed thin deposits of Choromytilus chorus periostracum and possible an- throsols under more than a .5 m of sterile soil. The nature of these deposits and their association with the larger middens needs to be clarified. A short explora- tory cruise in the vicinity of Canal Grappier indicated that sites are smaller and less numerous than at Puerto Eden, which seems to have been an important locus of activity throughout time. Patagonia. Beginning in 1985, the IP has been con- ducting early man research at several sites in Ultima Esperanza, under the direction of Mateo Martinic. In- vestigations at Cueva del Medio by Hugo G. Nami and Alfredo Prieto (IP, Universidad de Magallanes [UM]) has yielded archaeological materials indicative of gen- eralized economic activity. The bone remains of Mil- odon, Hippidium, Pantera onca messembrina, Canis avus, and other species have been recovered from hearths. Several bone tools and fishtail projectile points are in association with these remains. Radiocarbon dates on carbonized plants from the deepest levels were processed at 10,550 ? 120 B.P. (GRN-14911); 10,310 ? 70 B.P. (GRN-14912); 12,390 ? 180 B.P. (PITT- 0343); and 9595 ?+ 112 B.P. (PITT-0344). Cueva del Medio is located about 1 km east of Cueva Milodon. Another site, Cueva del Lago Sofia, located 8 km north of Cueva del Medio, has yielded similar remains, in- cluding Hippidium, Milodon, and unidentifiable spe- cies and projectile points. One radiocarbon date on charred wood was processed at 11,570 ? 60 B.P. (PITT- 0684). These data indicate that a widespread area of southern Patagonia, especially Ultima Esperanza and Rio Chico (including Fells Cave and Lali-Aike), was inhabited during late Pleistocene times. Hugo Nami, under the auspices of the IP and the UM. participated in his fourth season of fieldwork at the paleoindian site of Cueva del Medio (Ultima Es- peranza). Three hearths, various lithics, and faunal re- mains of extinct animal species were recovered in the lower levels. Located nearby is another rockshelter, Pedro Cardenas, where recent excavation has started. Tom D. Dillehay 160 [Vol. 56, No. 1, 1991]</page></plain_text>
