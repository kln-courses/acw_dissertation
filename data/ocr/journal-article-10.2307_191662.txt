<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE J. DONALD MOON Wesleyan University T HE OBVIOUS BASIS FOR DECIDING moral and political issues is, as Plato argued long ago, the Truth. Unfortunately, it is not always, if ever, available. Some would deny that the notion of truth, understood in the traditional way as correspondence to reality, is a meaningful or useful concept at all. But even those who continue to adhere to some kind of realism are prepared to recognize that all that we have to work with is our judgments, more or less well informed or thoughtful, where the "our" in question refers broadly to everyone who participates in moral and political life. When we agree, when we are able to respond to criticism and win over doubters, we have good (indeed, the best possible) reason to act on our judgments. But agreement obviously does not mean that we have the truth, let alone the Truth, for we might discover later that we were wrong. It should go without saying that the judgments of many are never articu- lated and sometimes are not even formed in the first place. This silence is often due to the suppression of certain voices by structures of domination and oppression, though deciding what counts as domination is itself prob- lematic. However, the possibility of domination reminds us that the alterna- tivc to agreement is imposition, whether by force or by more subtle forms of manipulation. No doubt, the best justification of imposition is that the norm or structure one imposes on others is "true," and so one's exercise of force or manipulation is legitimate. Plato spoke of "noble lies." But if we can never get the Truth, if we only have our judgments, the failure to reach agreement should at least give us pause: If we have such good grounds for our beliefs, why have we been unable to convince others?

Thus it is easy to see the attractiveness of what we might call "discourse-based" models of ethical and political judgment, in which the validity or acceptability of moral and political propositions is based on their being accepted by, or acceptable to, those who are subject to them, when their acceptance results from, or is tested by, a process of free discussion or discourse. For those who have come to be skeptical of foundationalism in any of its various forms, a discourse-based conception of moral and political judgment enables us to elide the issue of moral truth by substituting for it a procedure that would enable us to coordinate our activities in a satisfactory manner.' For those who wish to salvage more of the aims of traditional philosophy, the idea of a consensus emerging from a suitable process of discourse is attractive as a way of providing a nonfoundationalist but none- theless rational grounding for normative validity claims.2 And at least some realists would not disparage this concern with agreement as "merely" a kind of "political compromise" but would take agreement as a reasonable indica- tor of moral truth. Thus, with the exception of those who discover truth in essentially private revelations to which they alone are privy, the idea of a consensus emerging from discourse is one that is persuasive from many points of view. Implicit in any discourse-based ethics is an ideal in which social interac- tions and relationships are governed by principles or, speaking more gener- ally, "considerations" which are freely accepted by the parties to the relation- ship. In a moral relationship, as I will use the term in this essay, people conform to the expectations constituting the relationship because they regard them as appropriate, as binding or desirable, and not because they are coerced or manipulated into doing so. This formula should not be interpreted nar- rowly, especially not in a way that is overly "rationalistic." Our relationships and interactions are compounded of many different elements, including affective and emotional ties and revulsions, habitual and unreflective attach- ments, calculations of interest, and considerations of duty and moral princi- ple. All of these and more may be included in the "considerations" which enter into our acceptance of the expectations constituting a relationship. As I use the term, a "moral" relationship is one that is not based on coercion or the manipulation of one party by the other, but it may not be particularly "moral" in the sense that it is self-consciously governed by what the parties regard as moral principles or values. And, it should be noted, observers and participants may reach different judgments about a relationship. Where</page><page sequence="3">204 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 observers see manipulation, participants may not -even when apprised of the observers' judgment and the grounds for it. Moral relationships are not necessarily based on equality, for people could freely accept positions of subordination. Further, I do not mean to suggest that moral relationships are never experienced as confining. It may often be the case that their expectations conflict with other values or objec- tives one holds, and so conforming to them may be difficult or even painful. But one should not resent their demands as impositions, even if one might wish to evade them. It may not be possible that all of our relationships be moral ones. If agreement cannot be reached, there is no alternative to imposition. This is true even if one rejects imposition as morally wrong in itself. Failing agreement, we face the choice of attempting to impose (whatever is left of) our own view or acquiescing in the imposition of the others' position on us. Obviously, when we reach such an impasse, each party may fully and sincerely believe that its position is supported by publicly available, ration- ally grounded considerations, and so one's resort to force is not a case of domination but of legitimate authority or self-defense, or whatever. But one's own conviction of the validity of one's action will not alter its appearance to the other, to whom it will appear to be coercion. To make this conception of a moral relationship plausible, we need some account of what we mean by "free agreement" and the conditions under which we could take agreements to be freely reached. Various "models of discourse" have been proposed to answer these questions. The more ambi- tious have attempted to specify in a reasonably full way what substantive agreements we could expect to see reached if these conditions were realized. Others more modestly offer only "a particular way of thinking about fair procedures for adjudicating normative claims."3 Unfortunately, these models characteristically beg some of the key questions which they were originally designed to answer. In this essay, I will argue that this defect is inevitable, for there is a kind of circularity built into the very project of a discourse-based ethics or politics, a circularity which seriously qualifies the possibilities for moral and political theory that these models can offer. We must have some way of specifying the conditions under which agreements are acceptable, but any way of doing so - any list of conditions such as Rawls's original position or Habermas's ideal speech situation, to take the two best known - must itself be subject to moral and political argumentation, must itself be tested in discourse. In such testing, we find that any proposed condition may be rejected on the grounds that it silences some point of view, renders invisible some aspect of experience, and so rules out possible moral or political</page><page sequence="4">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 205 positions prior to the very discourse which is supposed to establish legiti- mate or acceptable moral and political principles. The obvious response to this dilemma is to make discourse as uncon- strained as possible, to reduce to a minimum the constraints that participants must observe. Unfortunately, as I will argue, this move will not work, for the very notion of "unconstrained discourse" is deeply problematic. The very effort to make particular voices heard will necessarily silence, or at least threaten, others. In this essay, I argue that the hope for a fully consensual model of moral and political life is bound to be disappointed, and so the experience (if not the reality) of injustice is inevitable. Nonetheless, I will argue that we must persevere with the project of creating a discourse-based politics and will argue for a particular version of this project. I begin by presenting three models of a discourse-based politics. The first two models propose constraints on discourse, holding that only by suitably limiting the scope of argument is it possible to reach agreement. The first model is Rousseau's, who imposes what I call "social" constraints by specifying the kind of (political) context in which discourse is possible. The second model has been offered by Bruce Ackerman, who would constrain not the social context in which discourse occurs but the contents of discourse itself. I will argue that neither of these proposals is adequate and then turn to the model of unconstrained discourse offered by Seyla Benhabib, showing why it fails to solve the problems of constrained discourse. I will close by defending a modified version of a model of constrained discourse on the grounds that it is the only strategy that offers the hope of achieving uncoerced agreement. CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE I: THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF DISCOURSE The idea of organizing our social life in accordance with norms which those subject to them freely accept is at least as old as the social contract tradition in political theory, in which consent is taken to be the basis for political authority. And the problems of a discourse-based model of politics are evident from its earliest formulations; one of the deepest problems with this approach is to determine exactly what constitutes agreement or consent. Part of Rousseau's great originality is that he was the first to provide anything like an adequate account of the problem. In keeping with the framework of discourse provided by the metaphor of the social contract, Rousseau imagines a "first convention" establishing society. But, unlike his</page><page sequence="5">206 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 predecessors, he attends to the way in which the formation of society trans- forms the issue of "consent" and its relationship to authority and, indeed, the emergence and nature of morality itself. Rejecting Locke's idea that there is, by nature, a rational, moral law binding on all people, Rousseau recognizes that the deep problem we face in thinking about society in terms of the metaphor of the social contract is to understand how moral relationships emerge at all. Thus the problem that Rousseau sets for himself is to explain how people could come to accept such rules or principles -to "find a form of association . . . [in] which each one, uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself and remains as free as before."4 Rousseau's answer is not without its obscurities, but its general form seems reasonably clear: What we must do is to create a society whose laws are expressions of the "general will" and whose institutions are such that each citizen will come to identify with, and accept, the general will as an essential part (though not the whole) of his5 own will. To the extent that this is achieved, then in conforming to the law, one is acting in accordance with principles one has fully accepted, and so one is free. What this requires (among other things) is that the citizens themselves make the laws through their own deliberations in the sovereign assembly, for it is only by actively participating in the creation of these rules that I will come to see them as expressions of my own will and so find obedience to them to be compatible with my freedom. And because my relationships to my fellow citizens and to the society as a whole are regulated by principles that I fully accept, they are moral relationships. But it is misleading to view the citizens of a polity based on the general will simply as "free," or, at least, "as free as they were before." For, as Rousseau argues, their "nature" is transformed by their coming to live in such an association, so that they come to have aspirations and needs that they did not have before: One ceases to be "a stupid, limited animal" and becomes "an intelligent being and a man." More than that, by coming to live with others under the general will, one comes to be genuinely free, for only then is "man truly master of himself." Prior to, or outside of a society based on the general will, one could act only on the basis of "the impulse of appetite," which Rousseau calls a form of "slavery."6 The sense in which we are free in political society - civil and moral freedom - is very different from what Rousseau calls "natural" freedom. Rousseau's citizens, as authors of their own laws, give their continuing consent to the authority which binds them. But what of those who initially form the social contract, those who (at least in our imagination) originally placed their persons and all their power "under the supreme direction of the</page><page sequence="6">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 207 general will"? Not having been transformed into "intelligent beings" who are "masters of themselves," how could they even understand what they were doing, let alone be said genuinely to consent to it? On this matter, Rousseau is disarmingly frank. It is, he insists, impossible for an emerging people to appreciate ... and follow the fundamental rules of statecraft, [because] the effect would have to become the cause; the social spirit, which should be the result of the institution, would have to preside over the founding of the institution itself; and men would have to be prior to the laws what they ought to become by means of the laws.7 Thus the people could not themselves create the political institutions neces- sary for a society based on the general will. The design of these institutions must be the work of a "legislator," who deceives the people by making them believe that his proposals are the work of the gods and so "persuading" them - without "convincing" them - to enact the laws he proposes. The creation of moral relationships rests on deception, and, in a remarkable inversion of the Lockean account of consent, the original act of "consent" in creating the state can be seen to be deeply problematic, while the "consent" of future generations appears to be genuine. But is it really genuine? If it results from a process of socialization which, in turn, rests on the manipulation of the people by an elite, is it really different from the case of slaves who, coming to think of themselves as slaves as a result of being subjected to slavery, "consent" to the institution? Rousseau faults Aristotle for justifying slavery as "natural" on the grounds that he "mistook the effect for the cause," failing to see that "slaves lose everything by their chains, even the desire to be rid of them."8 Can we not say the same thing about the "chains" of political authority, since even the general will society originates in deception? This sort of objection represents a general problem with the idea that legitimacy can be based on consent, what we might call the problem of circularity. If our "consent" to a set of social conditions results from our having been socialized to those conditions, is that consent not spurious? In Rousseau's case, the crux of the problem has to do with how people come to develop an interest in, or to value, civil and moral freedom. Joshua Cohen, in a rich and suggestive discussion of Rousseau's account of autonomy and democracy, argues that "Rousseauian contractors" are not "rational, asocial, purely self-interested individuals" but are persons who have an interest in being autonomous. Because of this interest, he argues, there is an "anticipation of the general will -something universal -present within the contractual situation itself, and therefore a basis for that will in the nature of human beings."9 In agreeing to establish a society "under the</page><page sequence="7">208 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 supreme direction of the general will," they advance their interest in rational freedom or autonomy. Because we wish to be free, we want to have a social order in which we can "affirm the framework of rules itself," and so we wish to "have a general will."'10 Viewing moral freedom or autonomy as a "natural" end of persons enables us to escape the dilemma posed earlier, and it seems reasonable to attribute at least a nascent interest in freedom to the contractors. After all, the social conditions in which the social contract is made are not those of the primitive state of nature in which humans are "stupid animals." When they have "reached the point where obstacles to their self-preservation in the state of nature prevail by their resistance over the forces that each individual can use to maintain himself in that state,"" "much progress had to have been made, [and] industry and enlightenment acquired, transmitted, and increased from one age to the next."12 In particular, "the first duties of civility" had come to be recognized, and with them the ideas of self- and mutual respect. Nonetheless, there is a danger in taking freedom as a natural end. Like most appeals to nature, it runs the risk of begging the question. What appears to be most striking about Rousseau, at least compared to other contractarian thinkers, is his insistence on the ways in which human motivations, needs, and capacities change with changing social circumstances and the inade- quacy of appeals to nature as a basis for explaining or prescribing forms of social and political order. While Rousseau attributes "free will" to human nature, it is only in (certain forms of) society that we come to value this freedom and to define ourselves in terms of it. Indeed, in the normal course of events - as depicted in Rousseau's Second Discourse - such an interest will not (at least in general) develop, as people will increasingly define their interests in terms of reputation and social standing and human relationships will increasingly be based on force and domination. Under these circum- stances, as Rousseau argues in the Second Discourse, the formation of the state can properly be described as the subjugation of "the whole of Mankind to labor, servitude and misery" in order to advance "the profit of a few ambitious men."'13 The difference between the state based on the general will and the state depicted in the Second Discourse is not in the quality of the consent to their original formation, for both are based on the deception of the people by the few. But in the former case, this deception is ultimately supposed to give way to knowledge; the people come to understand the basis of their institutions, develop an interest in civil and moral freedom, and make citizenship a core dimension of their identities. What is crucial is not that the contractors</page><page sequence="8">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 209 originally have an interest in moral freedom but that they come to develop such an interest and that the society provide scope for its realization. Rousseau's argument, then, is not subject to the objection he makes to Aristotle's defense of slavery. If Rousseau is correct that the incapacity of slaves to direct and control their own lives is not "natural" but a result of their socialization as slaves, then an appeal to this incapacity cannot be used to justify the practice of slavery. But Rousseau's argument for the general will state is not an argument from "nature." Once we recognize the social and historical character of our needs, capacities, and aspirations, we must realize that any norm or value which we affirm will be partly the result of processes of socialization which we could not, even in principle, freely control or direct. What we can expect, however, is that we be free to investigate and to criticize these processes and be willing to affirm our moral and political beliefs even after we have understood how we came to acquire them. While we cannot fully avoid the circularity of consent or discourse-based theories, if these two conditions are met, that circularity need not trouble us unduly. Unfortunately, these conditions are not adequately met by Rousseau's theory. Rousseau focuses too narrowly on the impediments to agreement that are rooted in material inequality. As a result, he envisions a form of society in which the knowledge and understandings of the citizens are so constrained as to call into question the authenticity of their freedom. Rousseau's model, then, turns out to be one of constrained discourse, in which consensus on a general will is attained by constraints on the range of issues permitted to arise. These constraints call into question the genuineness of the consensus on the general will. The key to Rousseau's argument is that citizens must come to have interests and aspirations that are broadly compatible in the sense that the realization of one person's interests will not necessarily conflict with the realization of another's. "Why," asks Rousseau, "is the general will always right and why do all constantly want the happiness of each, if not because there is no one who does not apply this word each to himself, and does not think of himself as he votes for all?"'4 If our interests were diametrically opposed, so that any principle that I could accept would prevent you from satisfying your needs, then we could not agree on rules or principles to govern it. In that case, our relationship would necessarily be based on force and manipulation. Because of scarcity, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise as people come into competition for a particular good. If they share a framework of rules, they can appeal to those rules to settle such disputes. While the conflict</page><page sequence="9">210 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 over any particular object may involve a complete opposition of interests in that object, by appealing to shared principles and rules we transform the situation from one of pure conflict to one of (at least ideally) complete co- operation. If I can be satisfied that the appropriate rules have been observed (because, for example, they are administered by a neutral or third party whom I trust), I can be satisfied with the outcome, even when it goes against me. A more fundamental problem for political order arises when we come to have needs or interests that are diametrically opposed not simply regarding particular objects but, as it were, intrinsically. This occurs when we come to have needs based on "vanity" or "status," what Rousseau calls amour-propre. When people come to define themselves and thus their needs and interests in terms of their relative standing to others, such that each person sets "greater store by himself than by anyone else,"'5 they will be unable to agree on principles regulating their relationship because each desires only to be accorded superior status to others. At an extreme, when "blind ambition" and love of "domination" come to be the principal motives for action, "everything reverts to the sole Law of the stronger."'16 The source of vanity, in Rousseau's analysis, is inherent in social life - in our capacity to compare ourselves with others and in the role of social comparison in the formation of self-consciousness and personal identity. But it is only with the development of personal dependence based on material inequalities that needs based on vanity come to play a major role in social life. People can enforce their demand for superior status only by controlling essential resources; by threatening to withhold these resources, they can force others to accord them the social recognition necessary to confirm their sense of themselves as superior to others. Without such confirmation, the view of oneself as superior will not become (an important) part of one's identity, and therefore, needs based on vanity will remain (relatively) insignificant.'7 Thus if a group of people is to have a general will, they must not have (significant) needs based on vanity. For that reason, Rousseau insists on material equality: "No citizen should be so opulent that he can buy another, and none so poor that he is constrained to sell himself.""8 Although this formula is not very precise, the general line of argument is quite powerful: Some measure of material equality is a necessary condition for the existence of a general will. But it is surely not sufficient, for needs and aspirations may be incompatible for reasons not (at least not directly) connected with vanity, with the desire for domination or superiority. We must contend not only with "class" division but with what we might call "moral" differences, disagree- ments rooted in differing conceptions of the aims and purposes of human life and in different allegiances and attachments. These differences, as Salman</page><page sequence="10">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 211 Rushdie testifies, can be significant barriers to the emergence of a moral community. Rousseau offers us little in the way of understanding the sources of such differences nor how they might be bridged. This is not surprising, for he did not believe that they would be significant in the kind of society he envisioned. He believed that material equality would be possible only in a relatively small and self-sufficient community, one without luxury, extensive commerce, and a flourishing artistic and scientific culture. Increasing wealth, he felt, went together with increasing inequality. In small, simple societies, the problem of moral pluralism would not present itself. Their size, the uniformity of social conditions, and the absence of a diversity of points of view and educational opportunities would mean that citizens would not be exposed to, nor be likely to develop, alternative possibilities, different ways of life, different aspirations. And to make sure of that, Rousseau advocates a num- ber of practices - notably those of a civil religion and of the "censorship" - designed to prevent citizens from deviating from the mores and beliefs of the society. As Viroli points out, "in working to preserve a just social order and freedom of the individual, he proposes to use means which are in contradic- tion with the goals that he desires to attain."'9 Thus Rousseau's account violates the first condition necessary for a discourse-based theory of moral and political life. Apart from such consciously repressive institutions, it can be argued that because their social horizons are so deliberately limited by the structure of their society, the consensus they reach does not satisfy the second condition set out earlier: that participants affirm their moral beliefs even while realizing how they came to acquire them. Their consensus, while it may appear to them as reasonable and just, is rooted in constraints imposed on them by the deliberate design of their institutions, constraints intended to prevent the emergence of issues and perspectives which would disrupt that consensus. Knowing that, it is difficult to see how we could agree to impose such constraints on ourselves, for to do so would require us to engage in a kind of deliberate forgetting, to practice a kind of self-deception incompatible with the notion of free agreement. The experience of the West over the past two centuries does not bear out Rousseau's general social theory. As our societies have become wealthier, they have become more, not less, equal.20 At the same time, moral pluralism has increased. Even if one believes that a moral community requires greater levels of equality than we have yet achieved, we must still face the problem of articulating rules or principles that can be accepted by people whose differences are based not on a need for domination but in different views of</page><page sequence="11">212 POLITICALTHEORY/May 1991 the ends and purposes of life. For this, we must go beyond the kind of argument Rousseau has to offer. CONSTRAMNED DISCOURSE II: PUBLIC NEUTRALITY The second model of discourse, Bruce Ackerman's, represents a dif- ferent way of constraining discussion in order to reach agreement. Whereas Rousseau was principally, perhaps exclusively, concerned with differences of class and status and failed to consider moral pluralism as an independent basis of conflict, Ackerman takes moral pluralism-disagreement among people regarding the ends of life and principles of action they regard to be "true" - as the only (or at least principal) problem we face. His starting point is a "simple model" of a society consisting of different groups of people "who have combined faith and reason in an effort to search out the moral truth" but where each group has come up with different answers. The problem then becomes: "How are the different groups to resolve their problem of mutual coexistence in a reasonable way?"21 Ackerman's answer is, in essence, that they must talk to one another -to engage in dialogue. But the point of this dialogue, Ackerman insists, is not to discover the truth, and so to break down the barriers of ideas separating the groups from each other, but "to consider the way they might live together despite this on-going disagreement."22 This requires, according to Ackerman, a conception of dialogue that enables "political participants to talk to one another in an appropriately neutral way."23 Unfortunately, the history of efforts to develop such a con- ception is not encouraging, including Hobbes's effort to discover a suffi- ciently important common value under which to subsume other disagree- ments, Bentham's effort to "translate" moral disagreements into the language of utility, and Rawls's effort to transcend moral disagreements in the "original position." The problem with all of these approaches, according to Ackerman, is that they require participants in a dialogue to renounce or to misrepresent their core beliefs by constraining them to fit the preferred model of political or moral dialogue. What we need to do, then, is develop a different strategy, one that does not offer a new framework to which all might converge but that begins (and ends) with their existing beliefs. Ackerman's suggestion for such a strategy is what he calls "the path of conversational restraint": "We should simply say nothing at all about [any] disagreement ["about one or another dimension of the moral truth"] and put the moral ideals that divide us off the conversational agenda."24 It must be stressed that this restraint applies only to "public" contexts -"we need not</page><page sequence="12">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 213 lose the chance to talk to one another about our deepest moral disagree- ments in countless other, more private, contexts."-' The outcome of such dialogues will be the discovery of shared moral beliefs, moral beliefs enter- tained by all parties to the conversation. The society then undertakes to make use only of these shared beliefs "for the purposes of conflict resolution."'2 In this way, no one will be compelled to disavow important beliefs or values, and citizens will have "a way of reasonably responding to their continuing moral disagreement."27 In many ways, this idea of "conversational restraint" is attractive. That we should seek areas of agreement with others and attempt to build on these areas rather than to impose our conceptions on them is a moral idea at the heart of the "discourse" conception of moral and political legitimacy. Unfortunately, the strategy is fraught with difficulties, the most obvious of which, perhaps, is that the notion of "shared beliefs" is not altogether clear. Ackerman illustrates his argument by means of standard Venn diagrams, showing the shared beliefs as the intersection of two sets of beliefs, those of two groups who are parties to the dialogue. But this is not an appropriate model for beliefs, since their relationships are not extensional but intensional. Unlike, say, the intersection of the set of objects that are white and those that are cats - namely, white cats - the "intersection" of two "sets" of beliefs may not unproblematically belong to each. Beliefs are not discrete objects like cats but bear "internal" or conceptual relations to other beliefs. The meaning of a particular belief depends on its place in a system of beliefs, and abstracting the belief from the system may distort its sense. This is particu- larly true in political and moral matters, where we necessarily make use of "essentially contested concepts." The fact that two participants in a dialogue agree, for example, that "freedom" is an important value does not mean that they share a common belief. This is not simply a quibble about the way in which Ackerman represents his argument but goes to the heart of the matter: the key idea behind his strategy of "conversational restraint" is to avoid questions of "moral truth." But in the case of beliefs, it is not clear that we can even identify a particular belief without asking questions about its "truth," about its coherence, grounds, relationship to other beliefs, and so on. Thus to be barred from discussing the truth of contested beliefs may prevent us from discovering common ones. Indeed, one of the most important ways by which we actually discover beliefs held in common with others is by challenging the beliefs that seem wrong and coming to see the grounds on which they are held. It is at least possible that in an unconstrained conversation, the area of agreement may come to be enlarged.</page><page sequence="13">214 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 This leads to a second problem with "conversational restraint": whether it can serve the purposes it is intended to serve, that is, to provide a way of "solving our problems in coexistence in a way both of us find reasonable."28 Would participants on such a constrained dialogue find this limit on what they are allowed to say in defense of their views reasonable? What motive might someone have for adopting it? On the face of it, it appears to allow a veto on principles of justice, principles that could be used to resolve conflicts, to any group that, for whatever reason, objects to a given proposal. At the very least, would one not wish to require some test of sincerity before according such power over our common life? And do we not test sincerity by examining the grounds of beliefs, by testing them for consistency with other beliefs and behavior? In short, by discourse aimed at discovering (something like) truth? More seriously, we must ask whether this approach is apt to provide a sufficient area of agreement for coexistence on terms all regard as reasonable. What do we do when we face conflicts that we cannot resolve on the basis of shared principles? Under these circumstances, the issue will be settled by imposition - by some kind of force. Given this alternative, is it not more reasonable to abandon the strategy of "conversational restraint" and at least attempt to persuade others before we seek to coerce them (and be persuaded by them before they may coerce us)? The strategy of conversational restraint seems capable only of discovering "preexisting" areas of agreement; the problem, however, may be to enlarge those areas if we seek to replace force and manipulation with relationships based on principles that all parties can freely accept. Finally, I should note that Ackerman's model rests on an unexamined distinction between "public" and "private," where the obligation of conver- sational restraint applies only to public, not private, dialogue. In our private lives, we may offer the deepest groups for our convictions and engage in discussion about whether these grounds are adequate. But in discussions of public policy, these grounds are ruled out of court when others disagree with them. But how are we to tell when we are in one realm and when in the other? When is it appropriate to engage one's fellow citizens in unrestrained dialogue and when are we to censor ourselves? The idea here, I take it, is that authoritative decisions, those ultimately sanctioned by the legitimate use of force, should only be based on shared moral beliefs, not on positions rejected by some citizens. What this is often taken to mean is that certain spheres of life, those on which no moral position commands a consensus, would be excluded from authoritative decision and</page><page sequence="14">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 215 be left to the "private" decisions of particular individuals. Assuming that all can agree on bodily integrity as an important value, so that force is only exercised by the state, private decisions would be noncoercive (at least in the sense that they would not involve the direct use of physical force). Thus the problem of reasonable coexistence is solved so long as the state monopolizes the legitimate use of force and its power is only employed on consensually held principles. But this is clearly an inadequate conception of the problem, as an exam- ination of some of the issues we currently face reveals. Take, for example, the question of abortion, on which there is deep, profound disagreement within our society. The strategy of conversational restraint would have us resolve this issue by referring only to shared beliefs as decisional premises, such as the belief in a separation between church and state, and shared commitments to certain basic individual rights. And, to a large degree, the debate has been conducted in these terms - in terms of a shared public discourse of rights, including the right of a woman to control her own body, and the right of fetuses or unborn children to life. In part because the debate has been framed in that way, it has (so far at least) been decided in favor of the "pro-choice" position. Since the grounds for deciding that a fetus is a "person" are to a significant degree particular, contested religious beliefs, they represent improper decisional premises for authoritative decision. But this way of framing the debate, as Luker has shown so well, misrep- resents the issues. According to her analysis, what is at stake in this argument are two broadly opposed worldviews which involve fundamentally different conceptions of the ends of life. In her study of the women active in the "pro-life" movement, she found a widely shared set of beliefs about what constitutes proper and fulfilling roles for women and men, based on the natural differences between the sexes. For these women, motherhood and nurturing were seen as essential and deeply valuable activities requiring full-time commitments and emotional qualities fundamentally different from those required by male activities. The ability to give life is what is distinctive to women, and it is in giving and sustaining life that women can find their full realization as persons. Legalized abortion, in their view, is one among a host of similar policies which undermines the possibility of realizing these values. These policies include permitting teenagers access to contraception and abortion without parental consent, allowing sexual activity outside of marriage, and public support for those kinds of contraception and for small families which implicitly supports the idea that sexuality is desirable for nonprocreative purposes. In particular, Luker argues, they see abortion as</page><page sequence="15">216 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 intrinsically wrong because it takes a human life and what makes women special is their ability to nourish life. Second, it is wrong because by giving women control over their fertility, it breakes up an intricate set of social relationships between men and women that has traditionally surrounded (and in the ideal case protected) women and children. Third and finally, abortion is wrong because it fosters and supports a world view that deemphasizes (and therefore downgrades) the traditional role of men and women.29 Public policies regarding the family and divorce, contraception, and abortion have increasingly disrupted settled patterns of life, making it more and more difficult for women and men to pursue this vision of the proper ends of life. The "pro-choice" position, according to Luker, is based on a very different worldview, one in which reason and the human capacity to control and direct one's life hold a central place. In this view, men and women are seen as fundamentally equal. Both men and women must choose for themselves what ends they wish to pursue, including the balance they seek between such goods as family and career. For a woman to have the ability to choose in this way requires that she have control over her own reproduction, including access to contraception and, when that fails, to abortion. Given this diagnosis of the positions at stake in the argument over abortion, it is easy to see why those who support the "pro-life" position might find Ackerman's idea of conversational restraint problematic. To the extent that it prohibits them from articulating what is, in fact, the basis of their position, it structures the public debate in terms that are systematically stacked against them. In this case, we may judge either that the supposedly shared language of rights and secularism is in fact not shared or that the injunction against asserting disputed moral positions is a disguised form of imposition and not "an appropriately neutral" device to enable political participants to talk to one another.30 Moreover, by illustrating the complex ways in which "public" policy bears on "private" life, it suggests that the distinction between public and private discourse that Ackerman invokes is deeply problematic. If the participants in this debate are to be able to act on their values in their "private" lives, it is hard to see how they can refrain from voicing these values in public debate. UNCONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE POLITICAL One obvious response to the inadequacies of constrained discourse is to turn to a model of unconstrained discourse oriented to the discovery of truth. Habermas, Apel, and other have articulated such a model in recent years,</page><page sequence="16">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 217 using it to develop what they call "communicative ethics." Drawing on their work, Seyla Benhabib recently developed a rich and suggestive account of communicative ethics, in which she argues that, at the most general level, communicative or discourse ethics does not simulate a thought experiment for all beings capable of speech, and establish what norms they ought to accept as binding. It requires that controversies over the validity of contested norms be settled through an argumentative process in which the consensus of all concerned decides upon the legitimacy of the controversial norm.31 For such a consensus to emerge, Benhabib argues, practical discourses would have to be viewed as a "moral-transformative process."32 What is involved in moral-transformative discourse can best be seen by contrast with Rawls's account of justice as fairness, in which individuals agree on the choice of norms to govem the basic structure of their society under conditions which enable them to make choices in a suitably impartial manner. Benhabib characterizes this model as discourse oriented to "generalized other" (in Mead's sense) - to more or less all other persons irrespective of their partic- ular identities or relationships to the self. Such discourse is intended to establish a "lowest common interest, while leaving the substantive conflict of interest untouched."33 It does so because it adopts a particular strategy of argumentation, in which we abstract from our particular identities and aspirations, seeking to find a set of goals or goods which we share with others at a fairly abstract level, one which transcends or brackets the particular goals that divide us. In Rawls's case, this move is represented by the "thin theory of the good." If successful, this model of discourse would lead to a consensus on the juridical framework within which conflicts arise, but because substan- tive conflicts would continue to exist, it leaves open the possibility that some people may find their needs and aspirations frustrated. Benhabib is critical of this model because, as she argues, needs and interests cannot be taken as given but must be seen (at least in large part) as a result of the processes of socialization and the life experiences of individ- uals in particular social formations. "Generalized discourse," she argues, arbitrarily takes a particular and historically contingent configuration of interests as given, as beyond question and criticism. In particular, she endorses the argument of Habermas and others, who hold that Rawls's approach "is biased toward the kind of needs fostered in a specific type of society, i.e., one characterized by social competitiveness and economic individualism," and so violates the discursive ideal in "that it declares once and for all that some potential voices (and the needs they express) will not be given an adequate hearing."34 Discourse should not be confined to finding</page><page sequence="17">218 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 rules which bridge the differences among given constellations of interests and identities but should call into question the conflicting interests, needs, and aspirations which lead to conflict. She thus concludes that discourses should be "moral-transformative processes" through which "new needs and interests, such as can lead to a consensus among the participants, emerge."35 The moral-transformative conception of discourse holds out the possibil- ity that people can come to discover new needs and interests, whose satisfac- tion for one person is compatible with (or even contributes to) their satisfac- tion for others. Such discourse would be oriented not to the "generalized other" but to the "concrete other" -to specific individuals with particular identities and aspirations with whom we would seek to establish a genuine community. By including the evaluation and criticism of needs-or, more precisely, "need interpretations" -in discourse, this model is intended to transform substantive conflicts of interest rather than merely providing a juridical framework to adjudicate them. Moral-transformative discourse, it would appear, must be based on some account of human needs, for it will succeed only if "true" needs can be discovered and if, contrary to Hobbes, the needs of different persons turn out to be compatible. Benhabib (wisely) rejects both the "essentialist" understanding of human nature, according to which there is some deter- minate set of "true" needs that we can discover, and the view that our conceptions of our needs, being rooted in ongoing social experience, are impervious to discourse. Rather than attempting to develop criteria for "true" needs, Benhabib offers a more modest proposal, arguing that those needs "which do not permit linguistic articulation cannot be true." When we discover that we disagree with others about the norms that should govern our relationships and enter into moral-transformative discourse with them to settle this disagreement, each will attempt to articulate the needs - the objectives, desires, projects, self-identity -which he or she holds, needs which lead one to advocate a particular norm or set of norms. As a result of this effort, we can discover which of these needs are false by attending to "those silences, evasions, and displacements which point to the presence of an unmastered force in the life of an individual." By discovering that one's position is rooted in "the dark recesses of the psyche," one will be in a position to reevaluate one's claims as a result of this deeper self-understanding.36 Thus moral-transformative discourse leads to a kind of self-transparency which can form the basis of a genuine community. To achieve the goal of transparency, discourse must be unconstrained: All matters, including those stemming from "the dark recesses of the psyche,"</page><page sequence="18">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 219 must be placed on the table, subject to public argumentation and analysis. Further, if discourses are to address such needs, they must be conducted by the actual parties to the relationships in question. There is no possibility here of representation, either in the sense of an "idealized discourse" along the lines of, say, Rawls's conception of the original position or one involving representatives of different groups and interests. Representative or idealized discourses enable us to examine issues only from the standpoint of the "generalized other." They are necessarily based on abstracting from the concrete particularity of individuals and their needs and can only establish an abstract equality and formal reciprocity, which can, at best, provide a basis for a "community of rights and entitlements." But such a "community" gives expression only to a "lowest common interest," one which is compatible with substantive conflicts of interests and, therefore, with situations in which the needs of some groups and individuals are suppressed. Thus transformative discourses can be conducted only in the context of a participatory democracy in which we come to examine our relationships not only from the standpoint of the "generalized other" but from the standpoint of the "concrete other," from a standpoint which "requires us to view each and every rational being as an individual with a concrete history, identity, and affective-emotional constitution."37 Such discourses can establish a "community of needs and solidarity," a community in which we affirm not simply the abstract humanity of others but their concrete individuality. Benhabib continues, "The moral categories that accompany such interac- tions are those of responsibility, bonding, and sharing. The corresponding moral feelings are those of love, care, sympathy, and solidarity."38 In con- trast to "late capitalist societies" in which "public life" is viewed only "from a legalistic-juridical perspective,"39 the ideal of moral-transformative dis- course envisions a "politics of empowerment that extends both rights and entitlements while creating friendship and solidarity."40 This model of unconstrained discourse is obviously attractive. It speaks to the problems we encountered in examining Rousseau's and Ackerman's theories, and there is an intuitive plausibility to the idea that unconstrained discourse will enable all voices to be heard, voices which may have been silenced by the kinds of constraints examined earlier here. But this appear- ance is deceptive; even if it is true that constrained discourse may be repressive in certain ways, it is false that unconstrained discourse is neces- sarily liberatory. Benhabib's argument is open to a number of objections that have often been urged against theories resting on a distinction between true and false</page><page sequence="19">220 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 needs. Even the apparently modest claim that needs which we cannot articulate are necessarily false is deeply problematic. It is far from clear that only dark thoughts are to be found in the "dark recesses of the psyche" or that we should seek to overcome all "unmastered forces" in our lives. Sometimes, we find ourselves driven in ways that frustrate our deepest commitments and projects by needs we do not understand, and in such cases, the discovery and mastery of these needs will be liberating. But not all of our unarticulated needs are of this character. Some of those needs may be at the basis of our deepest commitments, our strongest bonds, and our capacity to love. The kind of self-transparency that this model of discourse envisions is, I would argue, mistaken even as an ideal. Our capacity for self-transcendance, for distancing one's self from oneself and reflectively examining one's actions, motives, needs, and so on, makes it possible for us to achieve some mastery over our own lives, some degree of freedom or self-determination. But that is necessarily limited because no description of our needs and capacities, our attachments and aspirations, could ever be complete, if only because the very process of apprehending them alters them, opening up new possibilities for insight and self-discovery. The meanings of what we say and do, and what prompts us to act, are not univocal, fixed things but exist on a variety of levels in complex relationships to various aspects of the self and are fraught with ambiguity. In an important sense, then, we can never fully articulate our needs. Self-transparency therefore cannot be a condition of our needs being "true" or even "not false." Supposing that these objections could be answered, there is a much deeper objection to the idea of unconstrained discourse: It necessarily leads to the denial of values or ideals that are important to at least some participants in discourse. Viewed as a form of public discourse, it rests on the unacknowl- edged assumption that there is no limit to the claims that others can make on one to make one's needs transparent - not only to oneself but to them as well. Indeed, this assumption could be said to constitute moral-transformative discourse, distinguishing it from generalized discourses which are intended to establish common interests and therefore take individuals' need interpre- tations as, to a large extent, given. This demand that we render ourselves transparent is, to say the least, potentially if not necessarily repressive. When not only the "goods [we] desire" but the "desires themselves become legiti- mate topics of moral disputation,"41 in the context of a public discourse, we can see that moral-transformative discourse involves a commitment to self- disclosure that is incompatible with important values such as privacy and personal integrity.</page><page sequence="20">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 221 To assess the force of this objection, we have to consider the contexts in which such moral-transformative discourses takes place. There is an obvious difference between intimate settings, in which friends or lovers mutually explore their "affective-emotional constitution[s]," and such set- tings as re-education camps or citizens' neighborhood or block committees. In Benhabib's model, moral-transformative discourse involves a commit- ment to forms of participatory democracy and a corresponding reduction in the use of representation. Even in such settings, there will be significant pressures on the individual. If the costs of nonparticipation are high, some may be forced to give political activity and self-disclosure a place in their lives that precludes self-realization for them or at least frustrates their ability to satisfy their needs. If those sacrifices are too great, they would be forced to withdraw from politics and instead suffer the tyranny of activists. Thus moral-transformative discourse, because it rests on a demand for self- disclosure, can take institutional forms that involve domination or imposi- tion. It is hard to see how "discourse" could achieve a consensus that is genu- inely free and uncoerced unless participants enjoy some rights of privacy and personal integrity, unless they can resist the demand for self-disclosure. If the problem with constrained models of discourse, such as Ackerman's or Rawls's, is that they implicitly and improperly deny certain needs or values, the same is true of unconstrained discourse. One way around this objection, then, would be to deny the validity of values, such as privacy, or the right to resist others' demands for self-disclosure. But this route appears blocked to Benhabib, for she does not call for the abolition of any distinction between public and private, for the complete displacement of a community of rights and entitlement by a community of needs and solidarity. She acknowledges that "conceptions of the good life" may not be universaliz- able42 and so properly belong in the private sphere, since they cannot be settled by public debate. The dilemma is clear: We appear to require uncon- strained discourse in order to settle what the boundaries of the private should be, but such discourse itself violates those boundaries because it rests on a demand for unlimited self-disclosure. In addition to this bias against privacy, the model of unconstrained discourse implicitly structures the terms of moral and political argumentation in a way that makes it difficult if not impossible for certain voices to be heard, particularly those deeply informed by traditional or religious views of the world. As we have seen, moral-transformative discourse focuses on conflicts among the "need interpretations" of the participants. But if we return for a moment to the discussion of abortion, we can see that from the perspective of the pro-life position, this way of framing the argument is itself part of the</page><page sequence="21">222 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 problem. In their view, too much of our society's thinking on such matters proceeds from a consideration of "needs" to the exclusion of "duties." The articulation of the conflict in terms of conflicting interpretations of needs may well distort the self-interpretations of those holding the pro-life position, for whom the secular and anthropomorphic basis of discourse is itself problematic. When we take the position of the concrete other in this conflict, might we not find that it calls into question the very commitments which led us to moral-transformative discourse in the first place? I suspect that Benhabib would answer this question in the negative. Communities based on the perspective of the concrete other, she assures us, "are not pre-given," but are formed out of the action of the oppressed, the exploited, and the humiliated, and must be committed to universalist, egalitarian, and consensual ideals. Traditional ethnic, racial, and religious communities are neither necessarily nor primarily such communities of needs and solidarity.43 While this perspective "acknowledges the plurality of modes of being human, and differences among humans," it does not endorse "all these pluralities as morally and politically valid."44 Yet there is an obvious tension here, for the "standpoint of the concrete other" is also said to be governed by the norms of equity and complementary reciprocity: each is entitled to expect and to assume from the other forms of behavior through which the other feels recognized and confirmed as a concrete, individual being with specific needs, talents and capacities.45 It appears, then, that the affirmation of the concrete other for which Benhabib calls is not a presupposition of discourse but a result of discourse, in particular, a result of the transformation of need interpretations or, more specifically, the abandonment of traditional and religiously based identities which moral-transformative discourse is to effect. But once again, it is not clear that this is consistent with the rest of her argument, in particular, her rejection of foundationalist understandings of critical theory. Unless we posit either some form of essentialism or a very strong understanding of the possibilities of reason, we cannot expect rational argument alone to dislodge such traditional or religious identities. Translated into practice, then, the call for the "affirmation" of the concrete other is likely to lead either to an abandonment of the critical universalism that motivated the call in the first place or to a rejection of certain groups or positions as legitimate parties to the discourse.</page><page sequence="22">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 223 CONCLUSION Rousseau, it might be argued, articulated one of the deepest problems with a discourse-based politics when he observed that for such a politics to be possible, "men would have to be prior to laws what they ought to become by means of laws."46 For Rousseau, the circularity inherent in the idea of such a politics is sociological: To set up the institutions of a just political society, citizens must have developed traits of character and an understanding of themselves and the world that they could come to have only in such a society. For the later thinkers examined here, the circularity is conceptual: The conception of discourse they defend as adequate to the realization or discov- ery of consensual norms and values necessarily presupposes a particular set of norms or values or at least delimits the range of positions which can be effectively articulated. Models of constrained discourse, by restricting the range of issues that are to be decided consensually through discussion, can effectively silence certain voices or at least burden them by structuring a public language in which it is difficult to articulate their experiences and needs. On the other hand, unconstrained discourse rests on a demand for self-disclosure which can threaten the privacy and personal integrity of participants in a way that can make discourse coercive for them. I do not, however, wish to conclude that a discourse-based model of political and moral life is irredeemably flawed. My purpose in this essay has been to uncover the limits of the discourse model, but I do not wish to argue that the existence of such limits vitiates it. A principal reason for the growing interest in this approach is the failures of various forms of foundationalism and realism discussed earlier. Once we abandon the search for self-certifying foundations for our beliefs and values, we must also give up hope of finding a procedure that can guarantee the truth or justice of the positions we take. The limits of the discourse model are (part of) the limits of the world we have come to have. Concretely, what this means is that any political arrangements may be experienced as unjust by some members of our society. There can be no "neutral" framework of the sort Ackerman seeks, a framework that can be used to resolve differences among people in a morally pluralist society. Nor can we hope to overcome these differences through the unconstrained, moral-transformative discourse Benhabib seeks. Both of these models in- volve their own silences and evasions, for both structure our collective decision making in ways that, at the very least, make it difficult for certain voices to be heard. Even if we (hopefully) suppose that there are enough commonalities to develop a basic framework of justice governing our inter-</page><page sequence="23">224 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 actions, there can be no guarantee that these commonalities will be more important to any particular group, on any given issue, than their differences. Thus the group in question may well find the decision required by the framework to be oppressive. If they accept it, they may experience this as an imposition and, in this respect, find that their interactions with others do not realize the ideal of a moral relationship. Since we must, in a sense, learn to live with injustice, what model of discourse would serve us best in confronting our situation? We must, I think, reject the moral-transformative model of unconstrained discourse as a basis for our political lives in favor of a model which limits the public demand for self-disclosure and provides space for individual privacy. We should not have to defend or to justify every aspect of our existence, including our most intimate desires and beliefs, if it is going to be possible for us to participate freely in public discourse. Similarly, we must reject those models of con- strained discourse, such as Rousseau's or Ackerman's, which seek to provide a final or a neutral framework for public life, since they can have the effect of permanently excluding certain voices and needs. Suitably modified, however, a model of "generalized discourse" is the most promising. In generalized discourse, as explained earlier, we seek to abstract from our particular - and conflicting - identities and aspirations in order to dis- cover bases of agreement with others which "bracket" the particular issues that divide us. In Rawls's formulation of this model, these include not only the list of primary goods but the general conception of "society as a fair system of cooperation between free and equal persons."47 The process of bracketing or abstracting from our particular identities protects us against demands for unreasonable self-disclosure while at the same time discovering bases on which mutually acceptable norms of justice can be developed. Given that our society is morally pluralistic, there can be no guarantee that any particular framework of justice, any particular model of generalized discourse such as Rawls's, can accommodate all of the voices that may seek to be heard or which may, over time, come into existence. This means that we must be open to consider the values and aspirations, the needs and attachments, that any particular formulation of a framework of justice ap- pears to suppress. There can be no universal or complete justification of any particular framework because it is not possible for us to anticipate all of the questions we will face nor the ways in which people will come to define themselves and their attachments and so come to discover norms, including norms that have long existed, that are unacceptable, and whose enforcement is experienced by them as a form of domination. Thus our "generalized discourses" must be contextualized to specific social and historical settings</page><page sequence="24">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 225 in such a way as to allow the basic framework to be challenged. Each "we" must remain alive to the possibility that what "we" consider reasonable may be experienced by others as a form of imposition. But such possibilities can only be canvassed in a particular discursive context and framed by a specific structure of constraints, one in which dissentient voices will have to struggle to make themselves heard precisely because their demands will involve a violation of the established framework of rights and, in particular, the privacy which the model of generalized discourse is designed to secure. While this approach obviously disadvantages certain perspectives, its aim is to secure a reasonable balance between the scope of discourse at any particular point in time and the need for openness. As I argued earlier, in the absence of such a balance, the resulting unconstrained discourse will be experienced as coer- cive to some participants. Unfortunately, we must also realize that there is a darker possibility that when the basic discourse on the framework of justice is reopened, we may discover that there is no possibility of genuine agree- ment, that "we" may have no choice but to impose our judgment on others or experience the imposition of their judgment on us. We may hope that such situations are rare so that those who experience them can nonetheless accept the system as a whole. But we must live at least with the possibility of suffering, or acting, in ways that we or others experience as unjust. These difficulties can be illustrated by a final return to the issue of abortion. Assuming that our community of rights and duties includes the liberty of a woman to have an abortion, it may well be that many pro-life people find that the weight they attach to other aspects of their moral lives is greater than their commitment to the public framework of justice. Thus they feel that this decision is not a reasonable one but an imposition, and they may even feel justified in resisting it. On the other hand, pro-choice supporters will certainly feel justified in their position, pointing to what they see as an important asymmetry between their situation and that of the pro-life group. While recognizing that public policies permitting women to assume a variety of roles may make it more difficult for groups which hold traditional values to flourish, pro-choice supporters will point out that they would be unable to achieve their ends at all if public policies are premised on some conception of women's "natural" roles as mothers and caretakers. Without the ability to control her reproductive activity, a woman cannot direct her life in accor- dance with her own choices among career, family, and other ends. Quite apart from the fact that this argument overstates the case-we are, after all, only talking about how the burden of risks is to be distributed among different groups, not absolute impossibilities - the real difficulty in this response is that it structures the question in a way that many pro-life supporters would</page><page sequence="25">226 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1991 find objectionable. By casting the issue as one of finding norms enabling people to realize their objectives, it defines the issue in the secular and anthropomorphic language, which, for many pro-life people, is itself deeply problematic. It is by no means certain that such deep disagreements will necessarily arise, but should they do so, the model of discourse I am proposing will not be able to resolve them. Given the ideal of a society in which all relationships are moral relation- ships, this is not a happy conclusion. But in other ways, the model of generalized discourse I have been advocating has more hopeful implications. In particular, I would suggest that it is more likely to be able to incorporate Benhabib's concern with the standpoint of the concrete other than is her model of unconstrained, moral-transformative discourse, at least if we con- sider how these models would work over time in a society. Our capacity to take the perspective of the concrete other in the sense that we not only recognize differences but respond positively to them is limited by the nature of the differences in question. The more alien we find the other's affections, commitments, and aspirations, the less we can experience his or her concrete particularity in terms of solidarity and the less we can extend genuine recognition and confirmation to the other. It is in this context that we may resort to the perspective of the "generalized other," to abstract from these differences to find a basis on which we can create a relationship of mutuality in spite of our differences. The perspective of the generalized other finds its place precisely in those social worlds where the differences that have to be bridged are deep and pervasive. Historically, the development of moral and political theory based on the perspective of the generalized other followed the breakdown of religious unity in Western Europe, which ushered in a long, brutal period of war, violence, persecution, and witch hunts. As any number of critics have pointed out, the actual limits within which this perspective was extended at first were far from "general" - Locke's Letter, for example, might be read as offering toleration to Protestant sects. The idea that relations with Catho- lics, women, children, blacks, or workers might be subjected to this perspec- tive did not even occur to most of those who founded the contractarian tradition. But these "silences" and "evasions" (if these judgments are not too anachronistic) bespeak not the failure of the perspective of the generalized other and the need to supplement it with the perspective of the concrete other but the failure to extend the former into areas characterized by unquestioned hierarchal relationships. Over the past three centuries, there has been, both in the practices of Westem countries and in moral and political theories, a continuing extension</page><page sequence="26">Moon / CONSTRAINED DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC LIFE 227 of the perspective of the generalized other to an ever wider range of groups and relationships. Citizenship has come to be extended universally, and the "public morality" of justice and rights has increasingly come to limit accept- able behavior and relationships in the "private" spheres of family and associational life. Practices that once were common have come to be seen as forms of "abuse" and subject to legal sanction as considerations of rights and justice are extended more widely. Moreover, the dominance of the perspec- tive of the generalized other has not excluded, but arguably has formed the basis for, the perspective of the concrete other, for the recognition and acceptance of differences. We can see that, I think, in the movement in our public life from attitudes supporting "toleration" of "others" to those cele- brating "pluralism." This is particularly true regarding religious and ethnic differences, where official rhetoric has increasingly been dominated by motifs stressing the ways in which each group, precisely because of its differences, makes a distinct contribution to our society and culture, whose richness comes from the range and plurality of styles and ways of life rather than from achievements measured on a single scale of excellence. Because the perspective of the generalized other has increasingly come to be integral to our own self-identities, because, in other words, we have come to recog- nize others as subjects entitled to respect, it has become possible for us also to recognize and value our differences. Although it is only a possibility and one that must be tempered by the possibility of continuing injustice, it is as much as a political theory can promise. NOTES 1.
