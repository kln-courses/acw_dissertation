<plain_text><page sequence="1">'THE HAND OF GOD': A NUMISMATIC STUDY The encounter of imperial Rome with the nascent Christian religion produced the tradition upon which our culture is based. So legion are the examples of their mutual interaction that the source of certain facets of imperial Christian thought, art, and culture is not always clear. In seeking traces of Christian impact on the empire in the Age of Constantine, it was natural for scholars to look to the coinage, the largest surviving body of imperial art and propaganda,</page><page sequence="2">Fig. I</page><page sequence="3">Fig. II Fig Fig. VI</page><page sequence="4">Fig. VII Fig. XI Fig. XII</page><page sequence="5">Fig. XIII Fig. XIV</page><page sequence="6">'the hand of god' 323 and find such traces they did.1 More recent thought, however, has re-analyzed most of these alleged examples of Christian symbolism and has correctly found them to be either personal symbols of the emperor or merely minor adjuncts supplied by lesser mint-officials who, in their selection of mint and/or sequence marks, most probably in no way reflected imperial policy or belief.2 This position both supports and follows the theory that the reign of Con st antine represents the liberation of Christianity, while the victory of Christianity belongs to the reign of Theodosius I, some sixty years later, and that the tradi tional character of the imp?rium was not substantially altered in the intervening period.3 Certainly, with respect to the coinage, no one doubts that standard pagan symbolism continued even through the reign of Theodosius, though the explicitness of the pagan iconography is lessened to the point that both Christian and pagan citizen could claim the representations;4 this tendency was more than counteracted by the imperial coin signatures which clearly implied the super human, if not divine, character of the emperor. The ultimate translation of the god-king to the divine regent, with all that it would bring to the Europe of the Middle Ages, is a phenomenon of the Later Empire, and the coinage reflects it. We discover, on the one hand, that the translation-process does in fact reach back to the reign of Gonstantine, if not beyond,5 and that Christian attitudes and thought were not alien to many imperial opinions. On the other hand, imperial authority exerted considerable influence on the resultant Christian art so that the triumph of distinctly Christian principles was neither so complete nor so early as the tradition maintains. This paper is devoted to one example of the above phenomenon, the symbol known as the 'Dextera Dei' or 'Manus Dei,' as it appears, most regularly on the imperial coinage. This anthropomorphism is distinctly Hebrew, and quite popular in the Old Testament.6 It is not surprising, then, that the earliest artistic rendering of this metaphor in the Christian era is found in the mid-third-century murals 1 Cf.

LXI. 6 The Old Testament, for instance, often speaks of God as if He had a human body and, therefore, also hands. These hands, in turn, become the symbol of divine power (Ps. 39.22) and of God's punishing justice (1 Sam. 5-6.11), but also of God's love and providence (Job 5.18). On this, see F. Dingermann, 'Hand,' LThK2 4 (1960) 1342.</page><page sequence="7">324 traditio of a synagogue at Dura Europos7 (Figure I). The form is the simplest, a hand ' donatrice, ' and implies both that God is present and that what occurs is done by the power and authority of God. That we have only one distinctly Christian example of the ' Manus Dei ' before the last decade of the fourth century is most probably the result of twin in fluences: namely, the slowness with which a distinctive iconography of the Trinity was evolved,8 and the adoption of this particular motif as an imperial adjective. The first numismatic example of the symbol appears on a medallion of Constantius II (Figure II) dated a.d. 330. The representation of the emperor being crowned is not new, but its taking place from above and from a cloud is quite unique, and evokes other Biblical images.9 Professor Alf?ldi was of the opinion10 that the symbolism was pagan, though used here for the first time in a Christian cause; but if so, the symbolism is without parentage,11 and one must ignore the subsidiary imagery, that of the two imperial princes being crowned by Victoria and Virtus, the former being the most ordinary form to depict the scene of imperial triumph in both Christian and pagan Rome. The relative sizes of the personages clearly put Gonstantine into contact with the divine.12 Eusebius of Caesarea clearly has just this image in mind, and virtually in the same year.13 7 Excavations at Dura Europos (Sixth Season; New Haven 1936) 347, 355, Plate 49. 8 The Mersin medallion. An established order may be inferred from ca. a.d. 395 from the verse description of a mosaic given by Paulinus of Nola in a letter to his friend Sulpicius Severus (Ep. 32.10 [CSEL 29.286]) where vox is taken to mean the Manus Dei, based on later representations of the baptism of Christ, where it is so employed; see A. Grabar, Chris tian Iconography, A Study of its Origins (Bollingen Series 35; Princeton 1968) 115. Among other, very rare, and purely religious instances of the Manus Dei, of our period, and in other media, may be noted: the mosaic in the Baptistery of Soter at Naples, where the cross, flanked by the alpha and omega, is crowned by the Manus Dei, dated a little after a.d. 400; a Pales tinian ampulla, now at Monza, in which the Manus Dei is an element in the depiction of the Pentecost scene, dated in the fifth century; the Melchizedek mosaic from S. Maria Mag giore, with the full upper torso of God reaching down His blessing, dated a.d. 432; a Jewish amulet dated from the third to the fifth century (E. R. Goodenough, Jewish Symbols from the Greco-Roman Period [Bollingen 37; Princeton 1953] 1024). 9 Jgs. 5.4, Ezk. 1.4, Matt. 17.5, Lk. 9.34 all perhaps descendants of Ex. 19.16, God as lawgiver and master of the world order. 10 A.

The reverse type is again unusual for the period, showing, in all careful examples, the dead emperor ascending in a quad riga toward the Manus Dei.14 The closest similar type was the rare ' Consecra tion ' solidus of Constantius Ghlorus, in which the deified pagan emperor is shown in a quadriga, with the attributes of Sol Invictus, on an altar (Figure IV).15 The period from Constantius II to Theodosius I, in its toleration and neu trality toward the advance of Christianity, saw only two examples of the Manus Dei; in these two examples the distinctly Christian character of the symbol is most probably the reason for its general absence, inasmuch as Julian was quite unabashed in the returning of unmistakably pagan symbolism to his coinage.16 The Mersin medallion17 belongs to the latter part of the reign of Constantius II, and was privately produced. The necklace, of which it was a part, was appa rently a hygienic charm, and of Christian manufacture, linking as it does Gon stantine and Helena in the plaques forming the necklace proper. It shows the Heavenly Hand honoring the emperor in a pose virtually identical to the offi cial medallion of a.d. 330 (Figure V). In this instance the subsidiary figures are the sun and moon, personified, thus stressing the emperor, with authority from God, as Cosmocrator, where the imperial medallion had stressed military victory and Romanitas. The first bronze issue of Valentinian I from Sirmium, known only by a unique specimen in Budapest, shifts back to the temporal plane, showing the new emperor receiving a shield from the Manus Dei on which is depicted a swastika shaped cross, the whole inscribed PERPETUITAS IMPERII (Figure VI). The type, no doubt, represents an overreaction to the end of the reign of the pagan Julian. The scholarly consensus18 is that the type was not generally issued since it went far beyond the conservative policy of Valentinian in reli gious affairs: for, in its definite Christianity, it could not fail to be offensive to the pagans. 14 The rendering of the hand, the collection of the horses, and the angle of the quadriga are all subject to degradation, a common phenomenon of those large-volume copper issues of the fourth century, a fact which will effect the identification of a later example of the Manus Dei, but scholars are agreed that this is the basic form of the type. It must be noted that Professor Alf?ldi, ' Insignien und Tracht' ( . 10 supra), makes the Hand be that of the deified Gonstantius Ghlorus. Here he is on much firmer ground, as this composition was well established as an apotheosis type under Septimus Severus, and may well have had a sculptural prototype; but it had also been adopted by Christianity as the 'assumption of Elijah' long before as well, and that allegory, of the restorer of true religion, would have appealed to Christian citizens. There is no inscription with the type to bias it in one direc tion or another; cf. Grabar, Christian Iconography ( . 8 supra) 117, ill. 281-285. 15 The illustration of Figure IV is taken from Maurice, Numismatique Constantinienne, 1. Pl. XXII, 8 (Paris 1908). 16 See H. Thieler, 'Der Stier auf den Gross-Kupferm?nzen des Julianus Apostata (355 360-363 . Chr.),' Berliner Numismatische Zeitschrift 27 (1962) 49-54,. 17 A.

The shift occurs almost immediately after the baptism of Theodosius in a.d. 380: persecution of pagans and heretics is rigorously reviewed and, perhaps for the first time, rigorously enforced;19 and the Manus Dei reappears on the coinage after a twenty-year absence, honoring the imperial nomination of Theodosius' young son Arcadius (Figure VII). The fact that the Manus Dei is now found on the obverse of the coin is very important, for while deviation or artistic license on the reverse types was not uncommon, the ' imago ' of the imperial person verged on the sacred.20 The ur;e of the Manus Dei in this instance cannot be intended to honor a victor ious emperor, and must be interpreted as indicating that divine authority supports the election of the prince; thus dynastism, already well established in imperial Rome, calls on the God of the Christians to witness the legitimacy of the practice. Five years later Theodosius began the issue of the SALVS REIPUBLIGAE type in his Aes IV as a record of his victory over Magnus Maximus. The basic reverse type of this issue showed Victory carrying a trophy over one shoulder and dragging a captive with her other arm. In the field left a cross, Christogram, or dot is usually employed, most probably as a sequence mark in this, the staple issue of copper in the eastern empire from 388 to 393.21 Of the basic type, there are only two significant variations: the first, in which Victory is wingless, is peculiar to the mint of Constantinople, and does not appear to have had any great significance; in the second, minted at Cyzicus, the trophy is replaced by the Manus Dei over Victory's right shoulder.22 (Figure VIII) This use of the 19 Codex Theodosianiis 16.5.5; 10, 7-9 (Theodosiani Libri XVI, edd. Th. Mommsen and P. M. Meyer [repr. of 2nd ed.; 2 vols in 3; Berlin 1954] 1.2.856; 899). 20 Such items as the type of diadem (pearl or rosette), whether the obverse inscription was broken or unbroken, and the size of the bust, were at one or another time carefully differentiated for the seniority of the imperial house members; see Bruun, RIC VII 35; Pearce, RIC IX xxxvii. 21 These marks excited some interest as possibly reflecting in some way either the pagan Christian conflict of the raging heretical crisis (Pearce, RIC IX xli), but Bruun's arguments, cited above, probably still obtain. The Manus Dei escapes dismissal in the same fashion only for its overtly Christian character (i.e., it cannot be the imperial symbol or an artistic abbreviation thereof, a possibility which is ever present with a cross or Christogram) and the observation that field symbols or letters or variations in the mint mark were the ordi nary means employed by the imperial mint masters to indicate sequence. If it is thought, however, that the Manus Dei fits more readily into those disputes rather than the imperial political interpretation I have given it, one must remember that it was precisely the widely held view of the pagans that their gods were the source of Roman victory which occasioned the De civitate Dei. 22 First observed by the Rev. C. Daniel Clark. Degradation of the type makes identifi cation of the symbol difficult. Dr. R. A. G. Carson, in a private communication, expressed the view that what we see on the Cyzicene coins is no more than a degraded tropaion; and he took no cognizance of the type-variant in R. A. G. Carson and J. P. C. Kent, Late Roman Bronze Coinage II (London 1965). However, while we find examples of the Manus Dei quite clear, no such examples exist of a pre-degradation trophy. No shaft line survives on any</page><page sequence="10">'the hand of god' 327 symbol more closely approximates the first imperial theme, that God has granted the victory to Theodosius, and such a recollection of Gonstantine was not at all contrary to the image of this second re-unifier of the empire.23 The type variant is confined to Gyzicus, however, and more than probably was the idea of the local mint magistrate; but the mingling of the Christian symbol with the pagan type moves imperial coinage farther down the road which would even tually see the male Christian angel replace the female pagan Nike on the issues of Anastasius. We might anticipate, in view of the elevation issue of Arcadius, that the next three similar issues would also employ the Manus Dei, but it is found only on that of Eudoxia (Figure IX) in a.d. 400. Although it might be argued that Honorius was an emergency replacement for the murdered Valentinian,24 that his elevation was not considered in dynastic terms, or that the seniority and primacy of Arcadius and the eastern empire were stressed by the omission, no argument can be advanced to account for the failure of the symbol to appear on Theodosius IFs elevation issue. An examination of the later-fifth-century examples shows, instead, that another, subtle change has occurred in imperial iconography: the symbol, on the coin obverses regularly appears with the fe male members of the imperial house, Honoria, Galla Placida, Eudocia, and Eudoxia (Figure XI)25 but only on one of the issues of the male contingent,26 that of Valentinian III (Figure XII). The inference to be drawn is that, through the empresses honored, divine favor protects the succession of the legitimate example I have seen of this issue to reproduce the pole on which a trophy would rest, and there is plainly an artistic difficulty present in the treatment of Victory's right arm: the official prototype has Victory's right arm extended to support the trophy shaft, and this feature is retained in the Gyzicus variant with no function. Thus the artist occasionally has the right hand reaching up to grasp the E or I of the inscription, or simply terminates the arm in a rectangular block or cube. G. Bruck, Die sp?tr?mische Kupferpr?gung (Graz 1961) 61, saw sufficient difference to rate the Gyzicene reverse type as a major variant of SALVS REIPUBLIGAE, but did not recognize the Manus Dei symbol. 23 The attempt of Magnus Maximus to obtain Church sanction of his usurpation by his persecution of the Priscillians illustrates well the value of Christian opinion in the imperial mind; cf. Ambrose, E p. 24. 24 The solitary example of the Manus Dei associated with Honorius is as a reverse type of his first Ravenna mint solidi, in the traditional 'victorious Christian prince' pose, cele brating the defeat of Gildo the Moor (symbolized by an expired lion lying at the emperor's feet; cf. Claudian, De bello Gildonico 1.358-359) (Plate X). These coins were issued in a.d. 402. 25 In addition to the illustrated gold and copper examples of the Manus Dei on the obverse, two issues of Aes III repeated and expanded the type on the reverse, showing the empress enthroned with the Manus above: inscribed CONCORDIA AVG for Pulcheria, Placida, and Eudocia at Constantinople, and GLORIA ROMANORUM for Eudoxia at all the eastern mints. 26 A badly damaged specimen of the Constantinople mint, reverse inscribed CONCORDIA AGV (Carson and Kent, Late Roman Bronze Coinage [n. 21 supra] 90, no. 2232) with the Manus Dei on the obverse, has been tentatively assigned to Theodosius II and dated ca. 430; but neither the inscription nor the bust is clear enough to make this attribution certain.</page><page sequence="11">328 traditio imperial house, or, more simply, that succession 'in the purple' is maintained by God.27 This last and highly restricted use of the symbol is a prelude to its demise; under Valentinian III the Hand disappears, and only a wreath remains (Figure XIII). The more general and more easily rendered nimbus,28 of solid pagan ancestry ? used rarely by Gonstantine, Valentinian I, and Valens, and popu larized by Theodosius I ? becomes the almost exclusive mark of divine favor and protection. Even in its restricted use the symbol is absent, as on the mar riage solidus of Marci?n and Pulcheria (Figure XIV), where the theme of divine endorsement of the royal nuptials shows, instead, the full figure of Christ blessing the couple. Yet the Manus Dei was not entirely forgotten. It became a device by which the usurper Basiliscus, during the reign of Zeno, sought to establish an instant dynasty. Coins were issued for his wife Zeonis with the same obverse represen tation of the Manus Dei which had adorned the coins of the earlier-fifth-century empresses.29 The Manus Dei has yet a long history in medieval European and later-Byzan tine art, but it must develop once again from its origin, in the full light of the Christian day, as a symbol of God the Father, or of the God of the Old Testament. Thus the Exarchate mosaics of Ravenna show the Manus Dei over the saints of old, while the imperial family is nimbate. M i not, North Dakota John D. Mac Isaac 27 The prerogatives of the emperor in this and in all other earthly affairs were not univer sally endorsed by all Christians. Thus, although Prudentius (Contra Symmachum 1.427-429 [CCL 126.200-210]) might proclaim 'Hoc deus ipse / constituit, cuius nutu dominaris et orbi / imperitas et cuneta potens mortalia calcas' (cf. ibid lines 408-410), St. Augustine would caution that emperor's son against overpresumption (Retractationes 1.3.2.8). 28 Grabar, Christian Iconography (n. 8 supra) 117ff. 29 Carson and Kent (Late Roman Bronze Coinage [n. 21 supra]), no. 2285, attributed to Basiliscus, is, in fact, an issue of Zeonis*. 1 Bertram Colgrave, 'Bede's Miracle Stories' in A.
