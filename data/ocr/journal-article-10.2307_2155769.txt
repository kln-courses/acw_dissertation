Arabia, southern India with Ceylon, and the Malay Peninsula have all three served as cul-de-sac to old, discarded, and forgotten fragments of humanity, pressed out of circulation by more vigorous and more civilized groups to the north. C. S. Coon (61, p. 187) .a land where no one lives, through which no man travels.... Jeremiah 5 1:43 The Arabian experience has been unique from its beginning. Of all hyper- arid regions across the world, this is the only one where in few millennia a population of hunter-gatherers has developed peculiar forms of social com- plexity, extracted an accumulative wealth of subsistence resources organized around a few local domesticates, and greatly influenced nearby centers of urban civilization. The economic and social preadaptive conditions developed in the Early and Middle Holocene made possible the colonization of desert and maritime habitats expanding the resource basis of Near Eastern economy (286). To establish how this was accomplished may represent an important new issue for archaeology in the Middle East, to complement its traditional focus on agricultural origins and early urbanism. Curiously enough, the potential of Arabian archaeology for the development of anthropological disciplines seems to be almost equivalent to the disregard with which it has 461 0084-6570/86/1015-0461$02.00</page><page sequence="2">462 TOSI been considered by prehistorians until very recently. To this day there still does not exist any single monograph devoted even generally to the subject, let alone any works on a more regional level (31, p. 19). The degree of novelty represented by the prehistory of Arabia is best expressed by specifying the data of the related literature: Of some 234 titles so far printed, 151 (64.53%) have been published after 1975, while only 55 (23.5%) predate 1970. This lasting underestimation is to some extent the heritage of an ancient prejudice against a land that so contrasts with neighboring centers in the Fertile Crescent as to be considered the "discarded appendix" of the Near East (61, p. 187). Certainly, such a backyard perspective disregarded a priori the value inherent in an adaptive system other than farming, and one representing a striking ecological success comparable only to the certainly more lauded case of the Eskimos in the Arctic. In both regions response to scarcity developed the same adaptive flexibility of aggregated subsistence strategies. Such strategies resulted in a dynamic pattern of economic relations where resource pooling is increased by the articulation of distinctive technocomplexes, each represent- ing an independent line of evolution. To further single out early Arabia as a unique research ground of greater potential for anthropological studies, we should recall that scarcity of natural resources is here linked directly with geographical proximity to the major centers of Old World civilization. This trapezoidal peninsula is the geological continuation of Africa; no natural borders separate it from the alluvial farm- lands of Syria, Mesopotamia, and the lower Nile Valley, while only narrow straits divide it from Iran, Baluchistan, and the Horn of Africa (see the map at chapter's end). The analysis of its formative phenomenology reinforces our definition of the historical interplay of two major factors of adaptation: the selective pressure on the local biota on one side, and a highly responsive attitude to contact with other regional systems on the other. The conjunction of Arabia to the Asian landmass is to a greater extent the effect of historical events than of geomorphic processes. Physically, the peninsula is a part of Africa, landscaped by the same geological and climatic processes as the eastern Sahara and the Ethiopian highlands. While geograph- ers have successfully adopted a "Saharo-Arabian" definition to conceptualize environmental continuity, prehistorians have not yet been able to develop an integrative approach nor systematic investigations to evaluate its impact on the cultural processes in the formative period. Research in Arabia has largely remained a subsidiary of Near Eastern archaeology with a persisting tendency to rank the evidence according to that of its northern neighbors. Converse- ly, no relevance has been attached to its relations with Africa, before the assumed Sabean influence in the formation of the Axumite state of highland Ethiopia, around 500 BC, according to the same one-way style of ranking civilizations (60, 290a, 302). In the end, although its importance is assumed</page><page sequence="3">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 463 by many, in light of Arabia's intermediary role between the two continents, the African connection is still lacking in both the literature and the operating prehistoric programs. Recent work along the Tihamah coastal plains of Saudi Arabia and Yemen promises to provide the most consistent evidence upon which to build (288, 311). The borders of Arabia have been neatly cut both by tectonics and by cultural diversity. The northward sliding of the crustal plate has opened the two narrow trenches of the Red Sea and the Gulf, which, like necks of a funnel, bring the ocean deeply into the Near East. To the north the border is best carved along the 250 mm isoyet (8, 125, 145, 194, 306), separating the desert from the sown portion of the Fertile Crescent. A barren chain of deserts fills Arabia's heartland from north to south: the Hamad, the Great Nefud, ar-Rub' al-Khali and the Wahhiba Sands are discrete names for an unbroken space of extreme aridity. Arabia deserves then that old name of Jazirat al-'Arab, "Island of the Beduins," recalling the image of a country of steppes and desert, surrounded by the waters of the Ocean, the Jordan, and the Euphrates (165, 233). Although fellow Semites, as early as historical records go the neighbors identified its inhabitants as different: in an economic sense because nomadic breeders, and in a socio-political one because organized in tribes. The entire territory covering 2,225,000 kM2, and skirting the Near East for approximately 2300 km towards equatorial Africa and India across a variety of environmental systems, became identified with the minority of its inhabitants because of their proximity and dialectical opposition to the Near Eastern peoples. The most ancient mention of its name, mat Arabilmat Aribi in the neo-Assyrian inscription on the monolith of Shalmanassar III (858-824 BC), designates only the inhabitants of the peninsula's more northerly regions, between the Syrian desert, the Sinai, and the northeastern borders of the Great Nefud (156). After latitude and altitude the third determinant factor of ecological vari- ability in Arabia is the monsoon, whose northern front affects all lands below the Tropic line and divides the peninsula in two halves south or north of the 16th parallel (125, 194). The highest altitudes and isoyet values coincide in the southwestern quadrant, determining the agricultural fertility of Yemen. The traditional image of a desert homeland of nomadic pastoralists only corresponds to central and northern Arabia. Farming and cattle herding are predominant activities in Asir, Yemen, the Jebel Akhdar in Oman, and the Qara mountains of Dhofar: Each might qualify as a possible Middle Holocene homeland of desert Arabian farming, probably one of the earliest forms of tropical agriculture. Seasonal runoff supplies water and silt from the high- lands to the surrounding belts of piedmont plains, pushing farming into the ar-Rub' al-Khali and across the coastal deserts of Tihamah and Batinah; hence the early development of waterwork engineering in southern Arabia,</page><page sequence="4">464 TOSI fully accomplished in the 1st millennium BC (302), where terraced fields and palm groves house today over half of the people living in the peninsula (269). No less important are those shallow water reserves stocked in the eastern coastlands and the Gulf islands, which have made possible extensive oasis farming in al-Hasa, Bahrain, and Failaka from the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC (200, 201). Quaternary changes in coastal morphology, although they have been the object of several important investigations (2, 94, 108, 235, 273, 275, 278, 291), are still relatively too underdeveloped to allow a fallout on the analysis of sites. The geography of Arabia is then best defined as the irregular setting of three concentric circles made by the wide desert core closed within a moun- tain and a marine ring (4, 8, 209). The morphological repartition of resources is consequently organized according to the concentric setting of three main environmental systems: the predesert steppes, the southern highlands, and the coasts. As continuously related to niche-packing and complementary spe- cializations, economic dynamism would have been effected by that proximity and intersection of opposing environmental situations most evident in Oman and Yemen (263, 283). The prehistory of Arabia can be regarded as a pluriverse integrating three distinctive evolutionary processes. Only from such a composite nonlinear perspective may we expect to use the poor evidence at hand to detect institutional and economic modes behind the Arabian miracle of ocean and desert conquest. Data should be disaggregated and reaggregated according to these three principal adaptive schemes, in- tended as systems of production: pastoralism, fishing, and oasis farming. This optimization strategy had been suggested more than a decade ago for the Oman peninsula, where cultural discontinuity was expected from the in- terdigitated diversity of a rugged geography, packing ocean/mountain/plain/ desert ecosystems along a transect less than 100 miles long (8). Post-1975 intensification of fieldwork has confirmed that the kind of archaeological data available throughout the Arabian peninsula, somehow still underestimated, can provide the relevant information, whenever methods and questions are properly applied. In this respect Oman has provided almost laboratory con- ditions to test the archaeological configuration of differential evolutionary trends (283). More recently, Yemen has been providing similar high returns, since more refined techniques have been employed on its Neolithic and Bronze-Age sites (85, 86, 110). A DELAYED DEVELOPMENT The modest and slow beginnings of prehistoric archaeology in the Arabian peninsula are also a consequence of the scarcity of useful evidence, compared with that of the Near East where research was largely directed by the</page><page sequence="5">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 465 monumentality of material production. Until as recently as 1970 what scanty knowledge there was on prehistoric Arabia was derived from amateur activity and the brief incursions of passing specialists (111, 115, 312). This body of early data is almost entirely composed of flint sites, scatters of lithic artifacts exposed and compacted by aeolian deflation, often spotted in the most desolate regions along the western margins of ar-Rub' al-Khali (71, 92, 113, 117, 118, 120, 231, 233, 234, 251, 312) or the Syrian Hamad in the northern extreme (116). These indications intensified during the 1950s and 1960s in direct proportion with the expansion of oil prospecting (62, 155, 209, 268). While Kuwait had pioneered a national organization of antiquities by 1960, it was not until 1975 that all the countries of the peninsula had established governmental agencies for the protection of their cultural heritage. A lot has been done in few years, with foreign intervention kept to a minimum, particularly after 1979 when the Iranian revolution and Soviet intervention in Afghanistan were diverting an uncontrolled flow of projects towards the Gulf states. Priorities have largely been placed on establishing basic resource inventories through site reconnaissances, the most remarkable example being Saudi Arabia's Comprehensive Archaeological Survey Program, pursued by the Department of Antiquities since 1974 (1, 137, 142, 178, 190, 230, 243, 267-311). In Oman site reconnaissance has been carried out only in the initial stage and to a limited extent (79-81, 83, 84, 88, 126, 161, 176, 247-249, 266), while after 1977 all expeditions have shifted their priorities to the establishment of sub-regional subsistence and cultural variability. In Yemen, early survey work dates back to the 1930s within the British-controlled Aden Protectorates (40, 41, 87, 89, 159, 290a), while only very recently it has been extended to parts of the northern highlands (85, 86, 261) and the Tihamah (288-311). However, lack of sequential control over artifactual variability has hindered almost everywhere the capacity to evaluate surface data in an historical perspective. In spite of its potential vastness, the body of surface data would have remained too incoherent to detail adaptive processes at a subregional level, even with more systematic prospecting work. Only by imposing ad hoc theoretical questions and field strategies on this incoherent mass of data could one cope with the Arabian reality (287). Systematic research was inaugurated at Bahrain, Qatar, and in Kuwait by the Danes in 1954 (20, 22-24, 146-149, 152), but the long shadow of Mesopotamian archaeology overwhelmed those initial steps in the search for Sumerian Dilmun (25, 281). The reorientation was not to be accomplished until halfway through the 1970s, when the increased involvement of specialists resulted in greater investments and long-term programs. Already in the embryonic phase during the 1960s, attempts were made to systematize a sequence from surface evidence by intensively surveying relatively circumscribed territories. Lack of sequential control over the lithic typology thwarted every attempt from the</page><page sequence="6">466 TOSI beginning. Paradigmatic is the Danish survey of Qatar (148, 149, 151, 188, 205, 225): The chronological sequence of the cultural assemblages defined on a typological basis proved worthless with the end of the 1970s as a result of the first microstratigraphic associations carried out by the French CNRS Mission (79, 180, 181, 278-280). Moreover, in Arabia lithics remained in current use till the 1st millennium BC (216). Treated with a more careful approach to the complement of both naturalistic observations and wear trace analyses, the classification of lithic industries has proved an efficient instru- ment of chronological-regional specification, as most eminently demonstrated by Edens's correlation of site complex in western ar-Rub' al-Khali. Edens has been able to revisit a loose collection of data from over 30 years of unsystema- tic hit-and-run fieldwork around the margins of the great desert (106, 106a; data from 113, 115, 117, 120, 155, 209, 265, 268, 312). Lack of relevant sedimentary formations related to prehistoric occupation convinced the earlier explorers that, progressively abandoned by an original population of hunter-gatherers, the Arabian landmass had experienced no significant cultural development after an assumed post-Pleistocene de- sertification (38, 72, 194, 212). The entire question of nonfarming forms of accumulation was unfortunately dropped through the seminal period of active research on Near Eastern neolithization during the 1950s and 1960s. This exclusion had a direct impact on earlier theoretical approaches: No other patterned forms of ecological relationship among hunter-gatherers apart from cereal exploitation was considered as leading to food production. Pre-desert steppe exploitation, like maritime and mountain adaptations, remained strongly underestimated, even among the most innovative circles of special- ists (e.g. 124, 286), with the result that even an area of subcontinental magnitude like Arabia would be lumped with a role as a passive recipient. It is the principal aim of this review to call attention to the different forms of food production developed other than primitive dry farming for a more com- prehensive definition of economic evolution. As we shall see, Arabia is very likely to provide this complementary evidence in close relation with the Near Eastern "nuclear," but not unique, contribution to the origin of agriculture. Significantly, in the earlier stages of Arabian prehistory a degree of interest was developed for the only monumental remains: rock carvings and mega- liths. However, for lack of contextual means of dating they both represented dead ends. In spite of their very frequent occurrence throughout the entire peninsula, and the exhaustive analysis of the very large collection recorded by the Philby-Ryckmans-Lippens Expedition in Nejd (6, 233), rock carvings have not provided for Arabia the kind of comprehensive pictographic index of cultural variability they had provided for the Saharan massifs. Stratified deposits have not been excavated in juxtaposition with any major cycle nor</page><page sequence="7">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 467 does the production exhibit the standards of quality and diversification that allow chronological seriation. While Anati has been able to distinguish two main periods for the more comprehensive Central Arabian inventory, roughly dated to the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC, respectively (6, 209, pp. 77-80), later attempts all referring to a more reduced data base for other regions went little beyond a level of unsystematic description (44-46, 70, 121, 122, 174, 185, 215, 246). Megalithic monuments are a recurrent feature in the northern plateau and around the orographic belt of western and southern Arabia (89, 215, 230, pp. 37-42, 290a, pp. 535-37). For the most part, these are funerary structures, cairns, and tumuli, and only very few of them come up to their European counterparts. In general they seem to have been constructed and used, with little variability, over a long period, and the importance of this in terms of cultural significance is still ill-defined (91). At any rate there are at least a few remarkable exceptions worth mentioning: two large complexes made of radial alignments of monolithic ortostates have been located at Mohamdid al-Hamli in the Yemeni Tihamah (13, 75) and at Rajajil in wadi Sirhan, the latter dated by Zarins to the late 4th millennium BC from lithic types in associated aceramic assemblage (230, pp. 40-42, 305). Both these complexes, made of impressive circles and alignments of granite pillars, suggest major ceremonial performances already in the preceramic phases of the 4th millennium BC. A third remarkable complex, also associated to an aceramic inventory and including dolmen-like structures, has been reported for wadi Sarr, a northern tributary of the Hadhramaut (290a). The possibility that they would represent ceremonial structures for Chalcolithic chiefdoms would greatly reward future investigations, considering how elusive the evidence remains for social com- plexity throughout the formative periods. ASSEMBLING THE FIRST CHRONOLOGICAL FRAME As elsewhere, for the Arabian peninsula the development of prehistoric research and its relevance for anthropology are strictly related to the capacity of recovering the indicators of chronology and subsistence from contextual associations of the primary layout. The poor consistency of the deposits and the devastating effects of erosion on the exposed surfaces have made the recovery of organic remains problematic everywhere. From the second half of the 1970s, the longer-term involvement of pre- historians has finally devised appropriate techniques for surface sampling and recording to retrieve cultural variability from the small, thin-layered settle- ment deposits. In Abu Dhabi (47, 51, 54), Bahrain (257, 258), Oman (18, 82, 83, 183, 184), and Northern Yemen (85, 86, 110) they have allowed the first consistent recoveries of bioarchaeological data. As is to be expected, the</page><page sequence="8">468 TOSI degree of preservation is uneven, depending on the ecological setting of the sites. In general, the highest standards of conservation have been encountered in coastal sites, where shell middens and termite activity have concreted the fine-grained deposits (19, 94). Sites bordering the desert interiors provide instead almost no positive deposit below the deflation pavement: Settlement data are restricted to layouts of exposed stone structures and surface variance in distribution of lithics (139, 140, 230). For the future, we are compelled to deal with an exceptionally uneven record. This will most certainly affect our understanding of particular processes of adaptation, in particular those leading to pastoralism and camel domestication along the desert fringes. A chronological skeleton remains, however, the priority issue, emphasized of course by the general scarcity of organic remains in safe context. So far, about 100 radiocarbon datings are available for the period from 5000 to 2000 BC (19, 51, 55, 118, 129, 179, 183, 207, 210, 235), a drop in the ocean compared with what requirements would be in the face of the expected cultural variability in so fractionated a region. Two recent contributions have reviewed the whole chronological question for the western (306) and eastern (241) halves of the peninsula. In the latter region chronological setting is improved by the presence of imported items from better-controlled areas such as Mesopotamia and Iran (56, 95, 96, 103, 104, 127, 132, 198, 218, 219, 238, 254, 304), or even Egypt in the single case of alabaster vases found at Bahrain (150). So far the only two characteristic products of eastern Arabia that have been tracked in foreign contexts are the so-called "Dilmun" circular stamp seals dated to the early centuries of the 2nd millennium BC (10, 21, 136, 192, 193, 199) and steatite vessels carved with dot-in-circle patterns (56, map 6; 218). The critical aspect of foreign contact for the archaeological record of prehistoric Arabia is represented by the beginning of ceramics in each of its main regional repartitions, since to a greater extent the introduction of pottery was everywhere the consequence of contact with the world of farmers. The earliest pottery found in the peninsula south of the Syro-Palestinian borderlands are Ubaid sherds from southern Mesopotamia, spreading along the coastlands of eastern Arabia (27, 33, 35, 154, 207, 226, 257) and beyond, in Bahrain (257, 258), and in Qatar (79, 182, 228, pp. 39-52). While archaeometric analyses have proven that this pottery was manufactured in Mesopotamia and imported as a finished commodity (222, 227), typological comparisons of the painted sherds have placed them in phases 3-4 of Ubaid seriation in Mesopotamia, ranging between 5100 and 3800 BC (228, 241). Although the discovery of Ubaid ware had an immediate impact upon Near Eastern archaeology, diverting some interest to Arabia, further investigations have underlined the limitations of a phenomenon cast in the local cultural traditions of maritime adaptation. There is no reason to believe this earliest evidence for maritime contact was different from the recurrent featuring of</page><page sequence="9">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 469 foreign relations in historical times. The impact of external influences on the Arabian reality has been geographically circumscribed and rapidly assimi- lated, considering their discontinuous character, by reason of outside aims such as the control of few maritime routes (e.g. the Greeks at Failaka, the Persians at Qalhat, the Portuguese at Muscat, and the British at Aden) or the supply of rare resources available in its territory, from copper and dio- rite during the 3rd millennium BC, through frankincense and myrrh in clas- sical times and coffee in the 17th century AD, down to oil in the present day (221). In the Oman peninsula the appearance of pottery can be dated to around 3000 BC with imports from Jemdet Nasr Mesopotamia (51, 127, 241, 242) and black-on-red wares from southeastern Iran (51, 56, 282, 285). This web of relations is extremely significant in light of the early urban development occurring there since the late 4th millennium BC (195, 198, 286) and the precise typological correlations established in the Oman peninsula (56, 77, 78, 97, 129, 133, 238, 244). Pottery remains a rare imported commodity at least until 2500 BC, when local manufactures come into being, almost at the same time in both Oman and al-Hasa (56, 237, 241), already configured as two distinctive traditions. A single sherd with an impression stamp seal from a North Syrian EB IVA-B storage jar has provided a good means of cross- dating the western coastline of Oman to the Euphrates exchange circuit: 2400-2250 BC (5, 26, 208). Stratigraphically controlled excavations at Hili 8 have ascertained their first installment in phase IIc2, contemporary to ED IIIA-B of Mesopotamia (51), establishing also a trace spectrum to track their specifications (214). These earliest forms are few and predominantly repre- sented by large jars, certainly related to an increased demand for food storage. The contradictory aspect is that while permanent mudbrick settlements and oasis farming are present from 3000 BC, the earliest pottery manufacture of Oman is found some centuries later, highlighting another Arabian deviation from assumed standards. From 2500 BC, economic integration and political complexity are accomplished throughout eastern Arabia with a consequent growth of wealth. Relations with foreign countries represent a continuous variable in al-Hasa and Oman; but while Mesopotamian influence is predomi- nant on the eastern Arabian mainland at this time, the latter is more characte- rized by multiplicity than intensity, with little evidence of either cultural or political dependence on the exterior (56, 130, 131). Imported goods diminish after 2500 BC, while different maritime avenues of exchange are activated to the West, to Iran, and from 2200 BC the Indus civilization (21, 50, 97-105, 238, 252). From the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, archaeological evidence suggests a considerable control of shipping and seafaring activities in the Gulf and the northern Indian Ocean on the part of the Arabs (157, p. 110). Recent evidence from the Yemeni highlands points to an even later dating</page><page sequence="10">470 TOSI for earlier pottery: the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, with the most significant morphological connections pointing towards Palestine in In- termediate Early-Middle Bronze Age, radiocarbon dated around 1800 BC (86, p. 34). The lack of evidence in western Arabia for any connection with the Nile Valley is intriguing. In Arabia there doesn't appear to be any relationship between forms of developed food production and the spreading use of pottery; this recalls the situation of northeast Africa, where the use of pottery antedates developed forms of food production by almost a millennium. Apart from a few isolated notations of similarity (e.g. 290a, p. 533; 106a), nobody has attempted to connect the available evidence from the Arabian and African sides of the Red Sea. Little information is found in Mesopotamian texts of the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC on Arabia proper. The few references are rather concerned with islands and shores of the Gulf called the "city" (KI) of Dilmun and described as a paradise land of orchards and freshwater springs, conveying copper and exotic merchandise from countries further to the south, along maritime routes of the "Lower Sea" (203, 229). First proposed in 1880 (93, 187), the identification of Dilmun with the Bahrain Islands has been a long controversial question, now a century old (255). Intense survey work, testings (64, 204), and the long series of Danish explorations at Qal'at al-Bahrain (20-25, 28, 150-152) and Barbar (217, 219) seemed to provide evidence for a total identification. However, a thorough philological revisitation (3, 37, 107, 175, 239, 245) has proven the toponym's persistence in the Mesopotamian sources, implying a considerable degree of shifting among various locations at the head of the Gulf (172, 240). Imposing discoveries in the islands of Failaka (7, 39, 143, 171, 173, 259) and Tarut (253, 304) as well as on the Arabian mainland (10, 237) relative to affluent and complex settlements are directly confirming this more complex con- figuration. By far the most substantial evidence for the late-3rd to early-2nd millen- nium BC Dilmun culture rests on the thousands of burials across the island, firmly establishing the originality of the ideological traditions (20, 103, 135, 177, 187, 196, 220) behind their funerary practices. In Oman, collective burials in stone cairns represent probably the most distinctive aspect of the protohistorical archaeological record (57, 58, 79, 90, 127-129, 132, 223, 292, 296) strongly related to southeastern Iran (197). The identification of the Oman, rather than the ore-rich mountains of south-eastern Iran (158, 244), with part or the whole of Magan, the more distant copper and diorite country of Sargon and Gudea (294), still rests on thin evidence (141). Most likely, here again the Mesopotamian name shifted between the two sides of the Hormuz straits during the approximately 500 years the name is scattered through the texts (144). Anyway, archaeometric</page><page sequence="11">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 471 analyses of metal objects and ores have indicated in Oman one of the principal sources for Mesopotamian copper in the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC (14, 15, 232). Copper extraction peaked in Oman during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC to meet the growth of both foreign and local demand (153, 162, 295-300). Certainly this period in Oman corresponds to an extensive settlement along the fertile piedmont, unlikely to have remained unknown to contemporary Mesopotamian centers (91, 95, 129-131). Their affluence is highlighted by the development of a local metal industry evidenced by a wealth of copper objects of local typology from graves and hoards (9). SPECIALIZED FORAGERS FOR AN ADAPTED BIOMASS Earlier works assumed that climatic change, along with a worldwide de- sertification of subtropical belts largely predominant at the time (16, 38, 42, 61, 74), determined Arabian prehistoric evolution. The idea of desertification was ultimately responsible for the lack of interest in early Arabia among prehistorians, as resource scarcity was directly linked to marginality and poverty. The change in orientation has been likewise determined by more fully elaborated theoretical approaches to post-Pleistocene adaptations (e.g. 159a, 274, 285, 306) and by the availability of direct data on Quaternary climatic fluctuations (2, 108, 163, 186, 189, 202, 250, 262). Overall stability of hyperarid climatic conditions in the Arabian interior over the past 10,000 years has been determined by McClure from the most consistent Holocene data base, generated by examination of clastic sediments in fossil lake bed sites of southwestern and central ar-Rub' al-Khali (211, 212). Climatic fluctuation becomes significant only if evaluated on a regional basis, specify- ing the regulatory effect on those biological components of the system relevant for the subsistence cycle. The work of McClure in ar-Rub' al-Khali, a perfect example of such a regional approach, provides the first clues to understanding certain pre- adaptative processes in the Arabian Neolithic. Radiocarbon dates on molluscs and marls establish that lakes associated to a number of flint sites (210) existed in the Mundafan area on the far western edge of the basin between 9000 and 6000 years ago. Fossil vertebrates from lake deposits have documented faunal remains otherwise rare for Arabia. A sizeable mammal population could be supported by moderate grassland and aquatic plants growing around the puddles formed below stabilized dunes by what he describes as "sand-slope flooding" (212, pp. 214-18). The formation of these lakes is related to a Middle Holocene pluvial phase as the effect of a period of high-intensity rainfall, probably a temporary extension of the northern mon- soon front related to a Holocene subpluvial phase. The climatic trend towards</page><page sequence="12">472 TOSI increasing aridity is inferred by McClure from faunal variability between the two last active phases of the Mundafan lakes over a period of some 30,000 years-36,000-17,000 and 9,000-6,000 BP (210; 211, figure 84). As ex- tremes of a continuum of variability, hippopotamus and water buffalo existed in the wettest phase of the Late Pleistocene, and steppe grazers like the oryx and the gazelle are associated with the dune topography and are representative of the driest ones. Open parkland herding species, such as equids and the ostrich, would fall in between with a broader adaptive spectrum, while a wild cattle population is to be expected to graze any stabilized grassland. Lasting at least from the Early Pliocene, the hyperarid climate led to the formation of a large and adapted biomass all over the Arabian lowlands. Also given their extension and continuity, they niched the largest desert mammals of the world (159a). By the beginning of the Quaternary even around the most desert areas herds of bovids, equids, camels, and ostriches, specialized to extract nourish- ment from the scattered plant cover, granted the population of hunters that stood at the end of its trophic cycle a resource base comparable to that available along the swamps and riparian forests of the alluvial plains (111, 112, 114, 119, 123, 159a, 289). A second and even larger permanent biomass was available from the ocean, the belt of tropical waters surrounding the peninsula. Each of the several ecological compartments forming a maritime environment (rocky/sandy shorelines, tidal creeks and flats, littoral and pelagic waters) provided a reliable supply of fish and molluscs all year round, supplemented by more seasonal turtles and marine mammals. Middle Holocene sites have been detected along present and past coastlines of Arabia, in a whole variety of ecological settings, suggesting intensive exploitation at least by 5000 BC in Oman (17, 19, 63, 94, 235), al-Hasa and Bahrain (200, 207, 224, 257, 258), the Harassis (184), the Tihamah, and the island of Socotra (76, 288, 311). More than any of the so easily assumed scarcity or aridity constraints, these large food reserves would have determined the particular evolution of the Arabian Neolithic and the configuration of its complex societies in the Bronze Age. The Middle Holocene Arabian foragers represent at any rate an extreme case of successful harvesting for a hyperarid environment, organized along two distinctive adaptative processes: a continental one along the steppic fringes of the interior deserts, and a maritime one all around the oceanic perimeter. Progress in subsistence would have been represented in the first case by a shift to ovicaprid herding and camel domestication following overexploitation of the wild populations and in the second one by an increas- ing capacity for off-shore fishing and long-range navigation. Thus we may assert that the conquests of the desert and the ocean are the contributions of Arabian foragers to the overall development of civilization. Because in prehistoric coastal economies settlements are largely patterned</page><page sequence="13">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 473 by monitoring of complementary continental resources and proximity to freshwater sources, the spatial disaggregation between the two specialized populations of Arabian hunter-gatherers is most likely to turn out to be a false problem. Resource scarcity calls for overspecialization on restricted kinds of resources, but institutionalized forms of exchange would have developed as early to ensure larger economic and genetic pools. Higher levels of social integration were probably reached before the end of the Middle Holocene through the establishment of desert farming within date palm oases on one side and the build-up of tribal configurations on the other. It is a perspective that once more highlights the unique opportunity offered by Arabian pre- history to observe a course towards a complex society other than urbanism, and right alongside the agricultural heartlands of early states. To establish what preadaptive features leading to food production were already effective in Early Holocene times might seem a target out of range for the kind of archaeological record available for interior Arabia, but direct evidence has been recovered by Zarins through a revisitation of the Epipaleolithic Natufian complexes along the predesert fringes of the Hamad and Nefud (306, 310, pp. 34-36). Once approached from an Arabian- pastoralist perspective rather than a Palestinian-agriculturalist one, these com- plexes need to be treated not as marginal variants but as expressions of a desert-oriented adaptive trend to food production. The entire northwestern part of the peninsula, including Hijaz and the outskirts of Nefud, encompasses what Zarins has defined as the "Greater Southwest Asian Arid Zone," where he locates the formative core of the Southwest Asian Pastoral Technocomplex based on camel-ovicaprid herding and incorporating the characters of historic- al Bedu societies. Zarins's work has disclosed a world of implications very critical to our understanding of agricultural origins in Braidwood's "Near Eastern nuclear zone." Early Holocene pastoralism in the Arid Zone may represent a parallel development, made possible by a dialectic patterning of economic complementarity. General agreement on a single standard of cereal exploitation for the evaluation of accumulative processes has been the founda- tion of another "prime mover" proposition in our theoretical perception; but this single-standard approach breaks down once we can point to a different tradition leading to an important new development: ovicaprine-camel pastoralism, interdigitating and complementing along the ecotone zone of the Palestinian desert borderlands (11, 12). Zarins further suggests that "incipient transhumant herding was probably present as people shifted from a dependence on wild species to one on the same domestic species (Capra ibex to C. aegagrus)" (306). Since domestica- tion is widely understood as a state of reliance, forms of selective hunting cast in a cultural system with a specialized technocomplex can be treated as preadaptive elements. An incipient pastoral phase can be evidenced im-</page><page sequence="14">474 TOSI mediately after Natufian terminal hunting-gathering, with Prepottery Neolith- ic A, beginning around 8300 BC and lasting to include the entire Middle Holocene, until 3750 BC (1 1). How far this complex extended towards eastern Arabia during Early Holocene times is still hard to establish, since less information is available as we move south of the Negev. However, sites in Central Arabia, like Thamaman near Riyad (310) or Ain Qannas in Jabrin (207, pp. 96-116), together with the scanty evidence for Early Holocene settlements in the Oman peninsula so far limited to a group of sites on fossil lake terraces at Mazyad on the eastern side of Jebel Hafit (140), suggest a deep southward penetration of specialized desert foragers across Nefud and Nejd. Towards the southwest the long series recovered along the ar-Rub'al- Khali and in the Mundafan area indicate occupation since 6800 BC and the exploitation of perilacustrine marshes, which supported a population of cattle besides the expected desert bovids and equids (212, pp. 181-82). Settlements are built on elevated terraces and comprise several compounds of curvilinear structures on stone foundations, closely recalling those of Syro-Palestine in the Early Holocene, but persisting in Arabia throughout the Middle Holocene, in the interior and on the coast (17, 19, 139, 310). Faunal data are far too insignificant to provide any frame for an evaluation of economic strategies. Edens has called attention to recurrent incidence of equid and gazelle bones in all available samples (106, pp. 22-24). Both these mammals build up large herds and it is not unlikely they could have provided the basic food stock to articulate the continental forage economy of Arabia in the Early Holocene. Related evidence may be recollected from the site of Umm Dabaghiyah in the Jazira of Iraq on the very northern fringe of the Arabian desert (191). The settlement is dated to the mid 6th millennium BC, thus chronologically coherent with the relevant contexts in Arabia. A tantalizing series of long compartmented storage buildings indicates the specialized function of the site, culturally pertinent to the pre-Hassunan farming stages of northern Iraq. The total number of animal bones recovered from all four levels of occupation was 6580, of which 4429 (67.31%) were from wild equids alone, while another 1081 (15.67%) were from gazelles (30). The desert herd mammals represent close to 83% of the animals killed at a site, where all five domestic species as well as cultivated cereals were eaten (H. G. Helbaek in 191, pp. 17-19 ). Since in the heartland of Arabia foragers would have been even more de- pendent upon those populations, we may regard the evidence from Umm Dabaghiyah as a reliable reference. The small but stratified bone sample from Ain Qannas in northeastern ar-Rub' al-Khali records equids as the most frequent species from a context dated around 5000 BC by radiocarbon and associated Ubaid ware (207, p. 236; M. Zeder, personal communication). By the late 4th millennium BC, increasing selective foraging strategies had driven Arabian hunters and fishermen to the domestication of camel and date</page><page sequence="15">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 475 palm, catalyzing at last the adaptation process around forms of food produc- tion alien but complementary to those in the rest of the Middle East. Better than subsistence resources, both these Saharo-Arabian domesticates are to be conceptualized as means to increase control of the same basic food suppliers: ovicaprids, cattle, and cereal crops. While palm trees combined to water- works create the artificial microclimatic conditions for intensive oasis farm- ing, camel transport intensifies the gathering of rarefied desert plant com- munities (56). None of the basic subsistence species is ancestral to Arabia, but they were introduced in the different regions of the peninsula during Middle Holocene times, mostly by means of desert hunters and coastal cruisers. Lack of deposits in continental sites might explain the fact that the first direct evidence is derived from coastal shell middens. Charred grains of sorghum have been retrieved with floatation at the Qurum RH 5 site from a late 5th millennium BC context, together with a sizeable collection of mammal bones, including those of domestic cattle and ovicaprids (17-19; H. P. Uerpmann, personal communication). Sorghum suggests that the first cultivation ex- ploited in the Arabian peninsula originated from the East African center (159a). The earliest archaeological evidence for domestic camels occurs in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC, at Shahr-i Sokhta in eastern Iran (59) and slightly later from Umm an-Nar near Abu Dhabi (163), represented by bones, dung, textiles, and carvings on grave slabs. Scholars have debated at length whether there is evidence through the records that camels were at all relevant for the Arabian way of life before 1200 or 2000 BC (293, 313). Opinions vary also on the region where the domestication occurred first: between Central Arabia, in relation to desert herd hunters (256, 303), or around the piedmont ecotones of Oman or Yemen in relation to protofarming technocomplexes (33). It seems unlikely, however, that the domestication of this highly special- ized animal would not have required a prolonged preadaptive period on the human side, producing radical social changes among sub-Neolithic foragers. Domestic camels represent minimal mutations from their wild ancestors (33, 138), while the transformation of the human population has been more likely the true precondition for their exploitation. PATHWAYS FOR THE COMING OF FARMING TO ARABIA According to the phytogeographical criteria developed by Vavilov, Arabia falls into three main divisions: the desert fringes in the northern steppes and the agro-climatic region of the Arabian highlands in the south, separated by the arid core in between. The more analytical geobotanical investigations carried out by Zohary allowed a finer ecological repartition and a better</page><page sequence="16">476 TOSI articulation with surrounding regions-Africa in particular (314). In general, Arabia is the continuation of the African system across the Red Sea, spanning the Saharo-Arabian phytogeographical region comprising its northern and central parts and the Sudanese one for its tropical southern and eastern coastlands. Because of the climatic influence from the ocean, southern Arabia and the adjoining regions of Africa and the Lower Indus plain have developed a plant environment of their own. Zohary has proposed naming this eastern part of the Sudanian region the Nubo-Sindian Province, stressing an environ- mental continuity that bridges two continents along the highlands and seashores of tropical Arabia (314, pp. 3-7, map 6). Ecological similarity determines then an oddly shaped, narrow strip bridging two distant con- tinents. This might represent a significant feature that will guide future research strategies in the eastern Arabian coastlands. In particular, the early dispersal of African cultivars as originally suggested by C. 0. Sauer has become a testable hypothesis through the exploration of prehistoric sites along the eastern Arabian shores: "The southern rim of Arabia . . . may be a great lost corridor of mankind" (260, p. 36) and also "The Indian-South Arabian- Abyssinian route of the Old Planting culture functioned again in the spread of seed agriculture and became extended in the opposite direction . . ." (260, p. 82). Interestingly enough, both the Saharo-Arabian and the Sudanian regions are identified in a greater part of their agriculture by the date palm (Phoenyx dactylifera ), ancestral in this part of the world. The tropical Arabian coast- lands and the "hilly flanks" of their close hinterlands are among the most likely candidates for being one of the centers of early date palm cultivation. This assumption is partly confirmed by recently detected evidence from prehistoric sites in Arabia and Baluchistan. Charred date pits have been identified at 6th millennium BC Mehrgarh IA-B in the Sibi plain of eastern Baluchistan and 5th millennium BC site R37 in the Dowlatabad basin some 200 km south of Kerman, while the earliest Arabian occurrence is presently at Hili 8 in the Buraimi oasis of Oman around 3000 BC (52, 53, 69). All three sites are located within the boundaries of the Nubo-Sindian province. Palaeobotanical research at Hili has also provided the earliest evidence of oasis farming in Arabia, as represented by a combination of summer and winter crops and by intensive exploitation in scheduled multi-cropping all year round under the artificial microclimatic conditions granted by con- centrated palm trees and waterworks (48, 49). The evidence is represented by seeds and imprints that prove the contemporary farming of both east African and Near Eastern cultivars, shadowed under the local date palms. The pres- ence of durra (Sorghum bicolor) is most indicative in Period 1 (52, 53). More recently, and most surprisingly, sorghum has been detected at site RH5 at Qurum near Muscat, an aceramic shell midden in association with a fisher-</page><page sequence="17">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 477 men's compound more than 1000 years earlier (17). Closely following Sauer's early explanation for the dispersal of cultivated plants, the first direct evidence from Arabia would confirm that cultivars moved between south- western Asia and northeastern Africa, channelled along the Baluchistan and Arabian coastlines by prehistoric fishermen in a relatively short period (260, figure 2; 286). By 4500 BC they were part of the diet at Qurum and by 3000 BC were cultivated with other crops in oases like Hili (17). Unfortunately the African evidence for this period is too scant to allow more correlations (e.g. 43; 236 for earliest evidence in Ethiopia). The Arabian oasis, as the nuclear component of the integrated traditional economy, is fully developed at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, both in the Oman peninsula, where it is represented by the wadi Suq culture (55, 125, 128, 296), and by the City I-II assemblages of Qal'at al-Bahrain and Barbar (28, 169, 170, 219). Dental morphology on human skeletons provides direct evidence of a shift to farming and the establishment of dietary habits with higher grain consumption beginning in the mid 3rd millennium (166- 168, 223) and greatly distinctive from foragers' dental pathology in the same region (63). This major accomplishment has been underestimated for the wide-ranging evidence of cultural contacts across the archaeological record of this period. An Harappan component is significantly predominant over the Mesopotamian one, but no relations of dependency should be assumed (56). Development of nuclear villages and integrated economies follows the same trend at a close pace in neighboring Iran and India, both characterized by the merging of foreign cultivars with species of local ancestry (66, 68) and associated with the first use of work animals as represented by camels and domestic equids (213). On the highlands of Yemen, predominantly farming economies are documented only from the late 3rd millennium BC. Seed impressions on early historical potsherds suggested a heavy reliance upon African cultivars (267). Bronze-Age sites in Khawlan have produced more imprints on chaff-tempered wares, confirming the presence of domestic sorghum and millet associated with dwarfed forms of wheat and barley and with domestic cattle (109), signalling a long farming tradition in conditions of aridity (67). The tropical highland compartment would have reached a mature stage of development during the first half of the 2nd millennium BC (86), in close correspondence with the wadi Suq period of Oman. A second revolutionary apex in the evolution of agriculture is then reached shortly after 2000 BC, as the effect of the dispersal factor, when man-made mutants of cultivated plants and bred animals moved from the circumscribed areas of their primary domestication to new areas. Arabia has acted as a bridge between the African and Asian centers of plant domestication, foster- ing their early integration.</page><page sequence="18">478 TOSI CONCLUDING REMARKS The long prelude to Arabian civilization can be divided into three evolution- ary stages: 1. Formative: the Terminal Stone Age in Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene times. The economy comprised intensive exploitation of desert, highland, and littoral ecosystems. A wide range of plants was probably also gathered, involving an early development of technologies for their treatment as known so far from Late Pleistocene sites in Nubia and Upper Egypt (301). 2. Initial Stage of Food Production: Early forms of food production were developed within each specialized foraging system during the Middle Holocene, organized around the main Saharo-Arabian domesticates, along three distinctive technocomplexes: pastoral, maritime, and tropical highland. Foreign domesticates and cultivars were introduced to Arabia in this period through increasing contact, mostly maritime. Larger ceremonial centers were built in this period across the entire peninsula and may represent an important indicator of increasing complexity. 3. Developed Farming Economy: A farming economy derived from the social integration of the three specialized forms of subsistence economy. During the first half of the 3rd millennium BC local Chalcolithic cultures emerged, reelaborating foreign elements such as ceramic manufacture and mudbrick architecture (56, 276). Oasis farming, navigation, and camel herd- ing marked an accomplished capacity to adjust imported domesticates to the hyperarid climate, while large-scale mining (65, 161, 295-300) and craft production combined to evidence an emerging form of township, articulated to this particular form of desert economy. 4. Early States: Higher levels of social aggregation were probably reached first in eastern Arabia and Oman during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. The archaeological evidence is still disputable, ranging from ranked burials at Dhahran (35, 237) to the extensive use of elite productions such as limestone statuary (253) or ED III carved steatite vessels of Interculture Style in the Dilmun area, and increasing centrality of craft production in Oman (129, 138, 275, 296-300). Oasis settlements supplied with complex water- works were developed all along the piedmont belt of interior Oman during the long duration of the so-called Umm an-Nar culture, between 2500 and 2000 BC (53, 134, 284). Cultural uniformity throughout the Oman peninsula has suggested that by the middle of the 3rd millennium forms of social integration had compounded the different Middle Holocene economical compartments (50, 56, 276, 277, 284). Records of the military campaigns by the Akkadian kings against the countries of the Gulf consistently agree upon the existence of important state entities competing with Mesopotamia and Elam for the control of the Ocean trade (270, 272). Oman, regardless whether the center or part of</page><page sequence="19">PREHISTORIC ARABIA 479 0V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ t4) I ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0 I (,, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~: .~~~~~~~Z (</page><page sequence="20">480 TOSI Magan, was drawn into conflicts that probably destabilized the entire region prior to the growth of the early state in Dilmun and the privileged position of Harappans in eastern Arabia (27, 32, 50, 56, 73, 100, 286). The use of Akk. malek as title for the ruler of Magan, defeated by Naramsin in the campaign reported on the Sb 52 Louvre inscription from Susa, is the only available piece of textual information on the political setting of the region (144), and it suggests a system of state-like complexity. By 2500 BC most of Arabia was no longer the sparsely populated and economically segregated country of sub-Neolithic hunter-gatherers it had been less than a millennium before. Even if the emergent system had little in common with the urban configurations of the early states across the Middle East, it was a highly integrated aggregation of farmers, fishermen, and nomadic herders. Their cultural homogeneity was the product of political formations we are still unable to define but that likely foretold historical Arab ways of life and social institutions. Only a trend to social aggregation through parental affiliation may explain in fact the rapid diffusion of collective burials as general practice throughout the Oman peninsula during the 3rd millennium BC. Nowhere else in the entire Middle East can be found a similar scale of development: the late 4th millennium stone cairns developed into true "tow- ers" of dressed limestone blocks carefully jointed and finely carved, used throughout the Oman Peninsula in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. Well over one hundred individuals were buried in a period of a century or two in tomb A at Hili North (57, 58, 223, 292). Arabian prehistory suggests that from its very beginning, social evolution in the Middle East was an uneven process of diversification, based on and brought forward by the articulation of different modes of production.
