<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews 289 prose is a patchwork of polysyllables, pregnant yet undelivering metaphors, and simple affectation: 'Marvell contemplates the green world of time'; 'Marvell throughout his poetry confronts with resolute imagination the absolute contingency of freedom and necessity, transformingthatphilosophical conception into the drama, the "story", of the Resolved Soul'; 'Narration is an expressive form answering to the temporality of experience; emblem gives voice momentarily to the abstract. In Marvell's poems, the created picture is resonant with the history it bespeaks and the unfolding story discovers significance in the world of time'; 'Discord is absent, because since Silvio's betrayal the Nymph has lived entirely in the present, from day to day - that is, virtually out of time'; 'Emblematic seeing is the intaglio of prophetic judgment: the Puritan imagination, it is well to remember, is an allegorical imagination'. Beneath these obfuscations, much of the book is platitudinous paraphrase of the poems - like this comment on the last stanza of 'Upon Appleton House': Like the starry cattle and the halycon-Maria, like the square grown spherical and the river-snake, the great prelate of the grove and the mariners of the hayfields, like all the masquers of this afternoon's pageant, these fishermen are caught in a metamorphosis which is the creation of the transforming eye of imagination. The visionary poet sees in the picture of a salmon-fisher with his boat over his head an image of the earth and its heaven: the correspondence excites amusement and wonder and delight because it is beautiful and true. (p. I93) Mrs Berthoff's manner, however, purports to express theory and analysis, not simple description. Her opening chapter argues against the 'literalizing' of those who see in the phrase 'This Dial new' in 'The Garden' a specific visual and horticul- tural reference to a floral sundial: 'If the rhetorical character of "this Dial new" is understood, it will be no more visualized than "the Garlands of repose". ' Similarly she chides those like Margoliouth who see specific and architectural references in the opening stanzas of 'Upon Appleton House': 'But cogency does not depend on our having a visual image of Appleton House in mind. The "Square grows Spherical" probably derives not from the architectural details of Appleton House but from the implicit suggestions of the metaphor of the anthropomorphic house, which in turn is based not upon appearance but upon idea.' The implications of Mrs Berthoff's approach come out most clearly in her treatment of 'Upon Appleton House' where her concern to remove any contemporary political application from the poem is intransigently at odds with its manner and content: 'The best argument against the labored allegorization of the harvest/battle is that we do not need it and that, if allowed, it disrupts the poem.' Some of the book's most radical points are made in such brief, unargued statements. With happy surety we are told, 'Marvell does not return to the theme of the soldier's retirement. His purpose is neither to justify nor, of course, to question explicitly his employer's choice, but to describe the circum- stances of its enactment and its moral consequences. Ironic speculation about the safety of retreat, the loss of heroic leadership and the chance of earthly glory this is nothing to Marvell's larger purpose. He honors the private person, whose choice he does not question.' To ask for argued substantiation of such assertions, however, would be to take The Resolved Soul too seriously. M L MICHAEL WILDING SYDNEY Nahum Tate. By CHRISTOPHER SPENCER. (Twayne's English Authors Series) New York: Twayne. 1972. I84 pp. $4.95. This book is the first to be published about Nahum Tate (c. 1652-1715). Like the other volumes in the Twayne's English Authors Series it aims 'to provide an account of the writer and his works, with detailed historical and critical analyses of</page><page sequence="2">his most important publications'. So relatively little is known about the man him- self and the occasion of many of his writings that it would be difficult to attempt a 'life' ofTate as distinct from an 'account', and Professor Spencer adheres closely to his brief. Facts about Tate scarcely go beyond the records of birth, education, official appointments (he was Poet Laureate from 1692 until the year of his death), and burial in an obscure grave. From his writings little is deducible about his personality, other than that he was an extremely modest man, perhaps sickly, with a hankering for retirement. A habit of signing himself 'N. Tate' made many people believe his first name was Nathaniel. Professor Spencer ventures that Tate's Christian name suited his vocation, for 'the Book of Nahum is one of the most poetic in the Bible', but that book's fierce and bloody vision could scarcely be less appropriate to this mild versifier. Though he wrote a number of plays, usually designing each to be acted at a specific theatre, he seems to have had no recorded connexion with any company. He apparently never married, and died in the Mint, by tradition hiding there from creditors. This tradition, with the fact that as Laureate he had to ask Queen Anne for more cash and back salary suggests casualness in payment rather than Tate's prodigality: Professor Spencer estimates that the Laureate's stipend, properly paid, might have been adequate for a cautious, elderly bachelor. A tantalizing thread runs through the account of Tate and his works: Tate's relationship with Dryden. It would be worth much to know Dryden's feelings about Shadwell and Tate after they succeeded him as Laureate. He had helped early in Tate's career. Tate contributed three pieces in I68o to Ovid's Epistles, Translated by Several Hands, in which Dryden translated two epistles and wrote the preface. Soon after, Dryden asked Tate to write The Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel. It was a great hand-up for a rising poet. Tate did his part of the sequel competently, and also followed Dryden's example in adapting Shakespeare for the contemporary stage. He was at this time (early I68os), and frequently throughout his career, under the influence of Dryden's critical ideas. Yet of any personal intercourse between the two after this beginning there is no record, though Professor Spencer hints at a mild rivalry. He speculates that Tate's essay in defence of farce (I693) may have been inspired by Dryden's dismissal of the genre the year before. Eight years after Dryden's death Aaron Hill and Tate tried to depreciate Dryden's translation of the Metamorphoses (in Fables, 1700) in favour of their own - Dryden had brought out his book, as he told Tonson, to 'spoyl Tate's undertakings'. For Tate's part, perhaps his silence on Dryden's death says much. An obituary verse or two from the Laureate on his predecessor and patron would not have been out of place: but Tate, so very conscientious (as Spencer shows) in celebrating Birthdays and New Years, wrote nothing on this occasion. Dryden's passing was acknow- ledged in verse only by some scurrilous doggerel of Richard Blackmore's, actually placed on the new grave. Perhaps it is especially unfortunate for Tate that we know so little about him, for the works must therefore stand for the man. They do not inspire a great deal of affection: Professor Spencer accords them serious critical-historical treatment. Tate attempted many forms of writing, and Spencer offers concise and useful essays in definition, describing the traditions of classical translation in England, dramatic adaptation, panegyrical verse, psalmody, 'melancholy verse', and 'the celebration of tea'. The sections on Shakespeare adaptation and Laureate verse are especially good. In a perceptive analysis, fair to both Tate and Shakespeare, Spencer makes the point that Tate's adaptations were not meant to compete with Shakespeare, nor did Tate's History of King Lear contend with its original for seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century audiences. He appraises critical Reviews 290</page><page sequence="3">opinions of Tate's King Lear for their true value; and his conclusion on this notorious redaction is that while Shakespeare's is obviously far the greater work, Tate's is nevertheless a good play with different ends and different means. While estimating Tate's Laureate verse to have little value as poetry, Professor Spencer offers insights on the ceremonial nature of these works and on Tate's use of his musical experience in composing them. Though he takes seriously Amy Reed's assertion that Tate was an influential poet it is difficult to see, even after reading Professor Spencer's book, that Tate's work really influenced any other poet or school. On the contrary, the careful sketch of the background to each type of writing which Tate undertook helps suggest that whatever Tate did he did as a follower of tradition rather than as an innovator. Only in championing farce was he completely independent: even his high opinion (then rather unfashionable) of Shakespeare could have rubbed off from Dryden. He had critical precept from Dryden, was strongly influenced in imagery by Virgil, and for his tragic note went to school to Nat Lee. In short, like Auden's Unknown Citizen he held the proper opinions for the time of year. Perhaps this is why Tate is such an unknown citizen of letters: a poet's conformity within a tradition, or his common voice with other poets, matters less than his individuality. Time and again this book shows how Tate was at one with the interests and tone of his age. He was an honest and conscientious craftsman who, despite Scott-Thomas's opinion that he was 'a thorough-going and unrepentant opportunist', really was too diffident to capitalize on his chances. What opportunities he had!: deputy for Dryden in the sequel to Absalom and Achitophel; enjoying the reversion of King Lear, Richard II, and Coriolanus when adaptations were in vogue; lyricist to Henry Purcell; Laureate for twenty-three years. Yet all his plays but two failed; he is mainly recalled only, and unjustly, as the botcher of King Lear or as the author of 'Thus on the fatal banks of Nile | Weeps the deceitful crocodile' in Dido and Aeneas; and his surviving psalms and splendid Christmas hymn 'While shepherds watched' are sung with no memory of their author. Indeed, anyone indignant about Tate's supposed mutilation of Shakespeare might be comforted to know that nowadays in Irish churches 'While shepherds watched' is sung in a version 'refined' and reduced from Tate's - the shepherds no longer are seated on the ground, where he placed them, nor does 'glory shine around'. Tate was an advocate of poetic justice, and perhaps it has been done. B JAMES BLACK CALGARY William Congreve. By MAXIMILIAN NOVAK. (Twayne's English Authors Series) New York: Twayne. I971. I97 PP. $4.95. The Ethos of Restoration Comedy. By BEN Ross SCHNEIDER, JR. Urbana, Chicago, and London: University of Illinois Press. I97I. 20I pp. 4. Io. 'Congreve', Professor Novak states, 'shared with Southerne and Vanbrugh a critical moment of balance between an older comedy of wit and a new sentimental comedy, between an age of wit and an age of sentiment; and there is every reason to believe that Congreve, the man as well as the playwright, was a product of his time.' This compact, closely argued, and sensitive study never loses sight of the fact that most of Congreve's work (indeed, everything that matters) was accomplished during the decade of the I69os. In an opening chapter which also presents an account of Congreve's life and personal relationships, Professor Novak tries to define the literary character of the I69os: a troubled but provocative interregnum between the Restoration proper and the emergence of a distinctly eighteenth-century Reviews 29I</page></plain_text>
