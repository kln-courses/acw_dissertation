Cloth US$85 ISBN 978-0-7914-7517-1. In Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey Frederick Colby analyzes the historical development of the narrative on Muhammad's night journey (isrā') and ascension (mi'rāj) attributed to Ibn 'Abbās. By Colby's estimation the earliest (or "primitive") version of this narrative dates not from the time of Ibn 'Abbās but from the late 3rd/ 9th century and thus is presumably later than the narrative found in the canonical Sunnī hadīth collections (p. 44). The narrative associated with Ibn 'Abbās is also substantially different. In the earliest version of the Ibn 'Abbās narrative the Prophet does not travel to Jerusalem at all, but rather directly to heaven. Moreover, all versions of the Ibn 'Abbās narrative are distinctly apocalyptic: the heavens and its angels are described in detail and God speaks directly to the Prophet in a long colloquy (in some versions God touches Muhammad between his shoulder blades "with cool and comforting hands" [p. 34].) In light of the narrative's anthropomorphic God and fantastic details most Muslim scholars reject the Ibn 'Abbās narrative in favor of the canonical narrative, with its emphasis on Muhammad's superiority to the earlier prophets. Western scholars, for their part, have generally been occupied with the search for the most ancient version of this tradition, and so likewise favor the canonical narrative. In Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey, Colby means to address this imbalance by illustrating the significant place of the Ibn 'Abbās narrative in Islamic religious and intellectual history. In this his work is distinguished from Brooke Vuckovic's 2005 Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam, a book concerned with the reception of a wide range of mi'rāj traditions. In Chapter One Colby introduces the Qur'ânic material Muslim authors traditionally connect with the Prophet's night journey and ascension (while acknowledging that the connection is often tenuous). The following 75</page><page sequence="2">MESA I R 0 M E S I 44 1 I 2010 chapters are dedicated to the principal features of the various isrā'/mi'rāj narratives: the Ibn 'Abbās narrative (Chapter Two), the reports found in early historical literature including Ibn Ishāq/lbn Sa'd (Chapter Three), the reports of proto-Shī'ī authors, who often present the episode of the divine colloquy as a lesson on the walâya of the twelve Imāms (Chapter Four), the canonical narrative (Chapter Five), the reports found in Qur'ân commen- taries (Chapter Six), and the later works of Sunni scholars in Nishapur, notably Qushayrfs (d. 465/1072) K. al-Mi'rāj (Chapter Seven). The final two chapters are dedicated to the origins (Chapter Eight) and reception (Chap- ter Nine) of the longer version of the Ibn 'Abbās narrative associated with the little known, if not legendary, figure Abū 1-Hasan Bakrx. In these final two chapters Colby provides four detailed tables. Particularly illustrative is the first table (pp. 138-41), which presents the physical composition, the name, and the prophet/ angel of each of the seven heavens that Muhammad visits, according to nine different Ibn 'Abbās texts on the mi'rāj. Finally Colby includes a critical translation of the primitive version (Appendix A) and the Bakrī version (Appendix B) of the Ibn 'Abbās isrā'/mi'rāj narrative. Ultimately, Colby emphasizes the manner in which Muslim scholars use the isrā'/mi'rāj tradition for the sake of religious exhortation or sectar- ian/doctrinal controversy. In the chapter on the canonical narrative the reader discovers that Jerusalem has no place in three out of four extended sound hadīth on the isrā'/mi'rāj, hadīth shaped instead around the divine imposition of ritual prayer (which, Colby proposes, is the original focus of the tradition). Other hadīth, however, have Muhammad travel not only to Jerusalem but also to Medina, Mt. Sinai, and Bethlehem along the way (e.g. in Nasā'ī's collection), or describe how the Prophet is tempted to turn away from his itinerary to Jerusalem by a Jewish and a Christian voice (e.g. in Ibn Hishām and Tabari). Such features become still more fantastic in the Ibn 'Abbās narrative. Here the Prophet's ascension is connected (for the sake of parenesis) not only to the imposition of ritual prayer, but also of the jihād (the Prophet sees a bloody sword next to the divine throne, p. 143), and of the fast (originally set at six months, p. 144). Here the angels in heaven, and God Himself, recognize Muhammad as the seal of the Prophets. In the light of Colby's illuminating analysis, however, these features do not make the Ibn 'Abbās narrative a corruption of an originally pristine tradi- tion, but rather the continued development of a useful religious trope. ^ Gabriel Said Reynolds University of Notre Dame 76</page></plain_text>
