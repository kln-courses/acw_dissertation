<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oscar Bluemner's Late Landscapes: "'The Musical Color of Fateful Experience" By Jeffrey R. Hayes Oscar Bluemner's art and ideas are not well known, and the few indi- viduals who have studied his work have varied widely in their estimates of it. He has been called both "a radical painter"' and "a middle-of-the-roader."2 Scholars have found him "dependent upon ... Cubism and Fauvism"3 as well as "uniquely American in his personal combination of expressionist color with symbolic realism."4 Critics have de- scribed him as an artist out of place ("in all probability [he belonged] in the ranks of the pre-Nazi German mod- erns")5 and out of time ("a pioneer striving to look beyond the veil ... and see in the distance a future more stable than his own").6 The art-world figure closest to him at the end of his life would say only that "he was a man of great passion for paint, a person of intellect and purpose who was sure that in time he would be rediscovered."7 Such rediscovery calls for full knowl- edge of an artist, yet Bluemner's unset- tled reputation rests less on his mature paintings than on his initial efforts made shortly after he quit architecture and allied himself with Alfred Stieglitz's progressive "291" gallery.8 Stieglitz photographed Bluemner (Fig. 1), pub- lished his writings in Camera Work, and gave him his first American one-man show in November 1915.9 Like other early paintings from that exhibition, An Expression of a Silktown (Fig. 2) shows mixed motives and ancestry. Geometric patterning arrests play between bright subjective colors. Bold surface contours resist the pull of conventional perspec- tive lines. Still forms and high finish contradict the volatile reality of then strike-plagued Paterson, New Jersey. Such multivalence suggests an artist still in search of his own identity after working with oils for only a few years. Shortly after his New York exhibition closed, Bluemner himself confessed: "There is too much in the pictures ... too much effect and too much idea ... too little oneness of idea and repose."'' Bluemner dedicated the remainder of his career to resolving these problems and developing a distinctive mode of landscape that fused the musical, psy- chological, and symbolic properties of color. In September 1916, he abruptly left New York for the relative isolation of northern New Jersey." Despite the stimulation and support provided by "291," he recognized a more urgent need for sustained contact with the envi- ronment that inspired him: "I prefer the intimate landscape ... where town and country mingle, for we are in the habit of carrying into them our feelings of pain and pleasure, our moods."'2 Bluemner's decade in New Jersey was marked by professional obscurity and extreme poverty-precious frames sometimes fed the furnace to keep his family warm." He had few shows and could seldom afford canvas, but his numerous small watercolors and draw- ings evidence progress. Bloomfield (Fig. 3) shows Bluemner trusting his own instincts, no longer bound by precon- ceived standards of style or design. The charcoal's subtle inflection and loose weave across the warm paper relay his pleasure in contemplating nightfall and the greater mystery of time's dialogue with nature. The impression of canal, trees, sky-a sun or moon?-is at once immediate and unified, and dispels the boundaries between what is seen and what is felt. Ithough Bluemner initiated very few new oils while in New Jersey, he began a strenuous program of study and self-criticism, which developed into a personal theory of art that would guide him during his final and most prolific decade of painting. His investigation included scraping and reworking many earlier pictures and comparing his efforts with those of recognized innova- tors. At the 1917 Society of Independent Artists exhibition, he noted that Matisse "paints essentially" and was impressed with Vlaminck's "attempt to simplify WN M .... .. t Fig. 1 Alfred Stieglitz, Oscar Bluemner, c. 1915, platinum print photograph mounted on paperboard, c.10/8 x 8".

Art is man's divine instinct for creation."'6 That outlook was reinforced by his close friend and second dealer, Stephan Bourgeois, who denounced naturalism as an unfortunate by-product of Western materialism and called for a rebirth of the "inner vision" characteristic "of the East and our own old masters.""7 Bourgeois's practice of alternating shows of American and European modernism with exhibitions of Sung dynasty landscape, Buddhist sculpture, and Japanese prints height- ened Bluemner's resolve to cultivate the metaphysical dimension of his own art: The Chinese and Japanese were always truer artists than the West- erners, since they do not imitate the accidental, tangible real- ity.... Painting is flat. Vision ignores the realistic material but emphasizes the spiritual emotion- al; since vision corresponds to our state of soul.'8 Moreover, Bluemner's interest in Chi- nese aesthetics-particularly the writ- ings of the Northern Sung painter Kuo Hsi9-strengthened his own thesis that equivalents exist between landscape ele- ments and various states of human emo- tion: "I am able to let the simple objects of a scene, a house, a tree, a sky ... be my actors ... and use shapes resembling theirs to correspond to the respective tones of my imagination."20 His increas- ingly abstract, anthropomorphic vision of nature found further support in French Symbolist theory. "Denis: Ptg is flat,' " he wrote, "paint converted into ... symbols or aesthetic &amp; decorative expression-equivalents for an emotional state.""21 Bluemner and Bourgeois were also bound by a deep appreciation of music, which, like the Symbolists, they asso- ciated with painting through the me- dium of color. "Music," Bluemner recalled Bourgeois saying, "is space dynamics ... tone like color is an expression of fundamental force."22 Chromatics had long interested Bluemner, whose familiarity with the theories of M.E. Chevreul, Ogden Rood, and Wilhelm von Bezold shaped his early understanding of color harmony and structure.23 In 1917, he began a critique of Paul Signac's treatise D'Eugene Delacroix au nbo-Impres- sionisme. "Signac is an investigator of color as the effect of sunlight," Bluemner concluded, "[his art] does not correspond to the art of the Idealist, who seeks expression of inner motive ... spiritual color unbridled by reality."24 A year later, he studied Stanton Macdon- ald-Wright's controversial Synchromist paintings at the Charles Daniel Gallery. He noted that "neither intelligence nor feeling is conveyed by any and all colors. He is undoubtedly a painter in a techni- cal, aesthetic, and formal sense, but he fails of the deeper power."'25 Bluemner told Bourgeois that he preferred Goethe's psychological response to colors, which "stand for primary emo- tions or states of feeling."26 Like Goethe, he found red the most potent color, calling it "the signal, the warning, the symbol of power, vitality, energy, life." Violet had more ethereal properties including "distinction... rarity, un- rest."27 A chart composed in 1925 shows the varied moods and conditions that Bluemner had begun to ascribe to par- ticular colors: Blue: Yearning Sky Sea Green: Plants Soaring Winter 1984 353</page><page sequence="3">Yellow: Sunlight, Warmth, Front, Day Deep Orange-Brown: Melancho- ly, Mystic, Evening, Depth Red: Fire, Excitation; House = Man; Desire, Rage Violet: Solemn Mystic Black: Night, Death, Malice, Shadow, Cavity, Sleep White: Snow, Cold, Depth... Se- riousness.28 Bluemner's watercolor Death (Fig. 4) was completed on the eve of his move from New Jersey to South Braintree, Massachusetts, in May 1926. He was financially drained and had not had a show in eighteen months. As his circum- stances worsened, he had characteristi- cally taken refuge in metaphysics. He turned first to Schopenhauer, whose antimaterialist philosophy and moorings in Oriental mysticism reinforced his own ideals. In seeking the "essence" of a thing, Bluemner noted after reading The World as Will and Idea, "its appearance [is] only its shadow (flat figure) or symbol (color). The idea, will or soul [is] not representable by means of transient features." Bluemner also may have known Schopenhauer's early essay On Vision and Color in support of Goethe, for he concluded his notes with the observation that color is "spiritual excitation ... color of thing is thing + spiritual response."29 Next, he im- mersed himself in Oswald Spengler's recent Untergang des Abendlandes (1918), a pessimistic theory of history that held that Western civilization had passed from a period of high creative achievement into a digressive stage of materialism. Spengler's ranking of spiri- tual knowledge above scientific knowl- edge and Late Gothic art above Renais- sance naturalism authenticated Bluemner's own emphasis on "the musi- cal color of fateful experience."o0 That sense of fate is apparent in Death, which encapsulates most of the ideas that he had developed over the past decade. Conceived in solemn memory of his wife Lina, whose death in March seemed predetermined by their constant indi- gence, this landscape lacks the detail and formality of Bluemner's pre-World War I subjects. Its spare, nonspecific sense of location reduces nature to a symbol of his innermost thoughts and feelings: "Mother's death hours, her emaciated figure, walk and last move- ments of arms &amp; hands ... Apple Tree."31 This denuded tree, limbs devoid of vital green and unprotected by Bluemner's customary red architecture, bows before the saw-toothed clouds of an approaching storm.

B luemner's final years in Massachu- setts were his most productive, despite the fact that histories acknowl- edge only his early contributions to American modernism. As he ap- proached his sixtieth birthday, he grew more determined to realize his theories in his art. "From such thought," he wrote, "[I get] the only worthwhile defi- nite idea of shaping the imagination into paintings."32 Each new painting, in turn, brought his principal aims and ideas more clearly into focus, and his con- tinuing experiments with materials, especially casein, gave permanence to his color. Three major one-man shows during this period also earned him long- awaited critical recognition. Despite declining health and continued financial problems aggravated by the Depression, his marriage of mind and eye endured to produce his most powerful testimony as an artist. Once settled in South Braintree, Bluemner wrote Stieglitz, who had agreed again to represent him in New York: "If I had a vision 40 years ago that I should sit in this very corner of the world, more alone with myself... than the man in the moon! Hence I am paint- ing rooms; lunatica.""33 Bluemner was referring to a series of eighteen large watercolors that he subsequently exhib- ited as "Suns, Moons, Etc.-Facts and Fancy-Strains Or Moods" at Stieg- litz's Intimate Gallery in February- March 1928. Each composition centers around a great orb that hovers just above the horizon and barely touches houses, trees, and other earthbound fix- tures. The vermilion ?un ball in Eye of Fate (Fig. 5) floats among gabled build- ings whose dusky green walls draw the heat of the sky through their eyelike windows. On the left, a utility pole- often equated to a crucifix by the art- ist34-snakes upward through the fore- most building until its arm makes contact with the fiery halo. These com- plements and contrasts have cosmic overtones and coincide with Bluemner's interest in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, who held that ultimate reality is unknowable and that our only certain- ties lie in reflections of that reality. 354 Art Journal</page><page sequence="4">"Ultimately," Bluemner countered, "the painter feels the unknown Abso- lute."'35 That promise of revelation seems borne by the mysterious, em- bryonic image that crosses his sun ball. Bluemner's qualified acceptance of Spencer's evolutionary thesis that all things pass from incoherent homogene- ity to coherent heterogeneity is felt in the discrete but interdependent flow of forms in Eye of Fate, but the bold harmonic color and symbolic commu- nion between man-made and celestial elements suggest a final unity that rebuts Spencer's dire materialist predic- tion: "Have we thus to contemplate as the outcome of things a boundless space holding here and there extinct suns, fated to remain forever without further change?"36 Sun Storm (Fig. 6), another key watercolor within the series, affirms Bluemner's Goethean conviction that the powers of music and painting were closely associated: My idea fully established: colors, like music, can excite moods and express their emotions, are psychic agents or stimuli .... Pigment is like key on piano, tone tension of light is like octaves, texture is like character of a musical instrument, construction of form free and imaginative is like musical compo- sition.37 Bluemner compared his musical sense of painting to that of Albert Pinkham Ry- der,38 whose moonlit vistas and sugges- tively twisting skies anticipated his own romantic vision of the landscape. Subti- tles such as "Sonata" and "Rhythm" accompany many of Bluemner's water- colors. "Beethoven" serves this function for Sun Storm.39 Although Bluemner made no direct connection between this painting and any particular piece by his favorite composer, analogies of a gen- eral sort are apparent. Both Bluemner and Beethoven cherished the ideal of a just and ordered world in which individ- ual liberties would also be allowed to flourish. Their work thus shares great expressive freedom held within embrac- ing universal structures. The pro- gression of forms and colors in Sun Storm-from dark writhing foreground to deep rose sun ball to centered yellow aura to distant space, dark again but approaching calm-bears broad rela- tion to the surging character, expansion, and ultimate reconciliation of opposites evoked by Beethoven's Eroica. Bluemner's suns and moons also showed that, despite his remove, affini- ties with other Stieglitz artists remained strong.

Sur- face-modelling now emulates vital pro- cesses, expresses biological emotion."40 O'Keeffe also shared Bluemner's fasci- nation with distant spheres. Like Sun Storm, her Red Hills and Sun, Lake George (Fig. 7) is insistently frontal, centripetal in rhythm, and colored as much by the inner as the outer eye. The space in both paintings, unpeopled and immeasurable, approaches abstraction while evoking sublimity. Arthur Dove, another Stieglitz regular who would soon initiate a series of his own suns and moons, joined Bluemner for a look at his Intimate Gallery show and later sent an appreciation: "Being rather inarticulate about your paintings the other day, I would like to add something. The 'Red Moon' I liked. It burns harder than fire. I like that sort of heat.... The things are fine, way back and way on in music and in wisdom."41 ncouraged by the critics' response to his show-Edward Allen Jewell saw "a lyric passion ... an inner fire ... that may carry him very much fur- ther"42-Bluemner began another series of paintings, which he exhibited at the Whitney Studio Galleries in November 1929. Remarkably consistent in theme and technique, this group of twenty small oils remains among Bluemner's most original and telling accomplish- ments. Each arose from a full-size char- coal drawing that was carefully trans- ferred to his ground by retracing it with pencil over carbon paper. The ground itself consisted of a sheet of lead-primed academy board cemented to a three-ply fir panel. Razors and sandpaper were used to smooth the surface to a very hard, white finish. Full underpainting was followed by successive layers of color, each precoated with poppy oil and allowed to dry for several days. Only "steel proof colors (no cadms, cobalt viol, neapol yello)" and sable or soft bristle brushes were employed, and the razor was often retrieved and sections scraped and rebuilt before applying the final varnishes.43 The panels each took three to six months to complete, but their color-rich, crystalline surfaces mir- rored Bluemner's "dreams of Byzan- tium" and confirmed his abiding belief Winter 1984 355</page><page sequence="5">&amp; I M Ml &gt;1?_-?:\;: \\\ Fig. 8.

The always critical artist saw most contem- porary painters divided into opposing camps of unthinking illustrators and unintelligible abstractionists, both lack- ing the vital core of "IMAGINA- TION," which he defined as: The fundamental force of thought ... [in which] all forms of nature and human life, all ideas, religious and philosophic, all our moods and desires, originate.... Without imagination, painting fails of its greatest power and beauty: IN- TENSITY-the maximum inner tension of divergent experiences, emotions, conflicting moods as expressed by dramatic contrast of color and tone and lines.45 Bluemner felt that the truly modern artist must "see nature properly, that is emotionally [because] Man to-day is primarily more than ever interested in life and himself, in the complexes and possibilities of his ego."46 Bluemner regarded the Whitney panels as "psy- chological landscapes," an idea that he had fostered for years but could not develop fully until he settled in Massa- chusetts. During his first month there, he embellished his diary with a number of trial sketches that cast landscape ele- ments as "actors" personifying human experience.47 Most often, the house appeared as the masculine "I," while trees played the feminine "other." Joined by space ("sptm"), this ensemble formed an "outward symbol of hidden ideas, forces, and ... our physical rela- tion to them ... the Ego and the Alter-the Duality in ourselves as well as in Nature."48 The force that duality exerted over Bluemner's imagination is apparent in A Moon-Night Mood (Fig. 8). Dramatic contrast and conflicting emotion fill this small radiant panel. At the center, a vermilion building-"the healthy ego is red"49--with windowed eyes and caver- nous mouth recoils at the prospect of a willowy intruder. Her icy blue figure counterpoints his ardor much as the spill of frozen moonlight punctuates his memory of a warm summer night. Whether she is his now-lost bride or, more generally, an encroaching "female outlook," the event is highly symbolic and undoubtedly personal. "To render a scene as if it were a person ... its eyes and bearing," Bluemner wrote, "since all such turns [into] ego, landscape painting is semi self portraiture."50 The mood changes but the idea endures in June Night. Backyard (Fig. 9), which Bluemner also called "Red Love Night.""5 Interaction supplants opposi- tion in this "human altera stage scene" as a "womanlike tree" dances before and upon the "slab red phallus shape" of a solitary building.52 The image is at once personal-the apple tree of Death transfigured into a vital celebrant-and universal, an enchanted symbol of nature's most basic, life-sustaining drives. Although sometimes compared to the works of Charles Burchfield, whose anthropomorphic houses and trees imply a pantheistic outlook, Bluemner's translations of the landscape were decidedly more synthetic and introspective. Analogy best served to describe his creative method and the imagery it engendered: Take a steel bar; it is hard, rigid, cold fact, Reality. If you heat it, it glows red, and now you can bend it and twist it any way. Let intense emotion fire your imagination or memory of scenes (we live with), and the color of things or of night 356 Art Journal</page><page sequence="6">BE R: Z :.::..:_ we: x . . . . . . . ...::_: : : ::: : :: : : y:: :: : :: ::~ Fig. 10 Oscar Bluemner, Dawn.

His memory of a morning spent long ago at Silver Lake, New Jersey, inspired Dawn. A Canal, transition from dream- ing to awakening (Fig. 10).55 The paint- ing's gently layered forms and muted colors reflect the meditative character of that experience. Its title alludes to the mysterious boundary between subcon- sciousness and self-consciousness, where experiences can lose their conventional significance, and by free association take on startling new meaning. Bluemner appears to mark that boun- dary at the juncture of a tall terra-cotta chimney and a recumbent terrain-fig- ure, whose blue-black contours extend into the house at right and signify cos- mic yearning and infinitude. Unlike his other panels, a quiet inner tension pre- vails owing partly to the offsetting hori- zontal and vertical forms and partly to the coupled values attached to almost everything: phallus-chimney, woman- scape, head-house, knees-mountains. More important, Dawn transcends the characteristic male-female polarity of his other "psychological landscapes" by presenting just one sexually unified fig- ure. Bluemner described this painting as a "consciously concerned Freudian idea";56 perhaps Freud's view that dream mechanisms could condense or displace one subject into another gave Bluemner the authority he needed to synthesize genders and thus envision the ideal of their joint sensibilities.57 On the other hand, the "red ego" in Dawn remains at center stage and somewhat apart. It rises above the slumbering "al- tera" in quest of the blue-black sky's expanse of energy. With Freud again in mind, the painting invites another, more general reading: the artist's desire to overcome social restraints and regain long-lost powers and instincts. Although reviews of the Whitney Studio show were good and impor- tant sales were made to Mrs. Whitne and her associate Juliana Force, Bluemner did not have another major exhibition for five years. In early 1930, his attention again turned to technical matters. His experiments with water- color led to the development of a unique casein-based formula that he felt strengthened the medium without sacri- ficing its "spirit" of immediacy and translucence. As a colorist, he worried about fading pigments, and like Burch- field, he wanted his watercolors to carry the deeper intonations and textures usually associated with oil painting. The recipe that he established called for heavy board-mounted paper and solid gouache underpainting, followed by many thin glazes of color fortified with a 16 to 17 percent casein additive. Each layer was sealed with formaldehyde and allowed to dry separately. The finished painting was then heavily varnished and secured within an airtight, custom frame.59 He once compared his methods with those of a fellow Stieglitz associate, John Marin: "I do not paint watercolors in the present sense. [He] floats them on with buckets of water ... I hammer the colors forcefully together."60 The firmly wrought "color shapes" of A Light- Yellow (Fig. 11) owe their resonance to Bluemner's "tone-building" strategy, which he likened to "musical structure and orchestration."61 The entire paint- ing seems lit from within, an effect that suits a subject steeped in longing and nostalgia. At the center, Parillo's Tav- ern-once Bluemner's favorite Bloom- field haunt-glows like sulfur in the night.62 In the foreground, a solitary Winter 1984 357</page><page sequence="7"> . ........... ...... : iv ... . ......................il?.. .... . ... ..................iiiiiiii mS Fig. 12 Oscar Bluemner, Radiant Night, 1933, oil on canvas, 34 x 47".

In the spring of 1932, Bluemner began work on a group of large oils, which, with many of his caseins, would form his final one-man show at the Marie Harriman Gallery three years later. To support his project during those Depression years, he applied for a Guggenheim fellowship. Although not accepted, the sixty-five-year-old artist's proposal made clear that these "new possibilities for landscape painting" were foreseen as the culmination of his career: For forty years, I have made a constant ... complete study of the history, literature, and scope of color, of its theories, materials and applications.... In painting, I came to consider mere naturalistic color not to be real art, but insig- nificant and illustration. More recently, I inquired thoroughly into the psychology of color, and into its musical value.... Early this year, I thought out and sys- tematically tabulated a great number of new and radical con- ceptions-sketches and layouts- going by imagination. From these I want to paint a series of unusual "color themes"-inlandscape form.... A new thing does not drop from the sky, but grows from the soil of the past and takes a lifetime to establish.63 Radiant Night (Fig. 12) evolved from a small charcoal drawing made a dozen years earlier.64 Bluemner struggled intermittently for more than a year to translate its monochrome, documentary features into a "color theme" possessing musical and emotional value. His efforts ranged from slight adjustments in the large tree at left so that it might trans- mit an "awareness" of the house, to painting "in reverse positione" (upside down) in order to obviate descriptive detail and establish an "octave of major tones" that moved from pure whites in the foreground to a midrange of reds and blues and closed with the full black auras around the house and trees. Bluemner also introduced transitional halftones but only after defining the "largest mass tones . . . according to scale.'65 He related his color structure to the harmonics of Franz Schubert, whose appreciation for Goethe and cor- relations of music, poetry, and art bore comparison to his own. Indeed, Schu- bert's lieder are highly textured expres- sions that invite visual participation- his Nachthelle evokes an atmosphere of rapture and magic akin to that of Radiant Night. Bluemner made it clear that his tone spectrum had far more than formal significance: "The heavy black outlines to house &amp; tree &amp; rock mean night.., similarly the white, pure, as snow ... the sky as red glow from street light in distance means Town, Life." He also noted more specific analogies "inlandscape form"-the "claws" of the foliage, the "eyes" of the house, its "madonna" hair, the "red hand rising" behind it, and the "cat" within the rocks on the far right.66 Although the full and exact meaning of Radiant Night remains uncertain, its enigmatic forms, passionate color, and toiling space unfold as the very embodi- ment of Bluemner's romantic tempera- ment. Blue Above (Fig. 13), one of the last and largest of Bluemner's oils, is less difficult to interpret and more firmly defines his mature ideals. It arose from one of sixteen watercolor studies described as "free motives of Vermilion and Blue [in which] the Idea of Color and Action is parallel to the music of Prokofiev, Scriabin, and R. Strauss.""67 Subtitled "I am I have (3 Notes Ego Theme Scriabin),"68 the canvas alludes to the faith shared by painter and com- poser in the human spirit's evolution from self-division to oneness with the universe, which Scriabin called "the divine Ego." Bluemner's three notes of color-blue sky, red building, green vegetation-symbolize the psychic con- ditions and principal stages of that dra- matic passage: The very bluest sky as fate ... Unego. The reddest glow ... most oppo- site to symbol blue. Maximum human life ... vigor assertion affirmation sharp against empty blue space. The wall ... Ego. The earth the womb of all ... Altera cum Ego. Altera non Ego. Green, not red, vita terrae ... undulating body not straight hard mind figure.69 Poetic reduction and symphonic ex- pansion coincide in Blue Above, which centers on Bluemner's familiar vermil- ion building. Although beckoned by a chorus of mortal green trees, this "ham- mered slab" of red turns instead to face the blue "crystal of the Ancients ... the deep, awing, tall, luminous" sky.70 Scholars have linked his prismatic effects and clean planes to Precisionist painting of the period,71 but Bluemner's symbolic and mystical vision bears only superficial relation to that style. Charles Sheeler's American Landscape (Fig. 14) applauds industrial power with a sharp literal focus indebted to photogra- phy. Blue Above, in contrast, honors inner will and spirit with musical color bred by the imagination. It compares most tellingly with his own late Self- Portrait (Fig. 15), which Bluemner con- ceived as "a scene,"72" reversing his ear- lier prescription "to render a scene as if it were a person [since] landscape paint- ing is semi self portraiture." Although both paintings survey psychic terrain, Blue Above suggests a universal condi- tion whereas the slightly later Self- Portrait specifies a more personal one. 358 Art Journal</page><page sequence="8">...... .. ...iii i i : :  i:; i- ii~ ::i:i _:_- ii N  I '   t Fig. 13 Oscar Bluemner, Blue Above, 1933, oil on canvas, 51 x 36". Milton, Mass., Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Jason Bloom. The greens of earth no longer court the artist, whose "buddha head"73 is framed by an autographic red column penetrat- ing the blue firmament. Finally at one with "the musical color of fateful expe- rience," his Ego passes into nirvanic Unego.74 During his last decade, Bluemner put his long-nurtured theories into practice. He produced a distinctive body of care- fully crafted paintings whose semiab- stract form, emotive color, and complex symbolism defied Regionalist fashion much as they continue to defy simple categorization. He signed the later ones "FLORIANUS"-a more eternal, Lat- inized variation on his own surname. After his successful final show at the Marie Harriman Gallery in January 1935, serious eye and heart disease made work increasingly difficult. His suicide three years later was prefigured in a short poem written much earlier when painting well had seemed equally impossible: Art is the final form of Life the artist is the highest and last worker Art is like life &amp; death, when spirit becomes sensual matter when matter reverts to spirit.75 Notes 1 Ruth Lawrence, "Foreword," Oscar Florianus Bluemner, exh. cat., The University Gallery, University of Minnesota, 1939, unpaginated. 2 Abraham Davidson, Early American Moder- nist Painting, 1910-1935, New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1981, p. 41. 3 William Innes Homer, Alfred Stieglitz and the American Avant-Garde, Boston, New York Graphic Society, 1977, p. 304. 4 Clemency Coggins, Martha Holsclaw, and Martha Hoppin, Oscar Bluemner: American Colorist, exh. cat., Cambridge, Mass., Fogg Art Museum, 1967, unpaginated. 5 Paul Rosenfeld, "The Vermilionaire," Univer- sity Review, Summer 1939, p. 250. 6 Stephan Bourgeois, "Foreword," Oscar F.

He worked as a designer-draftsman in Chicago and New York for the next twenty years. He began to paint seriously in 1911 and, during a tour of Europe the following year, held his first exhibition at the Galerie Fritz Gurlitt, Berlin. His most important article for Camera Work, "Audiator et Altera Pars: Some Plain Sense on the Modern Art Movement," was published in June 1913.

When the collectors came for the rent, Bluemner would go to the other side of the house and the collector couldn't collect from him .... The children of the locality would throw vegetables at him when he went out on the street. When I said that seemed odd-he said, 'You were never that poor.'
