<plain_text><page sequence="1">Instructions to Authors SUBJECT MATTER The pages of Ecology and Ecological Monographs are open to research and discussion papers that develop or test ecological theory with data from field and lab- oratory experiments, observations, or simulations. New methodologies with a potential for broad use in ecology are also of interest. Papers that are well grounded in ecological theory and that have broad implications for environmental policy or resource management are wel- come in Ecological Applications as well as in Ecology or Ecological Monographs. Each paper should report original research or a re- analysis of published research that results in new in- sights. Treatment of the research topic should lead to generalizations that are potentially applicable to other species, populations, communities, or ecosystems. SCOPE We invite contributions from scientists working on the full spectrum of ecological problems. Included within this spectrum are studies of the physiological responses of individual organisms to their abiotic and biotic environments, ecological genetics and evolution, the structure and dynamics of populations, interactions among individuals of the same or differing species, the behavior of individuals and groups of organisms, the organization of biological communities, landscape ecology, the processing of energy and matter in eco- systems, historical ecology and paleoecology, and the application of ecological theory to resource manage- ment and the solution of environmental problems. Re- ports of ecological research on all kinds of organisms in all environments are welcome. LENGTH Ecology considers papers that will occupy up to 20 printed pages, including illustrations. Notes, Com- ments, and Replies to Comments may not exceed 4 printed pages. Ecological Monographs handles papers that will be longer than 20 printed pages. Assignment of an accepted paper to Ecology or Ecological Mono- graphs will depend primarily on the length of the paper after it is set in type. Three pages of typescript equal approximately one printed page. Ecological Applica- tions considers papers of any length. Illustrations and tabular material together may constitute up to 20% of the total printed length of the article without extra cost to the author. SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS Manuscripts should be submitted to the Managing Editor, Lee N. Miller, Ecological Society of America, 328 E. State Street, Ithaca, New York 14850-4318. Submit four photocopies of the manuscript; retain the original. Do not submit originals or photographic prints of illustrations; photocopies are preferred until the manuscript has been accepted by the subject-matter editor and edited by a technical editor. Include your address and telephone and FAX numbers in your cover letter. An author who moves from the address shown on the manuscript should provide a forwarding ad- dress. At the time of submission authors should provide information describing the extent to which data or text in the manuscript have been used in other papers or books that are published, in press, submitted, or soon to be submitted elewhere. Authors should adhere to the ESA Code of Ethics, which was adopted by the Society in August 1990. The Code, printed in the Bulletin of the Ecological Society ofAmerica, Volume 71(4), December 1990, deals with authorship, plagiarism, fraud, authorized use of data, copyrights, errors, confidentiality, intellectual proper- ty, attribution, willful delay of publication, and con- flicts of interest, as well as other matters that are not specific to the publication process. PEER REVIEW PROCESS Authors will be notified of receipt of the manuscript. A designated subject-matter editor will be responsible for review and acceptance or rejection of the manu- script. Technical correspondence concerning the manuscript may be directed to that editor. The Man- aging Editor or the subject-matter editor will make an initial appraisal of the manuscript. If the topic and treatment seem appropriate for the journal, the manu- script will then be reviewed by others with expertise in the subject. A decision on the manuscript may gen- erally be expected within 3-4 months of submission; delays in obtaining reviews may prolong this period. If a manuscript is returned for revision, the author should submit a revised manuscript directly to the sub- ject-matter editor within 4 months. Manuscripts un- dergoing revision for longer than 4 months may (at the editor's discretion) be considered as new submissions. Only -35% of the manuscripts received can be ac- cepted for publication. PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS Write with precision, clarity, and economy; use the active voice and first person whenever appropriate. Use American spellings (e.g., behavior, not behaviour). The CBE Style Manual, Fifth Edition, is recommend- ed for details of style. It is available in most university or research libraries, or it can be purchased for $27.95 from the Council of Biology Editors, 111 E. Wacker Drive, Suite 200, Chicago, IL 60601-4298 USA. SPACING, MARGINS, FONTS Double-space all material (text, quotations, figure legends, tables, literature cited, etc.) at three lines per inch (12 lines/i 0 cm). Number the lines of text if a line-numbering option is available in your word pro- cessing program. Type on only one side of standard- sized paper, approximately 22 x 28 cm. Leave 2.5-cm margins on all sides of each page. Do not use very thin paper, even when overseas mailing is required. Use a</page><page sequence="2">12-point font (proportionally spaced type) or 10 char- acters/inch (4 characters/cm) if the letter spacing is uniform. UNDERLINING Underlining indicates italicization. Please underline scientific names and the symbols for all variables and constants except Greek letters. Symbols should be italic in the illustrations to match the text. Italics should rarely be used for emphasis. EQUATIONS; STATISTICS Equations to be set separately from the text will be broken into two or more lines if they exceed the width of one column; mark equations for appropriate breaks. Subscripts and superscripts should be clarified by mar- ginal notes. State probability values without leading zeroes (e.g., P &lt; .01). FOOTNOTES Avoid footnotes; most footnote material can be in- corporated in the text to the benefit of readers, editors, and printers. UNITS Use the International System of Units (SI) for mea- surements. Consult Standard Practice for Use of the International System of Units (ASTM Standard E-3 80- 92) for guidance on unit conversions, style, and usage. (The Standard can be purchased for $23.00 from ASTM, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA.) When preparing text and figures note in particular that (1) SI requires the use of the terms mass or force rather than weight, (2) when one unit appears in a denominator, use the solidus (e.g., g/m2); for two or more units in a denominator, use negative exponents (e.g., g-m-2 d-'), and (3) you should use the international spelling of metre and litre, and a capital L as the symbol for litre. IDENTIFYING THE OBJECT OF STUDY Early in the manuscript, identify the type(s) of or- ganism or ecosystem you studied; e.g., "a small decid- uous tree," "the ground squirrel Spermophilus later- alis," "a bivalve of brackish water." Avoid descriptive terms that may be familiar only to specialists. Provide the scientific names of all organisms. Common names may be used when convenient after stating the scientific names. TITLE PAGE Running Head. -A running head not longer than 40 letters and spaces should be provided at the top of the title page. Title. -The title should tell what the article is about. It should be informative and short-the maximum length is 13 words or 100 characters; longer titles will be shortened by the editor. Do not include the authority for taxonomic names in the title or in the abstract. Titles may not include numerical series designations. List of Authors. -For each author, state the relevant address-usually the institutional affiliation of the au- thor during the period when all or most of the research was done. The author's present address, if different from this, should appear as a footnote at the bottom of the title page. ABSTRACT, KEY PHRASES, AND KEY WORDS An abstract, key phrases, and key words should be provided for all articles, including Notes, Comments, and Special Features. They are needed for the annual index, whether they appear in the published article or not. Abstract. -The Abstract should provide a brief sum- mary of the research, including the purpose, methods, results, and major conclusions. Avoid speculation in the abstract; if included, speculation about possible interpretations or applications of your results should play a minor role. Do not include any literature cita- tions in the abstract. Key Phrases and Key Words.-Following the ab- stract, list key words and 8-10 key phrases for the annual index. Extract key phrases from topic sentences that tell the main conclusions or "take-home lessons" of your article. Each key phrase should describe a re- lationship or fact. Example: TOPIC SENTENCE: Polli- nation in a sexually dimorphic species was affected by petal length, nectar, sexual type (hermaphrodite or fe- male), and pollinator visitation rates. KEY PHRASES: Floral characteristics of hermaphrodites vs. females; Pollinator visitation rates vs. flower type; Sexual di- morphism of flowers: effects on pollination. KEY woRDs: nectar; petal length. The key words should supplement but not duplicate the key phrases. Words from the title of the article may be included in the key words. Each key word or key phrase should be useful as an entry point for a literature search. Key words and key phrases will be listed to- gether in a single annual index; any key word that duplicates the initial word of a key phrase will be de- leted. Topic sentences are used only for creating the key phrases; they need not be listed with the key phras- es. BODY OF THE ARTICLE Organize your article in sections labelled Introduc- tion, Methods, Results, and Discussion. In long articles you may need to add a section of Conclusions. Brief articles usually do not require a label for the Introduc- tion. If the nature of your research requires a different organization, specify the level of each section heading (1st order head, 2nd order head, etc.) in the margin. The motivation or purpose of your research should appear in the introduction, where you state the ques- tions you sought to answer. In the Methods section you should provide sufficient information to allow some- one to repeat your work. A clear description of your experimental design, sampling procedures, and statis- tical procedures is especially important in papers de- scribing field studies, simulations, or experiments. If you list a product (e.g., animal food, analytical device), supply the name and location of the manufacturer. Give the model number for equipment used. Supply complete citations, including author (or editor), title, year, publisher, and version number, for computer</page><page sequence="3">software mentioned in your article. Results should be stated concisely and without interpretation. In the Dis- cussion section, carefully differentiate the results of your study from data obtained from other sources. Distin- guish factual results from speculation and interpreta- tion. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Acknowledgments or dedications should be placed under an Acknowledgments heading just before Lit- erature Cited. Do not include these on the title page. LITERATURE CITED The list of Literature Cited must be completely dou- ble spaced. Before submitting the manuscript, check each citation in the text against the Literature Cited to see that they match exactly. Delete citations from the list if they are not actually cited in the text of the article. The list should conform in sequencing and punctuation to that in recent issues of the journal. All journal titles should be spelled out completely. In the titles of arti- cles, capitalization of the common names of birds and the spelling of all words should agree exactly with that used in the original publication. Provide the publisher's name and location when you cite symposia or conference proceedings; distinguish between the conference date and the publication date if both are given. Do not list abstracts or unpublished material in the Literature Cited. They may be listed in the text as personal observations (by an author of the present paper), personal communications (from oth- ers), or unpublished x, where x = data, manuscript, or report; provide author names and initials for all un- published work and abstracts. TABLES Double space all parts of tables. Start each table on a separate page. Tables should be numbered in the order in which they are discussed in the text. Provide a short descriptive title at the top of each table; rather than simply repeating the labels on columns and rows of the table, the title should reveal the point of grouping certain data in the table. Statistical and other details should be provided as footnotes rather than appearing in the title. Do not rule tables unless essential to avoid ambiguity. Consult recent issues of the journal for style. Never repeat the same material in figures and tables; when either is equally clear, a figure is preferable. Do not include any class of information in tables that is not discussed in the text of the manuscript. ILLUSTRATIONS Each copy of the manuscript should include pho- tocopies of illustrations. Number illustrations in the order in which they are discussed in the text. Group the figure legends in numerical order on one or more pages, separate from the figures. To avoid extra expense, do not submit photographic prints until they are requested. If important details cannot be distinguished on a photocopy, submit a glossy print of that illustration for review purposes. Most illustrations will be reduced to single-column width in the journal; symbols and lettering should be clearly legible at that size. Examine each illustration for legibility after it is photo-reduced to an image width of 76 mm. After reduction, all lettering should be at least as large as the smallest type used in the journal (6 points). Uppercase letters are preferred except where SI requires lowercase letters for unit abbreviations. Avoid very large letters and lettering styles in which portions of letters are very thin. Use italic letteringfor variables, constants, and scientific names in illustra- tions to make them consistent with the text. Type- written lettering in figures is not acceptable. Solid black bars in bar graphs tend to overwhelm the adjacent text; use white, shaded, or hatched bars in preference to black ones. The editor may ask you to modify your illustrations. After the requested modifications have been made, provide either the original drawings or sharply focused photographic prints. Do not submit prints larger than 22 x 28 cm unless asked to do so. Protect the surface of any drawing that includes rub-on lettering or other attachments; include a reference photocopy of each original illustration. Identify each black-and-white fig- ure by number with a label at the top of the reverse side. Color figures should be identified with a label on the top of a photocopy; do not attach anything to the back of a color illustration. SUPPLEMENTS TO THE ARTICLE Some extensive data sets, mathematical proofs, and other information that will be of interest to a small subset of readers are too costly to publish in the jour- nals. These can be made available to readers as a sup- plementary publication on paper or computer diskette. In such cases, a footnote giving instructions for ob- taining a copy of the supplement from the author or the journal office will be printed in the article. ASSEMBLY OF MANUSCRIPT COPIES Assemble the parts of each copy of the manuscript in this order: title page, abstract, key words and phras- es, text, acknowledgments, literature cited, appendices, tables, figure legends, figures. Number all pages con- secutively. PROCESSING OF ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTS After your manuscript is accepted for publication, send the following to the Managing Editor: two copies of the manuscript on paper, one copy on diskette, the name and version of the word processing program used to prepare the diskette, and two photocopies of each illustration. Everything in the manuscript must be dou- ble-spaced (3 lines/inch), using a 12-point proportion- ally spaced font or a 10-character-per-inch uniformly spaced font. A technical editor will contact you if any questions arise during the preparation of your manu- script for typesetting, or if any changes in the figures are required. Proofs and a reprint order form will arrive in 15 weeks or less.</page><page sequence="4">Application for Membership THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA Date Name in Full Degree (highest) Mailing Address POSTAL CODE Telephone - - FAX Electronic mail address DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 1993 MEMBERSHIP DUES 1993 SUBSCRIPTION RATES FOR MEMBERS Regular Student - Regular member ....... $40.00t ECOLOGY ...................................... $50.00 $35.00 ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS .. .. $20.00 $15.00 - Student member* ...... $18.00t _ ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS .. .. $25.00 $20.00 - Emeritus member ........
