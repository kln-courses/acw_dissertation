<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOBBES' LEVIATHAN AND THE GIANTISM COMPLEX IN THE FIRST BOOK OF GULLIVER'S TRAVELS John D. Seelye, University of California, Berkeley "As we come to the level of recorded history," writes a modern his torian and economist, "we find that the great crises seem invariably to be concerned with one or other of these fundamental human vi talities?the urge to collective solidarity against the stranger and the determination to keep for one's community or for oneself the means of life."1 This statement seems a useful key to the relationships between Gulliver and the Lilliputians, for if one can see below the toyshop world occupying the surface layer of the first book of Gulliver's Travels, if one can conceive of the feud between the giant and the pygmies as expressing a basic tension between the needs of the in dividual and the demands of the state, then one can more easily examine the theoretical relevance of the first book to Swift's political thought. Gulliver's relations with the Lilliputian Empire pass through three stages, all operative within the framework of "fundamental human vitalities." The first stage presents his arrival on the island and his imprisonment by the Lilliputians; the second, his release to "liberty" and his consequent involvement in the struggle between Lilliput and Blefuscu; the third, his alienation from the Lilliputians, his sentence to blindness and starvation, and his subsequent escape from the island. These three stages correspond in turn with the following three phases of a political cycle: Individual versus State; Individual and State versus a Common Adversary; Individual versus State once again. Within all of these phases and integrally involved with their evolution are many amplifying digressions illustrative of the "human vitalities" upon which they turn. Consider, for instance, that the Emperor's council is persuaded to maintain Gulliver at great expense chiefly because of his merciful treatment of mischievous Lilliputian archers delivered to him for dis posal, while the Emperor is first turned against Gulliver by the Captain's equally goodhearted act of pleading leniency for the de feated Blefuscu Islanders. Both of these matters hinge not so much 1 Barbara Ward [Jackson], Faith and Freedom (New York, 1954), p. 7. 228</page><page sequence="2">Hobbes* "Leviathan" and First Book of {tGulliverfs Travels" 229 on the principle of humanitarianism as upon the Emperor's concern for collective security; similarly, Gulliver's reaction to the Emperor's measures reflect a regard for personal comfort and safety. In the first instance, given his life, he wants his liberty; in the second, sentenced to death, he makes good his escape. By creating this three-phased cycle, Swift has constructed an excellent machine with which to demonstrate problems of political activity in general as well as a framework upon which to place his satire on faction. For the larger issue here?one which rises head and shoulders above the duplicity and faction of the Lilliputian council? is the conflict between the integrity of the individual and the demands of the state. In many respects this is the central problem of all governmental systems, and as such often received attention from Swift, who made his opinions on the matter implicit in many of his sermons and political writings as well as explicit, for example, in his well-known Letter to Mr. Pope, published five years before the ap pearance of the Travels. Although Swift may have shared some of Hobbes' cynicism, his political opinions were practically antithetical to those of the philosopher, and in such a document as The Sentiments of a Church of England Man (1708), he attacked Hobbes outright, ac cusing him of confusing legislative power with executive or adminis trative authority and laying to this error "all the political Mistakes in his Book." Whereas Hobbes emphasized the necessity for absolutism in government, Swift maintained an allegiance to the Lockean idea of equal separation of powers,2 and while he may have agreed with Hobbes as regards the essential depravity of mankind, his solution to the problem diverged radically from that expounded by the creator of the absolutist monster, Leviathan. Either because of his sympathy with Hobbes' view of mankind, or through admiration for the other man's intricate mind and polished style, or possibly because of a desire to know well his enemy, or per haps for all of these reasons, Swift was very well versed in Hobbes' writings. In The Sentiments alluded to above, he was able to quote Hobbes slyly for the purpose of demolishing his main tenet, and in the same pamphlet he cites the philosopher's argument for absolute monarchy based on the Heavenly Kingdom, answering it briefly and devastatingly with: "All which I look upon as the strongest Argument against despotick Power that ever was offered; since no Reason can 2 See Irvin Ehrenpreis, "Swift on Liberty," Journal of the History of Ideas, xin (1952), 131-46.</page><page sequence="3">230 Seelye possibly be assigned, why it is best for the World that God Almighty hath such a Power, which doth not directly prove that no Mortal Man should ever have the like."3 A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books, and The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit are likewise seeded with references to Hobbes, in particular to his Leviathan; it is there fore no real surprise to learn that there were manuscript notes on Hobbes' great work among Swift's papers in 1742.4 And since Swift's views on government were consciously, even deliberately antithetical to those of Hobbes, it would seem likely that?as in The Sentiments above?the satirist would draw upon the philosopher elsewhere for purposes of refutation, particularly in the first book of Gulliver's Travels, which I have shown above to be largely oriented about the matter of the individual and the state. That this is true may be in dicated by the device of giantism; basic to the first book, it seems to point steadfastly in the direction of the monster, Leviathan. For as the use of giants and pygmies provides the first book of the Travels with its satiric device, so the giantism conceit running through Hobbes' book gives The Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth its metaphorical core of meaning. Again and again the author indicates correspondences between manifestations of his manmade god and aspects of human physiology and pathology. The coin of the realm is the blood of the Leviathan, the collectors of the revenue are its veins, colonies are its children.5 The Leviathan can suffer intestinal disorders and death, infirmities and defectuous procreation (III, 307-309). Not only is he prone to diseases in general (III, 310), but he is particularly susceptible to hydrophobia (Hobbesese: "tyrannophobia," or fear of being strongly governed, upon being bitten by "democratical writers"), ague (the difficulty of raising money due to the subjects' tenacious hold on their wealth), and, finally, pleurisy (the gathering together of a commonwealth's treasure into monopolies) (III, 315-20). Like any other person of the seventeenth century, the Leviathan is in constant danger of being hexed, for popularity has the effect of witchcraft upon his constitution (III, 321).

In the preface to A Tale of a Tub, Swift linked his frontispiece (a whale attacking a tub) to the Biblical Leviathan and hence to Hobbes' Commonwealth version. But as I have indicated, Hobbes' Leviathan took the shape not of a whale, but of a man, and the title page of the first edition of Hobbes' great book is a curious emblematic engraving, portraying the Leviathan staring out at the reader over a small range of hills. Only the upper part of his torso is visible, and in one hand he holds the sword of state, in the other the mace of religion. In the valley beneath the hills lies a small, walled city, complete with cathedral and fortifications, and with a little adjustment of propor tions, the emblem could easily suggest Gulliver staring out over the metropolis of Lilliput. The most curious feature of the emblem is the fact that the visible portion of the giant consists of a vast crowd of tiny people?a symbolic reference to the human composition of the Leviathan. Swift was well acquainted with this title page: he referred to it specifically in The Mechanical Operation of the Spririt, noting that "It is the Opinion of Choice Virtuosi, that the Brain is only a Crowd of little Animals, but with Teeth and Claws extremely sharp, and therefore, cling to gether in the Contexture we behold, like the Picture of Hobbes's Leviathan, or like Bees in perpendicular swarm upon a Tree, or like a Carrion corrupted into Vermin, still preserving the Shape and Figure of the Mother Animal."6 Abstracted from context, this becomes a clever satire on Hobbes' statement that the lives of warring mankind are "nasty, brutish, and short" (III, 110-16), on his theory that the purpose of government is to protect these man-beasts from their own animal passions (III, 157-58), and on his allusion to the numbering of ants and bees among "political creatures" by Aristotle (III, 156).7 Furthermore, this allegory in miniature serves to connect the emblem of the Leviathan with the symbolic presentation of Gulliver, who, when tied down by the Lilliputians, is covered with a swarm of pygmies in much the same manner as Hobbes' giant. There is an 6 A Tale of a Tub, to which is added The Battle of the Books and The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit, edited with introduction and notes by A. C. Guthkelch and D.

That an allusion by Swift to the Leviathan emblem is particularly apt in this part of Book One is indicated by the relationship estab lished at that point between the Lilliputians and Gulliver, one which corresponds with Hobbes' concept of eternal strife contingent upon mankind's "natural" state: "During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war, as is of every man, against every man" (III, 112-13). The tiny soldiers fire volleys of arrows into Gulliver, and he is several times seized with the impulse to grab "Forty or Fifty of the first that came within my Reach, and dash them against the Ground" (I:i:8),8 but is restrained by "the Smart of their Arrows upon my Face and Hands, which were all in Blisters." Despite his superior size and strength, Gulliver is held at bay at least partly by the intelligence and boldness of the Lilliputians, and im plicit in Hobbes' state of nature was the element of insecurity: "Even the strongest must fear the weakest who may at any time be able to overcome him by treachery."9 Gulliver is taken to the capital city as a prisoner, and in this condition the Captain is?by Hobbesian definition?still in a state of nature as regards his relations with the little people, "for he is still an enemy, and may save himself if he can: but he that upon promise of obedience, hath his life and liberty allowed him, is then conquered and a subject" (III, 704-705). It has already been observed that the initial phase of the political cycle in the first voyage ends and the second commences when Gulliver signs a contract with the Lilliputian Emperor. This act, as in a Hobbesian commonwealth, gives the Em peror the "right of sovereignty by victory. Which right, is acquired in the people's submission, by which they contract with the victor, promising obedience, for life and liberty'" (III, 705). Even when released, however, Gulliver's "liberty" is a restricted one at best, and the contract he signs limits it all the more. His chains struck off, he is 8 The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, ed.

These bonds, in their own nature but weak, may nevertheless be made to hold, by the danger, though not by the difficulty of breaking them" (III, 198). Thus, there is great irony in Gulliver's triumphant declaration that "my Chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at full Liberty. ... I made my Acknowledgements, by prostrating myself at his Majesty's Feet" (1:3:49). Given his "liberty," he is condemned by his monstrous bulk to move with great care through the porcelain kingdom and to suffer the further ignominy of being at the beck and call of his pygmy master. The paradoxical contrast in size between subject and emperor provides the comic and satirical elements of the episode, but there is also a serious implication in the ridiculous act of prostrate acknowl edgement performed by the giant. For the reader is often reminded, by such devices as Gulliver's impulse to annihilate "forty or fifty" Lilliputians with one swipe of his hand, and the meticulous care with which he creeps about the tiny metropolis, that the giant Englishman could have easily destroyed the little empire at any time he so desired. The climax of this ironical situation occurs when Gulliver is about to escape the island under threat of dire punishment and unjust accusa tions: "Once I was strongly bent upon Resistance: For while I had Liberty, the whole Strength of that Empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with Stones pelt the Metropolis to Pieces: But I soon rejected that Project with Horror, by remembering the Oath I had made to the Emperor, the Favours I received from him, and the high Title of Nardac he conferred upon me" (1:8:57). Like a good Hobbesian, Gulliver is held back by invisible strings of state rather than by humanitarian cords of feeling from venting his wrath on the Lilliputians: his contract, the favors of the Emperor, and his noble title ?these are the arbitrary ties that continue to bind him. "Neither had I so soon learned the Gratitude of Courtiers, to persuade myself that his Majesty's present Severities acquitted me of all past Obligations." Despite his loyalty to the Emperor, Gulliver is quick to leave Lilliput once his life is jeopardized by the ambitions of his little sovereign, and this narrative fact seems to be a satiric comment on the</page><page sequence="7">234 Seelye central paradox of Hobbes' contract theory. For Hobbes' premise that the basic impulse of mankind is self-preservation (III, 116), and his consequent theory that all men subsequently enter into a convenant with their fellows and subject themselves to an absolute sovereign in order to be protected, one from another (III, 157-58), are undercut by the fact that each individual thereby exposes life and limb to the chance impulse of his leader (II, 70). Mankind has merely moved from a state of warfare to slavery, and the factors of fear, hate, and sus picion remain tantamount. Skilled dialectician that he was, Hobbes tried to conceal this paradox as best he could (III, 127), but it re mained for some time a target for the attacks of his contemporaries, and Swift's description of the delicate balance of relationships be tween Gulliver and the Lilliputians seems also an allusion to this paradox. The Captain, having signed a contract with the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to the tiny empire, and having enlisted loyally his mighty abilities, he protests only when his humanitarian prin ciples are jolted by the sovereign's plans for conquered Blefuscu. However, it is these principles that damn him in the minds of the Lilliputians, for the impulse that caused him to spare a handful of their soldiery is wrongful when it is turned against the interest of the state and the whim of the Emperor. Gulliver is sentenced to death, as he would be in a Hobbesian commonwealth, but absolutist justice strains his allegiance too far, and he obeys his "basic impulse" for self-preservation by escaping the Hobbesian paradox. Unwilling to suffer the complete abnegation necessary to the absolutist scheme, Gulliver makes the critical discovery that his "liberty" was artificial, and that he has been held by chains none the less stringent for their invisibility. The final piece of evidence that the first book of the Travels satirizes, on one level, the doctrine of Hobbes, is concealed in the descriptions of Gulliver's captivity and his many pleas for liberty. It is strange indeed that one of the most memorable passages in the Travels?the description of Gulliver pinned to the beach and trans ported by the ingenious Lilliputians?has yet to be examined for any allegorical significance. The whole matter of his captivity is related with a remarkable attention to detail, even to the careful recording of minute tactile sensations,10 and this dwelling on minutiae should 10 Ellen Douglass Leyburn, Satiric Allegory: Mirror of Man (New Haven, 1956), pp. 76-77, sees this passage as an example of the "hyperacuteness of Swift's bodily senses,"</page><page sequence="8">Hobbes' "Leviathan" and First Book of "Gulliver's Travels" 235 warn the reader sensitive to allegorical configurations that something is afoot. The captivity incident, of course, is the high point of the toyshop sequence, and it is to be imagined that most readers have felt such a charming section to hold little else besides pure delighted in terest in the cleverness of the pygmies and the helpless confusion of the giant Englishman. But Swift never took an interest in amusement per se?"The chief end I propose to myself in all my labours is to vex the world rather than divert it"?and consequently the critical reader may feel assured that there is more in this episode than meets the en chanted eye. When Gulliver awakens on the Lilliputian shore, he is bound so tightly that he cannot move any part of his body; he is literally mo tionless. But after the initial appearance of the tiny soldiers, he manages to free his left arm and to loosen the strings binding his hair so that he can turn his head "about two Inches." Having accomplished this, Gulliver has obtained all the freedom of movement allowed him for some time by the Lilliputians. Once he has resigned himself to the situation, however, and has given them to know that they can do with him as they please, the little men are reassured to the extent that they give Gulliver enough slack in his lines to allow him to relieve his bladder. This, and the subsequent defecation within the confines of his prison, are incidents that have not escaped censure as gratuitous obscenities. Unlike the distinctive method used to put out the Queen's fire, these two episodes seem to have no historical-allegorical signif icance. Yet, when viewed as part of the captivity sequence, the whole seen in relation to a few important Hobbesian concepts, these ap parently gratuitous inclusions emerge as meaningful parts of the book. As I have already indicated, the first two phases of the "political cycle" turn on the matter of Gulliver's freedom; he begs for his liberty at constant intervals, commencing with his pleas to the "Person of High Rank from his Imperial Majesty" who visits him on the beach. And, correspondingly, as the narrative progresses, Gulliver's liberty is gradually increased, starting with the initial freeing of his arm and head mentioned above. For instance, the Captain makes much of the relative freedom granted when he is imprisoned in the old temple: "The Chains that held my left Leg were about two Yards long, and gave me not only the Liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a Semicircle; but being fixed within four Inches of the Gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full Length in the Temple" (1:1:12). And in order to amplify this theme of "liberty," Gulliver is made to</page><page sequence="9">236 Seelye inform the reader that the first words he learned "were to express my Desire, that [the Emperor] . . . would please to give me my Liberty; which I every Day repeated on my Knees" (1:2:17). The irony of this arrangement has already been discussed above; what remains is a demonstration of the philosophical foundations underlying the comedy of giant desires and pygmy refusals. To effect this, it is nec essary to examine Hobbes' definition of Liberty. Since his ontology was determined by mechanical modes, all phenomena were viewed by Hobbes in terms of motion (II, 69-70), and it followed from this that physical sensation was also considered by the philosopher as inferential of motion (II, 391). Consistent throughout, Hobbes went on to define Liberty in similar terms: Liberty, or Freedom, signifieth, properly, the absence of opposition; by op position, I mean external impediments of motion; and may be applied no less to irrational, and inanimate creatures, than to rational. For whatsoever is so tied, or environed, as it cannot move but within a certain space, which space is determined by the opposition of some external body, we say it hath not liberty to go further. And so of all living creatures, whilst they are im prisoned, or restrained, with walls, or chains; and of the water whilst it is kept in by banks, or vessels, that otherwise would spread itself into a larger space, we use to say, they are not at liberty, to move in such a manner, as without those external impediments they would. (Ill, 196) Expressed in purely sensory terms, Hobbes' definition of Liberty is highly suggestive of the minute tactile descriptions evoked in Gul liver's record of his captivity. Furthermore, the connection implicitly achieved between motion, sense, and liberty calls to mind the other physical and legal restrictions imposed on Gulliver during the Lilliput episode. And Hobbes' use of the water-vessel simile finds a parallel in Gulliver's necessity to relieve himself as he lies bound as well as the subsequent urge while prisoner in the temple. Apparently a needless Rabelaisian touch, it becomes in this context a perfect example? scatalogically rendered?of Liberty within captivity, couched in Hobbes' own imagery. It might be added that the episode in which the Lilliputians con vey the bound and sleeping giant to their capital appears to be sim ilar in intent: securely tied and thoroughly drugged, Gulliver is unable to move in terms of personal freedom, and yet he travels a full half mile in terms of pure physical motion. In this way does Swift exploit the many paradoxes ancillary to Hobbes' mechanical theory of politics, thereby enhancing his attack on the great paradox estab</page><page sequence="10">Hobbes' "Leviathan" and First Book of "Gulliver's Travels" 237 lished by Hobbes' insistence upon the concept of the sovereign as all powerful, all-encompassing, and, in all things, rightful. "Nothing the sovereign representative can do to a subject," Hobbes wrote, "on what pretence so ever, can properly be called injustice or injury; because every subject is author of every act the sovereign doth. . . . And therefore it may, and doth often happen in commonwealths, that a subject may be put to death, by the command of the sovereign power; and yet neither do the other wrong ..." (Ill, 199-200). It is in this concept of many-in-one that Hobbes' great paradox lies hidden, and Swift attacks it in two ways: first, by Gulliver's ridiculous, un questioning obeisance to the tiny Emperor, and then by his indignant escape from Lilliput when the ambition and tyranny of the ruler makes his situation perilous. The social contract, Swift would seem to imply, is only as good as Leviathan wills it to be, and the law of self preservation is more powerful than the invisible chains of government. For although Gulliver is a monster, he is completely autonomous and is not corporeally identifiable with the Emperor or Lilliput; Leviathan, on the other hand, is the state. It will be recalled that while he is bound on the shore, the Captain is covered with Lillipu tians; a true Leviathan would be composed of the tiny people. Once again, as in A Tale of a Tub and The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit, Hobbes' own knife is turned against him: his postulate of extreme absolutism is attacked by means of his postulate of self-preservation while his use of giantism provides Swift with his most important satiric device. In this way the lie is given and the paradox of unity through oppressive fear is exploded. But there is another purpose behind Gulliver's autonomy, a pur pose related to contemporary problems with which Swift was im mediately concerned at the time he was writing Gulliver's Travels. Throughout his public career, Swift identified himself with Irish affairs, particularly with those antagonisms in matters of religion and economy that arose between England and the Emerald Colony; when he was not espousing Ireland's cause in the face of English opposition, he was lashing her citizens into action. In such a document as A Pro posal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture, &amp;c (1720), we find him doing both, and in the same year, writing to his friend, Charles Ford, Swift indignantly attacked the "Act for the better securing the Dependency of the Kingdom of Ireland upon the Crown of Great Britain" (passed through Parliament in 1721) in terms highly evoca</page><page sequence="11">238 Seelye tive of Gulliver's situation in Lilliput.11 The connection between Ireland's troubles and those of Gulliver is made more positive by the fact that as early as 1707, Swift clothed Irish problems in allegorical dress when he wrote the short pamphlet, The Story of the Injured Lady.12 With this in mind, the relations between the Emperor of Lilliput and the enslaved Gulliver seem to allude to England's outrageous treatment of "the injured lady," Ireland, intimating that the policies of absolutism promulgate injustice toward whole countries as well as toward individuals. On this level, the first book appears to be a caveat against further mishandling of the Irish problem?an attempt, perhaps, to declare autonomy for Ireland by implicit juxtaposition of the two giants, Gulliver and Leviathan. And finally, the many hints of potential violence and destruction muttered by Gulliver might possibly be considered as reminders of Ireland's angry strength and the consequent possibility of incipient revolution. In summation, it becomes apparent that below the superstructure of the satire upon faction in politics?the miniaturization of the Whig-Tory struggles?there are at least three other layers of allusion and meaning in the first book of the Travels. The first and most basic? the foundation for Book One?is the three-phase political cycle con cerned with the "fundamental human vitalities" of social endeavor. Firmly mounted on this is the giantism complex, a satire upon Hobbes' Leviathan and the paradox of absolutism, and, finally, there is the matter of Ireland, a contemporary problem of universal applica tion that leads into the purely temporal satire on factional strife in England during the early years of the eighteenth century. There is thus established a pyramid of implication that progresses upward from an allegorical layer of universal validity to satire of the most specific sort, all layers tangential and all operative within the frame work of the basic construction?the problem of the individual versus the state. The reasons for Swift's attack on Hobbes are many. I have already shown the basic differences in political thought of the two men, and 11 The Letters of Jonathan Swift to Charles Ford, ed.

At any rate, in attacking Hobbes, Swift was merely following a long-established tradition, for the learned furor following the publication of De Cive and The Leviathan was great?Hobbes' thought cut deeply and painfully into the roots of all that was held to be true and beautiful by divines and philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
