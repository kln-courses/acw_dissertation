Lashinger A Summary of Research Studies Relating to Language Arts in Elementary Education: 1967 Partii Programs and Grouping Practices Camper1 compared an individual and group approach in teaching reading skills to selected intermediate grade pupils. Sig- nificant differences were found among group means as measured by the California Reading Test and the Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty in favor of those pupils taught individually. These pupils also dem- onstrated a more favorable attitude towards reading and read more books than the children taught in groups. 1Virgie Lake Camper, "A Comparison of two Meth- ods of Teaching Reading, Individual and Group, in the Teaching of Reading Skills in Combined Classrooms to Selected Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Grade Children in the Public Schools of Howard County, Maryland," Dissertation Abstracts, 27 (May, 1967) 3768A.

Each pair consisted of a once retained first grader and a never retained second grade child. The promoted or never retained group gained significantly more in reading and arithmetic as measured by the Metro- politan Achievement Test. Warner3 conducted an experiment to de- termine the effect on reading achievement of instructing first grade pupils in a half day session, 8:00-12:00 or 12:00 to 4:00, a whole day 9:00 to 2:00 or a divided day when half the pupils came to school from 9:00 to 2:00 while the other half attended from 10:00 to 3:00. 3 Dolores Warner. "The Divided-Day Plan for Read- ing Organization," The Reading Teacher , Vol. 20, No. 5, (February 1967), 394-397. The sample of 327 first grade pupils in 12 classrooms in six Los Angeles city schools was matched in intelligence of pu- pils, teacher preparation and experience. From the results of the Gray Oral Reading Test , the Dolch Word List and the Gates Primary Reading Test , it was demonstrated that the divided day group performed sig- nificantly better in most of the subtests of reading than children taught for one half or a whole day. While the study is 906</page><page sequence="2">Research Studies in Elementary Education 907 quite limited and raises a number of ques- tions concerning the administrative advan- tages accruing to the divided group and the positive teacher reaction for the divided grouping, it does suggest a possibility for relieving large classes and provide teach- ers the opportunity to teach one half their usual class for two hours each day. An unusual study of the effects on achievement of vertical and horizontal grouping was made by Mycock.4 The verti- 4Mary A. Mycock, "A Comparison of Vertical Grouping and Horizontal Grouping in the Infant School," The British Journal of Educational Psy- chology , 37 (Feb. 1967) 133-135. cal group stayed with one teacher from ages 5 to 7 while those grouped horizon- tally had a new teacher each year. Among the areas measured during three years of the experiment were size of reading vocab- ulary, reading accuracy, comprehension and rate. Four English schools with pop- ulation of 150-180 participated in the study. Schools were paired for locality, size, class size, staff ratio, teaching methods and quality of staffing. While no significant differences were found in vocabulary or reading achievement, the author speculated on the basis of limited evidence that the slower learning children benefited ( in read- ing) more in the vertical than in the hor- izontal group. Hawkins5 reports a limited study by eight experienced teachers of the movement of pupils from one reading group to another and the reason for the movement. The 5Michael L. Hawkins. "Changes in Reading Groups," The Reading Teacher, 21 ( October 1967), Pp. 48-51. classes were self-contained and pupils were usually divided into three groups for read- ing instruction. The twenty-one reasons given by teachers for moving pupils from one group to another indicated that most of the changes in grouping were based on teacher opinion with other evidence lacking for the most part. Teachers in the study could not identify particular strengths or weaknesses that would suggest that a change in group placement would con- tribute to a child's progress in reading. While the study was quite limited in scope and in research technique, it did raise questions related to the evidence teachers needed for determining when chil- dren should be moved from one group to another and also whether teachers had the resources available to them for assessing the specific reading strengths and weak- nesses of their pupils. The investigator sug- gested that research is needed to determine and test workable guide lines for aiding teachers develop flexible grouping. The effects of a nongraded program on reading achievement were studied by Jones and Moore.6 Fifty-two first grade pupils were assigned randomly to either experi- mental (N- 26) or a control (N- 26) groups and remained in their respective groups for two years. Teachers were pre- pared for participation in the experiment through workshops and received assistance from a reading consultant. Reading readi- ness levels were assessed for all pupils dur- ing the first two weeks of school. Nine learning levels were established for the ex- perimental group, while the control group was divided into three groups for reading instruction. The pupils in the control group could move only within the three levels assigned. Pupils who did not achieve ade- quately were retained at the end of the first year while those who went to second grade were again assigned to one of three levels. For the experimental group there was no grade distinction at the end of the first year. 6Charles J. Jones and J. William Moore.

This was repeated at the end of the second grade. Reading levels were created to meet the reading needs of the pupils. Vocabulary and Word Analysis There were a limited number of studies in this area. However, interest in vocabulary development and word analysis is still in- tense as reflected by the many methods and studies reported above which often com- pared various teaching methods and ma- terials to word recognition and analysis within the more general program of read- ing. A study by Carver7 attempted to de- termine whether sounds differ in their vul- nerability to analysis. The subjects studied were 154 seven-year-old boys and girls. Subjects were given seven words orally 7 Clifford Carver, "The Aural Analysis of Sounds," The British Journal of Educational Psychology, 37 (Nov. 1967) 379-380. and asked to identify the initial sound. They answered by circling the correct let- ter from a multiple choice selection. Sub- jects were then asked to identify words beginning with the same consonants as in the first list, but followed by a second con- sonant rather than a vowel, ie: climb, please, etc. There was a significant increase in the number of errors from the first to second set from which the investigator concluded that words as sounds differ in their vul- nerability to analysis. Boys in the sample had significantly more difficulty than girls as aural difficulty of words increased. A study conducted by Lemons8 explored the comparative effectiveness of teaching reading in grades 1-3 using Phonetic Keys to Reading with 77 pupils and Reading 8James Roscoe Lemons, "The Effectiveness of Two Methods of Teaching Reading in the Primary Grades," (A) Vol. 27, No. 12 (June 1967) 4048A For Meaning with 71 pupils. The results as obtained from an administration of the Metropolitan and Stanford Achievement Tests indicated that the pupils using the Reading for Meaning approach scored sig- nificantly better than pupils in other groups in word knowledge, word discrimination, reading comprehension, word and para- graph meaning. Pupils taught using the Phonetic Keys scored significantly higher in spelling and word study skills. The Reading for Meaning material proved most advantageous for pupils of low and medium I.Q.s and low and medium socio-economic status. The Phonetic Keys to Reading seemed most advantageous for pupils of both high I.Q. and socio-economic level. Four instructional methods for teaching word recognition to disadvantaged pupils were analyzed by Jones.9 The investigator tried to determine which method of instruc- tion is most appropriate for teaching word recognition skills to culturally disadvan- taged children. Â°Margaret Jane Jones, "A Comparison of Four Instructional Methods in Teaching Word Recog- nition to Culturally Disadvantaged Learners," Dis- sertation Abstracts 27 ( May 1967 ) 3758A. The subjects were 84 disadvantaged pu- pils from a nursery school, kindergarten and first grade in Philadelphia, Pa. Forty- six words were presented to each subject for 5 seconds. From these, 40 unknown words were selected for instructional pur- poses. Ten words were presented by each of the four methods during 15 minute periods on four consecutive days. Results indicated that method was not a significant factor in learning words. There were no significant relationships between grade level and method, or between intelligence and method. Order of method presentation was not significant. Kinsey10 attempted to determine words used most frequently in elementary school- children's written expression and compared</page><page sequence="4">Research Studies in Elementary Education 909 the results with the results of the Rinsland study of 1939. The investigator obtained 10Reba Vastie Kinsey, "A Comparative Study of the Written Vocabulary of Children in Florida Public Elementary Schools, Grades One Through Six," Dissertation Abstracts , 27 (May, 1967) 3775A- 3776A. writing samples from various sources from 1,100 children. It was hypothesized that there would be no difference in the fre- quency with which the 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 most frequently used words of the Rinsland test and the frequency of appearance of the same words in this study. Kinsey found that her sample differed sig- nificantly (.05 level) from the Rinsland sample in grades 2, 4, 5 and 6. At the first and third grade levels the first 100 words were used significantly more often by children in the present sample. In most instances the first 2000 words were used significantly more often by the 1939 sample. It was apparent from this study that the same basic words carry a heavy load in written expression year after year and it was suggested that such words should be taught early to children for this reason. A study of the reaction of third grade "low and middle class children" to selected words used in a social studies context was made by Bottorff. Two hundred twenty- two children noted their likes or dislikes for words presented by investigator. It was apparent that children responded favorably or unfavorably to specific words by class level and race. It was suggested that a study such as this might be helpful in guiding the writers of textual material used with pupils from varied socio-economic and racial groups on the assumption that a neg- ative or positive reaction to words would influence success in learning. Emans and Fisher11 developed a series of exercises for evaluating the use of context clues and then analyzed the success of 781 pupils in grades 3-10 in using certain clues as an aid to word recognition. Pupils were presented six versions of the Gates Reading Survey revised as follows: a. Form I- key word was omitted and a correct response was to be chosen from 4 choices supplied b. Form II- the beginning and end letter of each word was given with the others omitted c. Form III- just beginning letter was given d. Form IV- only the vowels were omitted from the key words e. Form V- the complete word was omit- ted and the line for each missing word was the same length f. Form VI- the entire word was omitted, but the length of the line was determined by the length of the word 11 Robert Emans and Gladys Mary Fisher, "Teach- ing the Use of Context Clues," Elementary En- glish , 3 (March, 1967) 243-246. Form IV proved to be the most sig- nificantly useful clue, while Form V was significantly less useful than the others. An article by Langer12 based on research defines concepts, explains the relationship between vocabulary development and con- cept development, explains the sources of word concept, difficulties, and describes important studies of concepts and concept development. 12 John H. Langer, "Vocabulary and Concept De- velopment," Journal of Reading , X, vii, (April, 1967), 448-455. Reading Achievement and Some Correlates There are dozens of articles which in some way or other relate the significance of a specific aspect of learning, education, instruction or living to reading achieve- ment. We present 35 of these which are representative of the widely divergent in- terests in reading achievement. Mayans13explored the possibility of pre- dicting reading level of pupils achieved in</page><page sequence="5">910 Elementary English first grade using estimates related to cul- tural level of pupils as gauged by father's education and occupation. The Metropoli- tan Readiness Test was found to be a useful predictor of the future reading achievement of all groups of children and early testing and grouping of children by cultural level is suggested in order to provide sound in- struction of a compensatory nature. The study failed to describe the type of kinder- garten and first grade programs utilized, but like others, suggests that early testing might be useful in guiding the develop- ment of preventative programs for cultural- ly disadvantaged pupils. 13Anna E. Mayans, "Early Differential Prediction of First Grade Reading Achievement Among Three Culturally Different Kindergarten Groups," Disser- tation Abstracts 27 (March, 1967) 2891A-2892A. A summary and discussion of research concerning creative understanding in read- ing is presented by Covington.14 14Martin V. Covington, "Some Experimental Evi- dence on Teaching for Creative Understanding," The Reading Teacher, Vol. 20, No. 5 (February, 1967) 390-396. From the sketchy data provided we can draw the conclusion that children who are instructed in drawing inferences from their reading are more adept in using informa- tion to guide their thinking and to test validity of their ideas than those who are not specifically instructed. Instructed chil- dren were able to detect factual discrep- ancies and use them in solving problems presented in mystery stories. The study suggested that children can benefit from direct instruction in inferential reading in spite of low reading ability if reading ma- terial is adjusted to reading level. Ryan and Torrance15 attempted to de- termine whether exercises which lead to growth in elaboration would be accom- panied by growth in reading ability. The study involved 7th grade boys and girls enrolled in remedial and developmental reading classes. During the experiment em- phasis was on elaboration of what was read by writing new endings for stories, acting out stories, panel discussion, etc. Significant growth in reading, comprehen- sion, graph reading and reference skills accompanied growth in ability to elaborate. 15Eunice G. Ryan and E. Paul Torrance, "Training in Elaboration," Journal of Reading, XI, i, (Octo- ber, 1967), 27-32. A study by Thatcher16 attempted to de- termine whether children taught by basal reader methods or by an individualized ap- proach profited most in growth in tested creativity and problem solving. Results as measured by a test of creativity and prob- lem solving ability developed by Torrance and Covington suggests that 5th and 6th grade pupils in an individualized reading program will perform as well as those in a basal reading program on the tests. 16David A. Thatcher, "Reading Instruction, Creativ- ity, and Problem-Solving," The Reading Teacher, 21 (December 1967) 235-240+ . Sister Mary Julia MacDougall17 attempted to determine if there is a significant re- lationship between the critical reading ability and creative thinking ability in in- termediate grade boys and girls. The ex- perimental classes received instruction in specific critical reading skills while the con- trol groups were enriched through chil- dren's books. Tests of critical reading, cre- ative thinking, reading and intelligence were administered and revealed a low but significant correlation between critical reading and creative thinking for pupils in grades four and five. An overall analysis of test results suggested that measurement instrument of creative thinking and critical reading needed improvement in order to identify both skills in a more discrete man- ner. Further research is needed to deter- mine whether critical thinking is inherent in critical reading and whether instruction</page><page sequence="6">Research Studies in Elementary Education 911 in critical reading can foster creative think- ing. 17Sister Mary Julia MacDougall, "Relationship of Critical Reading and Creative Thinking Abilities in Children," Dissertation Abstracts , 27, ( May, 1967) 3779A. Even though a study of phrase reading by Amble18 was difficult to read and lacked certain relevant information, the results seemed to justify comment and further in- quiry. The author attempted to present the theoretical and practical implications of phrase reading training for reading in- struction. In three consecutive experiments the researcher studied the significance in terms of reading of training pupils using the Phrase Reading Film Series- Intermedi- ate Grades. Findings indicated that phrase reading training may increase perceptual span, reading comprehension and reading rate. Skills acquired seem to be maintained. The reader was concerned whether or not there was a high correlation between the film series material and the criterion tests used to measure results. A question was also raised as to whether training in phrase reading should be restricted to a filmed presentation or whether other approaches might prove of equal value. 18Bruce R. Amble, "Reading by Phrases," California Journal of Educational Research , 18 (May, 1967) 116-123. Flatte,19 in a somewhat related study at- tempted to determine the effect of tachis- toscopic training on reading rate. Twenty-six pupils received thirty 20-min- ute tachistoscopic lessons over a period of ten weeks while an equal group of pupils received reading instruction without tach- istoscopic training. Post-testing revealed no difference in rate or comprehension be- tween the two groups. While this particu- 19Earle Edward Flatte, "The Influence of Individ- ualized Eye-Span Training With Digits on Ef- fective Reading Rate," Dissertation Abstracts, 27 (April, 1967) 3221 A. lar study was not particularly important it is interesting to note that experimentees continue to be concerned about ways of increasing reading rate using mechanical means. Another study made to determine wheth- er rate of reading of 5th grade pupils can be increased and whether comprehension level is effected was conducted by Griffin.20 Using specific materials aimed at increasing rate of reading Griffin found that purpose seemed to determine rate, rate was in- creased significantly without use of ma- chines and comprehension was not reduced significantly when rate increased. 20 Vernon Haywood Griffin, "A Study Designed to Investigate Some Aspects of Forced Increase in Rate of Reading on the Reading Comprehension of a Selected Group of Fifth Grade Pupils." Dissertation Abstracts , 27 (March, 1967 ) 2729 A- 2730 A. Reading Versatility, a new label for Reading Flexibility, was a study by Mets- ker.21 The purpose of the investigation was to determine the relationship between read- ing versatility and other reading skills and mental ability. A variety of reading and in- telligence tests and a test of Reading Ver- satility were administered to a population of sixth grade pupils living in a high socio- economic suburb and a metropolitan area. The results indicated that children with higher mental ages read more rapidly but were not able to skim and scan with com- prehension. Children who performed well on general reading test comprehended well in skimming and scanning. Children who comprehend well are no more versatile than those who do not comprehend. 21Carol Jo Metsker, "Reading Versatility: A Study of Reading Rate and Comprehension in Grade Six," Dissertation Abstracts , 27 (May, 1967) 3630A-3631A. A study by Yule22 to determine the re- liability of the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability in assessing reading retardation</page><page sequence="7">912 Elementary English when correlated with intelligence was con- ducted on 160 randomly selected children from the total school population of the Isle of Wight. The short form of the WISC (Maxwell 1959) was used to assess intel- ligence. Researcher found that test, retest correlations were all significant (P=.001), that accuracy and comprehension scales of the reading test are stable and that the large standard error of estimate for rate makes it too unstable for use in individual prediction. From the data it is possible to indicate the size of the discrepancy be- tween measured and predicted reading ages occur in various percentages of the standardized sample at each end of the reading continuum. 22 William Yule, "Predicting Reading Ages on Neale's Analysis of Reading Ability," British Jour- nal of Educational Psychology , 37 (June, 1967) 252-255. Hall and Waldo23 conducted an interest- ing study of the effect of a special reading program contrasted to a standard program on improving the reading of sixth grade youths assessed as prone to future deliquen- cy. Pupils in the special reading groups showed greater improvement at all levels of intelligence over control groups. Pupils in highest I Q category (110 and above) showed most reading improvement, but pupils in lower IQ category (79 and be- low) were second in reading improvement. As in other studies of its type it was demonstrated that a program for poor readers which attempts to highlight read- ing instruction and provide materials other than those ordinarily used in the usual classrooms can help pupils grow significant- ly in reading. 23 Nason E. Hall and Gordon P. Waldo, "Remedial Reading for the Disadvantaged," The Journal of Reading, XI, ii, (November, 1967) 81-92. Walker24 assessed the effectiveness of in- struction in a reading clinic by grade levels and found that grade placement (Grades 3-6) was not a significant factor in reme- diation and reading achievement as mea- sured by oral reading was higher for I.Q. group above median than for those below. This study is of interest to those who are attempting to determine the optimal grade level at which remedial reading instruction can be provided. 24Billy Wayne Walker, "Effectiveness of a Reading Clinic by Levels," Dissertation Abstracts, 27, (March, 1967) 2756A. Reed25 investigated the relation between differences in WISC Verbal and Perfor- mance I.Q. values and reading achievement for six- and ten-year old pupils drawn from three public schools in a metropolitan sub- urb. Significant differences in reading achievement among groups were found at C.A. 10 but not at C.A. 6. There was no evidence to suggest that the intellectual pattern as derived from the WISC could serve as a means of identifying children who might become reading problems. The results suggested that relationship of I.Q. to reading performance is dependent on stage of development. 25 James C. Reed, "Reading Achievement and Re- lated to Differences Between WISC Verbal and Performance I.Q.'s," Child Development , 3 (Sept. 1967 ) 835-840. Herman26 attempted to determine the per- centage of time spent by elementary school children in schools populated by pupils of a limited socio-economic background, in listening, speaking, reading and writing, while engaged in a social studies program. He found that 76.5 per cent of the class time was spent in oral communication, 12.9 per cent in reading and 1.8 per cent in writing. Classes with below average pupils listened to the teacher twice as much as those with above average pupils. The above average classes engaged in significantly more reading than other classes. The re-</page><page sequence="8">Research Studies in Elementary Education 913 search made obvious the long-held sus- picion that below average pupils have less opportunity to develop skills of reading and writing in the classroom and hence increase their language deficits rather than decrease them. 2GWayne L. Herman, Jr., "The Use of Language Arts in Social Studies Lessons," American Educa- tional Research Journal, 4 (March, 1967) 117-124. In a study27 investigating the effect of teachers encouraging second and third grade pupils to work more accurately or to work more rapidly during test taking, it was found that those pupils who were en- couraged to work more accurately did achieve a higher rate of items correct to items attempted than the group encouraged to work more rapidly or a control group which was not encouraged to work either more rapidly or accurately. The group en- couraged to work more rapidly did at- tempt more items than the accuracy or control group. In spite of the apparent dif- ferences in test performance the differences in mean scores were not statistically sig- nificant across the treatments. The investi- gator did not limit size of sample and short- ness of testing period and the suggestion that girls may be more affected by en- couragement in the number of items at- tempted than are boys. 27George S. Lamb, "Teacher Verbal Cues and Pupil Performance on a Group Reading Test," Journal of Educational Psychology, LVIII, vi, (December, 1967) 322-336. Landry28 attempted to determine whether the following organizational aids would affect reading comprehension and recall: (1) questions and problems identified in the introduction (2) questions and problems identified in the introduction and summary (3) questions and problems identified in the introduction, summary and written text Three hundred fourteen pupils were as- signed at random to three treatments and one control group and read selections si- lently, were tested immediately for recall and were tested seven days later for recall. Analysis indicated that none of the or- ganizational aids in themselves had a sig- nificant effect on reading comprehension, immediate recall or delayed recall. We can only assume that differences might have been established if treatment groups had been aided in profiting from the particular material they used. The study also suggests that it cannot be taken for granted that directions found within material are noted or followed by the reader. 28Donald Lyle Landry, "The Effect of Organiza- tional Aids on Reading Comprehension," Disserta- tion Abstracts, 27 (April, 1967) 3228A-3229A. Connor29 attempted to clarify the rela- tionship between perceptive-motor skills as measured by Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test using Koppitz scoring system and dif- ferentiated reading performance of second grade children measured by California Reading Tests. The population tested were 30 boys and 30 girls ranging in Stanford Binet I.Q.s of 91-122 and C.A.s between 7 yrs. 5 mos. and 8 yrs. 5 mos. One-half the population were designated as good readers, the other half as poor readers. The Bender performance revealed no significant relationship between reading performance and Bender measures of ro- tation, integrations or perseverations. A sig- nificant difference (p=&lt;.01) was found between reading performance and Bender distortion scores and the Bender test total scores (p=&lt;.05). No significant differences were found between sexes on any of the 29 James Paul Connor, "The Relationship of Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test Performance to Dif- ferential Reading Performance of Second Grade Children," Dissertation Abstracts (A), Vol. 28, No. 2 (Aug. 1967), 49 1-2 A.</page><page sequence="9">914 Elementary English Bender tests and differential reading per- formance. This study, while limited in scope, sug- gests a need for replication as reading specialists continue in their concern about the relationship between perceptual-motor skills and reading ability. An interesting study of the relationship of lateralized finger agnosia and reading achievement conducted by Reed30 yielded interesting but limited results due to the small and uneven samples of pupils. The investigator hypothesized that the reading achievement of six-year-olds who made more errors on the left hand than on the right would be lower than those who made more errors on the right hand than on the left. The same hypothesis was made for ten-year-old pupils. An analysis of reading test scores and the errors made on a test of finger localization indicated no significant differences between reading achievement and finger localization errors at the six- year-old level. At the ten-year-old level the group with predominance of right hand errors read significantly less well than group with majority of left hand errors. Investigator suggested that among normal children a right hand finger localization deficit is associated with limitations in the development of proficient reading. 30 James C. Reed, "Lateralized Finger Agnosia and Reading Achievement at Ages 6 and 10," Child Development, 1, (March, 1967 ) 213-220. Calder31 investigated the effects of certain aspects of programmed instruction used to supplement a fifth grade basal reading pro- gram on reading achievement. The research- er hypothesized that pupils using self- directed reading materials as a supplement to basal readers will make greater gains in reading than pupils using basal reading materials exclusively. It is also hypothe- sized that the pupils using the self-directed materials will also develop a better attitude towards reading than the other pupils. An experimental and control group of approximately 30 pupils each, equated on intelligence, reading and listening ability were given identical basic reading instruc- tion from 4-40 minute periods a week. The experimental group used self-directed reading materials for 27 weeks during their independent reading time. Both control and experimental groups were encouraged to read books from classroom and school libraries. A standard reading test and an interest inventory were used in pre- and post-testing. Both experimental and con- trol groups made significant gains in read- ing achievement. The attitudes of the ex- perimental group toward reading changed significantly while there was no change for the control group. The experimenter was encouraged by the changed attitude of the experimental group and their consequent improvement in motivation, enthusiasm and self-confi- dence. It seemed obvious from this study that these pupils profited in their attitudes towards reading when aided by an en- thusiastic teacher providing interesting ma- terials. 31Clarence R. Calder, Jr., "Self-directed Reading Materials," The Reading Teacher , 21 (December, 1967), 248-252. In an investigation of linguistic unit size in memory processes, Wilson tested third grade pupils on the hypotheses that: (1) In an immediate memory task a 3- word phrase should be recalled as often as a single monosyllabic word and a string of 3 words not syntac- tically related should be recalled less frequently than the other 2. (2) Imbedding the stimulus word in a non-syntactic string should depress the probability of recall. Wilson32 found that phrases were recalled more frequently than non-syntactic strings, but not more frequently than single words and that phrase structure did not facilitate</page><page sequence="10">Research Studies in Elementary Education 915 recall of embedded word. The probability of recall of single words was significantly higher when presented alone. Nouns were more easily recalled than verbs. Reading performance was highest during intervals associated with recall of single word and lowest during intervals associated with 32Harlalee Allen Wilson, "An Investigation of Lin- guistic Unit Size in Memory Processes," Disserta- tion Abstracts , 27 (April, 1967) 3327A. McLeod33 endeavored to analyze some of the automatic-sequential level skills perti- nent to severe reading disability in three consecutive experiments. The population studied was 46 second grade pupils, half of whom had been referred to a reading clinic, and were reading one year below expec- tancy, had no serious auditory or visual defects of evidence of exogenous causes of their reading disability, while the other half were chosen at random. In experiment I, children reproduced in writing tachisto- scopically presented letter sequences. The control group was superior to experimental at the .001 level of significance. The ex- perimental group improved with redun- dancy but were still significantly inferior in their responses to the controls. Experiment II presented words auditori- cally in context while pupils listened through stereophones. Speech and noise stimuli were controlled. The control group performed significantly better at the .05 level. It was apparent that the store of au- ditory linguistic units in pupils is far more highly developed than the store of visual signal patterns. Experiment III examined the effect of intra-word redundancy on auditory percep- tion. A test involving reproduction and one involving discrimination were taped and material was presented to pupils in a man- ner similar to that of Experiment II. There were no significant differences between groups in response to test involving re- production. Controls performed significant- ly better on the test involving discrimina- tion. There seems to be no difference be- tween good and poor readers in their ability to recognize words and nonsense syllables, but there is a significant differ- ence in their ability to recognize isolated sounds. 33John McLeod, "Some Psycholinguistic Correlates of Reading Disability in Young Children," Reading Research Quarterly, II (Spring, 1967) 5-31. Marlin34 examined the degrees to which fluency and reading speed could be im- proved over time under conditions of de- layed auditory feedback, when variations in task difficulty have their origin in syn- tactic, semantic and sequential properties of the material read. It was found that the primary disruptive effect of delayed feed- back is exerted at the level of motor skill integration; disruption is greater for highly integrative skills, and syntactic consider- ations are more important in performance under these conditions than semantic con- siderations in the material read. 34Marjorie Jean Martinson Marlin, "Response to De- layed Auditory Feedback is Related to Sequential, Syntactic, and Semantic Constraints," Dissertation Abstracts , Vol. 27, No. 11 (May 1967) 4146B. Ford35 studied the relationship of audi- tory-visual and tactual- visual integration to intelligence and reading achievement with a population of 121 white, middle-class fourth grade boys and found that auditory- visual integration as measured by Kahn was significantly related to both silent and oral reading ability and to intelligence. The relationships with reading lost signifi- cance, however, when intelligence was held constant. Tactual- visual integration (as de- veloped by Buchner) was not found to be significantly correlated with either read- 35Marguerite Prentice Ford, "The Relationship of Auditory- Visual and Tactual- Visual Integration to Intelligence and Reading Achievement," Disserta- tion Abstracts (a) Vol. 28, No. 2 (Aug. 1967) 493-4A.</page><page sequence="11">916 Elementary English ing ability or intelligence. Other aspects of this study, too detailed for inclusion, deserve the perusal of those interested in Auditory- Visual and Tactual- Visual inte- gration and aspects of learning and intel- ligence. In a very interesting study to determine whether there is a relationship between laterality patterns and reading ability in a clinic population with diagnosed learning disabilities and associated cerebral dys- function, Capobianco30 found no significant relationship. Because of the many con- flicting claims derived from research and observation, it would seem important that this area of study deserves replication with a number of clinical and nonclinical sub- jects. 3GR.

In a replication of a former study, Rud- nick, Sterritt and Flex,37 explored the re- lationship of auditory and visual rhythm perception and reading ability. Using a population of 36 third grade boys from a middle class suburban school, the research team administered visual, auditory and vis- ual auditory tapping pattern tests which demanded a response of choosing a printed dot pattern in each instance. 37Mark Rudnick, Graham M. Sterritt, and Morton Flax, "Auditory and Visual Rhythm Perception and Reading Ability," Child Development , 38 (June, 1967) 581-587. When compared with the fourth grade pupils in the previous study, the third graders were found to be significantly low- er in C.A. and M.A. Third graders made more errors than fourth on Auditory and Visual Tests, but demonstrated no differ- ence in errors on Auditory- Visual Test. Mental ages on auditory and visual tests were significant independent predictors of reading achievement. The range of scores on perceptual tests was not greater for third than fourth grade pupils. The prediction of reading scores from perceptual tests was less good for third graders than for fourth. Study suggested that with age visual perceptual ability decrease in importance to reading but auditory perceptual abilities and transposition between becomes signifi- cant. Weathers38 compared the visual percep- tual status of thirty one adequate and thirty one inadequate fifth grade boys and girls. Using the Stanford Achievement Tests of Reading to classify her population as ade- quate or inadequate readers and the Fros- tig Developmental Test of Visual Percep- tion as a measure of perceptual status. Weathers found that "Reading Skills" showed a positive relationship to visual perceptual development. 38Lillian Louise Weathers, "A Comparison of Visual Perceptual Development and Reading Achievement of Fifth Grade Adequate and Inadequate Read- ers," Dissertation Abstracts , 27 (March, 1967) 2756A-2757A. A study investigating the relationship be- tween the word recognition skills of 4th grade pupils and perceptual ability was reported by Chirhart.39 The study compared the results of a test measuring word recog- nition skills and a variety of tests and sub- tests which purported to measure percep- tual ability. It was found that some per- ceptual tests relate more highly to word recognition skills than others. For example, pattern completion correlated most highly while spatial task had the lowest correla- tion. When subjects are grouped according to their phonics knowledge, there are sig- nificant differences in perceptual skills. 39 Virginia J.

The examiners administered the McClelland n- Achievement Test, the STEP (Reading), a parent questionnaire and an intensive interview with a sub-sample of parents in collecting information. They found that children of professional mothers scored significantly higher on STEP p&lt;.001. The mean difference on the McClelland was not significant but favored the pro- fessional group. In view of a lack of certain information, the fact that professional mothers were better educated than the homemakers and the difference in size of libraries. It is suggested that this study be replicated to determine whether or not more comparable mothers in terms of edu- cation and interests might yield different results. It has been suggested that the absence of the mother from home, or the working mother influenced school achieve- ment negatively. This study would not in- dicate this, however. 40Jack B.

Johnson41 examined the manner in which the comprehension of pupils in grades 4, 5 and 6 is affected by their attitudes to- wards certain thematic content. The pupils in the study were distributed over the en- tire range of reading ability, intellectual level and attitudinal range. Stories used were classified according to three themes: 41Joseph Carlton Johnson II, "A Study and Analysis of the Relationships at the Intermediate Grade Levels Between Attitude as Reflected in Certain Thematic Content and Recalled Comprehension of That Content," Dissertation Abstracts , 27, (April, 1967 ) 3368A-3369A. 1. anthropomorphic- success stories of animals having human virtues 2. victorious underdog 3. character with culturally-alien attri- butes An attitude inventory was constructed for each theme. Comprehension tests entailing literal and interpretative questions were de- veloped for each story. The variables of sex, chronological age, school, grade level, socio-economic status and measured intel- ligence significantly affected the relation- ship between attitude and comprehension. Significant difference in total comprehen- sion cannot be attributed to differences in attitudes but significant differences in literal and interpretative scores can be attributed to differences in attitudes. More than five thousand primary grade pupils were studied by Aaron, Callaway, Hicks and Simpson42 to determine the rela- tionship of children's interests to reading gains in a summer remedial reading pro- gram. 42Iron E. Aaron, Byron Callaway, Randall Hicks, and Hazel D. Simpson, "Reading Achievement in a Summer Reading Program," Elementary En- glish 44 (Dec. 1967) 875-882. Pre- and post-tests of reading measured the status and reading achievement of pu- pils during the summer remedial program while an interest inventory was adminis- tered during the first week of lessons. There were no consistent patterns found in the results. The answer to "How much do people read to you?" was significantly re- lated to Primary Paragraph Reading and re- sults of the Informal Reading Inventory. Children with hobbies gained significantly more as measured by Paragraph Reading and the Informal Reading Inventory than those who did not. Number of books owned by children was related to significant gains in reading. Children who watched TV in moderation made more reading gains than those who expressed extremes.</page><page sequence="13">918 Elementary English Using 86 pupils drawn at random from a population of 578 sixth graders Lund- steen43 analyzed the interrelationships be- tween reading, listening and qualitative thinking in problem-solving. STEP reading and SCAT scores were obtained for all pupils in the study and all pupils were ad- ministered four unfinished stories dealing with social relationships. Each story was followed by 12 multiple choice questions dealing with main problem, sub problem, definitions, etc. Half the stories were read by pupils, the other half were listened to by the students. Subscores of abstract, functional and concrete levels in the problem-solving questions along with STEP and SCAT scores were factor-analyzed. 43Sara W. Lundsteen, "Listening, Reading and Qualitative Levels of Thinking in Problem Solv- ing," California Journal of Educational Research, 18 (November, 1967) 234-237. Lundsteen found that listening and read- ing for problem-solving r .39, Reading while problem-solving and STEP reading 4 .59, listening while problem-solving and STEP reading 4 .29. The highest correlation be- tween reading and listening when paired according to abstract, functional and con- crete was at the concrete level, 4.31. The most positive correlations between stan- dardized tests (STEP and SCAT) and the experimental measures was at the abstract level. Four verbal factors were identified in problem-solving: abstract reading ability concrete listening ability functional listening ability functional reading ability There was a relatively low r between reading and listening variables and a low association between abstract, concrete and functional levels. There was a high asso- ciation between abstract problem reading, reading achievement and general scholastic aptitude. Drake44 attempted to ascertain the effec- tiveness of the Dale-Chall formula in the prediction of success with technical and non-technical materials by seventh grade students. One hundred fifty two students matched on sex, reading ability, scholastic aptitude and divided into high-average and low ability paired groups. Subjects read a technical test as pre-test, read technical material at 10th or 5th level of readability, completed a technical test as post-test after reading technical material, completed tech- nical test in four weeks and a similar se- quence was followed for non-technical ma- terials. 44Lawrence Coleman Drake, "The Effectiveness of a Selected Readability Formula in the Prediction of Student Success with Technical and Non-Technical Reading Materials," Dissertation Abstracts , 27 (March, 1967) 2937A. The results suggested that rewriting tech- nical and non-technical material did not significantly improve possibility of higher comprehension, retention or reading speed. Learners understood and recalled non- technical material more readily than tech- nical material. Girls were more successful with non-technical content; boys with tech- nical content. The study has interesting implications for teachers of content (tech- nical) material and also suggests that the reading of technical materials by girls need special consideration. The question is raised again concerning the adequacy of using standard readability formulas in assessing level of complexity of reading material. An interesting study which compared the oral reading of a group of Scottish and American children was reported by El- der.45 The purpose of the study was to ascertain whether Scottish children ob- tained an advantage over American chil- dren by being introduced to reading at the age of five rather than six and by re- ceiving a greater emphasis upon phonics in beginning reading. The children in the sam- ple were seven and eight years old in the</page><page sequence="14">Research Studies in Elementary Education 919 second or third grades. The Scottish chil- dren were superior in word pronunciation ability. However, the Scottish pupils read more slowly and did not use context clues as well as American pupils. The early start seemed to give Scottish children an initial advantage. However, there is some question related to the persistence of the advantage. 4r&gt;Richard Duncan Elder, "A Comparison of the Oral Reading of Groups of Scottish and American Children," Dissertation Abstracts , 27 ( March, 1967) 2875A. Neville, Pfost and Dobbs40 tested the hy- potheses with 54 boys aged 7-14 in grades 3-9 that high test anxiety has an increased relationship to vocabulary and comprehen- sion gain. Prior to instruction in a six weeks summer reading program the subjects were given tests of intelligence, vocabulary, read- ing and a Test Anxiety Scale. At the end of the instructional program a parallel read- ing test was administered. Subjects were divided into three groups according to their anxiety test scores. Testing revealed no sig- nificant differences among the three anxiety levels in vocabulary gains, but significant differences p&gt;.01 in comprehension. It was suggested that study is needed to develop programs which will minimize negative ef- fects of anxiety on learning. 46Donald Neville, Philip Pfost, and Virginia Dobbs, "The Relationship Between Test Anxiety and Si- lent Reading Gain," American Educational Re- search Journal , 4 (January, 1967) 45-50. A study by Mitchell47 attempted (1) to determine whether or not fourth grade chil- dren can answer the questions on a stan- dard test without reading the selections and ( 2 ) to determine how successful adults are in anticipating which questions can be answered by pupils without reading the 47Donald Warren Mitchell, "A Comparison of Chil- dren's Responses to an Original and Experimental Form of Subtests GS and ND of the Gates Basic Reading Tests," Dissertation Abstracts, 28 (September, 1967) 970A-971A. selections. The subjects were 480 fourth grade pupils in a suburban school system. The pupils were divided into two groups with the experimental group given ques- tions without accompanying reading selec- tions and the control groups were tested normally. The results indicated that a high per- centage of items were answered correctly by the experimental group- at rates higher than expected by chance. By observing patterns teachers may often determine if child is reading or guessing when answering test questions. Adults seem to be able to anticipate which items can be answered without reading. While the results are tentative and not very specific the topic is one which could provide a fruitful area of research. Sutherland48 in attempting to obtain evi- dence concerning the factorial nature of reading tests administered five standardized reading tests to 250 fifth grade pupils. The resulting scores were factor analyzed by a principal axes method and rotated accord- ing to the varimax criterion, maintaining orthogonality. Test items were then classi- fied according to the "Taxonomy of Educa- tion Objectives." 48Samuel Philip Sutherland, "A Factor Analytic Study of Test Designed to Measure Reading Ability." Dissertation Abstracts (A) Vol. 27, No. 126 (June, 1967) 4141 A. The California Reading Test and selected reference tests from the "Semantic," facet of Guilford's "Structure of Intellect" bat- tery were administered to 250 seventh grade pupils and the scores factor-analyzed. The findings were not unlike those of prior studies and revealed that reading tests were heavily loaded on one factor. The vocabulary and comprehension subtests of each test were quite similar in factorial composition. Regrouping the items accord- ing to the "Taxonomy" failed to produce any meaningful factors. The California Vo-</page><page sequence="15">920 Elementary English cabulary subtest was loaded heavily on the factor "verbal comprehension" while the California Comprehension subtest was loaded most heavily on the factor "verbal comprehension" with small loadings on "general reasoning" and "cognition, seman- tic classes." The largest source of variance could be attributed then to one factor "verbal com- prehension." This research as prior research suggests a need for understanding of the factors which underlie the reading process before successful and differentiating read- ing tests can be constructed. It also seems to suggest that rather than attempting to make diagnostic use of separate vocabulary and comprehension sub-scores that whole scores which simply suggest overall verbal comprehension be used. Interests and Literature A study by Bridges49 to determine what kinds of poems appealed to boys and girls was carried on in 44 classrooms of 4th, 5th and 6th grades enrolling 1114 pupils. Using Poetry Rating Sheets for determining children's choices and teachers observa- tions of children's reactions, 44 teachers read 200 poems ( 25 a week ) to their classes. After two readings, pupils rated poems according to a scale on the first Poetry Rating Sheet. On a voluntary basis children answered three questions about each poem. Summaries were made of teach- ers' and children's ratings, as well as chil- dren's voluntary responses. The 25 favorite poems of 4th, 5th and 6th grades were ranked. Results indicated a significant cor- relation between boys' and girls' prefer- ences, between ratings of 4th, 5th grade pupils, between 5th and 6th grade pupils and between 4th and 6th grade pupils. A 49Ethel Brooke Bridges, "Using Children's Choices of and Reactions to Poetry as Determinants in En- riching Literary Experience in the Middle Grades." Dissertation Abstracts, 27, (May, 1967 ) 3749A significant correlation was found between children's and teachers' ranking of poems. Preferences were for poems related to chil- dren's experience, with humor and for those having strength of rhythm and rhyme. Miller50 conducted a study of the reading tastes of 3,212 intermediate grade pupils in the Lamar, Texas area. A questionnaire of 40 items was administered to gather in- formation. It was found that reading and sports shared the top spot as favorite hob- bies. Favorite adult magazines were Life , Readers Digest and Look. Boys read mag- azines to a greater extent than girls. Chil- dren's magazines were read regularly by 71 per cent of the sample; newspapers were read by 89 per cent of sample, while 77 per cent read comic books- boys to a great- er extent than girls. Twice as many boys as girls disliked reading books. More than half reported reading a book after seeing it on television or as a movie. Ninety-one per cent had read a book a second time while 54 per cent received books from a book club. 50Arthur Luther Miller, "A Study of Reading Tastes of Children in Grades Four, Five, and Six in Selected Schools of the Lamar Area School Study Council," Dissertation Abstracts, 27, ( March, 1967 ) 2741A-2742A. It would seem apparent that TV and movies don't effect the extent of children's reading, but do effect their taste. Comic books seem to have declined in popularity. Story content is a most important considera- tion in selecting books. A survey of children's interests in stories that involve developmental task situations was conducted with 1500 fifth and sixth grade pupils by Worley.51 A jury screened two basal reader stories for five develop- mental task areas, ie: (1) achieving an appropriate dependence-Independence pat- 51Stinson E. Worley, "Developmental Task Situa- tions in Stories," The Reading Teacher, 21, (November 1967), 145-148.</page><page sequence="16">Research Studies in Elementary Education 921 tern, (2) achieving a giving-receiving pat- tern of affection, (3) relating with social groups, (4) developing conscience and morality, (5) learning one's psycho-social- sex role. An interest inventory was devised to assess the pupil's expressed interests in specific story situations. A rank order comparison made between presence of developmental task situations and interests in stories correlated .81 at the fifth grade level and .84 at the sixth grade level. In most of the stories, the control character was a boy and the plot reflected male activities. At both grade levels (5 and 6) there were twice as many male as female story situations. The interest of boys and girls to stories are practically identical. It was obvious that boys and girls are interested in stories which help them with their developmental tasks. Burgdorf52 assessed the ability of inter- mediate grade children to draw inferences from literature by studying 432 children divided equally among grades 4, 5 and 6 and distributed in school representing wide- ly different socio-economic status. 52 Arlene Bernice Burgdorf, "A Study of the Ability of Intermediate-Grade Children to Draw Inferences from Selections of Children's Literature," Dis- sertation Abstracts , 27 (January, 1967) 2003A- 2004A. The children were divided randomly into two groups. Group I read the selections, while Group II listened as the selections were read to them. Children were then interviewed individually about each selec- tion on such points as the purpose or in- tent of author, setting, style etc. Results indicated that inference scores were significantly higher when children listened to stories. Ability to draw infer- ences increased with grade levels. There were no significant sex differences. M.A. was related significantly to inference. Vo- cabulary and comprehension scores were related to the literary score of children who read selections, but not to group who lis- tened (.05). There was no significant cor- relation between socio-economic levfel and literary scores. One of the growing studies of the place of minority Americans in children's litera- ture is that of Gast53 who hypothesized that stereotypes of American minorities are not found in children's literature, that recent literature dignifies the differences in race, creed and customs of minority groups and that recent literature emphasizes similari- ties in behavior patterns, attitudes and val- ues among minority and majority Ameri- cans. 53David K. Gast, "Minority Americans in Children's Literature," Elementary English , I (January, 1967) 12-23. * Gast studied 42 children's fictional books published between 1945-1963 about Amer- ican Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Negroes and Spanish- Americans. As a result of the analysis by three coders of the characteristics of characters and the implicit and explicit concepts in the stories, it was concluded that this relatively recent body of children's literature contains stereo- types complimentary to present-day minor- ity groups and is more complimentary when compared with literature analyzed in pre- vious studies. In another study of textbooks, Waite, Blom, Zimet and Edge54 analyzed first-grade reading text books to test these hypotheses: (1) Activities depicted in stories more frequently involve children under six years of age. (2) Activities are most frequently fe- male oriented. (3) Masculine activities end in failure more frequently than feminine activities. The selection of material was based on 54Richard R.

Hypothesis one and two are not sup- ported by the data. The findings supported hypothesis three. The series from which the original hypotheses were derived were pub- lished in the 1950s. Since 1961 a noteworthy shift in activities appropriate for older chil- dren were found. Apparently the readers published since 1961 are more generally acceptable in terms of their appeal to boys and in rewarding masculine activities. Hobson55 analyzed selected third-grade reading textbooks which were adopted in Texas for the years 1966-1967 to determine extent to which Lasswell's system of values - power , respect , wealth , enlightenment, affection , skill , rectitude and well-being is present in the texts. 55Stanley Preston Hobson, "A Value Analysis of Selected Elementary Reading Textbooks," Disserta- tion Abstracts (a), Vol. 27, No. 12 (June, 1967) 4040A. The results of the analysis gave the order of values as they appeared in the ten books examined as rectitude, well-being, skill, power, enlightenment, respect, wealth and affection. Some linguistic features of five literature books were analyzed by Davis and Seifert50 using such linguistic measures as number, length and structure of communication units, structure of communication units, movables and subordinating structures. The books analyzed were found to be linguis- tically consistent with the development of children for whom the books were written. Author suggested that a linguistic analysis of children's literature might replace the use of readability formulas. 560. L. Davis, Jr. and Joan G.

Special Problems and Reading This last section contains a variety of studies on widely different topics, but re- lated to special problems of interest to the reading specialist. Wilderson57 conducted an exploratory study of reading skill deficiencies and psy- chiatric symptoms in emotionally disturbed children. The population was drawn from a group of children aged 9-14 who had been referred to a Children's Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation of emotional dis- orders. 57Frank B. Wilderson, Jr., "An Exploratory Study of Reading Skill Deficiencies and Psychiatric Symp- toms in Emotionally Distrubed Children," Reading Research Quarterly , II, (Spring, 1967) 47-73. Children were administered an oral read- ing test, "the WISC and a complete battery of psychological tests. Low but significant correlations were found between the fol- lowing psychiatric and reading factors: Schizoid withdrawal and perceptual ef- ficiency (negative) Schizoid withdrawal and memory char- acter disorder and intellectual matur- ity (negative) Character disorder and hyperactive style Rorderline psychosis and visual efficiency Somatic complaints and visual efficiency It was concluded that problem readers may be classified according to a restricted number of psychiatric syndromes and a restricted number of reading deficiency clusters. However, the correlation between psychiatric and reading factors is not large enough to make prediction practical. Graubard58 studied the use of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in the prediction and assessment of reading disability in dis- turbed children. Correlations were run be- tween the PPVT and such measures of scholastic achievement and decoding test as the WISC, the Metropolitan Achieve- ment Test and the Illinois Test of Psycho- linguistic Ability to obtain congruent and concurrent measures of validity of the PPVT and to examine the Peabody to</page><page sequence="18">Research Studies in Elementary Education 923 determine its unique contribution to the assessment of intelligence. The Peabody correlated well with the WISC Verbal and Full Scale I.Q. The WISC, however, had a higher correlation with a measure of read- ing achievement than did the PPVT. The Peabody did not correlate significantly with the auditory and visual decoding tests of the ITPA. It did correlate significantly with the auditory, vocal and visual motor asso- ciation scores which tap ability to scan, relate and select linguistic symbols. Be- cause of PPVT's failure to correlate with receptive measures, its contribution to the assessment of intelligence is questioned. Be- cause of its lack of correlation with relevant measures, it is suggested that its statistical soundness and diagnostic value are limited. 58Paul S. Graubard, "The Use of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in the Prediction and Assessment of Reading Disability in Disturbed Children," The Journal of Educational Research , LXI, i, (Sept. 1967), 3-5. A study to test the hypothesis that mini- mally brain-damaged children are more dis- traetele than non-brained injured children was conducted by Browning59 in a series of three experiments. The findings suggest that brain-damaged children are not more distractible than normal children when dif- ferences in intelligence level are controlled statistically suggesting perhaps that intel- ligence is more relevant to distractibility than so called minimal brain-damaged. 59Robert Mitchell Browning, "Effect of Irrelevant Peripheral Visual Stimuli on Discrimination Learn- ing in Minimally Brain-Damaged Children," Jour- nal of Consulting Psychology , XXXI, iv, (April, 1967) 371-375. Zigmond60 evaluated the intra-sensory and intersensory functioning in normal and dyslexic children to examine intersensory and intrasensory learning and to determine 60Naomi Kershman Zigmond, "Intrasensory and In- tersensory Processes in Normal and Dyslexic Chil- dren," Dissertation Abstracts, 27, (April, 1967) 3534A. the relationship of neurological integrity to the learning process. Twenty-five dyslexies and 25 normal achieving readers were tested using meas- ures of auditory and visual intra and inter- sensory abilities involving memory and dis- crimination, paired associate learning tasks in which both stimulus and response were manipulated to produce inter- and intra- sensory conditions of learning and a ped- iatric neurological examination. It was found that auditory inter- and intra-sensory abilities were deficient in dy- lexics. The intra-sensory visual tasks were learned more quickly than intra-sensory auditory tasks by the dyxlexics. Data suggests that difficulty encountered by dyxlexics are not restricted to the read- ing process. The reading problem may be a single aspect of a more general problem. The tendency of reversing in reading was explored by Monk.61 It was hypothesized that children in second grade who made reading reversals would have difficulty with right-left discrimination and lateral pref- erence. It was expected that both discrimi- nation and lateral preference would exist in greater proportion in children with rela- tively lower I.Q. s and reading achievement scores. 01Evelyn Silberbusch Monk, "Reading Reversal, Right- Left Discrimination and Lateral Preference," Dissertation Abstracts , Vol. 27, No. 11, (May, 1967) 4114B. The population studied were all the sec- ond grade children in five elementary schools of a New York State School system. Tests measuring reading reversals, right- left discrimination, lateral preference, in- telligence and reading achievement were administered to each pupil. Results indicated that children who made reading reversals made significantly more right to left discrimination errors than those who did not reverse. Those pupils who made right-left discrimination errors and</page><page sequence="19">924 Elementary English reversed in reading had significantly lower I.Q.s and reading achievement than pupils who made right-left discrimination errors but did not reverse. Results of the study did not support hypothesized relationship between reading reversals and lateral preference. Further in- vestigation of right-left discrimination abil- ity in relation to other perceptual abilities was urged as an approach to the question of a pattern of deficits on behavioral level. Schab^2 tested the effectiveness of two approaches to remedial reading instruction on the permanence of resulting achievement. The two approaches primarily concerned a difference in planning. The first was teach- er, the second pupil- teacher planned. The program of instruction ran one year and at the end of the first year there were no differences in the achievement in reading of the two groups. A followup testing five months later revealed that all pupils con- tinued gains except one group of boys who had been taught in a teacher-planned group. Although there were no significant differences in the achievement of the groups, the pupil-teacher planned groups achieved at a higher level than the teacher- planned group. Teacher-pupil planning worked better in general for boys. Teacher- planning was more successful with girls. While the results were not significant war- ranted continued study of the role pupils should take in aiding in planning their own remediation. G2Fred Schab, "The Effects of Two Different Ap- proaches to Remedial Reading on the Permanence of the Resulting Achievement," Childhood Educa- tion, 44 (October, 1967) 140-141. A limited study by Lytton63 attempted to determine whether it was more effective to select pupils for remedial education on the basis of tests or teacher recommenda- tions. At the end of the instructional period there were no differences in gains of test- selected and teacher-selected pupils. In- telligence proved to be a good indication of success in remediation and teacher judg- ment concerning selection of pupils for remediation was at least successful as se- lection through a battery of tests.

Preston and Yarington04 reported on the educational and vocational status of a typ- ical sample of retarded readers eight years after treatment in a remedial reading clin- ic. Fifty individuals, each unsuccessful in school at the time of referral and ranging in ages from 6 yrs. 4 mos. to 17 yrs. and with a mean I.Q. of 97.6, were contacted and interviewed eight years after the com- pletion of their remedial instruction. Thir- teen of the subjects were attending high school- six of these were of post-high school age and had experienced slow progress by usual standards. The proportion of pupils attending college was not significantly dif- ferent from the proportion of the general population in college. 64Ralph C. Preston and David J. Yarington, "Status of Fifty Retarded Readers Eight Years After Read- ing Clinic Diagnosis," The Journal of Reading , XI, ii, (November, 1967) 122-129. More than two- thirds of the subjects had repeated 1-3 grades compared to 16 per cent in the general population. The pro- portion of drop outs from elementary and secondary school was not significant when contrasted to the general population. The college attrition rate was higher for the sample than for the population in general. Rate of unemployment for the mature group was not significantly different from the gen- eral population. Overall it was found that these retarded readers of modest ability were able to fill roles in life comparable to their peers even though their rate of educational advance- ment was slow and limited.</page><page sequence="20">Research Studies in Elementary Education 925 The study of Shearer,65 limited by popu- lation and other factors, deserves mention because it, too, considers the long-term effects of remedial education. According to this study all subjects made gains in remedial classes. The portion of the total group receiving continued remediation in high school had unit gains of twice the size as those whose remediation was dis- continued. The evidence suggested that it was profitable in terms of continued gains to maintain remedial instruction after pu- pils left the elementary school. 65E. Shearer, "The Long-Term Effects of Remedial Education," Educational Research, 9 ( June, 1967 ) . Another limited follow-up study of ele- mentary pupils by Buerger60 indicated that reassessment of pupils after a varied time had elapsed after the completion of re- mediation, it was revealed that, while re- mediation did not seem to have a specific effect on academic achievement, it did ef- fect the overall academic level of the pupils involved. Boys in the remedial group seemed to be aided most by remediation and 87 per cent of the total group ex- pressed the belief that remediation had been of help to them. The study suggested that post-remedial follow-up was essential both as a means of gauging the value of remediation and also as an aid in planning continued help for former remedial stu- dents. eeTheodore A.

An extensive review of the research on the learning patterns in the disadvantaged by Stodolsky and Lesser,67 too broad in scope to be presented in detail, deserves the at- tention of those interested in the learning of the disadvantaged. The authors conclude after their extensive study that both social class and ethnicity affect the level of in- tellectual performance but only ethnicity fosters the development of a different pat- tern of abilities. The authors suggested a number of future research studies including an evaluation of the specific origins and antecedents of differential patterns of men- tal ability and the school behaviors pre- dicted by these patterns. The review has implications for the teacher of the disad- vantaged reader in terms of the develop- ment of preventative and supportive pro- grams of instruction. e7Susan S.

Ramsey68 surveyed reading instruction in the Appalachia region of Kentucky and found that the amount of time spent in reading instruction is below recommended levels, library facilities are wanting, ex- periments are needed to determine best places of grouping, inservice programs for teachers are needed and remedial programs are suggested. Ramsey seems to indicate that instruction in Appalachia is unneces- sarily poor or inadequate and that the re- gion needs to look at its instructional pro- gram and improve it with existing facilities in addition to the outside aid available. 68Wallace Ramsey, "Reading in Appalachia," The Reading Teacher, 21 (October 1967), 57-63.
