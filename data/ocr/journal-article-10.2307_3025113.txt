<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW No. XXII. JUIjY, 1868. REPORT OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ANTHROPO? LOGICAL SOCIETY OF PARIS DURING 18G5-18G7.* By Dr. Paul Broca, Secretaire General, Hon. Fellow of the Anthropological Society of London. Gentlemen,?When, four years ago, I had the honour of delivering before you an analysis of your labours, I deemecl it necessary to open it by a succinct historical account of the principal phases anthropology had passed through from its origin to the time at which our society hacl given it a fresh impulse and a new direction. It was useful to show how the field of our science, first restricted to the purely descriptive study of human races, hacl rapidly become enlarged; and how, abandon- ing the pretension of standing isolated, it hacl contracted alliances with all sciences capable of throwing some light on the past ancl present state of humanity. For more than half a century the science of language has lent its aid to ethnography. This excellent medium of investigation, the scope of which extends beyond the narrow limits of history, has revealed to us unexpected filiations and has opened to us an almost unlimited horizon. By allowing it to occupy a prominent place in your labours, you have only followed the example set by your prede- ccssors. But what belongs to you is this, that you have for the first time realised the association of our science, with geology and palseontology, with historical archseology, with natural history and zootechnics, with medical geography, statistics, public hygiene, and finally with physio? logy, and even with medicine. In order to fill this gigantic pro- gramme, the society has claimed ancl obtained the support of a great number of savants devoted to different studies, but all anxious to * Read at the General Meeting held June 20, 1867.

By the side of the savants sat historians, men of letters, artists, ancl philo? sophers, who have more than once enlightened us in our discussions. The greater portion of human sciences have thus amongst us their re- presentatives, ancl our society is like a living encyclopflodia, where all questions in their different aspects are treated by competent men. This favourable position has, nevertheless, given rise to certain strictures. Such as differ from us as regards the object of anthropo? logy, ancl who woulcl restrict it to the description of human races, might have feared that, amidst so many sciences, it woulcl be carried beyond its clomain ; that it woulcl lose its unity of action, its inde- pendence, and, so to speak, its individuality. But it is sufficient to assist at our meetings to see that from the great variety of our labours there always emerge notions which converge to the same object; ancl that anthropology, so far from being absorbed by the sciences sur? rounding it, is, on the contrary, the common field where they all meet, the focus which attracts them and binds them together. It is like these large edifices in course of construction, where labourers of all kinds, from the hoclman to the artist, bring together ancl work all kinds of materials, granite, wood, stone, ancl marble. The seeming confusion at the beginning of the work is soon followed by order and harmony; nor is it necessary to wait until the building is finished to discover the plan of the architect. It is thus that our collective work is being developed. In our case the whole society con- stitutes the architect, and we all are reprcsentatives of the re? spective sciences, we are the labourers whose works the society utilises. But the extreme variety of the subjects which enter into our pro- gramme has raised reflections which have repeateclly been manifested. The necessity of taking anthropological materials from all sources is questionecl by none; but it was asked to what extent ought the sciences grouped around anthropology to be utilised. Our distinguished colleague, M. Charles Robert, who first raised this question, has for a long time studied human types from an artistic standpoint. He has specially fixed his attention upon the characters of Greek and Roman heads ; characters which he has determined after antique sculptures, without, however, neglecting numismatics or ccramics. But when on the point of communicating to us the results of his curious observ? ations he hesitated ; for he asked himself whether researches of this kind, based upon facts within the clomain of art, ought to figure in anthropological transactions. He, therefore, invited the Society to formulate in a general manner the nature of the relations the Society wished to establish between anthropology proper ancl the notions which the latter science borrows from different branches of human</page><page sequence="3">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 227 knowledge. The scruples of our colleague were exaggerated, as the attention with which you listened to his paper on the type of the Roman head must have proved it to him. But the general question which he put has preserved its importance, and cleserves your atten? tion the more since it has recently been reproduced, when M. Camus communicated to us the learned researches of M. Fetis on musical systems considered as an ethnographical character. The history of the arts, no more than that of languages, religious, literature, or political societies, no more than that of biology, zoology, paleeontology, and geology, forms part of the programme of anthropo? logy. A memoire, ex p&gt;rofesso, on painting or music would here be as little in its j^'oper }:&gt;lace as a communication on the structure of bones, or a dissertation on the subjunctive mood. Nevertheless, ana? tomy furnishes us with the best distinctive characters of human races, ancl we are constantly obliged to appeal to it when we desire to estab- lish a parallel between the human group and the anthropoid apes. Linguistics are not less indispensable to us when we wish to study the filiation of peoples and races. It is of little importance to us whether such or such arace of sheep have a finer fleece or yield more flesh ; but when the history of these races, of their origin, crossing, stability, affords us more or less clear notions on the general question of race or species, then anthropology eagerly lays hold of these facts, which may assist in the solution of some of its most important problems. Thus we have seen that our learned colleague, M. Sanson, with his vast knowledge on zootechnics, frequently, and with great profit, intervcncd in our discussions. We could not proceecl a single ste]) in the study of prehistoric races, if archseology did not furnish us with the elements of the distinction of epochs ; if it dicl not indicate the relative dates of sepulchres, whence are derived the bones submittecl to our inspection. It is, nevertheless, certain that pure archseology would lead us away from our object. This was well understood by those of our colleagues, who, without ceasing to be active and zealous members of our Society, have, two years ago, founded the " Societe Parisienne d'Arch6ologie et d'Histoire," under the presidency of M. Leguay. In this young society, allied to our own by so many bonds, archooological subjects are treated in all their details, and are discussed separately, whilst with us the archa3ological demonstration is only, so to speak, the preamble of an? thropological facts derived from it; ancl it frequently happens that the same researches are produced at the same time in both societies, but viewed from different standpoints. This example shows us better than any other the nature of the relations existing between anthropology ancl the sciences it has grouped around it. It demands from them particulars rather than didactic developments ; and in this wayanthro- r 2</page><page sequence="4">228 anthropological review. pology can excludc no branch of human knowledge which can furnish any data on the history of man and human society. From this point of view I shall draw your attention to the works of M. Fetis, of Brussels, on the origin of musical systems and their re- partition among different ancient or modern, civilised or barbarous peoples. Music, with this savant, who has devoted his long life to a study, which, before him, had scarcely fixed the attention of some curious inquirers, has, under his hands, become a science. Accustomed from our infancy to certain musical impressions, we are apt to believe that our classical gamut is the only form of harmony, that the division of the octave into five tones and two semitones is a natural institution, ancl that any modulation, the elements of which do not exactly enter into this division, is false, discorclant, contrary to eternal order. This is, however, a delusion developed by habit. It is sufficient to listen to, or to analyse the song of the nightingale or of the linnet, to recognise that they cannot be expressed on our pianos, and to become convinced that the purest harmony may exist outside of our musical system. This system we find among all people who have adopted our civilisation. Most of the foreigners who attended the Paris Exhibi? tion, after affording, during the clay, the spectacle of the confusion of tongues, formed only one people when they attended the opera in the evening. Amidst the diversity of their idioms, music alone established between them common sensations ancl a common language. But if the same audience had been all at once transported before one of the Chinese orchestras, of which our colleague, M. Armand, has given us an account, the audience would have thought to hear a Charivari, and would have stoppecl their ears, to the great annoyance of the natives, who understand as little our musical scale as we understand theirs. In the same way as linguistics may establish between human groups distinctions or approachments, the signification of which is open to discussion, but of which the reality is demonstrated, so may the study of musical systems and their actual repartition furnish important par- ticulars, if not as regards the filiation of peoples, at all events on the communications which must have existed between them at more or less remote epochs. For this reason alone woulcl the vast researches of M. Fetis be worthy of your approbation. The documents which he has collectecl on the music of most modern nations have led him to estab? lish a certain number of well defined groups. But this notion, how? ever interesting, dicl not satisfy him. He well understood that we must search for the explanation of the present state in the past, and he has undertaken a labour comparable to that of linguists, who, re- suscitating dead languages, and reconstructing even primitive lan? guages, of which there are no remnants, have thrown much light on</page><page sequence="5">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 229 prehistoric times. Not content to unite all documents written on tbe miisic of the ancients, he has also put into action the instruments dis? covered by archeeologists. Flutes, lyre handles, found in the monu? ments of Egypt, or sculptured on Assyrian monuments, have served him as models, ancl by imitating these instruments with rigorous accuracy, he has drawn from them sounds which have revived musical systems buried for thirty centuries. These remarkable works want, no doubt, the control of criticism, but we may say that they open to science a fertile and entirely new road. We cannot hope that the study of musical systems will ever acquire an historical ancl ethnolo? gical value equal to that of linguistics. Music is a mode of expression less rich and less precise than articulate language, and can only fur- nish much more restricted data of comparison. It is also certain that it is less bound up with the life of peoples, wTith their nationality, and the facts cited by all. Fetis himself proves that nations whose lan? guages belong to entirely different stocks, have adopted the same musical system. But the means of investigation which he has given to anthropology are not less precious because they reveal to us both the artistic aptitudes of certain races, and also the communications estab? lished between them in prehistoric times. I thought it right to dwell on these new and interesting researches, of which our Society has enjoyed the first fruit, and which have made their debitt in our science. Arriving now at subjects if not more clas- sical at least more known, I may proceed more summarily. General anthropology has, as before, occupied a large space in your Transactions. The question of the influence of media, which three years ago gave rise to so extended and complete a discussion, came again before us on the occasion when M. Carrier read his important memoir on acclimatisation in America. None was more competent to treat this subject than the author of the Histoire du Peitple Americain. Although his researches chiefly referred to the populations of North America, M. Carrier has also studied the acclimatisation of the Negro race in the Antilles and Brazil. That the races of the old world have become acclimatised in the United States is proved by the rapid increase of the population. But in order to appreciate the significa- tion of this movement, it is necessary to distinguish the intrinsic in? crease from that due to immigration. This, M. Carrier has done, ancl we cannot sufficiently praise the sagacity with which he compared all the statistic documents?unfortunately defective?which have been collected in the United States from the commencement of the century. It results from his work that the intrinsic increase of the popula? tion has notably slackened within the last twenty years. The re? searches of our learned colleague have moreover established, contrary</page><page sequence="6">230 anthropological review. to the generally received opinion, that three-fourths of the immigrants do not belong to the Anglo-Saxon race. The racial importance of this fact is considerable. M. Rameau, struck like many other observers, by the differences existing between the English of Europe and Anglo- Americans, has attributed these modifications to the influence of the media, whilst according to M. Carrier they are chiefly due to inter? mixture. The interesting discussion which then took place between our colleagues may have left the question undecided as regards the thirteen primitive colonies which at the end of the last century formed the American union. But as regards the twenty-three states which have been formed since that time, some of which date as it were but of yesterday, it is difficult to appeal to the action of the climate, which could only have exercised its influence on two or three generations. M. Carrier remarked that modifications produced by climates cannot be manifested in so short a lapse of time. In order to complete his work, our colleague has studied the accli- matisation of the Negro, not merely in the United States, but also in Brazil. This portion of his Memoire has procured us interesting com- munications from M. Martin de Moussy on the state of the Negroes in South America, and from M. Simonot on the question of hybridity raised by the study of Mulattoes. If the coloured population increases much in certain regions, it is not, according to M. Simonot, by its own fecundity, but by continued intermixture of blacks and whites. To the numerous and important facts which M. Perrier has collected in his learned memoir on the crossing of human races, and which permit us to doubt the fecundity of many hybrid races, M. Simonot has added another, which, in his opinion, opposes a more decisive obstacle to the formation of mestizo races, and is the tendency, which at the end of a few generations, gradually reduces the descend? ants of mestizos to one or the other type of the mother races. These phenomena of atavism it is now difficult to distinguish from the effects of return-crossings, because the mongrels of different bloocl intermarry in all directions either between themselves or with the mother races. This complication can, however, be easily avoided by experiments on domestic animals; and it is from facts based upon such experiments that M. Simonot has deduced the instability ofthe character of mon? grels. M. Pruner-Bey, however, remarked that the conclusions drawn from the study of certain crossings are not applicable to other cross- ings, differing from the first, either by the nature of the races or species, or by the condition of the medium in which they are effected. It is very probable, in fact, that these different circumstances must influence the results of the crossing. We must above all take into account the degree of proximity of the races, and what is clearly shown</page><page sequence="7">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 2ol by the researches of M. Perrier is that the incompatibility of crossings becomes the more manifest as the mother races differ from each other. If the resemblance of the parents constitutes a favourable condition, it is natural to suppose, other circumstances being equal, and putting aside hereditary pathological influences, that consanguine unions will not become injurious simply by the fact of consanguinity. In this manner M. Perrier has, in his work, logically connected the two oppo? site but still allied questions, that of hybridity and of consanguinity. These two questions have, from the origin of our Society, given rise to numerous discussions, in which contradictory opinions have been expressed. But I shall only speak here of what has taken place within the last two years. I shall not recur to the old debates, some years ago, between MM. Boudin ancl de Ranse, adversaries of consanguine marriages, and MM. Bourgeois, Perrier, and Dally, who deny the nocuousness of such unions. No one contested the truth of certain facts cited against consanguinity. It was admitted that in families with constitutional taints or hereditary diatheses, the marriages be? tween cousins led to evil results ; but whilst some attributed these results to consanguinity, others looked upon them as the acciclents of hereditariness. The latter formulated their opinion by saying that healthy consanguinity is exempt from injury. The question being thus put, it was only necessary to search here and there for sporadic cases, which apparently supported either of these opinions. In order to avoid the chances of error resulting from individual acciclents, it became necessary to study the effects of consanguinity in certain restricted, circumscribed populations, where the unions between relations are habitual. This our colleague, M. Voisin, has done. The commune of Ratz, situated in apeninsula north of the mouth of the Loire, contains a population of 3,300 souls, nearly all engaged in working in the salt-marshes. The nature of this branch of industry presents few attractions to strangers. It thus happens very rarely that an inhabitant marries out of his parish, and thus consanguine unions, even to the degree prohibited by the church, are very frequent. Thus it happened that in the year 1865, there were between cousins- german, or their children, fifteen marriages, for which it was necessary to ask ecclesiastical dispensation. It was amongst this consanguine population that M. Voisin made his observations. He was not satis- fied with merely stating in a general manner the physical prosperity of the inhabitants; but has written the history of each household, examined the parents and children, computed the number of births and deaths, and prepared complete genealogical tables, containing all particulars relative to forty consanguine marriages. When we exa- mine these tables appended to the treatise of M. Voisin, we mustagi'ee</page><page sequence="8">232 anthropological review. with him that, in a healthy population, consanguinity does not pre? sent that noxiousness which has been attributed to it. After sojourn- ing at Ratz for a whole month, and after examining all the families, our colleague states that " the vices of conformation, mental diseases, idiotcy, cretinism, deaf-mutism, epilepsy, albinism, blindness by pig- mentary retinitis, exist in no individual, whether or not the issue of consanguine parents." Similar observations have been made by M. Dally in the small island of Brehas (C6tes-du-Nord) and by M. Duchenne (de Boulogne) in the population of Portel. They are less rigorous, no doubt, than those by M. Voisin, because they are not accompanied by genealogical tables; but they are not less important. They are, moreover, con- firmed by the zootechnic observations of M. Renard (dTssoire), and M. Legrain (of Brussels), of which M. Sanson has given us a summary. M. Legrain has been specially occupied in the production of Albinism in rabbits. It results from his experiments, divided into several series and conductecl with great sagacity, that consanguinity never produces Albinism in these animals when they are bred under good hygienic conditions ; but that Albinism does manifest itself after a few genera? tions, when the rabbits are ill fed and lodged in dark and dirty stables. This example shows well the distinction established between healthy and morbid consanguinity. The questions of consanguinity and hybridity, and the discussions to which they gave rise, lead me naturally to allude to the numerous communications of M. Sanson, on the characteristics of race and species. It is the study of the j&gt;henomena of direct or cross generation which forms the basis of the doctrine sustained by our colleague with so much conviction. The authors who have tried the definition of species may be divided into two groups; the one, the most numerous, base the specific dis? tinction upon the ensemble of morphological and anatomical characters ; the other following the example of Ray, Buffon, and Flourens, admit as the criterion of species but one purely physiological character, namely the jjerfeet fecundity of sexual unions. M. Sanson accepts both these zoological methods, which hitherto have divided naturalists; he deems them both good, but he applies them to different cases. He employs the physiological method for the constitution of the group called species, and uses the anatomical method exclusively for the de- termination of the races of each species. These races are, in his opinion, not varieties resulting from a more or less retarded subdivision of a species formerly uniform and homogeneous. They are primordial, or, if you like, as old as the species itself; they are moreover perma? nent ancl immutable, that is to say, that neither the influence of</page><page sequence="9">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 233 media, crossing, or selection, can durably lead them away from their primitive type. In other words, as M. Lagneau has observed, M. Sanson attributes to each of the races which compose a species, the properties and characters which the classical naturalists have hitherto attributed to species. M. Sanson has clearly expressed this in saying that his object was " To substitute race for species as the last term of natural classification." The doctrine of our colleague is thus only an accentuated and absolute form of polygenism. But the discussion to which it gave rise turned only on the general principles, and the spe? cial question of the permanence of human races was not touched. Whilst M. Gaussin contested the validity of an exclusively physiolo- gical character upon which M. Sanson based the determination of species, MM. Lartet and Lagneau, raised doubts as regards the abso? lute permanence of races, and cited facts tending to demonstrate the formation of new races in domestic, and even in wild species. M. Mortil? let, finally appealing to paleeontology, denied not merely the permanence of races, but even of species. All these objections failed to shake the convictions of M. Sanson, and even his opponents have admitted the talent he displayed in this difficult argumentation. Questions of this kind belong to that class which will be discussed yet a long while. Still the discussion raised by M. Sanson has not been sterile. It has shown, in the first place, that the classical notion of species, con? sidered as a natural group, primordial and permanent, is far from satisfying the present wants of science ; it has shown that races, to which has been attributed so great a variability, tend, on the contrary, mostly to maintain and perpetuate themselves without clurable changes; that the innumerable varieties obtained by crossing, selection, or cul? ture have generally only a factitious existence, and that when left alone, they disappear very nearly always, either from want of fecundity, or by the effect of the law of atavism, which soon causes the types effaced for a time to reappear. I regret that I must pass over a great number of purely descriptive anthropological facts, as it would lead me into details of a special analysis. I pass, therefore, to your labours on craniology, which has ever been a subject of your j^redilection. The more the crania presented to you (which will enrich your museum) become numerous, the more requisite is it to have recourse to exact modes of mensuration, in order to establish truly scientific comqjarisons between the different series. Geometrical drawings, angular measurements, triangulations, require the use of special in? struments ; but they possess the advantage of revealing shades which will escape the most practised eye, and they moreover furnish numeri- cal data which permit the compilation of averages. The commis-</page><page sequence="10">234 anthropological review. sioners to whom you have confided the charge of preparing instruc- tions for craniometry have endeavoured to render the instruments more perfect. They have presented you with a new goniometer, light and not expensive, with a new craniograph by which, by geometrical projection, all the details of the cranial surface can be drawn, and with a small, very simple instrument, le crochet sp&gt;henoidal, by the aid of which we may, without sawing the cranium, measure the sphenoid angle of Welcker. Our colleague, M. Grenet (of Barbezieux) has, moreover, communicated to us a new process of triangulation of the cranium ancl the face, an ingenious process of which M. Bertillon has shown us the utility in his communication on cephalic angles. In this work, which united all the facts known on the facial angle of Camper, on the auricular angle, and Welcker's angle, M. Bertillon has also included the observations he made on the different series in our museum, ancl has shown the great use of the judicious employ- ment of statistic calculations in order to correct errors, or rather the divergencies which result from different modes of mensuration. It was not the first time that the results of craniometry hacl been submitted to the control of mathematical methods. M. Gaussin had already applied algebraic formulye to determine the proportions existing between the three diameters of the cranium, and he expressecl these rn'oportions by the aid of graphic constructions based on the system of rectilinear co-ordinates. Taking as a starting point the measurements of the great series of crania, known by the name of Cranes de la Cite, he deduced a formula which he afterwards placed by the side of craniometric tables formed after the most different series, by M. Pruner-Be}% MM. His ancl Rutimeyer, and myself. Such is the accuracy of these calculations, that whenever the formula, applied to a series of crania of the same t}rpe, seemed to indicate divergencies, it was found that these depended on the different pro- ceclure employed by the different observers for the measurement of the vertical diameter. The road opened by M. Gaussin may be easily cnlarged, for all craniometric elements may be applied to the same researches. It is, moreover, useless to point out the importance of a method which admits of reducing to the same standard observations made by means of different processes, and to correct what the astro- nomers call individual errors. Our distinguished colleague, M. de Khanikof, who himself knows how to unite the study of anthropology with that of the exact sciences, has applied with success the formula of M. Gaussen to the cephalo- metric measurements brought from Persia by M. Duhousset, who, operating on living men, could only by approximation obtain the length of the vertical angle. in conformity with the general instruc-</page><page sequence="11">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 235 tions given by the society, M. Duhousset has taken to replace this angle, the height of the plane of the vertex above the auditory aper- ture. But the position of this aperture in relation to the base of the cranium varies notably according to race. It was, therefore, to be expected that there would be found a certain difference between the cephalometric observations of M. Duhousset and the craniometric formula of M. Gaussin. The difference was, however, very small. In four series of observations out of six it was under one millimetre and a half. Only in the two series of Kurdes and Hindoos there was a difference of three or four m.m., which no doubt depended on the variations in the position of the auditory aperture. On that occasion M. de Khanikof communicated to us the notes he had collected in the museum of St. Petersburgh on the height of the aperture of the ear above the plane of the occipital foramen. He has consignecl them in an excellent table where figure most of the peoples of Asia. We cannot speak of craniometric tables without alluding to those with which our former president, M. Pruner-Bey, has enriched our Memoires and bulletins. Thanks to him, we can each in our room study the construction of the cranium and the face of most human races. The three large tables which accompany his memoire entitled, Resultats de Crdniometrie, contain more than 15,000 measurements of 507 crania obtained from all countries. We find there 117 African crania, 167 Oceanic, 82 American, 58 Asiatic, and 105 ancient or modern European crania. Nowhere else do we find such a mass of documents collected by the same observer. These three tables pre? sent to us in a condensed form the results of several years minute study, ancl when we think of the immense labour involved, we ask how our colleague could have found time for his great linguistic re? searches, and treat besides with so much competence the highest problems of general and philosophical anthropology1? The reason is that he possesses the happy privilege of preserving in mature age all the indefatigable energy and the sacred fire of his youth. Let us add that he is one of those rare savants who are fortunate enough to devote themselves entirely to the study, or rather to the culture of anthro? pology. May his example find many followers. I cannot think of summarising all the craniological facts communi? cated to us. It is rare that a season passes without our being pre? sented with new crania. Amongst those derived from foreign coun? tries I must mention the crania of two Chellouks from the banks of the White Nile, presented to us by M. Lagardo ; the two crania of red-skins brought by M. Berchon ; a cranium of a Bechuana sent by M. Lautre, missionary in South Africa ; an Egyptian head and an Arab cranium, which we owe to M. Perier ; the admirable deformed</page><page sequence="12">23G anthropological review. cranium from the Valley of Ghovel (Central America), presented to us by Abbe" Brasseur du Bourbourg; and finally the magnificent Austra? lian head given to us by Professor Ch. Martin. This last object, so remarkable from an osteological point of view, reveals to us a curious and hitherto unknown fact of Australian customs. It is mummified ; all the fleshy parts of the head, desiccated and hardened to the highest degree, are closely attached to the bones; the mouth half open is filled with bird feathers; finally, a thread firmly knotted passes through the nasal cartilages. From what is known of the customs of Australian people, it is impossible to suppose that this head belongs to a body embalmed or mummified by a methodical process. Every thing leads us to believe that it is a war trophy, desiccated and preserved by the victor as a remembrance of his victory. I ought particularly to mention the fine series of crania collected in Syria by M. Girard de Rialle, and at Alexandria by our lamented colleague, M. Schnepf. The crania of Alexandria date from the Greco- Roman period. The population of that large town then presented a confused mixture of almost all the races of the old world: thus tho practised eye of M. Pruner-Bey was able to distinguish in the collect- tion of M. Schnepf, apart from the Egyptian crania, a predominant number of Greek, Roman, Ligurian, Negro, and Syrian crania. The crania of the collection of M. Girard de Rialle come partly from Damas and partly from Rasheya. The latter, twelve in number, pre? sent a remarkable uniformity, and seem to have been artificially de- formed by occipital compression. The presentations of European crania are too many to be even enumerated. Most of them belong to the pre-historic epoch, or to certain existing populations, apparently the descendants of the auto- chthones of the stone-age. The conquering people who introduced into Europe the Aryan languages and the use of metals, did not, as was supposed, destroy the vanquished nations ; but by intermixture sub- jected them to more or less profound modification. Since that period, continued crossings have altered more and more the characters of the primitive races. New conquests, new migrations, have recast, as it were, most of the European populations, and amidst this inextricable mixture, the search for either origin has become one of the most com- plicated problems of our science. In order to dissipate this uncer- tainty, two roads are open before us. The one is the study of the populations, who, on the testimony of linguists, have more or less re- sisted the foreign influence, and who, by preserving their pre-Aryan languages, have no doubt also preserved in a degree of relative purity che type of the autochthonic races. The other is the examination of the remains left in the soil by the populations of the stone period</page><page sequence="13">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 237 during the pre-historic epoch, the succession of which is determinecl by archseology and paloeontology. The surviving witnesses of the primitive human fauna of Europe form, at present, only two groups, confined to two extremities of this part of the world : the Basques and the Fins. Our illustrious colleague, M. de Baer, thought that he found among the remains of the Rhsetian Alps a third group of primitive populations; but this opinion, refuted by MM. His and Rutimeyer in their Crania Helvetica, cannot be sus- tained in the presence of the facts consigned in the two important memoires addressed to us by M. His. The brachycephali of the environs of Coire, far from being the representatives of the auto- chthone race, are, on the contrary, the descendants of the A lemani, the last invaders of that country. Your attention has thus been directed chiefly to the Fins, including the Esthonians, and to the Basques. M. Beddoe (of Clifton), well known for his studies of the popula? tions of Scotland and Ireland, has communicated to us a table of the measurements taken on Swedish and Finnish heads. The latter are dis? tinguished by decided brachycephaly, and do not less differ from the Scandinavians by the conformation of the face than by that of the cranium. The absence of Finnish crania in the museums of Paris constitutes a gap which is much to be regretted. M. de Baer has last year presented to the museum of natural history three Esthonian crania, which have given rise to an important communication by M. de Quatrefages. Although separated from the Fins by the Gulf of Finland, the Esthonians speak a dialect of the same language, and, despite the intermixture they have undergone, most of them still pre? serve the characters of the Finnish race. Of the three crania pre? sented to us by M. de Quatrefages, one is decidedly Mongolic ; the second is also Mongolic, but to a less degree ; both are very brachycephalic. The third is nearly dolichocephalic; but resembling the second by the structure of the face. Like the latter, it is remarkable by a prognathism limited to the upper jaw. The lower jaws, on the contrary, have a vertical direction ; and M. de Quatrefages has found in these bones the characters of the celebrated jaw of Moulin-Quignon. Our eminent colleague is, therefore, disposed to believe that the Esthonians are the remnants of a race formerly spread to Western Europe, where it has long disappeared either by multiple and predominant crossing, but where its influence is still here and there manifested by the phenomena of atavism. The cases of alveolar prognathism which occasionally appear amongst us, especially in females, would thus be explained. These views are at present founded only on these two crania?for the first Esthonian cranium, being toothless and deprived of the low?er jaw, affords no estimate as to prognathism. These views require,</page><page sequence="14">238 anthropological review. therefore, further confirmation; but they are, nevertheless, of high interest. As to the Basque crania, the discussion raised is still pending. Nineteen new crania, resembling in every respect the first sixty, ancl like them mostly dolichocephalic, have been sent to us by our colleague, M. Velasco. But they are also derived from the cemetery of Zaraus, and consequently are open to the objection taken by M. Pruner-Bey. We ought, therefore, to direct our efforts towards obtaining Basque skulls from another locality. The present of M. Velasco was, never? theless, attended by this advantage, that it raised a new discussion, which procured us the pleasure of listening to an important lecture by M. Pruner-Bey on the Basque language. Without rejecting the ana? logies which have been brought forward between that language and the Tatar idioms, our colleague showed that these analogies are super- ficial ancl insignificant. In his opinion the Basque language consti- tutes a unique fact in the old world, ancl has only real affinities with the languages of America; but he does not feel justified as yet to infer from the affinity of languages the filiation of peoples. Be this as it may, the notions expressed in this memoire are not favourable to the hypothesis of those who try to reduce to a single race all the autochthonous or rather pre-Aryan populations of Europe. This question of prehistoric races has, for some time past, owing to the zeal of archaic anthropologists, made considerable progress. France, Switzerland, Belgium, Great Britain, Scandinavia, are not the only countries subject to the investigations of savants. Several important prehistoric stations have been discovered in Germany and Austria. The publications of the anthropological section of Moscow inform us of explorations of ancient sepulchres of Great Russia. Numerous explorations recently made in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, teach us that the two western peninsulas also hacl their stone-age. The results of the first researches of Casiano de Prado have been commu- nicated to you in an interesting report " on Anthropology in Spain," by M. Pruner-Bey. The discoveries of M. de Prado have been con- firmed by M. Louis Lartet, the worthy son of our eminent colleague. A note by M. Pereira de Costa made known to us some facts relating to the antiquity of man in Portugal, especially in the basin of the Tagus. This is no doubt only the beginning of a harvest. The notions we at present possess on the primitive populations of Iberia are still too vague to admit of a synthesis ; but the numerous and precious relics collected in the other peninsula have thrown a new light on the question of Italian origins. Nicolucci, Italia-Nicastro de Rossi, Cocchi, Canestrini, rival each other in zeal ancl perscverance, ancl show what science may expect</page><page sequence="15">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 239 from regenerated Italy. The Phoenician cemeteries of Sicily ancl Sar- dinia, explored by M. Italia-Nicastro, have furnished numerous and interesting archaeological facts. M. Nicolucci has sent us the descrip? tion and drawings of some crania which have been extracted; and when these crania are comparecl with such taken from ancient graves in Etruria, the hope rises that the Semitic origin of the Etruscans will at length be definitively demonstrated. We also owe to M. Nicolucci the first craniological notions on the ancient Japyges, a population of Southern Italy, whom the ancient historians but vaguely mention, and who, some years ago, were looked upon as autochthones. Yet M. Mommsen, from some inscriptions on their tombs, believecl to detect in the remnants of their language some characters which apparently attached them to the Inclo-European group. This view has been fully confirmecl by our learned colleague, M. Nicolucci, who, on examining three crania founcl in the tombs of the Japyges, testified to their re? semblance to the Greek type. Combining this also with historical notions, he thought that the JajDyges were probably a swarm of the Pelasgic race, driven from Greece into Italy by the invasion of the Hellenes. At present this is merely a hypothesis, but what is nearly certain is that the Japyges were of foreign origin, ancl that they were not the first occupants of the peninsula. If the Japyges ancl the Etruscans are but exotic branches, where shall we find the primitive races of Italy 1 The question as regards Southern Italy ancl Sicily is as yet very uncertain. The facts brought before us by M. de Rossi with so much clearness establish the existence of a dolichocephalic population, which occujjied central Italy during that stone age, which the ill-inspired poets called the Golden Age. But in northern Italy, in ancient Liguria, there is a brachycephalic race which seems to have precedecl all others. This Ligurian race, made known to us by the works of M. Nicolucci, extended on the Mediterranean shore to southern Gaul. Our illustrious colleague, the Due de Lynes, has in that soil made numerous explorations; he has exhumed a large number of crania, shown to us by M. Pruner-Bey, on most of which he founcl the cha? racters of the Ligurian race. This would be the moment of stating the facts relative to anthropo? logy in France ; but these will be laid before you in a special report, which you have confided to our learned colleague, M. Lagneau. I must, nevertheless, not omit here gratefully to acknowledge the acti- vity ancl generosity of our archaeological colleagues, avIio, not content with enriching our bulletins with their interesting contributions, have presented to us for our museum a large number of objects, the more precious as their authenticity ancl dates are warranted by competent men. Thus, MM. Bertrand and Leguay have presented to us a whole</page><page sequence="16">240 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. series of crania and bones extracted by themselves from the dolmens of Argenteuil, and M. de Saulcy has given us several crania from the tumuli of Meloisey (Cote-d'Or), datingfrom the first period of the iron age. The Society has also received by the intermediation of several members forming part of the Commission of the Museum of St. Ger- main, and specially by the exertion of M. Bertrand, director of that Museum, a fine series of crania, exhumed from the Gaulish cemetery of Saint-Etienne-au-Temple, near Chalons-sur-Marne. Several com- munications from M. Roujou and M. Leguay made us acquainted with the results of the explorations they made at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, in a station of the polished stone age. M. Roujou adjoined the de? scription of a certain number of worked flints found in the diluvium of the environs of Paris. M. Mauricet presented to us bones obtained from the dolmen of Moustoir-Carnac (Morbihan), and the fac-simile of two human feet designed on one of the lateral stones of the dolmen of Mont-en-Arzon. If we add to this the splendid cranium of Quiberon, sent by M. de Closmadeuc, of Vannes, and the worked flints which MM. Hamy and Sauvage have brought from Chatillon, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, we shall yet be far from having enumerated all the archaeological facts connected with the anthropology of our country. You would not, however, forgive me were I to omit mentioning the numerous com- munications of M. de Mortillet on prehistoric times. The learned editor of the Materiaux pour VHistoire Positive et Philosophique de VHomme informs us of every important fact which reaches his periodi? cal, and when we require any particulars we are sure he will furnish them to us. Most of the archseological documents I have just spoken of belong to the polished stone epoch, which preceded the bronze age?that is to say, the inauguration of the Indo-European era. The centuries which elapsed to the beginning of written history, and which are de- signated by the name of the Celtic epoch, are accessible by various means of investigation. Anthropology here is not solely founded on archaeology; it draws its light from linguistics, and even from the first glimpses of history. A note of M. Henri Martin on Cimmerian migra? tion, a learned memoire, by M. Georges, on the origin of the Celts, added new facts to those brought forward during the great discussion, which took place three years ago, on the origin of the European popula? tions. On the other hand, our venerable foreign associate, M. d'Oma- lius cl'Halloy, whose green old age seems unimpaired by the ravages of time, sustained, in a treatise which you greatly applauded, the objections he had raised against the dominant theory, and it must be acknowleclged that if linguistics can demonstrate the Asiatic origin of</page><page sequence="17">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 241 Aryan languages, anthropological observation does not permit us to consider all the peoples now speaking these languages as the descen? dants in a clirect line of one ancl the same people. The diversity of modern Indo-European types can only be explained by the survival of autochthonic populations, who, already diversified at the period of the Asiatic invasions, have intermixed with their conquerors, ancl have preserved the dissemblance of races there wdiere the affinity of idioms seemed to indicate a common origin. The multiplicity of races of prehistoric Europe, which was fixecl upon our minds as a necessary explanation for the actual state of things, results directly ancl incontestably from the study of crania of the stone age. In the discussion on the craniological type of men of that period, some apparently contraclictory and yet perfectly recon- cilable facts have come out. On the one hand you were able to lay down, contrary to the opinion of Retzius, that the great majority of the crania of dolmens are dolichocephalic. This not only holds true for France, but also for Great Britain, and very probably also for Sweden, the native country of the illustrious Retzius ; for you recollect that the twenty crania extracted by MM. van Diiben ancl the son of Retzius from the megalithic sepulchre of Suttra, in Westro-Gothia, were, all but one, dolichocephalic. On the other hand, as already mentioned, the researches of MM. Nicolucci ancl Pruner-Bey clearly establish the brachycephalic character of the race, which, before the era of metals, occupied Liguria and the shores of Provence. Europe thus at the polished stone period possessed already on its soil two dis? tinct races at least. But these times which preceded our histories, and which seem so remote from us, appear, on the contrary, very recent when they are comparedwith the incalculable periods which palseonto- logy has revealed to us, and which, finishing with the reindeer epoch, ascend to that of the elephant, the rhinoceros, the cave-bear, and pro? bably higher up, without our being able to point out the limit to which ulterior researches may assign the origin of humanity. During the past few years of its existence, the Anthropological Society more than once discussed the question of the antiquity of man. A dis? cussion on this subject would now be idle. The existence of the fossil man, of the quaternary man, contemporary with the large pachy- dermata, is a fact definitively acquired for science. If here and there objections are still raised against the evidence, it is not amongst us that they are raised. I have made a small collection of works, pub- lished in France during the nineteenth century, against the heresy of the rotation of the earth. Can we expect that the cliscovery of M. Boucher de Perthes should find more favour in a certain circle than the discovery of Copernicus % Let, then, as the Gospel says, the dead VOL. VI.?NO. XXII. s</page><page sequence="18">242 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. bury their dead, and let us pursue our work without noticing the attacks directed against us by men of the past. We also love the past, but we like to study it, and it is not our fault if it extends beyond the classical register. Our curiosity does not rest satisfied with the knowledge that there were men upon the earth in palseontological times; we want to know what was the social condition of these men, what their physical characters, whether they constituted already then distinct races, whether they differed from those which at a later time learned to polish the stone, ancl, finally, whether the im? mense period which elapsed between the mammoth and the reindeer epochs, between that of the reindeer ancl that of the dolmens, had not witnessed, like the much shorter periods which succeeded them, migra? tions and conquests renew and remodel several times the human fauna of quaternary Europe. These highly interesting questions are far from being solved. Never? theless, several important data have already been acquired, and inspire us with hopes for satisfactory answers at some not very distant time. With regard to industry, chiefly represented by flint implements, M. Mortillet has shown us that they were gradually perfected. In the lower beds of the diluvium of Abbeville, the hatches are lance-shaped, and struck off in large flakes. In the argillaceous sand which covers the diluvium, and which is consequently more recent, ancl where no mammoth bones are found, the hatches are elliptic, elongated, and struck off in small flakes. Finally, in the superficial light soil of the slopes, the hatches are polished, wedge-shaped, resembling those found in the dolmens. Were these successive modifications due to the gradual perfection of the same industry or to the arrival of new popu? lations ? The admirable discoveries of M. Lartet, which he made in the caverns of Perigord in company with our lamented colleague, M. Christy, render the last supposition as extremely ])robable. The inhabitants of the caverns of Perigord hacl only worked flints, but they had already reached a surprising degree of civilisation ancl artistic development. We can scarcely conceive how men deprived of the use of metals could have manufactured such an infinite variety of implements of bone, ivory, ancl reindeer homs. How they could sculpture, I should almost say carve, such elegant forms, and grave upon the handles of their implements the figures of various animals. These figures are distinguished by an accuracy ancl artistic skill truly remarkable; and in order to meet with a similar degree of art senti- ment, we must descend through innumerable centuries to the flourish- ing period of the Greeks. They form such an absolute contrast by the side of the crude sketches traced upon some Celtic monuments, that we may well ask whether they hacl not been designed within</page><page sequence="19">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 243 historical times by some proscribed who hacl taken refuge in the caverns of our ancient troglodytes. But who but the quaternary man could in Europe have designed upon the bones of the reindeer the figure of a species of elephant, which differs from all living sj)ecies ? This race, so interesting from its civilisation, led a peaceable life. A cranium, found in the grotto of Bruniquel, of which M. Brim has sent us a photograph, is distinguished by the purity of its form, the gentle- ness of its contours, the slight prominence of its apophyses, the little depth of its muscular marks, all characters which are incompatible with violent manners of a savage or barbarous race. What has become of this indigenous civilisation, so original, so dif? ferent from all known to us? Has it become gradually so modified and transformed as to become perfectly unrecognisable ? No I it j^erished all at once without leaving any trace, and all leads us to be? lieve that it perished by force. After that, without transition, we find onby the traces ofa powerful race, religious and warlike, furnished with more perfect weapons, and well acquainted with the mode of polishing flints, but otherwise of little industry ancl without any art notions. We have here all indications of a brutal and conquering invasion. The troglodytes of the stone period, who conquered the soil and knew how to destroy the last remnants of the large mammals of the quaternary fauna, found themselves unable tooppose the irrup- tion of barbarians, and a middle prehistoric age succeeded the happy days ofa premature civilisation, the origin of which is at present en? tirely unknown to us. These men of the reindeer period, so advanced in certain respects, were probably the polished descendants of the rude savages of the diluvial epoch. The flint industry from the first to the second epoch became a little modified, but not transformed ; and although a more regular cutting ancl small flakes had suj^planted the rudimentary initial form, it was still effected by simple percussion, and it was without friction that the flints were worked. These changes, more? over, only apply to the hatchets, the knives always presented a re? markable uniformity. It is finally probable that the art of designing was already known to the contemporaries of the cave bear. This is shown by the curious figure which that indefatigable explorer of the caverns of the Pyrenees, M. Garrigou, has discovered upon a flint in an ossiferous grotto. This figure represents a bear, which, by the length of its cervical spinous apophyses, resembles more the cave bear than any other species of the same genus. If the interpretation of M. Garrigou be confirmed, it might be interesting to fincl that the art of designing originated in a race, no doubt perfectible, but which, at the epoch in question, was in a half savage condition, and perhaps s2</page><page sequence="20">244 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. given to anthropophagy. M. Garrigou, and M. Roujou after him, have shown several human bones upon which existed methodical per- cussions made for opening the medullary canal, so as to extract the marrow. We have now arrived at the most ancient known epoch of the life of humanity. What were then the physical characters of man % The bones of the limbs which have been found prove that the stature was not high ; and although the crania, or fragments of them, are still rare, we may assume as nearly demonstrated that our predecessors of the quaternary period had small heads, a receding forehead, and oblique jaws. But here presents itself a more serious and thorny question. In the excavations made by our young and already cele? brated colleague, M. Dupont, in Belgium, on the banks of the Meuse, between LiSge ancl Namur, he found sometime back among rhinoceros and mammoth bones in the inferior bed of the cavern la Naidette, a curious jaw, the zoological characters of which seemed at first doubt- ful. By its general form, this bone seemed a human bone, and was so in fact; but by the details of its conformation, by its excessive thick? ness, by the total absence of the mental prominence, and, finally, by the characters of dentition-characters ofthe first order, it departed from the human type and approached that of the anthropomorphic apes. Analogous, but not so decided, features had already been found in the jaw extracted by the Marquis de Vibraye from the cavern of Arcis-sur- Aube, the authenticity of which is no longer qucstioned. In order to find in the living races some of these characters considerably attenuated, we must descend to the most inferior types of Australia and New Caledonia. These do not form, as was hitherto believed, the last, or, if you prefer it, the first term of the human series. The quaternary man places himself below them, and diminishes the interval which separatesman from his zoological neighbours. But what is the signifi- cation and the import of this factl Must we see in it a proof of the transformation of species, or merely a proof of serial distribution of organic forms, of which the Darwinian theory gives an hypothetical explanation 1 This doubt, gentlemen, still persists after the discussions which so serious a subject could not fail to provoke. If it were demonstrated that the type of the Naulette man, by successive and secular modifi? cations, had become gradually perfected until it reached our own, it would certainly prove a powerful argument for the Darwinists. But do we know in what manner the quaternary races have given place to those of succeeding ages ? Who can prove to us that the succession of types has not been the consequence of a substitution of races % Do we not this day see, in several regions of America and Oceania, the</page><page sequence="21">TRANSACTIONS OF PARIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 245 European races supplant the indigenous races 1 Let us then confess that we as yet possess too small a number of facts to solve the immense problem of human origins; and let us wait until new discoveries fur- nish us with more numerous data. Whatever may turn out to be truth, it cannot humiliate us. Whether man has received his royalty as a hereditary appanage, or whether he has bravely acquired it by a long series of evolutions and struggles, is he less the lord of the earth 1 He who uses the blind forces of nature as his instruments, who makes electricity his messenger, who weighs the planets, and even analyses the substance of the sun, need he blush at any revelation in origins buried in the immeasurable depths of the past 1 No, gentlemen; and your discussion, so complete, so conscientious, so learned on the doc? trine of the human kingdom, and sustained with such eclat by MM. Pruner-Bey and de Quatrefages, has proved that man, in order to maintain his rank in nature, does not require to caluminate or to de- base the beings by which he is surrounded. All the orators who have spoken on the subject have proclaimed the intelligence of animals, and have found in them the germ of intellectual faculties, sentiments, ancl passions, which have taken their development ancl their expansion in human societies. Whilst MM. Alix, Rochet, Voisin, laid stress from various points of view, on the great superiority of man, which no one contests, MM. Sansom, Letourneau, Simonot, Roujou, Gaussin, and others have, with not less conviction, pleaded the cause of animals. The contest, it is true, turned only upon a single character, upon which exclusively rests the conception of a human kingdom, namely, the sentiment of religiousness. The question was wdiether religiousness necessarily existed among all people, whether it was sufficiently uni? versal to serve as a characteristic of humanity. MM. de Quatrefages, Pruner-Bey, and Martin de Moussy had no cloubt of it; whilst MM. Prat, Letourneau, Dally, Couclereau, and Lagneau sustained the con? trary. We must not feel surprised at these differences, which are inseparable from a subject which touches the most arduous questions of psychology. But we are happy to state that this great discussion on a subject which is so calculated to impassion the mincls, and in which the most opposite opinions obtain, has created no discord amongst us. Every one has known how to respect the convictions of his neighbour, and the urbanity of language, a consequence of mutual esteem, has always kept the contest within the serene atmosphere of science. I am far from having finished, and yet I must stop. I have no time to analyse the works which have filled up your meetings.
