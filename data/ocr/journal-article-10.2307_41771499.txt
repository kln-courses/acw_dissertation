It is the only fluted projectile known from the Old World. I j ' I Siberian Fluted Point Discovery point northeastern at the of a site fluted Siberia of Uptar bifacial may in Discovery point at the site of Uptar in northeastern Siberia may force archaeologists to reconsider the origins of the Clovis point, a hall- mark of the New World Paleoindian tradition. Named after the New Mexico town where they were first unearthed in the 1930s, Clovis points have been found throughout North and Central America. All have been dated between about 11,200 and 10,900 B.P., making Clovis the earli- est well-defined culture in the west- ern hemisphere. No fluted points, Clovis or otherwise, were known from the Old World. Archaeologists Maureen L. King of the Desert Research Institute in Las Vegas and Sergei B. Slobodin of the Department of Education in Ma- gadan, Russia, reported the discovery of the Siberian point in a recent is- sue of Science. Similar but not identi- cal to Clovis points, the artifact was found in two fragments, the first in 1985 and the second five years later. A number of unfluted stone bifaces that resemble Clovis points in basic shape were found nearby. The entire assemblage lay atop an undated lay- er of sand and gravel and beneath a volcanic level radiocarbon-dated to 8260 ±330 B.P. King and Slobodin say that Uptar "offers a tempting link" with the Pa- leoindian tradition. The origins of Clovis are debated, with opposing camps arguing either that it evolved out of a much earlier American tra- dition or that it developed quite rapidly from a Siberian tradition im- ported with early migrants just be- fore 11,200 B.P. That the Uptar point might help clarify this matter and the date of the peopling of the New World (see page 58) is generat- ing excitement among scholars. But there are problems. Though the point must be older than 8300 B.P., as King and Slobodin observe, how much older remains undeter- mined. Uptar could be earlier than the Clovis sites, and its fluted point a progenitor of Clovis; contemporane- ous with them; or even later, in which case the fluted point might have been invented in the New 14 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">Seated Canaanite deity from Hazor ¡i i i i" O È ' h World and carried back to Siberia before the land bridge was sub- merged ca. 11,000 B.P. Unfortunate- ly, the underlying sand and gravel are not easily dated, so it is unlikely that the age of the point will ever be known more precisely. Furthermore, the Uptar collection differs in many respects from Clovis assemblages, and the fluted point is a far cry from the elegant Clovis points. It could even be a unique piece that was never part of a coher- ent tradition. Answers to questions about the point await the discovery of similar points in secure, datable contexts.

Hunting Hazor' s Royal Archive Discovery tablets at of Hazor four has cuneiform strength- tablets at Hazor has strength- ened archaeologist Amnon Ben-Tor's belief that he may be on the verge of finding the first Bronze Age royal archive ever to be excavated in Is- rael. "We're in the bank," he says, "Whether there's any money in it re- mains to be seen." In the 1950s archaeologist Yigael Yadin found a cuneiform tablet dur- ing his excavations at Hazor, in northern Israel, raising hopes that an archive might be discovered at the site. Part of a bilingual Sumero- Akkadian dictionary, the tablet sug- gested the existence of a scribal school and an archive at Hazor. The four new tablets were found inside the ruins of a palace complex where a royal archive presumably would have been located. Two of the tab- lets deal with the shipment of com- modities; one is a school exercise in multiplication; and the fourth is a let- ter from one person to another com- plaining about the untruthfulness of a mutual acquaintance. Ben-Tor, of the Hebrew Universi- ty of Jerusalem, now believes there may be two archives. Two of the tablets date from the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1600 B.C.) and the other two from the Late Bronze Age (1600-1200 B.c.). He believes it is unlikely that a single archive would have been used for such a long time. Furthermore, there are indications that the architectural remains being exposed ¿ire not of one palace, as he had believed, but of two, one Middle Bronze Age and the other Late Bronze Age. While numerous royal archives have been found in ancient Meso- potamia and Egypt, no such discov- ery has been made in Israel. Particu- larly intriguing would be a Late Bronze Age archive dealing with events from the period of the initial Israelite settlement in Canaan, ca. 1200 B.c. The Book of Joshua (11:1- 1 1) records the Israelites' victory over the Canaanite city-state of Hazor, which is described as "head of all those kingdoms," culminating in its destruction by fire. The last Canaan- ite palace at the site is buried in a thick layer of ash. Also found was a one-foot-tall bronze figure of a male Canaanite deity holding up a hand in a gesture of blessing. Other finds included bull statuettes, a sword, scale armor, and a battle-ax. - .

NEWSBRIEFS Redating Serpent Mound New dates Serpent radiocarbon suggest Mound, that dates suggest that Serpent Mound, a one-quarter-mile-long earthen effigy of a snake in south-central Ohio, was built as many as 2,000 years later than previously thought. The effigy had been attrib- uted to the Adena cul- ture (1000-100 B.c.) based on the presence of Adena burials nearby. The Adena people, who lived in an area stretch- ing from the Midwest to the Atlantic coast, col- lected and began domesticating plants, improved methods of food storage, and buried their dead in mounds. Two samples of wood charcoal were obtained from undis- turbed parts of Serpent Mound. Both yielded a date of ca. A.D. 1070, suggesting that the effigy was actual- ly built by people of the Fort An- cient culture (a.D. 900-1600), a Mis- sissippian group that lived in the central Ohio Valley. Mississippian people inhabited the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi river val- leys, built huge earth- works, cultivated maize, and we're governed by powerful chiefs, ruling families, or both. The Mississippian's central- ized authority would have made possible orga- nizing a» large building project such as the con- struction of Serpent Mound. Additional evi- dence for the later date includes the remains of a Fort Ancient village 100 yards south of the mound and rat- tlesnake motifs on Mississippian gor- gets (ornaments worn on the chest) made from marine shell: The nçw dates are the result of work by University of Pittsburgh ar- 16 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">chaeology student Robert V. Fletch- er, who noticed that maps of the mound were out of date. He and a friend, Terry L. Cameron, began to remap the site on weekends. Serpent Mound had not been scientifically investigated since the late 1880s, when Frederick W. Putnam of Har- vard's Peabody Museum mapped the mound and excavated sections of the serpent's sinuous body and oval "head" (upper right in photo), which has also been described as an egg or an enlarged eye. Putnam at- tributed the creation of Serpent Mound to the Adena culture even though he found no Adena artifacts within the serpent itself. Fletcher and Cameron wanted more solid ev- idence with which to date the effigy, so they contacted archaeologists Bradley Lepper, a curator at the Ohio Historical Society, and Dee Anně Wymer, of Bloomsburg Uni- versity, who took core samples and conducted the limited excavations that yielded the samples for dating. Other studies indicate that fea- tures of Serpent Mound are aligned with both the summer solstice sunset and, less clearly, the winter solstice sunrise. A pile of burned stones once located inside the oval head area was several feet northwest of its cen- ter, possibly to make a more precise alignment with the point of the "V" in the serpent's "neck" and the sum- mer solstice sunset. The A.D. 1070 date coincides roughly with two ex- traordinary astronomical events. Light from the supernova that pro- duced the Crab Nebula first reached Earth in 1054 and remained visible, even during the day, for two weeks. The brightest appearance ever of Halley's Comet was recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1066. Could Serpent Mound have been a Native American response to such celestial events? "It is impossible to test whether or not the effigy mound represents a fiery serpent slithering across the sky," says Lepper, "but it is fun to speculate." - ; J.E.S.

Postholes and stains indicate the position of two palisade walls connected by a corner bul- wark, fitting a 1610 description of James Fort. "The position of this corner of the fort suggests that as much as 80 percent of the struc- ture's remains could be uncovered," says William Kelso, director of Jamestown Rediscovery, a ten-year effort to find and study the fort. Evi- dence for the 1607 date includes the absence of artifacts in a palisade trench, indicating that it was the first structure in the area; signs of glass- making within the fort (documents indicate that a special building was constructed outside the walls in 1609 for this purpose); and 12 coins, none of which is later than 1603. More than 90,000 artifacts have been recovered, including ceramics, a full breastplate and helmet made before 1610, weapons, book corner-plates and clasps, firearms, bullet molds, lead balls, an official, seal, smoking pipes, and cast-iron shot for light artillery. A skeleton found at the site will be studied to learn about the physical condition of the colonists. An initial examination revealed that the deceased, a male European in 18 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">his twenties, had suffered bullet wounds to a leg and shoulder. So far a 60-by- 120-foot section, or five per- cent of the fort, owned since 1893 by the Association for the Preserva- tion of Virginia Antiquities, has been excavated. Jamestown was established on May 13, 1607, by the Virginia Company, a trading concern under charter from King James I. Of the original 104 settlers, only 38 sur- vived the first year, many dying of dysentery, typhoid fever, or starva- tion. Evidence of glassmaking, including sky-blue glass beads, and the manufacture of copper jewelry indicates that the early settlers were producing goods for trade with Powhatan, chief of the Pamunkey tribe and Pocahontas' father. In exchange the Pamunkey traded corn, which was essential to the sur- vival' of the English. Eventually the settlers learned from the Pamunkey to cultivate corn and tobacco, fish, and build huts of tree bark. Native American stone tools, pieces of pot- tery, large pots, and projectile points have also been found at the site. An early seventeenth-century nav- igational chart of the James River, found last year in the Dutch National Archives, shows the posi- tion of the original fort. Drawn between 1613 and 1617, the chart is in excellent condition and remark- ably accurate when compared to satellite photos, suggesting that ero- sion of the island has not been as extensive as previously thought. The first James Fort, which cov- ered about one acre, burned down in 1608. It was replaced with a five- sided fort covering about four acres. The remains of a church tower built between 1608 and 1609 sit on the walls of the first fort. The expanded camp eventually became a town with store- and guardhouses; foun- dations of brick buildings overlap traces of the second fort's walls. Kelso hopes to trace the develop- ment of the settlement. The town was abandoned by the end of the seventeenth century.- J.E.S.

The fragments were almost certainly smuggled out of Iraq after the Gulf War, when many museums were looted. Russell says he was recently contacted by a Euro- pean museum seeking to check the provenance of the wall-reliefs in advance of purchase. The slabs came from rooms with intact wall decora- tion that has provided valuable infor- mation about the adornment of Assyrian palaces, according to Rus- sell, who photographed the reliefs in situ between 1989 and 1990. One of the missing fragments depicts two Assyrians making an offering before dragon- and serpent-shaped stan- dards attached to poles. The second shows laborers hauling a heavy object, while the third shows two dead sheep and a human corpse floating in water, an unusual image in Assyrian art. Russell says the museum did not purchase the reliefs. The artifacts, which Russell has reported missing, join some 3,000 other objects known to have been stolen from Iraqi museum collections in the past five years. McGuire Gibson of the Oriental Institute of the Uni- versity of Chicago and British scholars have published three volumes of these items, but the pillaging of Iraqi sites contin- ues. "Hundreds of people are reportedly looting [the third- millennium B.Č. Sumerian city of] Ur, and the [Iraqi] antiqui- ties department has no money to pay for guards," he says. Harsh economic conditions in Iraq are responsible for much of the loot- ing, notes Gibson, who is not opti- mistic about the return of such looted material to Iraq.

I Secret Religion of Slaves Five historic been caches found district in of a artifacts of house Annapolis, in have the been found in a house in the historic district of Annapolis, providing evidence of the secret reli- gious life of enslaved African Ameri- cans. Discovered in Slayton House, built in the 1770s and now owned by the Historic Annapolis Founda- tion, the caches include pierced coins, broken glass, white buttons, black beads, common pins, a brass ring, and pieces of bone. "We stud- ied the excavation reports of 30 sites in Maryland and Virginia where slaves lived," says Mark Leone, a professor of anthropology at the Uni- versity of Maryland at College Park. "At about half of those sites, caches of artifacts have been found in the northeast corners of workrooms, un- der héarths, or in root cellars, sug- gesting a pattern of burying ritual objects." That information led Leone to predict where similar caches might be found in Slayton House. Subse- quent excavations uncovered three caches in workrooms and two be- neath a hearth. "We now know de- finitively that slaves practiced reli- gious rituals," adds Leone, "but, just as important, we know where to go to look for the proof." Frederick Lamp, curator of Afri- can Art at the Baltimore Museum of Art, examined similar caches from Charles Carroll House, also in his- toric Annapolis. He says that their positions in northeast corners and under hearths suggest a consistent, ritual use of the objects. He notes that white stones were used in shrines in West Africa to venerate ancestors, who weťe thought to pro- tect the community. The artifacts from Carroll and Slayton houses may have been similar offerings. Gladys-Marie Fry, a professor of English and folklore at the University of Maryland at College Park, has studied slaves' autobiographies and life histories from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. She agrees that the objects reflect concerns for safety. Protection from the ^màster or over- seer, healing or "secret doctoring" (making teas, salves, and amulets to treat injury and disease), and divina- tion could have been the intended purposes of the cached objects.

Archaeologists with the Combined Caesarea Expeditions, led by Haifa University and the Univer- sity of Maryland, are interpreting the find as a reminder of the wealth of the city, a prosperous entry point for Christian pilgrims visiting the Holy Land during the Late Roman and early Byzantine era (A.D. 324-640). The fill in which the gold pieces were discovered suggests they were dumped under the floor rather than being intentionally buried. Six of the pieces are decorated with a distinctly European interlace pattern. Two others form a buckle whose catch plate is incised with stylized bird heads and whose clasp bears a monogram of the Greek name Stephanos. The name was common during the Late Roman era, al- though it is tempting to associate it and therefore the gold find with either of the two governors of that name who served in Caesarea in the late sixth and early seventh centuries A.D. The governors' dates are com- patible with both the style of the dec- oration on the gold and the form of the monogram. The Late Roman era at Caesarea ended with the Arab conquest in A.D. 640, and perhaps the gold was lost then. - -Frederick A.

The hotels are intended to bolster the tourist trade and alle- viate the country's poverty. The government hotel will be located two to three miles from Angkor Wat, the most famous of the temples, on a parcel known as Hotel City encompassing four and one-half square miles. In an at- tempt to control development near the site, the government banned construction of large hotels outside the complex. Local officials, how- ever, recently approved building plans for five large private hotels along the main road to Angkor Wat. Ground clearing for the hotels, which will have a total of 1,295 rooms, has already begun, and Cambodia's two co-prime min- isters have since given their approval. Meanwhile a Malaysian com- pany hopes to attract 1,500 people every night to Angkor Wat with a sound-and-light show it is develop- ing. The show purports to describe ancient events, but conservationists and even King Norodom Sihanouk contend that they will be crass, gar- ish spectacles with no basis in his- torical fact.

Boyd and J. Philip Dering of Texas A&amp;M Uni- versity, who believe anthropomor- phic figures in the art may represent shamans who used the plants to communicate with the spirit world. Boyd and Dering say that images of spiny ovals attached to staffs closely resemble the seed pods of jim- son weed, and that disk-shaped crowns of the peyote cactus are rep- resented by dots and deer impaled by arrows. Deer and peyote are linked in the religious beliefs of the modern Huichol Indians of northern Mexico, whose shamans ritually hunt and shoot the peyote cactus with arrows as if it were a deer. Boyd and Dering believe the two plants were used as early as 4,000 years ago, based on carbon-dated pigments and peyote and jimson-weed remains from mid- dens at the sites. Anthropomorphic figures are often depicted in the rock paintings alongside images of peyote and jim- son weed. Boyd says that ethno- graphic and historical accounts of Indians from the American South- west to Mexico indicate that "these are the two plants most commonly used by shamans to access the spirit world." - Brett Leslie Freese 24 Archaeology</page><page sequence="12">F rom left : Towney Anderson, Senator Patrick Leahy, and Arthur Cohn with bombs and portrait ofGeiieral P.

Epidemiologists Patrick Olson and Charles Hames of the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, and Abram Bennensoii and Nicholas Genovese of San Diego State Uni- versity believe that Thucydides' description of the disease in his his- tory of the Peloponnesian War matches the symptoms of ebola, which killed more than 300 people in Zaire and Sudan last year. Thucydides wrote that after the disease's "abrupt onset, persons in good health were seized first with strong fevers, redness and burning of the eyes, and the inside of the mouth, both the throat and tongue, immedi- ately was bloody-looking and expelled an unusually foul breath. Following these came sneezing, hoarseness... a powerful cough... and every kind of bilious vomiting...and in most cases an empty heaving ensued that pro- duced a strong spasm." Scholars had thought that Athens suffered an outbreak of measles, smallpox, typhus, or bubonic plague. All these ailments, says Olson, would have been preceded by a cough pro- ducing blood or mucus. Thucydides wrote that .the cough was "empty." Olson and his colleagues contend that the description of the dry cough in Thucydides' account matches that of ebola, basing their theory in part on a retranslation of Thucydides. They believe that the Greek word lugx, which Thucydides uses in his description of symptoms and which had previously been translated as "retching" or "dry heaving," may have been the word for hiccup.
