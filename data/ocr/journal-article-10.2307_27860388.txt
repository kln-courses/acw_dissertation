Princeton, New Jer sey, W. van Nostrand Co., Inc., 1961 ; pp. + 259. $ 6.50. It is difficult to believe, in the present climate of thought, that a symposium on the question of relativism in human affairs could be organized without the presence of someone competent to present the anthropological position. Lacking a student skilled in handling cross cultural data, only a welter of confusions could result. And this is precisely what occurred in the symposium that forms the basis for this book. Let us see, first of all, the disciplines that were represented in the group. The editors, according to the biographical note about them on the book-jacket, are sociologists, both on the staff of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Of the contributors, one is a psychologist (Car michael), one is a botanist (Zirkle), one a theologian (Casserley), two are political scientists (Leoni and Strauss), one a economist (von Mises), one an historian (Malin). There were also a philosopher (Vivas), a professor of English (Weaver), an educationalist (Tietz), and a linguist (Pei). There were thus both social scientists and humanists ; the group included those whose interests lay in the realm of ideas as well as those whose concern is with practical affairs. As one reads through the chapters, a certain homogeneity in point of view becomes apparent. There is no member of the symposium who is not disturbed at the developments that mark the present trends of our culture ; none who does not view with alarm contemporary changes in morals, modes of behavior, patterns of thought and ways of expres sion. The book gives the feeling that the discussions at the meetings where these papers were presented must have carried a strong emotional component. One is tempted to raise the question : Is not this book an example of the perennial cry of the elders against the innovations of the oncoming generation ? Only in these terms can we explain the note of dissatisfaction that appears again and again when new ways manifest in various aspects of our culture enter into the discussion.

It is perhaps not without significance that the only papers wherein this feeling of dismay at change is subordinated to the intellectual problem are the two final ones on linguistics. Particularly in the chap ter written by Pei, one feels the intellectual serenity that comes when the range of variation in any aspect of total human behavior is squarely faced, accepted as a fact to be reckoned with, and its implications objectively analyzed. It is worth noting, moreover, that this is really the only paper that makes a substantive contribution. This is found in its discussion of the roots of linguistic relativism in earlier thinking. Its analysis of relativistic excesses in the field of linguistics are coldly, clearly and convincingly analyzed. One can only say that it deserves a better setting than it has. Most prominent among the confusions in the book is that between intra-cultural and cross-cultural relativism. It is difficult to understand why such a simple conception should be so hard to grasp. The kind of intra-cultural relativism envisaged by the various contributors ? that is, the denial of validity to standards of conduct operating within a society ? would not only bring on moral, but perceptual anarchy, and social life would grind to a halt. Every society has its codes ; they are stable, and only to those within a given group does change seem im portant. Change in values and beliefs constantly occur, but with regu larity. This is why, when seen in retrospect, we find all ways of life exhibit the phenomenon of cultural drift. The culture of no social entity is marked by the moral disintegration that intra-cultural rela tivism, if practiced, would bring on. When we move to value-judgements drawn on a cross-cultural basis ? and it is this, and this alone, that is the concern of cultural relati vists ? we are faced with quite a different problem. This has to do with the question of the existence of absolutes and universals in human culture. The problem is essentially methodological ? how any human being, enculturated to the evaluative and perceptual modes of a par ticular way of life, can avoid the enculturative screening of experience in judging cultures other than his own. That is, since every society has its particular schedule of absolutes, how do we, as human beings who accept the schedule of our own society, attain objectivity in evalu ating the schedules of other societies ? The cultural relativist is content to withhold judgement until empirical proofs of the existence of abso lutes that are also universals can be adduced. In anthropology, the importance of this question has long been recognized, but in this book it scarcely even enters. Carmichael, one</page><page sequence="3">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 471 of the few contributors who recognises the existence of the cross cultural problem in relativism, like his colleagues in the symposium, becomes enmeshed in the shift from this to intra-cultural applications. Thus he states, "The idea... that there are some established esthetic values in the arts is ... hard for those who now like to say that a fashionable non-objective painter who reports that he experiences great emotional satisfaction as he paints is necessarily as satisfactory an artist as was Titian-." Or, again, "If we accept the suggestions ... that there may be some absolutes in human conduct that can be discovered, we must have the courage to apply this knowledge in deciding the content of the education that we wish to furnish for the children of this or any other age" (p. 11). The statement of Vivas that, "Cultural relativism leads to individual relativism, which is to say, moral nihilism" (p. 52), flies in the face of everything we have learned from the com parative study of the processes of cultural conditioning. And these are only samples of the many other examples of confusion on this point that can be found. The only chapter in the book which invokes anthropological findings is that of Vivas, who uses the writings of anthropologists as a stick with which to beat the cultural relativists. The doctrine of relativism, we are told, holds that, "The criteria of value judgements are deter mined by the culture. From this it follows that it is not possible to judge the values of one culture in terms of any criteria except its own, and, therefore, the objective indices of cultural inferiority or superiority cannot be established. An American cannot feel superior to Malinow ski's savages because they are lously and dirty. It's just a matter of cultural difference ? although I do not see how we can deny they are lousy" (p. 46). Granting the validity of the statement about the Trobriand Islanders, to which no citation is given, one does not deny the fact; what is puzzling is the assertion that the American, free of lice, "cannot feel superior" to the lousy Melanesian. He not only can, but does feel superior; Vivas obviously does so. However, one could scarcely hold that our American, in his response, is reacting as a scientific student of culture. Vivas bases most of his argument on an enthymeme : "A culture determines the values acknowledged by its members. Therefore a culture determines the values its members ought to acknowledge." The "implicit premise," we are told, is that:</page><page sequence="4">472 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. "The values determined by a culture are the values that the members of that culture ought to acknowledge." Yet there is no anthropological relativist, as far as is known, who either as a scientist or in his philosophy would sanction the "ought" in the shift from the first to the second of these propositions. Indeed, if we move from moral to perceptual relativism, the propositions lead to a reductio ad absurdum. How "ought" one to divide the continuum of color that makes up the spectrum ? Even as stated, the enthymeme vanishes, for the so-called "implicit premise" is but a rewording of the explicit statements out of which it presumably arises. Space does not permit an examination here of how, moving from this distortion of the logic that directs the relativist position, the discussion in this chapter also distorts the position of the anthropologists who are cited. One can only conclude that this symposium would have been the better if it had entirely ignored the anthropological contribution. The anti-relativist position of the papers reveal other points worthy of remark. Zirkle, accepting the universality of "scientific" relativism, seems to forget scientific objectivity when it comes to the science of man ; certainly his discussion exhibits no lack of value-judgements. Most striking is the doctrine of what may be called neo-social-Darwinism, arrived at by an analogy to the biological struggle for survival. Animal behavior patterns, he tells us, "have been preserved, and developed by nature to just the extent to which they aid the behaving organism to survive and reproduce" (p. 28). Quite aside from the anthropomorphism found in ascribing will and purpose to the reification of the concept, "nature," anthropologists must challenge his readiness to argue, from analogy, that survival is a criterion for evaluating human cultures. We read that "deviant subcultures are... checked and controlled almost automatically by natural selection" (p. 32); that "if the test of survival is applied to the different human cultures, they can easily be recognized as being fit or unfit" (p. 43). Unfortunately for the argument, all existing cultures have survived. How, in terms of this analogy, is the worth of these many surviving cultures to be "scientifically" evaluated ? Casserly, the theologian, gives one answer. He draws a distinction between "the absolute, which is certainly never absolutely known, and that which is absolutely known, for the absolutely known is nearly always not merely a relativity, but even a triviality" (p. 107). Present ing the thesis that "while it is true that man as we know him is always man in the context of the local and the temporal, it is also true that</page><page sequence="5">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 473 man as he knows himself is always man face to face with the absolute" (p. 109), he cites the role of the prophet as "an important criterion" for evaluating cultures. "There are cultures so placidly successful as almost completely to exclude the prophetic challenges. There are others, on the contrary, that seem by their very nature to encourage and foster it..." Hence "we may distinguish between relatively closed and rela tively open cultures and insist strongly on the higher value of the open kind of culture" (p. 109?110). One can but wonder how, in these terms, he grades the cultures of Africa and North America, which have long had "prophetic challenges"; to say nothing of the presumably lousy Melanesians, with their prophet movements called Cargo cults. It is not possible here to give further examples of the confusions that mark this book. Because it is one of the most extended series of state ments against cultural relativism, it is important for anthropologists to read it. For those of us who accept the logical postulates of cross cultural research, and are willing open-mindly to abide by the scientific principle of basing our conclusions on facts, the volume will provide many enlightening instances of ethnocentric reactions to* the relativistic point of view. That it has proved disturbing to this sampling of students from so many disciplines testifies to the power of cultural relativism, giving evidence of the stimulus which the relativistic principle, willy nilly, carries even to those who have not been exposed to the cross cultural methods of anthropology.
