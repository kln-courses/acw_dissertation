<plain_text><page sequence="1">Drinking Vessels (Rhyta) from Tel Ya'oz IRIT Z1FFER, RAZ KLETTER AND ORIT SEGAL (PP. 25*-37*) Three drinking vessels, perhaps part of a drinking set, were found in a Persian-period building at Tel Ya'oz: An almost complete human-headed rhyton (Fig. 1) and two animal headsâ€”a lion's (Fig. 2) and a ram's (Fig. 3), probably parts of cups or rhyta. The most extraordinary among these vessels is, undoubtedly, the anthropomorphic rhyton</page><page sequence="2">204 Summaries (Fig. 1). Made of reddish brown clay and slipped red, this horn-shaped rhyton has a protome in the form of an Egyptian sphinx wearing an artificial beard, a nemes-headcloth with ram's horns and a solar disk. These features are typical of the Egyptian god Amun-Re (identified in the fourth century BCE with Theban Zeus) or of a Pharaoh presented as Amun-Re. The anthropomorphic rhyton from Tel Ya'oz, a local adaptation of an Achaemenid vessel that was used in the royal banquet, must have taken on a local meaning. The strikingly Egyptian appearance of its head looks as if it could have been created by an Egyptian working on the Levantine coast, or by a Levantine trained in Egyptian iconography. Anthropomorphic rhyta are known in silver from Thrace and the Caucasus, and in bronze from the Levant. The metal vessels and their humble pottery versions point to the adaptation of prestigious Achaemenid practices by the local elites. Captions to Illustrations Fig. 1. Anthropomorphic rhyton. Fig. 2.
