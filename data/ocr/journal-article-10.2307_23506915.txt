<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philo and the Aggadah BERNARD J. BAMBERGER New New York City A.A. The Problem It It is now more than four centuries since Azariah dei Rossi published the pioneer study of Philo's relation to rabbinic tradition.1 For a long time it was the only study. But during the last hundred years the subject has been re-examined by a number of scholars, Jewish and Christian. This re search, however, has not yet led to agreement on the results. Some distinguished savants hold that the parallels between Philo and rabbinic literature indicate that Philo was well acquainted with Palestinian tradi tions.2 Others deny that the parallels are either numerous or impressive, or that they prove Philo's control of the material later incorporated into the Talmud and Midrashim.3 Dr. Samuel Sandmel, in his admirable study of the subject,4 suggests that this surprising diversity of opinion is rooted in a broader question of Philonian interpretation. Was Philo essentially a Jewish thinker who clothed his doctrine in Greek language and style? Or was he basically a Hellenist whose warm attachment to the religion of his fathers — an emotional, not intellectual attachment — led him to read his philosophic and mystical ideas into the Scriptural text? Those who hold the first view, says Sandmel, stress the importance of the rabbinic parallels; those who hold the second view minimize their significance. Whereas study of the parallels should help one decide the basic question, scholars have been inclined to judge the parallels in the light of their preconceived notions about Philo's place in Judaism. In returning to this subject once again, I am heartened by the fact that I am not seeking to bolster any interpretation of Philo's thought.

BAMBERGER [2] cern is with the history of the aggadah; and for that subject, the question how much Philo knew of the Palestinian tradition, though interesting, is not crucial. I can therefore hope to maintain a reasonable degree of objectivity. But one can go further. Philo's extensive acquaintance with Greek literature is evident to the most casual reader of his works. But his acquaintance with Jewish lore was at most limited and fragmentary. The question is: Do we have any clear evidence that Philo had any significant sources of Jewish knowledge, aside from the Septuagint? I am not aware of any systematic attempt to demonstrate that Philo was acquainted with the Palestinian aggadic tradition. Many scholars have assumed that he was, and have piled up quantities of alleged parallels, some of them demonstrably mistaken, and many of them unconvincing. Thereby they have hurt their cause more than they have helped it. The present study is an effort to show that Philo had a modest knowledge of the Palestinian traditions later incorporated into rabbinic literature; the demonstration, in my opinion, supports this assertion with a high degree of probability, if not absolute proof. B. The Method We begin with the full acknowledgment that the bulk of Philo's exposi tions are remote in content and spirit from the aggadah. By and large, his handling of biblical texts and his interpretation of biblical personages and events is utterly different from what is found in Talmud and Midrash. We are seeking no more than bits and pieces of aggadic lore in Philo; and whether we find a few more or a few less, we will not have to revise the basic judgment that Philo's enterprise and that of the rabbinic preachers were very unlike. In this search, we must follow certain critical rules. 1. 1. No conclusion can be drawn from a parallel that derives entirely from the biblical text, or from the obvious implications of the text. Thus, both Philo and the Rabbis5 implicate Canaan in the sin of Ham against Noah. But this does not prove borrowing on either side. For Scripture plainly says that Noah cursed Canaan, and surely the righteous Noah would not have done so had not the curse been deserved. 2. No inference can be drawn from the presence in Philo and the rabbinic sources of commonplaces of Hellenistic culture. Philo and the (5) Quaestiones Gen. 11:70,77 (cf. Sob. 31 ff., 44 ff.); Gen. Rabbah 36:7. (All quotations from Philo are from the Loeb Classics ed., translated by Colson and Whittaker, the Quaes tiones by R. Marcus. The abbreviations for the Philonic works are those given in vol. I of that ed., pp. xxiii-xxiv).</page><page sequence="3">[3] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 155 Rabbis alike speak of the wheel of fortune6 and the supposed light mindedness of women,7 but they need not have borrowed these clichés from one another. 3. Nothing is accomplished by gathering instances where the re semblance is so slight and uncertain that a connection cannot even be disproved, let alone established. The accumulation of unconvincing items has been a besetting sin of Philonian scholars. Even so cautious an inves tigator as E. Stein,8 who generally avoided questions of priority and was content to show how a motif that appears in the Midrash as aggadah appears in Philo as allegory, cited some instances where the resemblance is discouragingly vague. This tendency was carried to extremes by S. Bel kin.9 If Philo had ever informed us that he spent six months in the school of Hillel, we might be justified in finding echoes of Pharisaic teaching throughout his work. But when our problem is to decide whether Philo knew anything at all about Pharisaism, the faint items have no value whatever. In short, conclusions can be drawn only from what might be called unexpected parallels, from cases where resemblance in thought is suffi ciently close and sufficiently distinctive to justify the presumption that two passages are somehow related. 4. Even then we must be cautious. Literary history records many cases of two authors saying the same thing in virtually the same words, even though it can be proved that one had no knowledge of the other. In any single instance, even a striking parallel may be accidental. But the likeli hood of coincidence diminishes rapidly as the number of parallels in creases. In the present case there is enough material to warrant the assumption of a real connection. 5. We must recognize that a parallel may point in one of two directions. It may indicate a borrowing by Philo from Pharisaic traditon; or it may indicate a borrowing by the Rabbis from Hellenistic culture, of which Philo provides our most extensive record. (It is unlikely that any of the talmudic sages was acquainted directly with Philo's writings.) This fact was largely disregarded by some early workers in the field, for instance Z. Frankel, who seems to have assumed that every parallel implies a borrow ing from Palestine by the Alexandrine writers. To this tendency J. Freu (6) Deus 176; Lev. Rabbah 34:9.

BAMBERGER [4] denthal10 rightly took exception, and he enumerated a number of in stances where the borrowing was done by the Rabbis. (Some of his exam pies are more convincing than others.) Our only recourse is to examine each case critically, for content, tone, and expression, so as to decide whether a Palestinian or an Alexandrine origin is more likely. There are a number of parallels concerning which scholars are generally agreed that they are of Hellenistic origin, and these items will not be included in our presentation. 6. The importance and validity of a parallel are enhanced when it is one of language as well as of content. Particularly impressive are cases where two items are combined both by Philo and by the aggadists. Before we present the evidence that Philo had a modest knowledge of Palestinian Jewish lore, three other preliminary matters must be men tioned briefly. First, a certain amount of Alexandrine aggadah has been preserved in the writings of Eusebius and Josephus; a chief source of both was the lost work of Artapanus. Philo does not allude to these stories, which (if he knew them) were alien to his rarefied tastes. The one Alexandrine legend he mentions concerns the origin of the Septuagint. Philo tells the story much as it is found in the Letter of Aristeas — with one important exception. According to Pseudo-Aristeas, the seventy scholars made sepa rate translations of the Torah, and then adjusted their divergences and disagreements in conference. But Philo, as well as the Talmud, reports that by a miracle the seventy independent translations proved to be word for word the same.11 Second, it is clear that the term "unwritten law" in Philo usually means not the oral Torah of the Pharisees, but a universal law that preceded the Mosaic revelation. We need not discuss here the contention that in a few cases, Philo uses the term "unwritten law" to designate Jewish tradition.12 But that Philo was aware of extra-biblical Jewish teachings is beyond doubt; he states that his life of Moses is based on what he had learned both from the sacred books and from some of the elders of the nation. "For," says Philo, "I always interwove what I was told with what I read."13 (îo) J. Freudenthal,HelUnistische Studien I, Breslau, 1874, pp. 68 ff. F. also notes a third possibility: some similar notions could have originated independently in Palestine and in Alexandria. He seems to go too far, however, in declaring that only such common teachings can be regarded as Palestinian in origin which demonstrably arose in Palestine before contacts with Hellenistic culture began. On p. 66, note ** he acknowledges that Beer, Sachs, Joel, and Graetz had previously pointed out Hellenistic influences on Judaism. (11) Mos. 11:25-44, especially 37 ff. (cf. Aristeas 302); Megillah 9a. (12) So Wolfson I, pp. 188 ff. (13) Mos. 1:4. The importance of this statement was already noted by Siegfried, p. 146.</page><page sequence="5">[5] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 157 Third, one sometimes encounters in Philo (and also in Josephus) com ments on, or expansions of the biblical material that have a markedly aggadic flavor, though they seem to have no parallel in rabbinic texts. Such impressions are admittedly subjective, but they persist. They could mean that Philo and Josephus have preserved some bits of aggadic lore that did not survive in the traditional text, or else that these writers occasionally tried their hand at the traditional manner of interpretation.14 C. The Evidence 1. 1. How Many Things Were Created on the First Day? Philo states (Op. 29) that on the first day the incorporeal forms of the following were created: heaven, earth, air, void, water, lifebreath (pneuma), and light. These items number seven. Now Jubilees 2:3 states that seven great works were created on the first day. This summary statement follows a long list of creations; the number seven was probably arrived at by counting all the angels and spirits here enumerated as a single creation, with the following result: heaven, earth, water, angels and spirits, abysses, darkness (=eventide), and dawn (=light). Since Philo regarded the angels as denizens of the air (Gig. 6 ff. and frequently), his item "air" may correspond to Jubilees' angels and spirits. The Talmud (Hagigah 12a) counts ten creations on the first day: heaven, earth, tohu, bohu, light, darkness, wind, water, the duration of the day, and the duration of the night. The last two items are not on any other list. The omission of the angels from the talmudic list is to be expected; against the older view of Jubilees, the Rabbis insisted that the angels were not created until the second (or even the fifth) day — to preclude the supposition that God had any assistance in bringing the world into be ing.15 On the other hand, tohu and bohu (Gen. 1:2) may originally have Less convincing is Spec. 1:8 (= De Circumcisione II), cited by Siegfried, p. 145, Wolfson, I 193. For "the divinely gifted men who made deep research into the writings of Moses" might weU have been Alexandrians, earlier practitioners of the philosophic-allegorical Midrash. The reasons ascribed to them for the rite of circumcision are certainly not in the spirit of the Palestinian aggadah. . (14) See below, n. 24. Further instances from Philo: Before the Fall, man and animals spoke spoke a common tongue, Quaestiones Gen. 1:32,cf. Op. 156(soalsoJosephus Ant. 1:41,Jub. 3:28). Isaac regained his sight, Quaestiones Gen. IV: 196. Isaac could eat two kids when he was old; how much greater was his capacity in his prime, ibid. 200.. Moses entered the thick cloud through an opening caused by the divine speech, Quaestiones Exod. 11:48. From Josephus: A dew congealed around Moses' hands to form the manna, Ant. 111:26. The sacrifice of Exod. 18:12 took place in the vicinity of the burning bush, ibid. 63. During the violent storm over Sinai and the camp, the rest of the sky remained serene, ibid. 79. ( 15) Gen. Rabbah 1:3 (Theodor p. 5) and parallels.</page><page sequence="6">158 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [6] counted as a single item, thereby reducing the number to seven. They may have corresponded to the void of Philo and the abysses of Jubilees, just as wind (ruah) may be the same as Philo's pneutna. The medieval Midrash known as Pirke Derabbi Eliezer (ch. 3) has the same list as the Talmud, but omits the last two items. Another late work, Midrash Tadshe, which contains a number of echoes of Jubilees, enumer ates the first created works as heaven, earth, water, darkness, wind, depths, and light.16 All the items listed are named in the opening verses of Genesis, and therefore Urbach17 denies that these statements have any common source but Scripture itself. But the recurrence of the number seven (which may have originally extended to the lists in Hagigah and Pirké Derabbi Eliezer), and the striking similarity of all the lists from Jubilees through Tadshe suggest more than coincidence.18 It is no surprise that Philo speaks of the creation of incorporeal forms which preceded the sensible world, while the other sources refer to material entities. 2. Separation of Light and Darkness.VU hen God created light and darkness, says Philo, He "in His perfect knowledge of their mutual contrariety and natural conflict, parted them from one another by a wall of separation." He established boundaries, evening and dawn, between them. (Op. 33 f.) This graphic language seems strange coming from a philosopher who knew that darkness is merely the absence of light. It is much like the parable of R. Johanan and R. Simeon b. Lakish in Gen. R. 3:6. A king had two generals who were constantly contending for the right to command the army by day; he therefore called them in and assigned a time of duty to each.19 3. What Was Created on the Second Day? Philo observed (Op. 37) that the creation of the sensible heavens was assigned an entire day "by reason of the dignity which heaven occupies among the objects of sense." Here (16) Midrash Tadshe ch. 6. I cite from J.D. Eisenstein, Osar Midrashim, N.Y. 1915, p. 477a. (17) Ephraim E.

V, p. 7, n. 15, which mixes in some irrelevant references to the ten or seven attributes of God. The material in this section and other similar parallels are treated fully in A. Epstein, "Le Livre des Jubilés, Philo, et le Midrasch Tadsché,"Revue des Études Juives, vol. XXI (1891) pp. 80-97 an(l XXII pp. 1 ff. Epstein's notions about the origin of Jubilees (p. 81), however, can no longer be taken seriously. ( 19) This parallel was noted by Siegfried p. 140 and by Ch. Albeck,EinleitungundRegister zum Bereschit Rabba I, Berlin 1931, p. 85.</page><page sequence="7">[7] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 1 59 again we have a view recorded in Jubilees (2:4), which emphasizes that this was the only thing created on the second day. And Tadshe echoes this: "only the firmament."20 This is apparently connected with the view of Jubilees that the angels were created on the first day.21 When the Rabbis rejected that view and assigned the second day for the creation of the angels, they had to drop the notion that this day was reserved for the creation of the firmament alone. 4. Fruit Trees. An old Midrash22 reports that at creation fruit and field produce were ripe at once. Similarly, Gen. Rabbah 10:4 tells that a variety of fig, which now takes three years to mature, was ready for eating on the third day of creation.23 This same notion is expounded at length by Philo (Op. 40-42), who marvels that the trees at creation bore fruit in its prime. He alludes to this legend elsewhere (Quaestiones Gen. 11:47)to support the statement that after the Flood the trees at once bore springtime fruit. We have no parallel to this last in regular aggadic literature, but it certainly has the aggadic flavor, even to the characteristic expression, "And do not wonder that. . ." (ve°al titmah).24 5. Why Was Man Created Last? To this question Philo and the Rabbis each give four answers. Only one appears in both lists, but there the agreement is striking. Philo's first reason is that God "made ready for (man) all things in the world . . . that he should be at a loss for none of the means of living and living well .... Just as givers of a banquet... do not send out the sum monses to supper till they have put everything in readiness for the feast."25 It should be noted that this explanation is ascribed by Philo to those who have studied the laws of Moses in minute detail.26 This agrees with the fourth reason of the aggadists: (Man was created last) "that he might enter at once upon a feast. They offered a parable: To (20) See n. 16. (21) Above, n. 15. (22) Sifra Behuqqotai 1 on Lev. 26:4, Weiss ed. p. 1 lod, which promises a return of these conditions in the messianic age. (23) Cf. Gen. Rabbah 12:6 and Theodor's notes. (24) Seen. 14above. (25) Op. 77 f., cf. Quaestiones Exod. 1:1. Philo also extends the parable to the case of a spectacle for which invitations are issued. Philo's other explanations, Op. 79-83. (26) This point is stressed by Siegfried, p. 149, and by A. Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine Doctrine of God, II: Essays in Anthropomorphism, N.Y. 1968, p. 19. Stein p. 7 agrees that Philo and the Rabbis had a common source.</page><page sequence="8">160 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [8] what is this like? To the case of a king who built a palace, inaugurated it, prepared a feast, and then invited guests."27 Philo's other reasons are 2) for the instruction of future generations in self control (?); 3) creation, which began with heaven, best of imperishable creatures, fittingly ended with man, best of perishable creatures, a kind of miniature heaven;28 4) that by his sudden appearance among the other animals he might impose his mastery upon them.29 The other reasons of the Rabbis are: 1) that heretics might not say that man participated in the creation of the world; 2) to teach man humility, since the smallest gnat preceded him;30 3) that man might enter at once upon the performance of a commandment, i.e., the observance of the sabbath. 6.6. The Number Seven. We have already noted parallels between Philo and Jubilees, which are echoed in the late Midrash Tadshe. There are also instances where Tadshe reproduces material from Jubilees, though no parallel is found in Philo. But there are likewise some striking re semblances between Philo and Tadshe, for which we find nothing to correspond in Jubilees or any other known Palestinian source. They may derive from an old source, of which Philo had some knowledge and which was still available to the author of Tadshe; or else the latter may have had some indirect access to Philo's writings. This material concerns the properties and applications of the number seven, which Philo discusses at some length in Op. 90-128 and more briefly in L.A. 1.8-18. The parallels are in Tadshe ch. 6. a) Op. 115: "The full tale of the band of the Pleiades is made up of seven stars. When they are setting, furrows are opened for sowing; and when they are about to rise, they announce reaping time." Tadshe: "The seven stars of the Pleiades — when they are setting, men plow the earth to sow it; and when they rise, it is the time of harvest." (27) Tosefta Sanhédrin 8:9; Bavli ibid. 38a; Yerushalmi ibid; chap. 4 end. Cf. Gen. Rabbah 8:6. See Ginzberg, vol. V, p. 67, where the citations from Sac. and Dec. are not directly relevant. (28) Urbach, p. 193, n. 7, notes a remarkable parallel to this in Midrash Hagadol Gen. 1:26 (Margulies' ed. p. 54). What connection there could be between Philoand this medieval Yemenite compilation remains obscure; but see below n. 38. (29) Ginzberg, vol. V, p. 120, n. 113, finds this statement parallel to rabbinic utterances about man's ability to cow the animals; but these statements do not allude to man having been created last. (30) Philo, Op. 87 f. argues, to the contrary, that being created last was no evidence of man's inferiority: the driver stands behind the horses, the pilot at the stern of the ship. Urbach, p. 193, n. 8, assumes that Philo knew the rabbinic teaching and took issue with it; but there is no proof that this assumption is correct.</page><page sequence="9">[g] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 61 נ b) Op. 118 lists the seven visible parts of the body: head, breast, belly, two hands, two feet. In L.A. 1.12, Philo reckons hands and feet as one each, and adds neck and abdomen to make up seven. Tadshe: Head, neck, belly, two hands, two feet. c) Op. and L.A. ibid, list seven internal organs: stomach, heart, lung, spleen, liver, two kidneys. Tadshe: stomach, testes,31 oesophagus, trachea, spleen, liver, and kidneys. d) It is not remarkable that Philo and Tadshe agree as to the seven orifices of the head: more interesting is their agreement that there are seven bodily discharges. Op. 123 lists tears from the eyes, purgings through the nostrils, phlegm from the mouth, discharges from "two receptacles" in front and behind, "perspiration exuding through the whole body," and semen (similarly L.A. I. 13). Tadshe is quite similar. It also has the phrase "in front and behind," though here "in front" seems to mean nasal discharge, since urine is mentioned separately; it also has the phrase "perspiration of the whole body." e) In the same context, Op. and Tadshe list seven movements: upward, downward, to the right, to the left, forward, backward, and circular.32 7. Enoch. The brief account of Enoch in Gen. 5:21 ff. is altogether laudatory. That he "walked with God" is similar to what is said of Noah; that "God took him" reminds us of the ascent of Elijah. The LXX renders "walked with God" by "was pleasing to God" — free, but in the spirit of the original. The apocalypses that bear Enoch's name, and some of the other pseudepigrapha carry the glorification of Enoch to unparalleled ex tremes; Enoch is transformed into an angel of the highest rank. The Hebrew text of Ben Sira 44.16 reads: "Enoch walked with God and was taken;/He was an example (or miracle) of knowledge to all genera tions." But the Greek Ben Sira renders: "Enoch pleased the Lord (as in Gen. 5:24) and was taken up;/He was an example of repentance to all generations." Our present Hebrew text is probably original, for in 49:14 the Greek version also glorifies Enoch: "No one like Enoch has been created on earth,/For he was taken up from the earth." Indeed, the LXX (3 נ) Heb. segel; for this word see E. Ben Jehudah, Thesaurus, vol. VIII, p. 3951. (32) The sources also mention the seven ages of man, a Hellenistic commonplace. But Op. 103 and L.A. 1:10 do not agree fully, and Tadshe is not much like either. See further Eccl. Rabbah 1:2, Tanhuma Piqqude 3. In Op. 124, L.A. 1:9, Philo mentions the belief that seven-month babies are viable and eight-month babies are not. This view, which goes back at least to Aristotle, is not found in Tadshe, but appears in older rabbinic literature. See S. Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, N.Y. 1950, pp. 76 f.</page><page sequence="10">162 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [10] here goes further than the Hebrew, which has "Few" instead of "No one."33 The striking change in the Greek of 44.16 is no accident. It is typical of a trend that began in pre-Christian times and continued for several cen turies — a trend to "cut Enoch down to size."34 Many people were evi dently troubled by the notion that a human being could be elevated to an angelic, quasi-divine level, as described in I and II Enoch. The Wisdom of Solomon 4.10 f. is probably35 referring to Enoch when it says, "Being well pleasing to God, he was cherished ,/And living among sinners, he was translated./He was plucked away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding,understanding,/Or guile deceive his soul." The view that Enoch's virtue was shaky, and that his translation was not the reward of perfect saintliness but a precaution to get him into heaven while still eligible, is found also in Philo, Quaestiones Gen. 1:82: "For although he did not altogether remain in piety, none the less that period of time was reckoned to him as belonging to the order of the praiseworthy, for he was pleasing (to God) so many years." A fourth century Rabbi put it more sharply: "Enoch was inconsistent (hanef can hardly be rendered here by "hypocrite"!), sometimes righteous, sometimes wicked. So God said: While he is still righteous, I will remove him."36 Enoch, in fact, is rarely mentioned in rabbinic sources and not at all in the late apocalypses of Ezra, Baruch, and Abraham. Aside from the one passage just cited, Philo does not denigrate Enoch, but presents him repeatedly as an example and symbol of repentance,37 a notion that is not suggested in any way by the Greek text of Genesis. In one passage Philo affirms that Enoch was translated,38 but elsewhere he allegorizes the incident.39 (33) Unfortunately, 44:16 is missing from the Hebrew text of Ben Sira found at Masada and published by Y. Yadin. (34) Stein, pp. 16 f. supposes that the Jewish attitude to Enoch changed because Chris tian writers regarded him as a prototype of Jesus. But the sources just cited show that this negative view was prevalent also in pre-Christian times. But even though the original motive could not have been anti-Christian polemic, it may have been a factor at a later date. (35) But not certainly; see J. Reider, The Bookof Wisdom, N.Y. 1957, pp. 84 ff. (36) Gen. Rabbah 25:1. The implication that Enoch was not translated, but died, is made explicit in the context by two other teachers. A third states that Enoch was recorded among the wicked. Nevertheless, the mythological view of Enoch survived underground, to emerge later in such mystical works as III Enoch, edited by H. Odeberg, Cambridge 1928. (37) Abr. 17 ff.; Praem. 15 f.; Quaestiones Gen. 1:82-85. (38) Quaestiones Gen. 1:86. (A striking parallel in Midrash Hagadol Gen. 5:24 was first noted by V. Aptowitzer, Kain undAbel. Wien 1922, p. 133, n. 103). Ginzberg is mistaken in the assertion (vol. V, p. 156 bot.) that Wisdom and Philo deny that Enoch was translated. Wisdom does not deny it and Philo here affirms it. (39) See the citations in n. 37 and Mut. 34 ff.</page><page sequence="11">[il] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 163 It should be observed that for Philo the penitent remains on a level which, though honorable, is below that of the perfectly righteous — as against the rabbinic view which gives the penitent the highest place of all.40 8.8. The "Sons of God." In my Fallen Angels (Philadelphia 1952), pp. 53 f., I discussed Philo's treatment of Gen. 6:1-4, found in Gig. 6-11, in which he denies repeatedly that the story is a myth. I inferred that he knew the myth of the fallen angels and rejected it. At that time I overlooked Quaestiones Gen. 1:92, which is remarkable in several ways. It takes note of the Septuagint reading "sons of God," wereas Gig. follows the alterna tive "angels of God." And it gives the two divergent interpretations of the episode known to us from other sources. First it states that the giants were "a mixture of two things, of angels and mortal women. But the substance of angels is spiritual; however, it often happens that they imitate the forms of men and for immediate purposes, as in respect of knowing women." This is essentially the mythical account found in I Enoch 6-11 and other pseudepigraphic documents. But the end of this Quaestio states that Moses applies the term "sons of God" to good and excellent men, while wicked men are called "bodies." This is not far from the prevailing rabbinic view (Gen. Rabbah 26:5, Targum Gen. 6:2), except that the Rabbis say the "sons of God" were men of noble birth rather than of virtue. The discrepancy between the Quaestiones and De Gigantibus might be utilized to throw doubt on the authenticity of the former. Some scholars have indeed denied that Philo wrote the Quaestiones, but the majority accept them as genuine, and as probably earlier than the allegorical commentary. There are a good many such variations in the writings of Philo. 9. Chronology of the Flood and of Creation. According to Gen. 7:11, the flood began "in the second month." Ancient interpreters differed, however, as to the starting point of this reckoning. At the end of the first century C.E., R. Joshua taught that the second month was Iyyar, i.e. that the flood began and ended (Gen. 8:13 f.) in the spring. R. Eliezer held that the second month must be counted from Rosh Hashanah, i.e., that the flood began and ended in the fall.41 This disagreement is coordinated in the talmudic sources with another controversy — as to whether the world was created in spring or in fall; R. Joshua upheld the former, R. Eliezer the (40) Abr. 26; Spec. 1:103; Virt. 176, and contrast Berakhot 34b; Sanhédrin 99a; Luke 15:7 (41 ) Seder Olam Rabbah 4; Rosh Hashanah 11b-12b.</page><page sequence="12">164 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [12] latter view.42 R. Eliezer's view prevailed; the liturgy repeatedly speaks of Rosh Hashanah as the day of creation.43 Josephus (Ant. 1:80) agrees with R. Eliezer that the second month was Marheshvan. Philo, however, held that the Flood began in the spring,44 and also states plainly that it was spring when the world was created.45 Without going into the complications of this subject, it is sufficient for us to note that on these points Philo was in agreement with a well known rabbinical opinion.46 10. 10. The Sexes Separated in the Ark. In Gen. 7:7, those entering the ark are listed in the order: Noah, his sons, his wife, his sons' wives. Butin 8:16 they are ordered to leave the ark in the order: Noah, his wife, his sons, their wives. From this variation, both Philo and the aggadists inferred that the men were commanded to stay apart from their wives during the Deluge, and that permission to resume marital relations was given when they all left the ark. All this, says Philo, was indicated simply by the order of the words; it was not necessary to proclaim aloud that in such a time of disaster the fortunate survivors should show their sympathy with the victims and not indulge in sensual enjoyment (Quaestiones Gen. II.49). The Rabbis draw the same conclusion from the same verses, and add similar moraliz ing comments.47 The combination of the two elements in both sources strongly suggests that Philo was drawing on an old tradition. 11. 11. Abraham Abandons Astrology. Philo (Abr. 68 ff.) states that Abraham had been immersed in the astrology of his native Chaldea; he departed from that system when he recognized a God who rules the forces of nature. Several scholars48 have seen this passage as parallel to a rabbinic legend: Abraham complained to God that according to his horoscope he would never have children, whereupon God told him to give up astrology (42) Rosh Hashanah 8a, iob-11a, 27a. Somewhat differently, Pesikta Derav Kahana 23 (Buber ed. p. 150a-b, Mandelbaum ed. p. 333); Lev. Rabbah 29:1; Deut. R. ed. S. Lieberman p.p. 11 ; cf. Pesikta Rabbati 46, p. 186b.

Ginzberg49 even equates Philo's "Depart for a short time from the greatest of cities, this world" (Abr. 71) with the Rabbis' "Depart from your astrology." This is certainly unjustified; Philo in the cited passage is merely interpreting Gen. 12:1. On the other hand, Sandmel50 is perhaps too hasty in dismissing the parallel as superficial. He righdy states that for Philo "astrology is not to be equated merely with forecasting, but with pantheistic materialism"; this is fully attested in Abr. 69, where Philo states that the Chaldeans identified the world with God. But Philo does not disregard, or even minimize, the aspect of prediction. The Chaldeans, he informs us, elaborated as tronomy and the casting of nativities. "They hold that the vicissitudes of better and worse are reckoned by the courses and ordered revolutions of the stars, and that on these depends the birth of good and evil."51 It seems to me that Ginzberg could have made a better case for the existence of a real parallel. He cites Jubilees 12:16 ff., but does not indicate its importance. In this passage we read that Abram "sat up throughout the night... to observe the stars from the evening to the morning, in order to see what would be the character of the year with regard to the rains; and he was alone as he sat and observed. And a word came into his heart, and he said: All the signs of the stars and the signs of the moon and of the sun are in the hand of the Lord; why do I search them out? If He desires, He causes it to rain," etc. We have seen other instances where items found in Jubilees recur in Philo (above sections 1, _j). Here both sources contrast the belief in a mechanically ordered universe with the faith in a divine providence; and this in turn is the point of the talmudic story that Abram was told, "Depart from your astrology! Israel is not controlled by movements of the planets." Strangely reminiscent of the passage in Jubilees is a story told by R. Huna. An astrologer converted to Judaism. Once he was about to set out on a journey, but hesitated because according to the stars the moment was not propitious. But then he said to himself, "Did I not join this holy people (49) Vol. V, p. 227, n. 108.

Subject to these corrections, the n. lists a large number of parallels in substance, but not in language to Shabbat 156a.

BAMBERGER [14] in order to separate myself from those superstitions? Let us go forth in the name of our Creator!"52 It seems probable, then, that we are dealing here with a genuine parallel. 12. 12. The Cave of Machpelah. The name Machpelah is rendered in the Greek Bible by "double." Philo explains: "There are altogether two burial caves under the mountain, one outside and one inside, or two walls, one which encloses, and the other, which is enclosed" (Quaestiones Gen. IV:80). Similarly, a Babylonian scholar asserted that the cave consisted of two chambers, one within the other (0Eruvin 53a; the context mentions another view that the two chambers were one above the other). 13. Joseph and Simeon. Why did Joseph pick Simeon as the brother to be detained in prison? It was natural to assume that Simeon had been the ringleader in the plot against Joseph. Reuben and Judah had both tried to protect Joseph, so Simeon was the oldest of the hostile group. Both Philo and the Rabbis explain that this was why Joseph selected Simeon to be the hostage.53 This could be no more than an inference from Scripture made independently in Alexandria and in Palestine; but in all likelihood it was an accepted aggadic tradition. For the Testaments (Simeon 2:7 ff., 4:3; Zebulon 2:1, 3:2,4:2; Gad 2:1,2) repeatedly stress the same point. 14. 14. "My Son Joseph Is Still Alive." In Gen. 45:28, according to the new Jewish translation, Jacob says, "Enough! My son Joseph is still alive." The word rav, here rendered "Enough!" has the general meaning "large, great;" and the Greek here renders it "It is a great thing" that Joseph is still alive. Philo understands it figuratively: It is a great thing that Joseph is still alive spiritually, having surmounted the temptations of ambition, love of pleasure, and false doctrines.54 Similarly, the Midrash paraphrases the verse: "Great is the strength of my son, for though many troubles have beset him, he still clings to his righteousness."55 That the resemblance is more than coincidental is supported by the fact that Philo gives this same interpretation in three different contexts.

Philo (Praem. 58 f.) notes that Ab raham had "many children, but all faulty save one . . . That son . . . had two sons. One was wild and indocile . . . The other was gentle and kind ly . . . This is the third of the founders, father of many children and alone among the three blessed in them all, who met with no mishap in any part of his household." This statement does not fully accord with the Scriptural record. True, the Bible traces the descent of the Israelite people from all the sons of Jacob, while excluding Ishmael and Esau and their posterity. But it does not depict Ishmael and Esau as wholly bad characters, while it displays several sons of Jacob in a most unfavorable light. In his farewell to his sons (Gen. 49), Jacob denounces Simeon and Levi, and his characterizations of Reuben, Issachar, Dan and Benjamin are far from complimentary. Rabbinic literature provides numerous close parallels to Philo's state ment; they constitute a sort of apologetic refrain. For example: "The bed (i.e., offspring) of our father Jacob was perfect. From Abraham there issued dross (pesolet) — Ishmael and the sons of Keturah. From Isaac issued dross — Esau and all his chieftains. But Jacob's bed was perfect, for all the sons born to him were righteous."56 According to one version, Jacob feared that history would repeat itself and some of his children would be adjudged dross. But his anxiety was allayed when he learned that Reuben had repented of his sin with Bilhah.57 Elsewhere we read that Jacob was reassured when the stones at Bethel were fused into one.58 Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (Gen. 35:22 and cf. ibid. 49:28) states that the Holy Spirit gave Jacob the reassurance. Finally, it is told that on his deathbed Jacob expressed his anxiety to his sons, who quieted his fears by reciting the Shema together.59 This aggadah is clearly apologetic. It is hardly directed against Chris tians, for the latter agreed that the descendants of Jacob were holy until they forfeited their election (either by making the Golden Calf or by the rejection of Jesus) . Our aggadah was rather directed against rationalistic or proto-gnostic critics, who argued that the sons of Jacob were far from flawless and that Ishmael and Esau were unfairly rejected. Now Philo could have evaded the difficulties by treating the various persons as allegorical figures. The fact that instead of following his own characteris (56) Lev. Rabbah 36:5.

Moses —Man and God.Deut. 33:1 and Ps. 90:1 call Moses "the man of God." And in Exod. 7:1 he is told that he will be "a god to Pharaoh." These passages suggested some bold speculations, which are much alike in Philo and the rabbinic sources. "The chief of the prophets," says Philo, "proves to have many names. When he interprets and teaches the oracles vouchsafed to him, he is called Moses; when he prays and blesses the people, he is a man of God; and when Egypt is paying the penalties for its impious deeds, he is the god of Pharaoh" — for one who prays for others and blesses them is properly called God's man, and the wise rules like a god over the fool.60 Elsewhere Philo remarks that "the legislator of the Jews in a bolder spirit" spoke of the man possessed by the divine "as having passed from a man into a god, though indeed a god to man, not to the different parts of nature."61 The rabbinic version runs: "If he was a man, why is he called a god; and if a god, why is he called a man? When he stood before Pharaoh, he was as a god; when he fled before Pharaoh, a mere man. When he was cast into the Nile, he was a man; when the water turned to blood, he was as a god. When he ascended on high, he was a man" compared to the fiery servitors of the Deity. "But when he descended, he was called a god (Exod. 34: 29 ff.). Alternatively: "when he ascended to a place" where there was no eating and drinking and he likewise refrained from eating and drinking, he was called a god; but when he descended and ate and drank, he was called a man."62 The Midrash remarks further on the boldness of Moses' demands upon God — he changed the divine justice into mercy and annulled God's will as a man might annul the vows of his wife. But Philo remarks elsewhere63 that we should not understand such a passage as Exod. 7:1 in too literal a sense. i17. Classification of the Plagues. Philo (Mos. 1:97) states that the ten plagues were divided as follows: "Three belonging to the denser elements, earth (60) Mut. 125 ff. In Som. 11:230-234 he says that the good man is on the border between human and divine. (61) Prob. 43. (62) Midrash Tillim 90:5; Pesikta Derav Kahana, Bubered. p. 198b, Mandelbaum ed. p. 443; Deut.

He gave to Moses alone; one, the seventh, He committed to both in common; and the other three which go to complete the ten He reserved for Himself." So in the Midrash: "Three of the plagues took place through Aaron, three through Moses, three through the Holy One (blessed be He!), and one through them all. Blood, frogs, and lice which were on earth, took place through Aaron; hail, locusts, and darkness through Moses, for they were in the air and Moses held sway over earth and heaven; mixed beasts, murrain, and the slaying of the firstborn through the Holy One; and boils through them all."64 18. 18. 18. Israel Was Immune to the Plagues. In the narrative of the ten plagues, the Torah sometimes states explicitly that Israel was not affected by the disaster that befell the Egyptians (Exod. 9:6, 10:23). other cases noth ing of the sort is said. But Philo says flatly that none of the plagues troubled the Israelites. Thus, "the river changed to blood, but not for the Hebrews; for when they wished to draw from it, it turned into good drinking water."65 This undoubtedly old tradition is given a more elaborate form in the Midrash: Israel became rich through the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in the same house and a container of water was there, the Egyptian who went to fill a jug from it would get a jugful of blood, whereas the Israelite could drink water from the container. Then the Egyptian might say, "Give me a little water by your hand"; but as he gave it to him, it would turn to blood. And if he said, "Let us drink together out of the same vessel," the Israelite would be drinking water and he would be drinking blood. Only by paying the Israelite a price for the water could he drink it, and thus the Israelites became rich.66 19. The Finger of God. "What is slighter than a gnat? Yet so great was its power that all Egypt lost heart, and was forced to cry aloud: 'This is the finger of God' (Exod. 8:15); for as for His hand, not all the habitable world from end to end could stand against it, or not even the whole universe." So Philo.67 (64) Exod. Rabbah 12:4, cf. 15:27; Tanhuma Va'era 14 end. (65) Mos. 1:144; so Josephus Ant. 11:295. Ginzberg vol. V, p. 428, n. 178 erroneously adds Wisdom 11:6-8. (66) Exod.

BAMBERGER [18] This homiletic play contrasting the finger of God with His whole hand is also found in early Palestinian sources. It is used to prove that while the Egyptians suffered ten plagues in Egypt, they were smitten by fifty at the Sea, where the hand of God is mentioned (Exod. 14:31).68 20.20. Fire and Hail. The seventh plague was a hailstorm accompanied by fire, which was flashing (mitlaqahat, Exod. 9:24) in the midst of the hail (the LXX understood the word similarly). That is, the hail fell during a severe thunderstorm, as happens not infrequently. But both Philo and the Rabbis add miraculous elements to this natural phenomenon. As Philo puts it, the lightnings "ran through the hail, their natural antagonist, and yet did not melt it nor were quenched by it, but un changed coursed up and down and kept guard over the hail" (Mos. 1:118). The Rabbis add variations: "R. Judah said: There were bottles of hail filled with fire. R. Nehemiah said: Fire and hail were intermingled. Said R. Hanin: According to R. Judah, it was like a split pomegranate whose seeds are visible through the fleshy part; according to R. Nehemiah, it was like the flame of a candela, where oil and water are mingled, and the flame issues from the midst of them . . . Said R. Aha: It is comparable to the case of a king, whose two fierce legions feuded with each other. But when the king engaged in war, they made peace with each other" to fight his enemies.69 21.21. The First Passover Celebrated Openly. According to Wisdom 18:9, the Israelites celebrated the first Passover service in secret, presumably to guard against reprisals by the Egyptians. But Philo declares that the blood was put on the doorposts and lintel so that the Israelites might sacrifice without fear, displaying contempt for their enemies.70 In the same vein, the Tanna R. Isaac taught that the blood was put on the door so that "the Egyptians seeing it would be cut to the quick."71 The Midrashim state further that the lambs were selected ahead of time and kept waiting in an open show of defiance. This reached a climax when the animals were (68) The Passover Haggadah; Mekhilta Beshallah 7, Lauterbach ed. vol. I, p. 251; Mekhilta R. Simeon Exod. 14:31; Midrash Tillim 78:15, and cf. Exod. Rabbah 23:9. The interpretation of "finger" is ascribed to R. Jose the Galilean; but in the context earlier teachers, R. Eliezer and R. Akiba, build further computations upon it. Thus the original midrash is old. (69) Pesikta Derav Kahana 1, Buber ed. p. 3b-4a, Mandelbaum ed. p. 6; Exod. Rabbah 12:4; Tanhuma Va'era 14 (and cf. Tanhuma Buber ibid. 22); Cant. R. 3:11; Num.

When the miracle of the manna was announced, the people were commanded (Exod. 16:4) to go out "and gather each day that day's portion." Both Philo and the old Tannaitic Midrash give a double interpretation of this verse. First, the daily collection of food is understood as an expression of faith. "He who would fain have all at once," says Philo, "earns for himself lack of hope and trust, as well as a great lack of sense. He lacks hope if he expects that now only, but not in the future also, will God shower on him good things; he lacks faith if he has no belief that both in the present and always the good gifts of God are lavishly bestowed on those worthy of them" (L.A. III.III. 164). In the Mekhilta, R. Elcazar says the same thing more pithily: "He who created the day created the sustenance for it... If one has enough to eat today, but says, 'What shall I eat tomorrow?', he is among those who lack faith."73 But in these same contexts, the phrase devar yom beyomo is also inter preted as a figure for spiritual nourishment. Philo explains: "The people, and all that goes to make up the soul, is to go out and gather and make a beginning of knowledge, not all at once, but 'the day's portion for a day.' For to begin with, it will be unable to contain at once the abundant wealth of the gracious gifts of God, but will be overwhelmed with them" (L.A. III.163). On the same Bible verse R. Joshua remarked: "If a man studies two halakhothalakhot in the morning and two in the evening and works at his trade all day, it is accounted to him as if he had fulfilled the whole Torah."74 The two comments are not identical. Philo is interested in an orderly, progressive plan of study. R. Joshua seeks to reassure the average man, so that he will not be terrified by the vast amount to be learned and so give up study altogether. But the fact that the same verse is interpreted in Philo's Allegories and in the Mekhilta as referring both to faith and to study makes this one of the most impressive of our parallels. It is worth noting, moreover, that in the same context Philo sets forth the characteristically rabbinic doctrine of lishmah: "The wise man of worthy aims sets himself to (72) Pesikta Derav Kahana 5, Buber ed. pp. 55a-b, Mandelbaum ed. p. 106; Pesikta RabbatiRabbati 15, p. 78b; Exod.

BAMBERGER [20] acquire day for the sake of day, light for the sake of light, the beautiful for the sake of the beautiful alone, not for the sake of something else."75 24. Why Are The Ten Commandments Addressed to the Individual? Philo gives three reasons for the fact that the Ten Commandments are couched in the second person singular: a) to suggest that "each person, when he is law-abiding and obedient to God, is equal in worth to a whole nation, even the most populous, or rather to all nations, and if we may go stiil farther, to the whole world." b) "If the exhortations are received as a personal message, the hearer is more ready to obey, but if collectively with others ... he takes the mul titude as a cover for disobedience." c) To teach us not to despise any individual, since God treated each individual as a special guest (Decal. 37-43). There are rabbinic parallels to all three reasons. The most obvious corresponds to Philo's second point: "Why were the Ten Commandments spoken in the singular? Because it is individuals who violate them."76 At Sinai, God appeared to Israel like a statue with faces on every side — so that when a thousand people look at it, it seems to be looking at each. And so, when the Holy One (blessed be He!) spoke, each Israelite thought, "He is speaking to me."77 The parallels to Philo's other reasons do not appear in the aggadah in connection with the Decalogue, but they are none the less striking. His first corresponds closely to the famous Mishnah: "Whoever destroys one human life is regarded by Scripture as having destroyed a whole world, and whoever preserves one human life is regarded as having preserved the whole world."78 Philo's third reason reminds us of Ben Azzai's saying, "Despise no man . . . for there is no man but has his hour" (Avot 4:3). But similar utterances can no doubt be found in other literatures. 24. Moses Renounced the Flesh. Philo describes Moses as having raised himself above all passion and "the calls of nature, food and drink and intercourse with women." He continues, "This last he had disdained for (75) For this concept in rabbinic literature, see, e.g., G.F.

"He stayed apart from his wife, and his decision was later given divine approval. For he reasoned: God decreed a separation of the sexes for all Israel when they were to receive the Decalogue at Sinai (Exod. 19:10), though they were to be sanctified only for the time being. How much more, then, ought I practice abstinence, who must be ready for revelation every day and every hour, not knowing when He will speak with me!"80 This aggadah derives, not from the Greek idea that the bodily is inferior to the spiritual, but from the widespread belief that the sexual act causes ritual defilement. Philo doubtless got the tale from old Jewish tradition; it may have had a special appeal to him because it fits in easily with the body-spirit opposition he had learned from Plato. 25. Heavenly Food. The Bible states repeatedly that Moses went without food and drink for the forty days he spent on the mountain. The reason, says Philo, was doubtless that "he had the better food for contemplation, through whose inspiration, sent from above, he grew in grace, first of mind, then of body through the soul" (Mos. II.69). Similarly the Midrash reports, "He ate of the bread of the Torah . . . and drank of the water of the Torah. And by what was he sustained? By the radiance of the Divine Presence" (Exod. Rabbah 47:5, 7). 26.26. Nadab and Abihu. The story in Lev. 10 is not entirely clear, but its general intent is plain: the two sons of Aaron committed sacrilege, and their death followed inevitably. The aggadah, moreover, accuses the young men of various other sins which the Bible does not specifically mention. But there was also a counter-tendency to "whitewash" Nadab and Abihu. A moderate expression of this trend is the following: "In four places the death of Aaron's sons is mentioned, and each time mention is also made of their offense — to indicate that this was the only wrong they (79) Mos. 11:68 f. The ensuing parallel is noted by Stein, p. 45. (80) Shabbat 87a; Yevamot 62a; Avot Derabbi Nathan 2, Schechter ed., p. 5b; Exod. RabbahRabbah 19:3,46:3. Several of these sources also contain the view that Moses did not live apart from his wife until God so commanded. This may reflect disapproval of Christian asceticism, suggesting that the case of Moses was exceptional and not an example to follow.

No one should suspect them of secret sins of corrup tion."81 An older source supplies this ambiguous statement: "When the sons of Aaron saw that all the sacrifices had been offered and all the rituals performed, yet the Divine Presence had not descended on Israel, Nadab said to Abihu, 'Can one cook a dish without fire?' So they took strange fire and brought it into the Holy of Holies. Thereupon God said, 'I shall honor you more than you honored Me: you brought impure fire before Me, but I will burn you with pure fire" (Sifra Millu'im, ed. Weiss pp. 44d-45a). But sometimes the Rabbis went much further. Sifra gives two versions of an incident in which, after the two men have died, Moses approaches Aaron to console him. It was at Sinai, said Moses, that I heard it said, "Through those near Me will I be sanctified" (Lev. 10:3), i.e., God de clared that He would sanctify the Tabernacle through a great man. I supposed, Moses went on, that God would sanctify it either through you or through me. But now we know that your sons are greater than we, since it was through them that the House was consecrated. When Aaron heard this, he silently accepted God's decree as just (ibid. 45a). According to the other version, Moses said: Your sons died only for the sanctification of the name of God (Exod. 29:43). And when Aaron realized that his sons were so close to God (yedu'e haMaqom), he was silent (ibid.(ibid. 45d). Still another account runs: "Nadab and Abihu were in a state of joy. When they saw the new fire, they arose to add love to love. 'They took' (Lev. 10:1), and the word 'take' implies joy" (ibid. 45c). Finally, the two sons of Aaron are repeatedly spoken of as righteous men.82 Now wherever Philo mentions Nadab and Abihu, it is always in terms of praise. Their death by fire, which in the Bible is unmistakably punitive, is transformed by Philo into a symbol of flaming enthusiasm. Nadab and Abihu, he says, drew nigh to God and forsook mortal life (L.A. II.57 f.). The words "they died before the Lord" (Lev. 10:2) mean: They died in order to live, "receiving an incorruptible life in exchange for mortal existence" (Fug. 59). "They were not seized by a savage evil beast, but were taken up by a rush of fire unquenchable, by an undying splendour, since in sincerity they cast aside sloth and delay and consecrated their zeal ... to piety" (Som. II.67). (81) Lev. Rabbah 20:8; Tanhuma Buber Ahare 7; Tanhuma ibid. 6; Pesikta Derav Kahana,Kahana, Buber ed. Chap. 27, p. 172b, Mandelbaum ed. Chap. 26, p. 3g4; Num. Rabbah 2:24.

For Philo and many aggadists agreed in adopting an interpretation that contravenes the plain sense of Scripture. The case is similar to what we found in the treatment of Enoch (above, section 7). There, even though their com ments do not tally exactly, Philo and the Rabbis alike drastically reduced the glory conferred on Enoch in Scripture and still more in certain apocrypha. Here they do just the opposite, transforming manifest sinners into mystical saints. Philo followed this procedure only in his allegorical exposition. It may be significant that Nadab and Abihu are not mentioned in the Life of Moses. For in that work he generally kept to the plain sense of Scripture; and the plain sense of this episode would have been an embarrassment. 22 7. The Sabbath Breaker. Philo's account of the man who gathered wood on the Sabbath (Num. 15: 32 ff.) provides an impressive double parallel to the rabbinic version. Those who caught the offender, he reports, "took him before the ruler, beside whom the priests were seated, while the whole multitude stood around to listen; for it was customary on every day when opportunity offered, and preeminently on the seventh day ... to pursue the study of wisdom with the ruler expounding."83 Or, as R. Eliezer put it, Moses and his entourage were sitting in the House of Study when the accusers came and stood before him.84 What follows presents an even closer agreement. Moses, says Philo, "was in doubt as to what should be done to him. He knew that the action deserved death, but what would be the proper method of punishment?" (Mos. II.217). The Rabbis say: "Moses knew that he deserved death, but did not know which form of execution should be used."85 28.28. The Appointment of Joshua. Philo observes: "When . . . Joshua . . . had been approved by divine judgment as best fitted to command, Moses was not depressed as another might have been because the choice had not fallen on his sons or nephews, but was filled with intense joy, to think that the nation would be in charge of one excelling in every way" (Virt.66 f.). (83) Mos. 11:214 f. This passage states that the crime was witnessed by persons who had gone out to pray in the solitude of the wilderness. (84) Sifré Num. 113; cf. ibid. 68, 133. In Ginzberg vol. VI p. 85 top a printer's error makes it "Sifra" instead of Sifré; and note that Philo does not use the term "house of study." (85) Sifra Emor parashah 14, Weiss ed. 104c; Sifré Num. 114; Sifré Zutta Num. 15:34, Horovitz ed. p. 288; Bava Batra 119a; Sanhédrin 78b; Yerushalmi ibid. 7, 22d; Targum Neofiti and Pseudo-Jonathan Num. 15:34.1 discussed this subject inHUCA XVI (1941) p. 106.</page><page sequence="24">176 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [24] This reminds us of a Tannaitic statement: "Moses went and acted in joy, and was not troubled on account of his sons and nephews. . . . Just as God commanded Moses in joy, so Moses commanded Joshua in joy."86 29. Moses Recorded His Own Death. According to R. Judah (some say R. Nehemiah), Joshua wrote the final verses of the Torah concerning the death and burial of Moses. But R. Simeon objected: "Could the scroll of the Torah have lacked a single letter? Say rather: God dictated (the Torah) and Moses would repeat and write it down. And as for the last part, God dictated it and Moses wrote it down tearfully."87 The first opinion is one of simple common sense, the second reflects the concept of a transcendant Torah. Not surprisingly, the latter view was held by Philo. At the very moment, he says, when Moses was to take his upward flight, "the divine spirit fell upon him and he prophesied with discernment while still alive the story of his own death" (Mos. II end). More briefly, Josephus states that Moses recorded his death in the sacred books, so as to preclude any notion of translation or apotheosis (Ant. IV. 326). 30. The Foetus Is Formed in Forty/Eighty Days. Thus far we have dealt with comments on and elaborations of the biblical narrative. Now we come to a miscellaneous group of parallels dealing chiefly with ethical or theological themes. Our first example, however, concerns "popular science." "Forty," says Philo . . . "gives the time of life in which, as we are told, the man is fully formed in the laboratory of nature" (Mos. 11:84). Elsewhere, however, he reports that the molding of the male requires forty days, whereas imperfect woman is formed in eighty days.88 In several of the pertinent passages Philo refers to the opinion of physiologists. But there is apparently no familiar Greek source for the notion, for Colson does not cite any classical parallel to Mos. 11:84; indeed, he mistakenly supposes that the allusion is to the forty weeks of gestation — overlooking the evidence cited in our note 88, and the fact that the same view is found in rabbinic literature. The Mishnah states (Niddah 3:7): "The male is completely formed on the forty-first day, and the female on the eighty-first day, according to R. (86) Sifré Num. 141; similarly Sifré Zutta Num. 27:22, Horovitz éd., p. 322. According to Sifré Num. 139, Moses did not name Joshua in his prayer, so as not to rouse resentment in his own family. (87) Bava Batra 15a; Menahot 30a. (88) Quaestiones Gen. 1:25, II: 14. Ibid. IV: 154 speaks of forty days, especially for the male; ibid. IV:27 states that the usual time is forty-five days, rarely forty, less often more.</page><page sequence="25">[25] PHILO AND THE AGGADAH 177 Ishmael. The other sages say that the formation of male and female alike is complete on the forty-first day." It would be futile to try to trace the origin and spread of such a notion. But wherever it came from, it is all but certain that Philo got it from Jewish tradition; for both he and the Midrash connect this bit of popular physiol ogy with the forty days of the Flood. The length of the Flood is not mentioned idly, Philo assures us. "It is to emphasize the two numbers which are set apart for the birth of man, (namely) forty and eighty, as is reported by many others, by physicians and also by naturalists. And especially is this written in the sacred Law, which was for them also the beginning of being physiologists. Accord ingly, since destruction was about to come upon all persons everywhere, both men and women, because of their excessive unity in discord and unbridled wrongdoing, the Judge decided to fix a time for their destruc tion equal to that which He had determined for the creation of nature and the first production of living beings" (Quaestiones Gen. II: 14). More briefly, R. Johanan said (Gen. Rabbah 32:5): "They corrupted the form which was given in a period of forty days, therefore the Flood lasted forty days and forty nights." 31. God Called The Place. On his flight to Haran, Jacob "came upon a certain place" (Gen. 28:11). Both Philo and the Rabbis take this to mean that Jacob encountered the Deity. But why should God be called "place"? Philo answers: It is "by reason of His containing things and being con tained by nothing whatever, and being a place for all to flee into, and because He is Himself the space which holds Him."89 Similarly, R. Ammi explained: "He is the Place of His world, [and the world is not His place]."90 A century earlier, R. Jose b. Halafta derived the same thought from Exod. 33:21, "there is a place with Me ."91 These ideas recur in many Philonic and rabbinic passages.92 (8g) Som. 1:63. Philo gives a similar explanation of "place" in Gen. 22:4,Ibid. 64 ff; Post. 17 ff.; and in Exod. 21:13, Fug. 75. (90) Gen. Rabbah 68:9. Most of the mss. do not have the bracketed clause. (91) Ibid. Tanhuma Buber Tissa 16; Tanhuma ibid. 27 (and Exod. Rabbah 45:6, where "bar Hanina" is a mistake for "bar Halafta") give R. Jose's view in the form, "My place is subordinate to Me, I am not subordinate to My place." (92) Philo: L.A. 1:44, 111:51; Conf. 136; Quaestiones Exod. 11:40. The Rabbis under stand maqom in this sense also in Isa. 28:8, Avot 3:3; and give the same interpretation of mtfon,mtfon, m'onah (Psalm 90:1, Deut. 33:27). See Gen. Rabbah 68:9; Midrash Tillim 90:10 (this seems to me the probable source of Midrash Hagadol Deut. 33:27, excerpted by Hoffmann in Midrash Tannaim p. 222); Pesikta Rabbati 21, p. 104b; Pirke Derabbi Eliezer Chap. 31 (and see G. Friedlander's n. pp. 225 f. of his edition) and 35.</page><page sequence="26">18ל BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [26] The philosophic tone of the explanation offered by R. Jose and his successors led Freudenthal to conclude that this was a case of Hellenistic thought penetrating the aggadah.93 But the inference was too hasty. For the earlier rabbinic sources constantly employ the term Hamaqom, "the Place," as a name of God. Indeed, it was one of the earliest appellatives adopted in order to avoid the use of the words aElohim and נAdonai in ordinary speech.94 It is hard to believe that this old usage was suggested by the philosophic ideas cited by R. Jose and R. Ammi; more probably the latter adopted these abstract conceptions in order to explain and justify an established usage. At the start, "Place" may have been no more than a vague substitute for the divine name, like "Heaven." (Popular American usage at one time was to speak of "the Man upstairs.") Or the expression may have actually been suggested by Gen. 28:11. For the word there rendered "came upon" (pgc) also means "to entreat" (Jer. 7:16, Ruth 1:16). If the verse meant "He entreated the Place," then "Place" was obviously an allusion to Deity.95 We might suppose, then, that the use of Hamaqom was a native devel opment; that it was followed by (or possibly, even derived from) an understanding of the word as having this sense in several Bible passages; and that later some Rabbis found a sophisticated explanation of the usage in Hellenistic philosophy, which was also known to Philo. But such a conclusion is highly doubtful. There are no clear antecedents in Greek philosophic literature for the idea of God as the locus of the universe.96 Nor is "Place" used of God in any Alexandrine source except Philo.97 Moreover, this idea is in basic contradiction to the pantheistic notion that God pervades the universe as the soul pervades the body of man. This idea seems to have been developed by the Stoics, and is adopted elsewhere by both Philo and the Rabbis.98 (The striking parallels on this subject have (93) HeUenistische Studien pp. 72 f. (94) Marmorstein states (The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, Part I, pp. 92 ff.) that the usage goes back at least to Simon the Just I. He evidently was alluding to T osefta Nezirut 4:7, where the term is put into the mouth of Simon the Just. But even though the language of the tale is a bit archaic, one can hardly be sure that it quotes Simon verbatim. Marmorstein, however, has abundantly shown in the work cited thatHamaqom was an old term, which was later largely replaced by "the Holy One, blessed be He!" (95) So Ginzberg vol. V, p. 289 n. 130. (96) See Wolfson I, pp. 247 ff. Colson cites no Greek parallels. (97) Urbach, pp. 61 f., citing Geiger. See his whole discussion of the subject beginning at p. 53, which includes a full answer to Freudenthal and others who consider the usage as original Greek (p. 61).

The probability, then, is that not only the use of "Place" as a name of God, but also the explanation that the universe is contained in God, not God in the world, originated in Palestine. 32. The Righteous Live, the Wicked Are Dead. Constantly in Philo, and frequently in rabbinic literature, we meet the thought that the righteous are to be considered alive even after their death, whereas the wicked are accounted dead even in their lifetime. Sometimes Philo means by this that the righteous enjoy blessed immortality. He tells us he learned from the lectures of the wise woman Consideration (skepsis) "that some people are dead while living and some alive while dead. She told me that bad people, prolonging their days to extreme old age, are dead men, deprived of the life in association with virtue, while good people, even if cut off from their partnership with the body, live forever and are granted immortality."99 Elsewhere Philo stresses rather the thought that true life is excellence of character. "Those who have taken service in the ranks of the God who only is, are alive, and that life can never die."100 In one passage he refers exceptionally to the immortality of influence which a good ruler leaves behind him.101 The rabbinic formulation is usually, "The righteous even in their death are called living, and the wicked even in their lifetimes are called dead" — i.e., that Scripture uses the words "living" and "dead" in this sense.102 But the terminology of course implies that the righteous know true life, both now and after death, and vice versa. Philo twice quotes a saying of Heraclitus, "We live their death and are dead to their life" — which apparendy means that the life of the body is the death of the soul, whereas physical death releases the soul to life. In one instance Philo commends Heraclitus for following Moses on this point; in the second, he reproaches him for taking law and opinions from Moses, like a thief!103 The ascription of priority to "Moses" in itself proves nothing, for Philo constantly reads philosophic notions into the Torah (99) Fug. 54 f. In subsequent paragraphs, Philo adduces a number of Bible verses to support support this view. Similarly, Jos. 264, Quaestiones Gen. 1:16, 70. (100) Spec. I end; Det. 49, 70. (101) Spec. IV: 169.

BAMBERGER [28] text, of which the original author of the Torah never dreamed. The important fact is that Philo's formulation — at least in some cases — is close to that of the Rabbis, whereas the saying of Heraclitus is not much like either. That we have to do with an old Jewish teaching is further suggested by IV Maccabees 16:25: "Men dying for God live unto God, as live Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the patriarchs."104 33. Positive Value of the Passions. Following Plato, Philo generally speaks slightingly of the material, the bodily, and the sensuous. A similar attitude is found in the Stoics, who denigrated all emotion. But in one interesting passage Philo calls the senses and the passions "helpers of the soul." The senses supply necessary information. The passions too are useful: "plea sure and desire contribute to the permanence of our kind; pain and fear are like bites and stings warning the soul to treat nothing carelessly; anger is a weapon of defense, which has conferred great boons on many; and so with the other passions."105 This exceptional utterance reminds us of remarks by the Rabbis about "the evil inclination," which is identified especially with the sex drive, as well as with aggressive impulses. The Midrash declares that the expres sion "very good" (Gen. 1:31) refers to the evil inclination. "Why should it be considered very good? Because without the evil inclination, no man would build a house, take a wife, or beget children. So Solomon says (Eccles. 4:4), 'All labor and skillful enterprise come from men's envy of each other.' "106 And a remarkable talmudic story tells of an occasion when men were able to chain up the evil inclination. Before long, a fresh egg could not be obtained for an invalid! So they were constrained to release the evil urge again (Yoma 69b). Elsewhere, Philo appears to echo a Platonic statement about the need to sever the soul from the body. "We may almost (schedon) make it an axiom that the business of wisdom is to become estranged from the body and its cravings" — so Philo puts it.107 The "almost" is not found in Plato. Does it suggest an awareness that Jewish tradition set a higher value on the physical? 34. Sinful Thought vs. Sinful Action. Philo makes a sharp distinction be tween harboring a sinful thought and carrying it out in action. The two (104) Also ibid. 7:18 f. Cf. Wisdom 3:1 ff., Mark 12:26; Matt. 22:31 f. (105) L.A. 11:7-8.

"Now no legis lator fixes a penalty on the unjust when in the quiescent state, but only when they are moved to action."108 Similarly, the Rabbis stress many times: "Evil intent is not regarded by the All-present as equivalent to action." But the Rabbis add further that for good intentions credit is given, even if they are not transmuted into deeds.109 Yet neither Philo nor the talmudic sages treated these principles as absolute. The Talmud condemns the very thought of idolatry as sinful.110 It also declares that fantasies of sexual sin are worse than the sin itself.111 Similarly, Philo asserts that the intention to commit homicide is criminal, even if it is not acted upon (Conf. 159 f.). 35. God's Word Is Deed. "God spoke and it was done — no interval between the two — or it might suggest a truer view to say that His word was deed."112 Philo makes this statement several times in slightly different forms.113 R. Samuel b. Nahman says the same thing: "The word of the Holy One (blessed be He!) is deed."114 The idea goes back to Ps. 33:9: "He spoke, and it was." We might suppose that it was a Hellenistic thinker who gave it an abstract formula tion. Yet the identical statement appears in both the apocryphal books of Enoch, which were originally composed in Hebrew or Aramaic.115 Very possibly then, the saying is part of old Jewish tradition. 36. The Ark a Symbol of Sincerity. "It is not," says Philo, "without a well thought purpose that he covers the ark both inside and outside with (108) Sob. 44 ff., L.A. 11:61; Det. 97.

In Yerushalmi Peah 1,16b, Midrash Tillim 30:4, this generous principle is restricted to Jews, while Gentiles are given no credit for good intentions and condemned for evil intentions.

For the wise man must be adorned with the prudence that is more precious than all gold, both in the inward invisible things of the soul and in the outward which are seen of all men." Or, as he puts it elsewhere, the gold inside and out provides "symbols of a soul which in inward things is undefiled towards God and in outward things is pure towards the world of our senses and human life."116 The same inference from Exod. 25:11 is likewise drawn by the talmudic writings. Commenting in this verse, the Babylonian Amora Raba said,"A scholar whose inwardness is not like his outwardness is not a true scholar" (Yoma 72b). The Palestinian Midrash gives the same application (Tanhuma Vayaqhel 7). And the expression, "A scholar whose inward ness is not like his outwardness" was used by Rabban Gamaliel II, about a generation after Philo's time.117 Evidently the figure was old and tradi tional. 57. Fear and Trust. In an extended devotional passage, Philo declares, "I come before Thee in fear and trembling, and yet again I am confi dent. . . Yet I who proclaim my confidence, confess in turn my fear and consternation. And still the fear and the confidence are not at war within me in separate camps . . . but are blended in a harmony" (Her. 24-28). Very similar are the rabbinic comments on Ps. 2:11, "Rejoice with trembling." "In the place of joy," says the Talmud (Berakhot 30b), "let there be trembling" — i.e., prayer should be at once joyous and reverent. The Midrash, contrasts "Serve the Lord with fear" (Ps. 2:11) and "Serve the Lord with gladness" {ibid. 100:2), and concludes, "When you rise to pray, rejoice, yet be in awe of God."118 38. Israel the Intercessorfor Mankind. Philo describes his people as "a nation destined to be consecrated above all others to offer prayers forever on behalf of the human race, that it may be delivered from evil and partici pate in what is good"(Mos. 1:149). In contrast to the priests of other nations, who pray only for their own constituency, the high priest of the Jews prays and gives thanks on behalf of all mankind, and even of the natural universe (Spec. L97). In discussing the omer ceremony, Philo asserts that the Jewish people serves mankind as a priest serves his particu lar group; and he expresses astonishment "that some people venture to accuse of inhumanity the nation which has shewn so profound a sense of (116) Ebr. 85 f., Mut. 43 f., Quaestiones Exod. 11:54; cf.

But the same idea occurs in rabbinic sources which were definitely not composed for gentile consumption. The se venty sacrifices offered during the Feast of Tabernacles (Num. 29:12-38) are regularly explained as offerings in behalf of "the seventy nations of the world."120 Some of the sources refer to the ingratitude and hostility of the heathen, citing Ps. 109:4, 1° return for my love they are my adver saries, but I am all prayer." 39. The Frontlet of the High Priest. Considerable attention has been given by scholars to the legal elements in Philo's writings, and their relationship to the rabbinic halakhah.121 Without entering this area, we may note that a number of interesting passages in Philo deal with the priestly service in the Temple, which he seems to have visited at least once.122 One of these passages, which lies on the border between halakhah and aggadah, de serves notice here. To evaluate it properly, we must bear in mind that the Septuagint regularly renders the Tetragrammaton by Kyrios, "Lord" (Adonai). Philo takes this name to refer to God's sovereignty, whereas the title God (theos= elohim)elohim) is taken to indicate His creative and benevolent aspect. (The Rabbis do just the opposite, taking elohim to indicate the attribute of divine justice, and the Tetragrammaton as a reference to God's mercy.) Now just one passage in all of Philo departs from this procedure. Speaking of the frontlet worn by the high priest, he says: "A piece of gold plate, too, was wrought into the form of a crown with four incisions, shewing a name which only those whose ears and tongues are purified may hear or speak in the holy Place, and no other person, nor in any other place at all. That name has four letters."123 ( 11g)( 11g) Spec. 11:163 ff., especially 167• Cf. ibid. 1:190. (120) Pesikta Derav Kahana 28, Buber ed. pp. 193b-194a, Mandelbaum ed. p. 433 (cf. ibid.ibid.

Yet Philo's statement reflects neither confusion nor caprice. It is supported by Josephus and apparently by Pseudo Aristeas.124 And it corresponds to a statement that appears four times in the Talmud.125 The latter reports that the inscription on the frontlet was in two lines. The upper line consisted of the Tetragrammaton; below it was inscribed "Holy to." R. Eleazer b. Jose dissented; he claimed to have seen the confiscated frontlet in the imperial treasury at Rome, and it was inscribed in a single line just as ordained in the biblical text. But whatever the facts, we are clearly dealing here with an old tradition, on which the Hellenistic writers and an anonymous Tanna agreed. 40. The Gift of Self. Many religious and ethical traditions possess the commonplace that the value of a gift, and specifically of a sacrifice, depends not on its size or monetary cost, but on the spirit of the giver. This commonplace, however, is expressed by Philo and the Rabbis in terms so similar as to suggest more than coincidence. Philo says, "Though the worshippers bring nothing else, in bringing themselves they offer the best of sacrifices" (Spec. 1:272). The Talmud declares that when a poor man brings a cereal offering, the least costly sacrifice, God receives it "as if he had offered himself (nafsho)."12e And the Midrash tells of a priest who was contemptuous of the small offering brought by a poor widow; thereafter he was rebuked in a dream and told that the woman's offering was valued "as if she had offered herself."127 This last reminds us in turn of the Gospel story of "the widow's mite" (Mark 12:41-44, Luke 21:1-4). Perhaps the Gospel expression SXov xbv pîov and Philo's aûxoùç yépovxEÇ are attempts at a Greek rendering of nafshahnafshah hiqrivah, hiqriv nafsho. 41.41.41. Parallels to the Hypothetica. The Church Father Eusebius has preserved several selections from a lost work of Philo called Hypothetica. It appears that Josephus drew on the same work for his exposition of Jewish doctrine in Contra Apionem II. One extract of Eusebius contains the Golden Rule in a negative form much like that of Hillel.128 (124) Josephus, War V:235; Ant. 111:178; Letter of Aristeas 98.

Josephus puts it: "Creatures which take refuge in our houses like suppliants we are forbidden to kill."129 There is, of course, no such provision in the Pentateuch; nor does the halakhah, despite its concern to protect animals from needless suffering, forbid us to slaughter a beast that runs from the slaughterer. But there is a legend on the subject about Rabbi Judah the Prince, who lived about a century after Philo. Once a calf was to be slaughtered, and it ran up to R. Judah and bleated, as if to say, "Save me!" But the rabbi dismissed the animal, saying, "Go, that is what you were created for." Because of this callous response, the sage was stricken with toothache, from which he suffered for many years. Then one day he saw his housemaid about to sweep out some tiny animals, and he told her to spare them. And at once the toothache departed.130 These materials appear to be an expression of popular Jewish senti ment. It may be that the legend was told orginally about some earlier saint and later attached to the name of R. Judah the Prince. This sort of thing is a common occurrence with folklore. D. The Conclusion All the evidence we have offered tends to show that Philo borrowed from Palestinian tradition. Not all the items indicate this with the same degree of probability; in some cases the probability is high, in others moderate. But even if we decide that this or that instance is not fully persuasive, cumulatively they lead to one conclusion: Philo had a modest knowledge of Palestinian aggadic tradition — not as much as some scholars have affirmed, but more than others have been ready to admit.
