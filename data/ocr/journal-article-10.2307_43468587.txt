<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poet and the Pulpit LAURENCE PERRINE IN THE year 1880, at a time when religious dogma and religious faith had for many Englishmen suffered mortal blows from the onslaught of Darwinism and scientific rationalism, Matthew Arnold, the poet and critic, made a remarkable prophecy about poetry: The future of poetry is immense, because in poetry, where it is worthy of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer stay. There is not a creed which is not shaken, not an accredited dogma which is not shown to be questionable, not a received tradition which does not threaten to dissolve. Our religion has materialized itself in the fact, in the supposed fact, and now the fact is failing it. But for poetry the idea is every- thing; the rest is a world of illusion, of divine illusion. Poetry attaches its emotion to the idea; the idea is the fact. The strongest part of our religion to-day is its unconscious poetry. What did Arnold mean by saying, "Religion has materialized itself in the fact, in the supposed fact, and now the fact is failing it"? He meant that the faith of most Christian believers was founded upon a literal acceptance of certain supposed historical events as facts. It was necessary not only to believe in Christ as a historical personage, but also to regard it as literally true that he was conceived by God upon a virgin, and that he rose from the dead after being buried three days. People at- tached emotion to these "facts," and now the "facts" were failing them. With the advance of knowledge, it was becoming harder and harder to believe any longer in the literal truth of the Virgin Birth, or of the Resurrection, or of any of the biblical miracles. With the removal of these Christian cornerstones, the whole edifice of religious faith built upon them was swaying and toppling. With poetry it was otherwise; for "poetry," said Arnold, "attaches its emotion to the idea"; for it "the idea is the fact." We do not have to SOUTHWEST Review 113</page><page sequence="2">believe that Achilles and Ulysses were actual personages, or that Homer's account of the Trojan War or of the travels of Ulysses are transcriptions of history, for the Iliad and the Odyssey to have value for us. It is unim- portant to us whether Hamlet and King Lear really existed; Shakespeare's plays are not one whit less significant if they did not or one whit more significant if they did. We need not believe in the literal existence of mermaids and mermen for Arnold's own poem "The Forsaken Merman" to have meaning for us. For poetry presents a world "of divine illusion"; it is one of the realms of fiction, whose truths are independent of its "facts." Arnold's day, of course, was a day of religious crisis; loss of faith and conversion to agnosticism was one of its most common experiences. And so, to meet this crisis, Arnold wished poetry to perform a religious func- tion - saw it, in fact, as in the future largely replacing religion. "More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to inter- pret life for us, to console us, to sustain us. Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry." I wish I could say that Arnold's prophecy had come true. But I can- not. I see no evidence of any considerable body of men for whom poetry is serving a religious function, of any large number whom it has saved from religious chaos. Most men, in fact, do not read poetry, have never read poetry, may never read poetry. Poetry seems to be a pleasure of the few, not the many. For its full comprehension and appreciation it de- mands a degree of knowledge, sensitivity, intelligence, and skill that the majority of men do not possess. For most men, bread and circuses - or, in modern terms, TV and chorus lines - have always been a superior attraction. Yet poetry can, for some men, perform the function that Matthew Arnold prescribed for it. It served such a function for Arnold himself. In a sonnet entitled "To a Friend," he begins with a question: "Who prop, thou ask'st, in these bad days, my mind?" His answer to the ques- tion is Homer, Epictetus, and Sophocles - three poets (or two poets and an epigrammatist). More notably, poetry served a religious function for Arnold's elder contemporary, John Stuart Mill. Mill, during his early twenties, underwent a severe emotional and mental depression, described in his Autobiography , in which he "seemed to have nothing left to live for." Greatly instrumental in recovering him from this crisis was the 114 spring 1974</page><page sequence="3">poetry of Wordsworth. "What made Wordsworth's poems a medicine for my state of mind, was that they expressed, not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the ex- citement of beauty." He singles out for special mention Wordsworth's famous ode, "Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood," a poem in which he found, along with more than Words- worth's usual "sweetness of melody and rhythm," and along with the two so-often-quoted passages "of grand imagery but bad philosophy," a description by Wordsworth of an experience similar to his own. If, then, poetry is capable of performing a religious function, if it is able "to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us," in what way is it able to do this? What are the "ideas" to which poetry "attaches its emotion"? What, in short, is the nature of poetic truth? Let us begin by examining Tennyson's famous and beautiful poem "Crossing the Bar," in which an aged poet contemplates approaching death. Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar. Here, beautifully presented, is the expression of a calm, untroubled faith. The idea of approaching death, effectively conveyed through a combination of two symbols - the coming of evening and the beginning of an ocean voyage - strikes no fear in the poet. All the images, by their southwest Review 115</page><page sequence="4">beauty and calm, define the poet's acceptance of death as quiet and se- rene: "Sunset . . . evening star . . . one clear call . . . such a tide as moving seems asleep . . . home . . . twilight . . . evening bell." The poet even re- quests that there may be "no moaning of the bar," that is, "no sadness of farewell" when he dies. And why not? Because, after the ship's crossing of the bar at the harbor's mouth, marking its transition from "our bourne of Time and Place" into the sea of eternity, the speaker will be "home" and will see his "Pilot face to face." There is no reason to lament his passing, for he is going on to a better world. The "hope" expressed at the end of the poem is not just hope; it is confident expectation. The poet accepts death serenely, for he is confident of immortality. Upon closer examination, however, we discover that the poet, though confident of the fact of immortality, is uncertain as to its mode - an un- certainty which makes him hedge his bets between two different and in fact opposed conceptions. In the second stanza, when he refers to "that which drew from out the boundless deep" he is referring to his soul, which, upon death, "turns again home" - returns, that is, to "the boundless deep" - the ocean of eternity or of universal spirit. In the fourth stanza, when he says, "I hope to meet my Pilot face to face," he is again referring to his soul, which after death will see its Creator. The first image derives from a pantheistic belief. The soul is referred to by an impersonal pronoun ("which") and is imaged as a droplet of water which at birth is sep- arated from the ocean of boundless spirit and which at death returns to it, merging its separate identity in the divine whole. The second image suggests an anthropomorphic belief. The soul is referred to this time by a personal pronoun ( "I" ) ; it retains its separate identity after death and greets its Maker "face to face." God, here, is not an ocean of divine spirit but a person - a Pilot with a face. The two conceptions contradict each other and reflect an uncertainty which characterized Tennyson's thought all his life. He instinctively clung to the anthropomorphic concept of the traditional Christian belief in which he had been brought up. But he found a pantheistic concept easier to reconcile with the concepts of mod- ern science. Clearly, if immortality is the "idea" to which this poem attaches its emotion, the idea is a vague one. But is certainty of immortality the "poetic truth" of this poem? Is immortality one of the truths of which poetry assures us? Certainly, many people have used this poem for the religious consolation and the support that Arnold said could be found in 116 spring 1974</page><page sequence="5">poetry. But before we accept this consolation too readily, let us look at another poem. This one is by A. E. Housman, and it is called "The Im- mortal Part." In it a young man brings us an account of what his bones within him seem to say. The bones resent being the slaves of flesh and soul, forced to do their bidding and to carry them about. The bones look forward to death and their release from this bondage. Death, for them, indeed, will be a new birth. Every man, male or female - they tell the young man - is pregnant, with a skeleton. He will give birth to this skeleton at his death. When I meet the morning beam, Or lay me down at night to dream, I hear my bones within me say, "Another night, another day. "When shall this slough of sense be cast, This dust of thoughts be laid at last, The man of flesh and soul be slain And the man of bone remain? "This tongue that talks, these lungs that shout, These thews that hustle us about, This brain that fills the skull with schemes, And its humming hive of dreams - "These today are proud in power And lord it in their little hour; The immortal bones obey control Of dying flesh and dying soul. " Tis long till eve and morn are gone; Slow the endless night comes on, And late to fullness grows the birth That shall last as long as earth. "Wanderers eastward, wanderers west, Know you why you cannot rest? 'Tis that every mother s son Travails with a skeleton. "Lie down in the bed of dust; Bear the fruit that bear you must; southwest Review 1 17</page><page sequence="6">Bring the eternal seed to light, And morn is all the same as night. "Rest you so from trouble sore, Fear the heat o' the sun no more, Nor the snowing winter wild, Now you labor not with child. "Empty vessel, garment cast, We that wore you long shall last. - Another night, another day." So my bones within me say. Therefore they shall do my will Today while I am master still, And flesh and soul, now both are strong, Shall hale the sullen slaves along, Before this fire of sense decay, This smoke of thought blow clean away, And leave with ancient night alone The steadfast and enduring bone.* If "Crossing the Bar" was subtly in contradiction with itself, here is a poem that contradicts both positions implicit in "Crossing the Bar." The title grimly ironical, for before we have read four stanzas, we discover that "the immortal part" is not the soul, as we had anticipated, but the skeleton. The soul blows away at death like a puff of smoke; "the stead- fast and enduring bone" remains. The "rebirth" promised at death is not the Christian rebirth of the soul, but simply a birth of the skeleton. Now what becomes of the consolation and sustentation that Matthew Arnold promised us in poetry as a substitute for religion? How can poetry "interpret life" for us if one poem tells us that life leads on to further life, while another poem tells us that life ends with death? Is not the "idea" of immortality simply another fact, supposed fact, or nonfact, like the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, a supposed fact to which these two poems, in their different ways, attach emotion? One might argue, per- haps, that different kinds of people can get different kinds of comfort * From "A Shropshire Lad" - Authorized Edition. From The Collected Poems of A. E. Housman.

In "Crossing the Bar" the believer can find support for his own hopeful faith, can learn to face death calmly by relying on his confidence in the reality of a future life. From "The Immortal Part" the unbeliever may derive a renewed stoic determination to make the most of life while he has it. Today while he is "master still," he can make his bones obey his will. But such a solution seems less than satisfactory. Unless we can define poetic truth in such a way that it makes all good poems equally available to all good readers, we probably should give up the attempt. But before we examine the problem further, let us look at one more poem. This one is by Matthew Arnold himself, and it is entitled "Dover Beach." "Dover Beach" is Arnolds lament over the decline of religious faith. The "Sea of Faith" was once at the full, he tells us - perhaps he means in the Middle Ages, or perhaps earlier in the nineteenth century before the advent of Darwinism - but now he only hears "its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar," like the sound of a wave retreating or the sound of the tide going out. The speaker in the poem is in a room overlooking the cliffs of Dover, with a pebbled beach at their foot and the English channel beyond. Across the channel, some twenty miles or so away, he can occa- sionally make out the coast of France as it catches the gleam of the moonlight. In the room with him is someone dear to him, a wife or sweet- heart, to whom he is unburdening his despair. The poem is built on a series of contrasts, the two principal ones being a contrast between the illusory physical beauty of the world and its actual spiritual darkness, and the contrast between the full tide which the speaker sees before him and the tide of faith, which is ebbing. The sea is calm tonight, The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits; - on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, Listen! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, At their return, up the high strand, Begin, and cease, and then again begin, With tremulous cadence slow, and bring The eternal note of sadness in. southwest Review 119</page><page sequence="8">Sophocles long ago Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery; we Find also in the sound a thought, Hearing it by this distant northern sea. The Sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. But now I only hear Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath Of the night- wind, down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world. Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night. Here, I submit, is one of the most eloquent expressions of despair in all English poetry. The speaker lives in a world drained of significance by the decline of religious faith. Despite the illusory physical beauty of this world, illumined by the moonlight, its actual spiritual state is one in which there is "neither joy, nor love, nor light, /Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain." In such a world, personal love is the only thing left to cling to, and the speaker cries out in his anguish, "Ah, love, let us be true to one another." But one is made to feel that even this love is a frail support in a vast spiritual darkness, that though the two lovers cling together, they are simply lost together rather than each alone. The final image for this spiritual world is remarkable for the way it piles up words indicating darkness, confusion, and conflict. The plain is "darkling," the "alarms" by which it is swept are "confused," they are alarms "of struggle and flight," the contending armies are "ignorant," they "clash," and they do so "by night." The picture called up is one of utter darkness, of noisy 120 spring 1974</page><page sequence="9">disorder and cross-purposes, where men strike against each other blindly, mistaking friend for foe in their confusion. And now I must ask, "Is this the kind of poetry in which its author felt "our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer stay"? Can we turn to this kind of poetry "to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us"? Can this kind of poetry perform a religious function? And here I must answer, astonishingly, "Yes!" Deliberately, "Yes!" Firmly, "Yes! " Speaking first from personal experience, let me testify that all three of these poems, so different in theme and idea, so different in the confidence with which their speakers face the present or the future - all three of these poems have enriched my own life, have in their differ- ent ways consoled or sustained me, have made my life more precious to me. (That this experience is not merely personal is evidenced by the frequency with which all three turn up in anthologies.) I will go even further. All three of these poems embody and express poetic truth. How they do so, and how they sustain me, requires some explanation. First, you will remember that what gave Wordsworth's poems medici- nal value for John Stuart Mill was that they expressed "states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling," and that one of the best medicines in Wordsworth's kit was a poem marked by passages "of grand imagery but bad philosophy." True feelings, not true ideas, made these poems efficacious. The truth of poetry, then, lies not in the beliefs it expresses, which are matters of opinion, but in the experience it communicates, which is a matter of imagined life. Poetry cannot tell us whether or not there is immortality; it can tell us what men have thought and how they have felt about immortality. Thus "Crossing the Bar" truly tells us how it feels to look forward confidently at the end of a long life to a new and better life to come. "The Immortal Part" truly tells us how it feels to have discarded any such belief and to determine to live resolutely a life which will end - end utterly - with death. "Dover Beach" truly tells us how it feels to be in despair over the decline of religious faith and the presence of conflict and confusion in the world. The poetic truth of these poems applies not to the truth of the views expressed, but to the experience of having those views. Poetry, in brief, is not a means by which we improve our minds, but a means by which, imaginatively, we broaden our experience. Through poetry we live, not only our own rather narrowly constricted lives, but many widely varying lives. Through poetry we can get out of our own skins and know what it is like to be southwest Review 121</page><page sequence="10">in the skins of others. Poems may be false, of course, as well as true; but poetic falsity arises when the poet is not faithful to the full complexity of his feelings, or of a dramatic characters feelings; it does not refer to the correctness of his beliefs. It thus happens that excellent poems have been written on all sides of almost every arguable question, and that all may be valued and enjoyed by a man of catholic taste. And it is thus possible for me to derive value from both "Crossing the Bar" and "The Immortal Part." My second point, and that which particularly explains the consola- tion I receive from "Dover Beach," involves one of the fundamental paradoxes of human existence. It is this. All experience, when success- fully organized and transmitted to the imagination in the form of art, is enjoyable - even painful experience. In real life death and pain and suffering are not pleasurable, but in poetry they may be. In real life un- requited love is not pleasurable, but in poetry it can be. In actual life, if we cry, usually we are unhappy; but if we cry while seeing a play or reading a poem, we are thoroughly enjoying it. The crowning paradox, indeed, is that in art, as opposed to life, the most painful experiences are often the most pleasurable. Shakespeare's tragedies communicate a deeper, more enduring joy than do his comedies, as successful as these are. "Our sweetest songs," says Shelley in "To a Skylark," "are those that tell of saddest thought." Whether or not tragic experience, encountered in poetry, tempers and steels our souls and enables us better to endure tragic experience encountered in life, I shall not say. I think it does. But this is not the point. The point is that tragic experience in poetry is in itself a source of joy. It makes us more intensely alive. And human beings are so constructed as to find some value in all intense living. It is the opposite of being dead. Poetry sustains us by bringing us life, intense life, rich life, experienced through the imagination. Poetry comes to us bringing life in both hands. Thus it is that even poems which sing eloquently of the sweetness of death, as some of our greatest poems do, are serving the claims of life. While I read, in Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," Now more than ever it seems rich to die, To cease upon the midnight with no pain, or when I hear Walt Whitman calling out, in "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," 122 spring 1974</page><page sequence="11">Come lovely and soothing death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later delicate death, or when A. E. Housman advises me, in "When Smoke Stood Up from Ludlow," Lie down, lie down, young yeoman; The sun moves always west; The road one treads to labor Will lead one home to rest, And that will be the best - while, I say, I read such sweet inducements to death, or such lovely ex- pressions of despair over life as are found in "Dover Beach," so long do I find the savor of my own life sweeter, so long am I more tenaciously in love with life. The poets sing so lovingly of death as to make us want to live if only to hear them. Thank you, Matthew Arnold. I will not claim, nor, I think, would you, that poetry is the only source of religious value, or that poetry must entirely replace religion. There are certainly many other sources of re- ligious joy and consolation, and religion has its own values when disen- cumbered of its dead "facts" - of beliefs no longer tenable. We claim - Matthew and I - only that poetry does serve a religious function, that it embodies a form of truth, and that it is capable, in its own way, of inter- preting life for us, of consoling us, and sustaining us. For Poetry says, with Christ, and says it sweetly and invitingly, "I am come that ye may have life, and that ye may have it more abundantly." southwest Review 123</page></plain_text>
