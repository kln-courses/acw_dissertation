Revised September 2006) ABSTRACT Victorian ideas on evolution had strong adherents amongst the European men and women who colonized Africa. Such individuals perceived themselves as superior and viewed African societies and cultures as primitive. Yet, some missionaries who encountered Njanja iron-workers in what is now Zimbabwe were astonished by the sophis tication of their industry and even labelled it 'the Wolverhampton of Mashonaland'. This is unexpected given the stereotypical and derogatory perception of African cultures and technologies that was deeply entrenched at the time. Throughout the 20th century, historical and archaeological research revealed that Njanja iron production was specialized and that it conferred economic power on master smelters, hence promoting their politicalfortunes. Despite this consistent story of successful economic specialization, the technical parameters, such as the conditions of operation in thefurnaces, the quality of the ores and the skills of the smiths in manipulating furnace conditions, remain largely unknown. The results of preliminary metallurgical analyses are presented in this paper. Comparisons with the physico-chemical characteristics of slagfrom historical sites revealed that even though Njanja smelting was constrained by the underlying principles of the bloomery process, there were some subtle links between specialized production, efficiency in reduction and product quality. Keywords: Iron working, smelting, Njanja, Iron Age, Farmer period, Zimbabwe INTRODUCTION The dominant ideas of a generation are greatly influential; this has been the case in the past as well as in the present. This can be seen clearly amongst the late 19th century scientists, hunters, travellers and missionaries who traversed southern Africa. This was the period following the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Strugglefor Life, the work that revolutionized ideas about evolution by natural selection. The concept of survival of the fittest came to be applied even to the understanding of cultural evolution across the globe (Seligman 1930; Fagan 1997; O'Connor &amp; Reid 2003). In terms of technological sophistication Europeans judged themselves to be on the top of an evolutionary ladder while so-called 'primi tive' Africans were said still to be close to the bottom (Newton 1923; Hall 1984, 1987). Because of such pseudo-scientific theories of social evolutionism, late 19th and early 20th century explorers and adventurers were indifferent to African achievements (see O'Connor &amp; Reid 2003). To them, Africa lacked the capacity to invent (Newton 1923). Thus, any seemingly advanced cultures or technologies on the continent were either viewed as the result of the diffusion of ideas from the more 'developed races' or were claimed as the introductions of 'superior colonizers' such as 'Hamites' and 'Semites' (Bent 1892; Hall 1910; Newton 1923). Such a phenomenon has been labelled the 'settler paradigm' in archaeological discourse (Garlake 1982; Trigger 1989). The profound belief in African incapacity led to the conviction that civilisations like Great Zimbabwe were exotic in authorship. Artefacts of local manufacture such as pottery and iron artefacts found at Great Zimbabwe were erroneously perceived to be "of recent kaffir origin and decadence" (Hall 1910: 246). This further accentuated the settlers' low regard for African achievements and resonates well with the racist sentiments of the time. Furthermore, this avalanche of racist views ignored earlier comments by missionaries such as David Livingstone who, in his journals, observed that products from indigenous iron smelting on the Zambezi were of high quality when compared to European imports at the time (Clendennen 1992; Holmes 1994). Most early descriptions of African technologies such as iron smelting were cultural caricatures depicting the technology as crude and backward. For instance, Bent (1892) observed iron smelting amongst various Shona sub-groups and described it as "clumsy" and "replete with barbaric rituals". Brown (1973: 3) posited that Shona smelting technology was in deep and perpetual slumber with master smelters turning out the same product that their ancestors had produced for a thousand years or more. Elsewhere in southern Africa, reports on iron smelting and its associated rituals and taboos were often exaggerated and viewed with disdain. For example, having spent some years of the late 19th century in what is now northern South Africa, Beuster (a missionary) posited that "it was the ancient custom of the Venda tribe in Central Africa for the smith to add human flesh to the ore in order that the iron might make a good hoe, and if no flesh was available, the smith sought for it among the dead" (cited in Rickard 1939: 89). Apparently, Beuster gave undue prominence to the practice of using human body parts in smelting by positing that the Venda smelters scavenged the dead for flesh. Even if the practice of using human anatomical parts in iron working was practised by the Venda (Miller et al. 2002: 118), it would seem that the idea was exaggerated by Beuster to fulfil the stereotypical views of African societies and technologies. Noteworthy is the fact that a critical appraisal of Mrs E.D. Giesekke's work, which is regarded as one of the most authoritative, on Venda ethnography shows very little to support Beuster's overstated claims (Miller et al. 2002). In any case, most Venda groups smelted iron infrequently, with some even relying on the Lemba for their iron requirements (Van Warmelo 1932, 1940). Against this background of the denigration of African cultures, some missionaries, who visited what is now Nharira (Chikomba District) in east-central Zimbabwe, were impressed by the Njanja's (see Fig. 1) well-organized and specialist iron production which they described as an industry. For example, the missionary Shimmin (1893) commented "the Njanja</page><page sequence="2">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 200614 c z ~~ S h ,, rugwl.

Map of the Zimbabwe plateau showing the Njanja and their neighbours. country is the Wolverhampton of Mashonaland where the working of iron takes place from dawn till dusk". The Anglican Bishop Knight-Bruce corroborated Shimmin's views by arguing that Njanja iron working was a "modern industry", with master smelters operating up to twenty furnaces using a shift system of labour (Knight-Bruce 1896). This economic specialization does not seem to have been practised by most Shona groups on the plateau who only smelted infrequently for localized demand (Prendergast 1972). Ever since these observations by early missionaries, interest in Njanja iron working has developed among scholars, colonial administrators and professional historians. There exists a large body of ethnohistorical literature on the Njanja, the historical context of their origins and economic organization. Yet, very little is known regarding the process technology of Njanja iron working: the nature of the technology, the quality of the ores, the conditions of operation in the furnaces and the skills of the smelters and smiths. Thus scientifically analysing metallurgical residues from Njanja iron working processes is essential to complementing the largely historical and cultural data that is available. The next section of this paper deals with the historical origins of the Njanja, their specialization and the description of their iron working as documented in historical sources. This will provide the context for my subsequent laboratory investi gations concerning their metallurgical residues. HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS: FROM POSSELT TO DEWEY, THE 1920s TO THE 1990s The Njanja, a sub-group of the Shona people, have histori cally inhabited a considerable area in central Zimbabwe (Fig. 1). The ethnogenesis of the Njanja is still enveloped in controversy as several traditions have bestowed different and often conflict ing versions. All the divergent myths (see Beach 1994; Macken zie 1975), however, seem to converge around the fact that the Njanja were late comers who migrated from the Zambezi basin in Sena, Mozambique, and occupied a frontier created by the withering Chirwa-Shiri dynasty. Because of their mastery of iron working, Njanja success was initially more economical than political as they were organized in loose kin based groups. Great smelters such as Neshangwe attracted a lot of people as labourers and, as their wealth grew, so did their political fortunes. Furthermore, as newcomers, the Njanja managed to establish their legitimacy through a combination of economic success, which revolved around specialist iron working, and marriage alliances with others. It is not surprising that when colonialism dawned in the late 19th century, the Neshangwe chieftaincy encompassed a huge area with Neshangwe's sons such as Ranga, Tambaoga and Kwenda, great smelters in their own right as sub-chiefs. Several ethnohistorical documents illustrate in detail the nature of the Njanja iron industry and its efficient organization with the smelter-chiefs controlling the whole production and distribution process. After the entrenchment of administrative structures, colonial administrators such as EW Posselt, the Native Commissioner of Enkledoorn and Charter Districts, took a keen interest in Njanja iron working (Posselt 1924, 1926; Mackenzie 1974,1975) delving into Njanja history and encour aging the last of the leading Njanja smelter-chiefs, Headman Ranga, to pursue his trade. Posselt's work revealed that Njanja smelting thrived on exploiting the haematite from the Wedza Mountains (see Fig. 2) and master smelters controlled a large pool of labourers, both men and women, who mined the ore, processed the charcoal and pumped the bellows. Njanja smelting peaked during the dry season, when there were no farming activities, but a few groups smelted ores and smithed blooms from previous seasons all year round (Mackenzie 1975). Given these ethnographic records it is most likely that concentrations of</page><page sequence="3">144 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 2006 Mozambique Zambia - - v - | t '~~~~~~~~m Do* Bfno Boiando |Harare Wedza Nyanga Wedza Mountains * ~~Gutu Shurui*Gu.

Map of Zimbabwe showing the location of the research area and some of the sites mentioned in the text. metallurgical residues exist at iron working areas such as Magangara, the former capital of Neshangwe, and in the vicinity of the Wedza Mountains. Within a degree of variation, Njanja furnaces were approxi mately 70 to 120 cm wide at the base and 60 to 80 cm high, but they varied in size and form depending on the scale of production (Posselt 1924). Typical Njanja smelting furnaces were decorated with anthropomorphic features characteristic of some Shona furnaces demonstrating that they were part of the Shona world view. Despite this expression of fertility symbolism, the Njanja did not observe taboos such as the exclusion of social groups like women and children whose labour was crucial to the pro duction process. De Barros (1986,1988) has documented the ex istence of such reorganization of the role of different genders in the specialized, large scale and market oriented Bassari iron production in Togo. The location of Njanja smelting was dic tated more by the location of critical resources such as labour and ore as in the Bassari case. After forging diplomatic alliances with the Mbire in the second half of the 19th century, the Njanja sited their "factories" within the centre of villages and close to the mines. This shows that although economic reorganization was done within a general group worldview, for example decorating furnaces with female breasts, some aspects were altered to increase success even if it meant going against tradition. This also demands a careful archaeological investigation to comprehend the spatiality of Njanja iron working to evaluate whether there were any diachronic and synchronic changes. Typical Njanja furnaces differed from those of Shona sub-groups such as the Karanga of Shurugwi and the Kalanga of the Matopos and this is to be expected given the differing scale of production. While the bowl furnaces of the Karanga of Shurugwi were operated by a single tuyere with a pair of bellows (Prendergast 1972), Kalanga furnaces typically had two tuyeres with the air being supplied by a pair of bellows (Hatton 1967). Njanja furnaces possessed two or three tuyere ports which accommodated between two and six tuyeres per furnace (Frobenius 1930 cited in Miller 1992; Mackenzie 1975; Prendergast 1974). The number of bellows varied depending on the size of the furnaces with smaller furnaces utilizing two pairs while the largest ones used three pairs. The use of multiple tuyeres and bellows no doubt increased the provision of the combustion air in the furnaces which facilitated more efficient separation of the iron from the waste slag. In the absence of metallurgical data regarding the efficiency of the smelt ing/reduction process and the quality of finished objects, it is tempting to hypothesize that these subtle modifications on Njanja furnaces may have led to the production of quality products, highly esteemed in areas with their own smiths (Hatton 1967; Mackenzie 1974; Prendergast 1972). In the 1940s and 50s, Njanja smelters led by Headman Ranga smelted iron to provide extra entertainment at popular events such as the Johannesburg and Salisbury Agricultural Shows (Franklin 1945; Brown 1973). Such episodes evoked a strong interest in iron smelting among archaeologists who organized a smelting exhibition featuring Headman Ranga at the Queen Victoria Memorial Museum in Salisbury (Harare) (Goodall 1944,1946). Goodall meticulously recorded the whole</page><page sequence="4">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 2006 145 smelting process from furnace construction up to the termina tion of the smelt. After the smelt, Ranga and his co-workers successfully smithed items such as hoes. To crown his achieve ments, Headman Ranga constructed a typical Njanja smelting furnace which is still on display in the Museum of Human Sciences in Harare. From the 1970s, an economic historian from Lancaster University, J. Mackenzie, conducted a diachronic study of the nature and organization of the Njanja iron industry using oral and documentary sources. According to Mackenzie, the economic success of the Njanja was based on the reorganiza tion of the production to achieve economies of scale. The Njanja operated many furnaces using a shift system of labour (Mackenzie 1975; see Shimmin 1893). Under the supervision of the master smelter, able bodied people of both sexes were heavily involved in the production process. For instance they mined the ore, prepared the charcoal and pumped bellows, thus making their labour crucial to the success of the industry. Unlike in areas such as Chivi where rituals prevented the use of women's labour in iron production (Bent 1892), Njanja women were integral to the success of the industry. This form of reorga nization ensured a ready source of labour for the success of a labour-intensive occupation. After producing iron objects in abundance, some young men travelled long distances, exchanging finished products for goats and cattle. This enabled the Njanja to supply iron to distant areas such as Gutu and Shurugwi (see Fig. 1). This form of specialization shows a great deal of variation from the local ized and non-specialized iron working among contemporary groups such as the Karanga of Chivi. Because the Njanja were independent specialists, they used their economic success as a springboard to political power, an historically documented phenomenon in other regions of the world, including the New World (Costin 2004; Flannery 1999; Hayden 2001). In the late 19th century, their iron trade with the Portuguese from Mozambique gave them access to guns and valuable imports to the extent that they were slowly becoming more powerful than their perennial rivals, the Mbire (Mackenzie 1975). Even the Ndebele raiders avoided them despite the appeal of their wealth. In 1990, an American art historian, W Dewey produced a documentary on Njanja iron smelting and smithing, heralding them as a success story in technological and economic organization (Dewey 1990). The Njanja, however, achieved different results when compared to known attached specialists such as the 19th century Nkandla who produced iron on a fulltime basis to meet the voracious appetite of the Zulu war machine (Maggs 1992). The Nkandla were converted by Shaka into full time specialists and did not farm or raise cattle. Also, because the distribution of iron objects was done by Shaka, the Nkandla did not become wealthy nor did they establish their own chiefdom (Maggs 1992). Instead they depended on Shaka for food, demonstrating that different levels of specialization often produced varied returns for the specialists involved in the context specific situa tions (Arnold &amp; Munns 1994; Costin 2004; Patterson 2005; Peregrine 1991). Almost a century of encounters with Njanja iron working convinced missionaries, colonial administrators, historians and archaeologists that Njanja production was highly specialized and well organized, from the raw material procurement up to the distribution of the finished products (see Mackenzie 1975). Having considered the historical reports, the next step towards understanding Njanja iron working is to study the remains of the production process, with a view to reconstructing the process technology. Several questions and historical expecta tions naturally emerge out of such an exercise. For example, did the reorganization of production associated with Njanja smelting stimulate technical innovations (Costin 1991, 2004; Patterson 2005) that increased production, or not? Alternatively, was the economic reorganization responsible for increased efficiency without necessarily changing the basic technology (Costin &amp; Hagstrum 1995; Peregrine 1991)? In this case, archaeometallurgical studies are essential in establishing whether the scale of production was matched by an increase in the quality of finished objects (or not) since Njanja products were highly valued. To provide insights into some of these historical expectations and questions, archaeological studies were therefore carried out on late 19th century Njanja smelting sites near the Wedza Range of Mountains (see Fig. 2) as part of a University of Zimbabwe project that was producing a documentary on Njanja iron working. This presented me with an opportunity to collect metallurgical remains for laboratory studies. BRIDGING GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE: TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF NJANJA IRON PRODUCTION Information elicited from oral sources revealed the existence of late 19th century Njanja mining and smelting sites specifically on the Wedza range of mountains (see Fig. 2) (Headman Mubaiwa, pers. comm. 2004; Samaita, pers. comm. 2004; Headman Ranga, pers. comm. 2004; Mackenzie 1975). These oral sources link the sites with the Njanja. The 89-year old Samaita, now living on the base of Gandamasungo (part of the Wedza Mountains), still remembered stories of Njanja miners and smelters from his childhood. Localized archaeolog ical studies were carried out in this area and important Njanja iron mines and several smelting sites were located by the University of Zimbabwe project team. The mines consisted of quarries of different sizes and depths and stood as testimony to the fact that thousands of tons of ore had been extracted. In the absence of much rubble, it is tempting to speculate that the mines contained mostly good ore and that this therefore reflects the skill of local prospectors in locating rich deposits. Also, one can see a great deal of selectivity exercised by Njanja miners because many iron rich stones are readily available on the surface of the Wedza Mountains. By the late 19th century, the Njanja had established diplo matic alliances with their main rivals the Mbire and Hera for unlimited access to the Wedza ore (Mackenzie 1975). For instance, Kwenda managed to extend his chieftaincy to within a stone's throw of the Wedza Mountains (Mackenzie 1975). Several smelting locations were also situated within a hundred metre radius of the mines on Gandamasungo. Oral traditions reveal that Njanja iron workers divided themselves into groups, with some people mining ore and others smelting and fabricating objects to barter on their way home (Samaita, pers. comm. 2004). Most of the finds from such smelting sites include ore, slag, broken tuyeres and collapsed furnace remains (see Figs 3-6). The ore, which was predominantly haematite, was recovered in two forms: raw or partially reduced. Two types of slag were found: the first consisted of small to medium lumps which had charcoal encrustations. In some cases these had ceramic material attached, possibly from tuyeres or furnace walls. The second type, blockier than the first group, repre sented the majority of the slag found and had a clearly defined flow structure. About five metres east of the main smelting area, a large and smooth block of igneous rock was flanked by a shallow and collapsed thin walled bowl which could have been used as a smithing hearth. The wall thickness of the smithing hearth was</page><page sequence="5">146 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 2006 3~.'.A FIG. 3. Blocks of haematite lying on mining debris on thefloor of the iron mine on Gandamasungo, Wedza Mountains. almost half that of the base of the nearby furnaces. Because lower temperatures were involved in smithing when compared to smelting, such a thin wall could suffice (see Friede &amp; Steel 1986). The recovery of smithing slag (smithing hearth bottoms) in the vicinity of the large rock further provides evidence that it was used as an anvil. Furthermore, the lack of tuyeres and other structural evidence is consistent with a smithing area because the process of smithing utilized fewer tuyeres and often the hearths were not as massive as furnaces used in smelting (Crew 1996; Friede &amp; Steel 1986). A large number of broken tuyeres, which were fused in pairs, were observed at all the studied smelting sites. Such tuyeres were heavily corroded with slag at the tips, unequivo cally demonstrating that they played a part in the smelting process. Irrespective of their heavy fragmentation and the fact that we do not know the original length of the tuyeres, some of them had between 5 and 15 cm of vitrification. This shows that such tuyeres were placed deep into the furnace. Schmidt (2001) has argued that such a practice preheated the air, resulting in the production of blooms with high carbon content. However, the question of such preheating is highly debatable, with some archaeologists denying its possibility on physical grounds (Rehder 1986). This type of tuyere, when fused in a pair, was used in conjunction with double bellows. This represents a significant deviation from the smelting practices documented in other areas of southern Africa at the time (see Prendergast 1972, 1974; Miller et al. 2002). Collapsed furnace remains were also discovered, one of which had a tuyere port still intact at its base. S~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 5.

Samples of ores, slags (smelting and smithing), broken tuyeres and furnace wall were collected for dedicated scientific studies in the Wolfson Laboratories of the Institute of Archaeol ogy, University College London. They were prepared as polished blocks for incident light microscopy and as pressed pellets for bulk chemical analyses using quantitative Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (ED-XRF) in a Spectro Xlab 2000 instrument. ARCHAEOMETALLURGICAL RESULTS SMELTING SLAG Smelting slag was recovered from the site adjacent to a small stream at the foot of Gandamasungo and it was associated with well-defined smelting areas. It was grouped into flow and furnace slag on the basis of external morphological appearance. While the flow slag had a smooth surface, the furnace slag contained occluded charcoal and had attached ceramic material. Typically, both types of slag can be produced during the same smelt. Another distinction needs to be made between flow slag and tapped slag. Tapped slag either collected at the bottom of a pit in the furnace or was removed through an opening in the furnace (Miller &amp; Killick 2004: 24). Morphologically, tap slag has a flat bottom incorporating fresh sand grains from the soil over which it drained. Under _N FIG. 6. Furnace slag from Site 2.</page><page sequence="6">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 2006 147 FIG. 7. Photomicrograph of Wedza Flow slag (in reflected polarized light) showing blocky fayalite, with interstitial glass containing fine fayalite (feathery) and magnetite (shiny) dendrites. x200 magnification. reflected light microscope, tap slag is distinguished by the existence of magnetite skins which form when molten slag is exposed to air outside the furnace. However, the distinction between flow and tap slag in reflected light microscopy is often complicated by the fact that molten slag raked from the furnace can exhibit features akin to those of tapped slag (Chirikure &amp; Rehren 2006). This suggests that control over the archaeological context is important in classifying slags, as laboratory investi gations alone are sometimes not enough. Smelting involved the separation of metallic iron from the silica-rich, glassy slag, in a high temperature furnace. The more efficient this separation, the higher the yield of usable iron obtained. Fluxes promoted this process by combining with waste materials in the ore and this released more iron for reduc tion. While much pre-European iron smelting used self fluxing ores, some societies used sand (rich in silica) as a flux. Microscopically, the flow slags from Wedza were very lean with less than 5% (volume) wustite (Fe, O) in the samples that were analysed. Fayalite (Fe2SiO4) (70%) was the predominant phase together with interstitial glass (15%). In some samples, magnetite (Fe3O4) (2%) was visible in glassy phases (see Fig. 7). Minute quantities of metallic iron (1 %) and hercynite (FeAl2O4) spinels (5%) were also visible in a tiny fraction of the flow slags. Chemically, the flow slags from Wedza stand out for being very lean in FeO with an average of around 58 wt% (see Appendix 1). This further corroborates the microscopic observations and is indicative of a very efficient slag - metal separation and or the use of high grade ores. In addition, the slag is rich in fluxing alkali and alkali earth metal oxides. Typically, these are derived from fuel ash, the furnace wall and tuyeres, demonstrating that they played a part in the furnace chemistry. In terms of its microstructure, the furnace slag is identical to the flow slag discussed above, being dominated by fayalite and interstitial glass with very little wustite. The blocky fayalite in a glassy matrix indicates that the slag solidified in the cooling furnace. In some samples (for example Wedza 3 and Wedza 5), it is difficult to see the grain boundaries of the fayalite. Minute (about 1%) quantities of cotectic intergrowths of leucite (KAlSi2O6) and FeG inclusions were also visible microscopically. Chemically, the furnace slag retained the silica (SiO2) to alumina (Al2O3) ratio of the flow slags (6:1); the main distin guishing feature being the higher FeO content which is on the average c. 66 wt%. As with the flow slags, the furnace slags are also rich in fluxing alkali and alkali earth oxides. Besides the FIG. 8. Photomicrograph of smithing slag (in reflected polarized light) show ing pre-eutectoid wustite dendrites, fayalite, leucite/kalsilite cotectic phases with FeO, and interstitial glass. x500 magnification. difference in the FeO composition, all the other elements are identical to those found in the flow slags, showing that the two groups are related. SMITHING SLAG Smithing slags were collected from a possible smithy, con sisting of the large stone anvil surrounded by a smithing hearth basin discussed above. The physical process of smithing was a two stage process (Crew 1996; Friede &amp; Steel 1986) in which iron blooms were repeatedly hammered in an oxidizing hearth to expel attached slag and consolidate the metal into usable iron, a process known as primary smithing. The forging of objects is called secondary smithing and typically, it does not produce as much slag as in refining the bloom. Smithing slag was identified on the basis of its visual appearance and association with the anvil and smithing hearth. The majority of the slags were rusty and highly magnetic, while some exhibited plano-convex shapes characteristic of slag which solidified at the base of a smithing hearth. Typically, these are some common features of smithing slags that have been studied elsewhere in southern Africa (Greenfield &amp; Miller 2004; Miller &amp; Killick 2004). Microstructurally, the smithing slag was dominated by wustite and fayalitic phases. In addition, it contained leucite cotectic inclusions averaging 10% by volume (Fig. 8). Chemically, FeO stands out as the element with the highest concentration of c. 82 wt% on average. Smithing slags are known to possess high levels of FeO since they often contain fragments from the bloom and smithing scale, both rich in iron (Crew 1996; Friede &amp; Steel 1986; Miller &amp; Killick 2004; Serneels &amp; Perret 2003). The silica to alumina ratio is 5:1 on average which is close to that found in the smelting slags. Typically, smithing slags formed from a mixture of smelting slag (squeezed from the bloom) and hammer scale (essentially pure magnetite). This probably explains the lower levels of silica when compared to smelting slags. While the potassium levels are the same as those of the smelting slags, the calcium content is lower in the smithing slag. Overall, the chemical oxide composition of the smithing slag suggests an association with the smelting slags. UNIDENTIFIABLE One group of slags which could not be associated directly with any metallurgical process with certainty was labelled as unidentifiable. Such undiagnostic slags were wustite rich, with</page><page sequence="7">148 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (184): 142-151, 2006 fayalite in a glassy matrix. They closely resemble smithing slags from the site in terms of their mineralogy. Chemically, this relationship is reflected by the high FeO content of almost 80 wt% which is well above that found in smelting slags. Unidentifiable slags are lower in potassium and calcium when compared to flow and furnace slags. The low levels of fluxing alkali oxides in this group suggest a different origin and perhaps smelting recipe for this material. However, it should be borne in mind that the bloomery process was inherently an inhomogeneous process. Only the analysis of more samples of this material can provide further light on their nature and possible origin. TECHNICAL CERAMICS Collapsed furnace remains and broken tuyeres, here given the umbrella name of technical ceramics, were also studied in the laboratory. The major phases in the analysed furnace wall samples were the clay matrix (70%) containing inclusions such as feldspars and quartz grains (30%). Feldspars have a low melting point which promotes the early formation of a free running slag. The quartz grains in the vitrified parts were shattered due to exposure to high temperatures. No deliber ately added temper was detected. The microstructure of the clays used to make the tuyeres is indistinguishable from that of the furnace superstructure. In addition, the vitrified lining of the tuyeres is bloated and glassy with some slagged parts consisting of wustite and fayalitic phases. In terms of chemical composition, the silica to alumina ratio in both the tuyeres and furnace wall is 3:1. With almost identical levels of magnesium, potassium and calcium, it seems that the clay for making tuyeres and the furnace wall was sourced from the same area. ORE Samples of possible ore were studied using reflected light microscopy (see Fig. 9). The ore is predominantly haematite dominated by iron oxide at about 80%. The quartz grains and other impurities make up the remaining 20% by volume. The chemical analysis of the ores was done to evaluate if there were any significant relationships between any of them and the slag retrieved from the site as would be visible for example by similar elemental signatures (Miller &amp; Killick 2004). The analysed ore samples are distinguished by their very high FeO content which is close to 85 wt% on average. Inversely, they are very lean in alumina and silica. The ore is also 'clean' with low levels of impurities such as silica, manganese, and potash indicating that the fuel ash and the technical ceramics may have played an important role as fluxes in the slagging process. DISCUSSION OF THE METALLURGICAL EVIDENCE Njanja iron smelting was typical bloomery smelting in which iron ores were reduced by carbon monoxide to form an iron bloom and silicate waste products (slag). The preliminary metallurgical analyses carried out enabled the reconstruction of the furnace chemistry, the quality of the ores and the refractory nature of the furnace wall and tuyeres. Although the number of samples is small, it can be argued that Njanja smelters exploited high grade and 'clean' haematite from Wedza. This is supported by a match in the chemistry of the ore and the slag. While there is a difference in the texture of furnace wall (coarse) and tuyeres (fine), the two types of clay have identical chemistry. For instance, they both possess a similar silica to alumina ratio of 3:1. Furthermore, the similarity in the minor element composition suggests a geochemically related source for the soils. Clearly, the corroded nature of the refractory ceramics indicates that they contributed part of the fluxes in the a- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IL .it~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. FIG. 9.

However, the silica to alumina ratio of 6:1 reflected in the slag is strikingly high when compared to the 3:1 ratio in the tuyeres and fumace wall. There are two possible reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, Njanja smelters may have blended high grade with low grade ores, rich in siliceous impurities which were then inherited by the slag. Altema tively, the Njanja added sand as a flux to reduce the high grade ore, a technological solution practised by the BaPhalaborwa smelters in northem South Africa (Miller et al. 2001; Miller &amp; Killick 2004). In the absence of evidence in the historical docu ments for deliberate fluxing and the difficulty of detecting it metallurgically, such an interpretation will only remain a possibility. The existence of smithing slag suggests that smelt ing and primary smithing were practised in close proximity. However, the sample size is too small to give any meaningful picture of Njanja iron smithing and further research will add more light on the subject. The amount of residual FeO retained in bloomery slag is an indicator of the efficiency of the reduction process (Morton &amp; Wingrove 1969, 1972). Mineralogically, the smelting slag is nearly 'wiistite free' demonstrating that most of the available iron oxide had been converted to metallic iron. Flow slag dominated the slag recovered from the site, an indication that high temperatures were achieved in the furnaces. However, the furnaces were non-slag tapping and upon the termination of the smelt, the rake hole was opened with most of the molten slag assuming a flow like structure. This is hardly surprising because non-slag tapping furnaces in general, and those with rake channels in particular, are known to produce flow slag as well (Miller &amp; Killick 2004: 24). The issue of interest is whether raking slag represents semi-slag tapping or not. This is critical because in essence, the process of raking allows a semi continuous operation of the furnaces allowing minor repairs to be made before smelting can be resumed, taking advantage of residual heat (Chirikure &amp; Rehren 2006). The chemical data on Njanja smelting was compared with that from the Zimbabwe tradition site of Baranda situated in northern Zimbabwe and Nyanga Culture sites of Nyamuzihwa Falls and Demera in Nyanga, northeastern Zimbabwe. While Baranda was occupied between the 15th and 17th centuries (Pikirayi 1993), Nyamuzihwa Falls and Demera are probably late 18th or mid 19th century sites (Soper 2002). The comparative procedure was meant to establish the level of efficiency in iron reduction by looking at the levels of FeG in the slags.

Of all the four groups of smelting slags, Njanja slags stand out for being the leanest with an average FeO content of about 62 wt%. Baranda slags have about 70 wt% FeO with those from Nyamuzihwa Falls and Demera being the most inefficient with 76 wt% and 78 wt%, respectively. This variation is a result of two factors: natural constraints and human agency. Differ ences in the geology of the ores exploited by the smelters at the sites are reflected in the slags. For example, Baranda slags are richer in MnO when compared to Njanja and Nyanga. In smelting, MnO has a beneficial effect in that it substitutes for FeO during slag formation thus enhancing the yield. However, it is unlikely that the smelters at Baranda exploited manganese rich ores deliberately, because most of the basement schist com plexes in northern Zimbabwe are manganese rich (Prendergast 1974). In contrast, lateritic ores exploited in Nyanga are defi cient in manganese and alkali earth elements like magnesium which are known to play a fluxing role in smelting. The other level of variation in these slags can be attributed to the human factor in iron smelting. Different smelters at the sites possessed different skills and this is reflected by the high level of fluxing alkali oxides in Njanja slags which is matched by a low FeO content. Greater control over the smelting process by using a higher fuel to ore ratio and a higher blowing rate contributes to the formation of glassy phases which are deposi tories of calcium and potassium. In the case of Njanja, the use of furnaces with multiple tuyeres and bellows no doubt contrib uted to an efficient slag/metal separation. Also, the fact that the Njanja may have used sand as a flux further explains the leanness of their slag. Thus even with the same bloomery technology, the Njanja exercised greater control over their smelting process with greater efficiency and effectiveness. This demonstrates that the production of iron was subject to subtle modifications as different groups engaged with the world around them to satisfy their iron requirements. CONCLUSION Historical observations have shown that Njanja iron production was specialist and highly regarded in other areas that had their own smiths, such as Gutu and Shurugwi. The metallurgical analyses have generated data which can be used to determine whether there was a link between the scale of production and the quality of the products. The preliminary mineralogical and chemical analyses of Njanja iron production remains from Wedza revealed important information on the quality of the ores, slag-metal separation, and the chemistry of the technical ceramics and the possible use of a flux to produce lean slag. Morton &amp; Wingrove (1969,1972) have suggested that wiustite free slag indicates that the iron produced varied within the levels of carbon steels. Normally, steels are known to possess superior qualities when compared to plain and unalloyed iron. If the leanness of Njanja slag implies that they produced carbon steels, then the high quality of their products cited in ethnohistorical documents may result from this fact. However, for such statements to be accepted, metallographic analyses of typical Njanja objects must be carried out so as to understand their fabrication history. Deliberate heat treatment such as quenching objects in water can also improve the qualities of soft iron and has been noted in historical records (Goodall 1946; Prendergast 1972). Thus while the carbon steel hypothesis is an interesting one, it must be backed up by analyses of blooms and finished objects. The next issue to consider is whether the specialization associated with Njanja iron smelting prompted innovations in the process technology. The comparison of Njanja slags with those from Baranda and Nyanga revealed some subtle differ ences in the levels of iron oxide. This suggests that Njanja smelters had greater control over furnace conditions than the other smelters. The use of many tuyeres and bellows may have facilitated this. However, it must be borne in mind that the reorganization of the production process can lead to increased efficiency even without altering the basic technology. Obviously there is a need to study more sites, particularly those from known iron working centres such as Magangara, the capital of Neshangwe, the founder of the Njanja confeder acy. It was here that the missionary Shimmin reported large numbers of furnaces operated simultaneously. Such studies should also consider the spatiality of iron working at these sites to establish whether statements that iron was worked in the centre of villages can be sustained by the evidence and attributed to specialization. Metallurgical analysis of more samples from such a wide area no doubt would provide a broader understanding of the technology and its efficiency than is provided here. In addition, it will be important to study how non-Njanja smelters such as the Mbire and Hera responded to the high grade Wedza ore, and whether they made modifications of their own. This is because the nature of the ore can influence smelting traditions as well as the skills of the smelters (Killick 1990). Despite being based on a smaller area and a small number of samples, it can be argued that the skill of Njanja smelters was well matched by their efficient organization, as mentioned in historical documents. It is hoped that future studies will throw more light on the subject. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The ideas expressed in this paper benefited from very thoughtful comments made by colleagues and referees alike.
