Undertaking a one-volume history of the Jews is a courageous enterprise today. In this age of academic specialisation, few scholars seem eager to risk writing authoritatively about almost four millennia of history connected to at least half a dozen major civilisations (Ancient Near East, Hellenistic, Roman, Sassanian, Christian, Muslim, Modern European and American). The models of multi-volume detailed histories with full documentation by Jost, Graetz, Dubnow and Baron seem alien to contemporary academic enterprise. Similarly with the pre- World War II one-volume surveys, written before the explosion of Jewish Studies in the American and Israeli universities: Abram Sachar, A History of the Jews (Knopf 1930, at age thirty-one!); Josef Kastein, Eine Geschichte der Juden (Ernst Rowohlt 1931), History and Destiny of the Jews (Viking Press 1933); Cecil Roth, A Birds-Eye View of Jewish History (UAHC 1935, at age thirty-six); or the post- War survey by Solomon Grayzel, A History of the Jews (JPS 1947). It is generally accepted that so much new research has been published in the past two generations that no individual can claim to control it all. More recent books have been written for a wider audience by authors with no pretensions of being professional historians - Max Dimont, Jews , God and History (Simon and Schuster 1962); Abba Eban, My People : The Story of the Jews (Behrman House 1968), Wanderings : Chaim Potok s History of the Jews (Knopf 1978) - or by distinguished scholars of general history who are dependent on the research and publication of others for much of what they *Marc Saperstein, Principal of Leo Baeck College, has written four books on the history of Jewish preaching, most recently Jewish Preaching in Times of War, 1800-2001 (Littman Library, 2008).

The alternative model - a cooperative effort of several scholars with different areas of expertise - seems more appealing: Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People with six authors (Random House 1956); A History of the Jewish People also with six authors (Dvir 1969 in Hebrew, Harvard University Press 1976 in English translation); The Jews: A History with four authors (Prentice Hall, 2009). The current work by Michael Brenner, Professor of Jewish History and Culture at the University of Munich, is therefore a somewhat unexpected and intriguing venture. Brenner has chosen as the central theme for his presentation the phenomenon of Jewish mobility, migration, shifting of centres for Jewish life and creativity, with the tension between homeland and exile frequently in the background. Each of the twenty chapter titles is in the form of 'From X to Y' (with the letters generally representing place names): 'From Ur to Canaan,' 'From Jerusalem to Yavneh,' 'From Medina to Baghdad,' 'From Everywhere to Auschwitz.' Only occasionally does this pattern seem strained, as in 'From Tétouan to Teheran', where the latter city plays no role at all in the chapter. In counterpoint with the mobility theme is the Pesach Haggadah, a narrative of dislocation used as an archetype of Jewish experience. Facing the opening of each chapter is a page from a manuscript or printed Haggadah, generally with text or illustration connected with the chapter's theme. In addition, incorporated into the chapters are many striking examples of Jewish art that exemplify and illuminate topics being discussed. These pictures on the glossy paper of the book are appealing in themselves and well integrated into the narrative. It is a beautifully produced volume. The writing does not reveal a distinguished stylist - nothing of the flair (sometimes out of control) of Graetz or the purple prose of Simon Schama - but, in the translation by Jeremiah Riemer, it is clear and free of the jargon that often makes contemporary academic writing opaque to many readers, exposition that doesn't call attention to itself but serves effectively to communicate. In addition to the narrative, the author reveals an obvious interest in population statistics, which he not infrequently integrates into the text and incorporates into a three-page appendix at the end. The data provided for the number of Jews in Istanbul and Salónica (140), Frankfurt (178), Odessa (230), the Habsburg Empire (232-36), the Czarist Empire (243), and several central and East European cities (295-96) undergird the central thesis of dynamic changes in population centres. The book is generally characterised by fairness and balance in discussing 132 European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 20 11</page><page sequence="3">Marc Saperstein controversial issues. I was especially interested in the treatment of Reform Judaism and found it to be without a hint of condescension, with sympathetic presentation of such figures as Abraham Geiger (202, 204), Isaac Mayer Wise (215-16), Stephen S. Wise (301,3 12) and Leo Baeck (308). (This balance does not apply to all historical movements, however; Karaism, a major medieval challenge to rabbinic Judaism continuing into modern times, is given only one paragraph (79-80), and none of its major figures is mentioned.) Every broad survey by a single author is going to raise problems for the specialist reader. I begin with the apparatus. One notices immediately that, characteristic of the one-volume survey, there are no footnotes,1 so that the sources for the details in narrative paragraphs or even of direct quotations which come at the beginning of many chapters are usually not identified.2 References to 'the latest scholarly research' (11) has to be taken on faith, or by guessing the relevant work in the eight-page listing of books for 'Further Reading'. Many readers will wish there was a topical index to supplement the Index of Names and the Index of Places. Since the chapter titles are geographical rather than topical, anyone looking for the discussion of such specific themes as Karaites or Khazars or Kabbalah, Crusades or Disputations, ghetto or antisemitism, Messianism or Reform Judaism, will find no guidance in the back of the book. In a history of the Jews stretching over some 3800 years, important decisions made by the author about the apportioning of space will reflect the author's evaluation of what is important and what is adequately documented, as well as the area of the author's own interest and expertise. One test is to see how many pages are devoted to the period beginning with Jewish Enlightenment and Emancipation in the late eighteenth century (exemplified by Moses Mendelssohn) in comparison with everything that came before. In the Israeli work edited by the medievalist Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson, the 'Modern Period' (here including seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) begins two-thirds of the way through the book. In the 2009 cooperative effort by John Efron et al., 58% of the pages deal with the periods before the Mendelssohn's Berlin Haskalah. Brenner devotes 57% of his pages to the period the starting with Mendelssohn. This material is clearly where his heart is; despite a natural gravitation toward more recent events, some readers may well feel that this is disproportionate attention to the past 250 years. One notes a certain inconsistency in historical approach especially in the early chapters. There is an extreme scepticism regarding the historicity of biblical narratives concerning David (described as 'the legendary founder of the Judaic royal house' 15) and Solomon, with their united kingdom, for which 'there is not a shred of evidence' (12), suggesting that much of First and Second Samuel and First Kings consists of narratives composed in the Second European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011 133</page><page sequence="4">Review Essay : 'Jewish History and Historians ' Temple era for ideological purposes. Since this contentious scholarly stance has serious political repercussions today, it is unclear to me why a historian specialising in the modern period would appear to endorse one side of an ongoing debate. On the other hand, the author knows that Persian King Artaxerxes I gave his queen 'a scrutinizing glance' before he gave Nehemiah permission to depart for his homeland (19), a meaningless detail not even justified by the only relevant biblical verse (Neh. 2:6).3 The theme of Messianism evokes some rather strange discussions. Here is how it is introduced: Of the numerous messianic movements that took place during those [medieval] centuries, only a few are known to us. As a rule, what happened was that a charismatic figure was declared the messiah, and was expected to redeem the world at some specific time - and then, when the foretold date came and went without any noticeable change, people returned to the realities of everyday life. (80) How does the author know that there were numerous messianic movements that remain unknown to us? 'Was declared the messiah' by whom? None of the major messianic movements engendered by charismatic figures was connected with a messianic date; that kind of speculation (based on the numerical equivalents of biblical or rabbinic words or phrases) was generally produced in the study, independent of actual figures or movements. Movements came to an end not because nothing occurred by a designated date, but because the messianic figure died, usually a violent death. And often the followers of such figures did not simply return to everyday life; a community of followers of Abu Isa of Isfahan was intact more than two centuries after his death. Brenner proceeds to describe 'the best-known case' of David Alroy, but unfortunately he bases his narrative entirely on a hostile and mocking Muslim source (80), rather than the much more detailed and sympathetic account by Benjamin of Tudela, the celebrated Jewish traveller, not mentioned in the book. The treatment of the movement surrounding Sabbatai Zevi is totally dependent for its data and interpretation on Gershom Scholem's magisterial account, ignoring some challenges raised by younger scholars (144-48). Perhaps most bizarre is the treatment of Lubavitcher Hasidism. The leader of this messianic movement (also called Chabad Hasidism) was Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who was the Lubavitcher rebbe for forty-four years until he died, childless, in 1994 at the age of ninety-two. Some of his adherents took this as a sign that he must be the messiah. And so they did not choose a successor. The Messianic Age had now dawned, they effusively proclaimed. (372) 134 European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011</page><page sequence="5">Marc Saperstein This totally misrepresents the dynamic of Chabad Messianism, which was focused on the figure of the Rebbe while he was alive. The death of the Rebbe was not viewed as the sign that the messianic age had dawned, it was a traumatic challenge that pushed some adherents to the unanticipated and extremely controversial conclusion that it was possible for the Messiah to have died without accomplishing the familiar messianic tasks, and still remain the Messiah. Obviously this is not a theme of Jewish history that the author has much interest in, or sympathy for. Several key figures of Jewish history are mentioned only in passing. Moses ben Nahman, perhaps the leading rabbinic scholar, proto-Kabbalist and religious disputant of the thirteenth century, appears in half a sentence: '. . . or Moses ben Nachman (Nachmanides or Ramban) who had likewise fled Europe after a disputation in Barcelona' (143).4 The Baal Shem Tov, often described as the founder of Polish Hasidism, is given exactly six lines (161), while Bob Dylan is given a paragraph of 14 lines (372), and the heretical apostate Jacob Frank is given a full page (164-65). While some attention is given to Lurianic Kabbalah - presented misleadingly as having 'revolved around Messianism' (144) - with its central doctrines summarised (148), classical Kabbalah, its major text the Zohar and the author of that text Moses de Leon are absent except for the assertion that 'The study of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) became widespread among Christians' (114). German Pietism is summarised in one short paragraph (112), without a mention of Sefer Hasidim , an extraordinary resource for the everyday life, ideas, and values of Jews in medieval Ashkenaz. Despite gratitude expressed in the Foreword to fifteen different colleagues for their 'critical reviews of some chapters', the final work is not without factual errors. These include errors of chronology. The 'Letter of Aristeas' dates not from second century CE (7), but from the second century BCE. We are told that the title 'rabbi' was not attested prior to the period of the Second Temple' (57), while it is actually not attested even during the Second Temple period.5 An event in the year 1066 is said to mark beginning of the end of the Golden Age in Spain (88), while the term is understood to apply to the 200- year period ending in the 1 140s. The Emperor Henry IV, who died in 1 106, is described as functioning 'toward the end of the Middle Ages' (100), generally assumed to have terminated almost four centuries later. The Spanish Inquisition, established in 1478 (119), 'enacted the first racial laws, which made so-called limpieza de sangre (purity of blood) a requirement for certain offices and titles' (122); in fact, the Inquisition, while authorised by the Pope in 1478, was established by the Catholic Monarchs in September 1480 and went into operation in January 1481, and 'purity of blood' legislation had been enacted in Toledo - not by the Inquisition - in 1449. Hitler's Concordat with European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011 135</page><page sequence="6">Review Essay: 'Jewish History and Historians ' the Vatican was ratified not in September 1933 (325) but two months earlier, in July. There are also problems of formulation and conceptualisation. The ideas of a corporeal resurrection of the dead on earth and a spiritual life after death in another realm are jumbled together without recognising their different origins and the tension between them (47). Maimonides is said to have demonstrated 'that the Biblical text should be understood on two levels: in a literal sense that is disclosed to everyone, as well as in an allegorical sense' (92), but 'literal' is wrong here; Maimonides insisted that all Jews should understand that anthropomorphic language about God should not be understood according to the literal sense. Turning to medieval Europe, we read that 'Enfeoffment, or the mortgaging of land, began to require that a Christian oath be sworn, and in consequence there were soon no longer any Jewish peasants' (98): 'enfeoffment' is not mortgaging but the transfer of land in return for an oath of fealty and service, and surely the intent must have been 'no longer any Jewish land-owners'. In the aftermath of the first Crusade, we are told that 'the emperor allowed the survivors to return to their original faith, since forced conversion was not regarded as legitimate' (99), except that forced conversion, though condemned by the Church, was according to official Church doctrine of the time indeed valid and indelible after the fact, and Henry's decision was a blatant violation of the existing Church doctrine. A few of the other mis-statements: • During the Abbasid period, the geonim were not 'the principals of the most important Talmud academies in Sura and Pumbedita' (79), but rather of the academies of Sura and Pumbedita which had relocated to Baghdad. • Saadia Gaon is no longer thought to be 'the first medieval thinker to attempt harmonising rationalist Greek philosophy with the teachings of Judaism' (80); that place of privilege is now given to DãwQd al- Muqammas.6 • Some of Samuel ha-Nagid ibn Nagrela's 'literary creations in the form of piyyutim, religious poems, have been incorporated into Jewish services around the world' (88): this must refer to another of the 'Golden Age' poets; if ibn Nagrela wrote piyyutim, they have not been preserved. • In a partnership between a Jew and a Muslim, 'rabbis permitted Jews to work on Friday, while Muslims could work on Saturday' (76). This case, taken from Goitein, makes no sense as formulated here: Jews could work on Friday and Muslims on Saturday without any special permission from rabbis. The innovation here was that the Muslim partner in this arrangement, who could work on both Friday and Saturday, agreed to give all profits from Friday to the Jew, in return for receiving all profits from Saturday.7 136 European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011</page><page sequence="7">Marc Saperstein • Pope Innocent III coined the term '(chamber)-serfdom' ( Kammerknechtschaft ) (101); in fact, Innocent III was the first to use the term 'perpetual servitude/serfdom' {perpetua servitus ) with regard to the status of Jews, but 'chamber serfdom' is a rather different conception, implying protection for the Jews by Emperor or King for his serfs of the imperial/royal chamber'. • 'We have hardly any documents pertaining to the women of medieval Ashkenaz' (111): unless this statement contains a translation error and 'pertaining to' should be replaced with 'written by', it would come as a major surprise to scholars such as Avraham Grossman and Elisheva Baumgarten, who have made documents pertaining to women the basis of much of their book-length studies of Jewish women in Medieval Europe.8 • Eliayu [sic] ben Shlomo Zalman, the Vilna Gaon, after excommunicating the Hasidim, was 'in turn, excommunicated by them' (163-64); this must be a new discovery: who among the early Hasidism in the 1770s had the stature to excommunicate the most respected Jew in Eastern Europe? To be sure, the book will be useful to those seeking an up-to-date manageable survey, though I think on balance I would prefer the collaborative efforts of four scholars in the 2009 publication The Jews: A History , with its 'Questions for Reflections' and extensive bibliographies 'For Further Reading' at the end of each of its fifteen chapters. Brenner's book is a brave challenge to the assumption that the single-author academically respectable and generally readable one-volume survey is an anachronism, but it is not a fully convincing rebuttal to that assumption. Prophets of the Past : Interpreters of Jewish History is a very different kind of a book: a solid and illuminating review of Jewish historical writing over the past two centuries. Not surprisingly, the author is especially strong on the works written in the German language, treating not only the familiar figures of the Wissenschaft des Judentums but also some significant contributions to Jewish history made by German-Christian scholars, German-Jewish women historians, and Judaica doctoral dissertations written in the 1930s. He also displays his mastery of the material written in English and Hebrew, and even includes material by Polish, Russian and Hungarian authors. The towering figures of nineteenth and twentieth century Jewish historical writing - Geiger, Zunz, Graetz, Dubnow, Baer, Dinur, Scholem, Baron, Roth - are treated in their historical context, and many of their internal disputes are elucidated: Graetz's attack on Jost, critiques of Graetz by a variety of Jewish authors, Scholem's vitriolic attack on the whole school of Wissenschaft des Judentums and the author's own critique of Scholem; the trenchant reviews of Baron by Baer, Dubnow and Roth; the 'new historians' critique of their Zionist historian forbears. European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011 137</page><page sequence="8">Review Essay : ' Jewish History and Historians ' The translations of Graetz's magnum opus , undoubtedly the most widely read work of Jewish history since Josephus, are given fascinating treatment. We learn that a Yiddish translation of Graetz transformed the author's open disdain for Hasidism into praise of Hasidism as a movement of spiritual renewal. We learn that the Hebrew translation by S. P. Rabinovitch, later used as a textbook in Israeli schools, eliminated all references to biblical criticism, and substituted another historian's work for the final volume covering the most recent period because the translator decided that Graetz did not do justice to East European Jewry. In addition to the giants, there is abundant treatment of lesser known historians: Peter Beer (1758-1838, Bohemia), author of a two- volume history (1822-23), who rejected the title 'Rabbi' in favour of 'preacher' or 'pastor' because he believed that the Karaites were closer to original Judaism than were the representatives of rabbinic Judaism; Samuel Bäck (Leo Baeck's father), author of a one volume survey in 1878, later re-edited by his son; Marcus Fischer, who forged a chronicle of Bohemian Jews in order to demonstrate their medieval roots in Bohemia; Moses (Mojżesz) Schorr, professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Lemberg and pioneer in Polish Jewish history, preacher in the Liberal Synagogue of Warsaw and member of the Polish Senate. The central theme of the book is the relationship between the claim by modern historians of writing history using critical philological and historical methodologies that produced pure objective scholarship, and the ideological assumptions and purposes that almost always accompanied such writing. From Josephus until the nineteenth century, it was extremely unusual for Jews to write works of history in the language of the broader society, intended not only for their Jewish co-religionists but also for their Gentile neighbours. But the founders of the Academic Study of Judaism were certainly aware that their publications were directly relevant to their struggle for acceptance as citizens on an equal basis with their neighbours and acceptance of their religion as one that contained values of importance to modern enlightened society, though it may have required reform to bring it back to its pristine purity. Their history was indeed essentially a history of their religion - the beliefs, the ideas and to some extent the practices that they considered to be the essence of Judaism, alongside an account of how their ancestors had been persecuted and suffered because of their beliefs ( Leidens - und Gelehrtensgeschichte ). Later historians, committed to a nationalist rather than religious concept of Jewish identity, shifted the emphasis from the Jewish religion to the Jewish people, focusing on the institutions of Jewish self-government in the Diaspora (Dubnow), or highlighting the centrality of the Jewish community in Eretz Israel, the strong psychological bonds of all Diaspora communities to this 138 European Judaism Volume 44 No. 2 Autumn 2011</page><page sequence="9">Marc Saperstein centre and the inherent pathology of Diaspora existence (Baer, Dinur). But these historians were themselves often driven by an ideological agenda (Diaspora Nationalism, Zionism). The ideological underpinnings of the work described in this book do not invalidate the enormous contributions made by these historians in enhancing our understanding of the Jewish past, but they do problematise any claim of pure objectivity in historical writing. I mention one technical error that may be the fault of the translator: the rabbinical seminary founded in New York by Stephen S. Wise was neither the 'the Institute of Jewish Religion' (131) nor 'the Jewish Institute for Religion' (132). It was 'the Jewish Institute of Religion'; Shalom Spiegel came there as Professor of Medieval Hebrew Literature in 1929, not - as claimed on p. 168 - to the Jewish Theological Seminary, to which he moved fifteen years later in 1944. A trivial detail to most readers, but not for my father, who wrote his rabbinic thesis on Berdichevsky under Spiegel's supervision at the Jewish Institute of Religion in 1934-35. Notes 1. Paul Johnson's survey is the exception, providing endnotes to document specific references. 2. Occasionally there will be some help such as 4 According to a Talmudic legend', or 4 So wrote the famous Rabbi Eleazar of Worms in his family chronicle around 1220', or This legend, which was recorded by the Toledan philosopher Abraham ibn Daud in his twelfth-century Book of Tradition' - though neither text appears in the Bibliography. In the second half of the book, full bibliographical references are occasionally inserted parenthetically into the body of the text. There is thus no uniformity of documentation. 3. Later, he asserts that 300 New Christians were burnt in Seville in one year, a figure taken from a contemporary source that current scholars view as greatly exaggerated (120). 4. None of these three names for the same person appears in the Name Index; other names missing from the Index are Yehiel of Paris (143) Gershom Mendes Seixas (211). 5. The exception to this generalisation is the use of the title Rabbi in the Gospels, but most scholars assume that this is an anachronistic retrojection from a later period, not unique evidence about the time the texts purport to describe. 6.
