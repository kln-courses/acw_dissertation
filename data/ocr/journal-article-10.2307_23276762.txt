<plain_text><page sequence="1">5 Goddess, nymph or housewife; and water worries at Myrtos?* Gerald Cadogan Forty years ago, when he was 30 years old, Peter took me for the second season at Myrtos Fournou Korifi. My first trench was at the top of the hill, excavating the North Building (Building 1). Then I was moved to the southwestern part of the site. That meant exciting finds and long days of staying on, after work stopped for the rest of the team and they had taken the fishing boat back to the village, to clean, photograph, plan and lift the rich floor deposits of the EM IIB destruction that appeared almost daily. I soon came to know before kolazo what sort of day it would end as. The most intriguing find in the southwestern rooms was the pottery vessel that Peter called the 'Goddess of Myrtos' (frontispiece). When we eventually stopped on the day she came out of the earth, Antonis Papadakis, proedros of Myrtos, gave me a lift back to the village on his motorcycle. I sat behind, holding her in a hessian sack. She has been dear to me ever since; and I thank Peter, and Elizabeth, for the good luck of meeting her in Room 92 and the chance to work at Fournou Korifi — which led two years later to further British School at Athens excavations at Myrtos Pyrgos. In honour of Peter and his Goddess, I offer him a few reflections about her. CONTEXT The figure was lying on its side in the eastern, preserved half of Room 92 at the southwest corner of the excavated area, where it appeared to have fallen from a small stone stand that stood against the east wall of the room. This stand (two flat-topped stones with a clayey filling set on the floor) was only 13 cm high as found. At any rate, the figure had not fallen far, since it was unbroken (until hit by the little pick in excavating). It was in a clayey fill (presumably decayed mud brick) above the floor which was about 15 cm further down:1 this could suggest that it did not fall at the time of the EM IIB destruction by fire (which would have affected mainly the roofs and the upper parts of the walls) but later, perhaps decades or even centuries later, as collapse(s) continued. (As I know from Pyrgos, the winter rains at Myrtos can do plenty of damage to buildings at hilltop settlements, and easily wash out their contents.) There is no evidence that anything else had occupied the stone structure. Its context is clearly EM IIB. This probably is its time of manufacture, but a date in EM IIA cannot be excluded, especially in view of a parallel in one of its ways of showing clothing with an EM IIA vessel (HM 4137) from Koumasa, as is discussed below. Room 92 was a shrine, Peter has said often, seeing it as a forebear of later Minoan 'household shrines'.2 He bases this view on: - principally the figure itself, and the stand (which is labelled an 'altar' in the plan);3 - a hearth and tripartite bench structure he identified in Room 89, on the other side of the east wall of Room 92: this long narrow, stepped room also contained the skull of a young male, burnt in the EM IIB fire (see below);4 - the large number (66) of bowls, jugs and other vessels in Room 91: Peter interprets them as shrine paraphernalia and calls the room, which is entered from the NE corner of Room 92, the 'Shrine Store'; - and Room 90 beyond Room 91: this had a bench and a tub (or lekane) that had probably fallen from the bench.5 Other interpretations are possible. In his re-study of the site,6 Todd Whitelaw demonstrates that the complex * I thank Jules Cashford, Katerina Kopaka and Todd Whitelaw for incisive comments and helpful information; Lucy Goodison for an advance copy of her then forthcoming paper (2009); and Stefan Stahle of the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, for kind help.

In his analysis of the growth of the settlement,7 the South west House is the latest of these three houses, which are unlike those in the rest of the settlement. It is almost certain that it too had a n-shaped pier in Room 92.8 Since its features are so similar to those of other houses in the settlement,9 Whitelaw concludes that, despite the presence of the figure in Room 92 (on which alone the identification of a shrine here depends), this was 'a domestic household, and not a special purpose community shrine'.10 We shall return to this issue. PROVENANCE, FORM AND APPEARANCE If we start with the figure itself and its manufacture,11 a key feature is that its clay contains small black and white grits and gold mica, which identify it as having grano-diorite temper from the Mirabello area on the north side of the Isthmus of Ierapetra near Gournia and Kalo Chorio:12 most probably it is then a Mirabello product. In other words, if from not more than a day or two's journey away, it was an import (or less likely, its unformed clay was) at Myrtos, where it joins a large number of other Mirabello vessels that were received at Fournou Korifi and Pyrgos in EM II.13 The figure has a long, solid stick-like or, perhaps better, phallic neck made from a coil of clay, which joins a closed vessel that describes an oval when viewed vertically, and in general shape is closely similar to a modern metal sheep bell. (This gave the vessel stability when resting on a flat surface.14) Equally, the body looks rather like a crinoline-type skirt; and/or one may see it as having some ceramic similarity to a (truncated) lentoid flask (although this shape is not attested until Protopalatial times).15 At the top of the neck is a small head which is virtually a pin head in relation to the rest of the vessel. But the head has prominent features: ears (pierced perhaps for earrings); eyes that seem bright and attentive; nose; mouth. The breasts are also prominent. Its long arms are fashioned from thinner coils of clay; the left hand is fairly indistinct, the right now missing. The left arm clasps a miniature jug in the crook of the elbow like a baby being supported on a mother's hip. The jug faces more or less left, its handle to the right. The right arm comes across the body to hold (or steady) the jug by the handle, and thus support it.16 The jug forms the mouth of the whole vessel and is its sole opening, which rules out any interpretation of the vessel as a rhyton.17 That is, it is not a 'flow through' vessel with two openings, usually one large and one small. From its dark-on-light decoration of 'fans' (vertical lines descending the body of the jug and converging in groups, starting from the shoulder where they are splayed) and its tall piriform shape, this miniature is immediately recognisable as a model of a distinctive group of jugs found at Fournou Korifi (and Pyrgos) that Peter has called 'Myrtos ware',18 confining the term strictly to jugs of this shape with this scheme of decoration19 (which would otherwise seem cognate to other EM II dark-on-light decorative styles, as known especially in the Mesara in EM IIA).20 In his main account of them Peter notes that they are found in 'most excavated levels';21 but it is interesting that of the Myrtos ware sherds in Mirabello fabrics in Fournou Korifi II contexts none was from clear final destruction deposits and there were no whole vessels, suggesting they may be rather earlier than the destruction, perhaps EM IIA debris or early EM IIB imports.22 As for the fabric(s) — or wares — of these jugs with this style of decoration, they were rightly seen by Peter to belong to both his fabric group 2 (hard, and gritty) and his group 3 (fine brown clay with tiny white and often gold [mica] grits),23 which is an apt account 7 Whitelaw 2007, fig. 1, esp. E and F. 8 This domestic design is probably the forebear of that of the Myrtos Pyrgos II house tomb, with a central pier (which is not Il-shaped but a pillar) in the main chamber (Room 105) together with a narrow rectangular side-room (Room 104, Ossuary 2), as well as an oval ossuary (Space 106, Ossuary 1): Cadogan forthcoming a and b.

Betancourt (1985,43^1, fig. 26 D) describes Warren 1972,134,184, fig. 69, pi. 52 A: P443 as 'particularly aristocratic'.

The vessel slots into group 3.24 Supporting Peter's macroscopic division into two fabrics, Whitelaw et al. showed,25 25 years after the publication of Myrtos, that these jugs at Myrtos with fans are not all from the same production centre(s). Some (Peter's fabric group 3) are from the Mirabello area; others come out of a 'South Coast tradition' (his group 2) with a centre, or centres, probably at Myrtos and/or anywhere to the immediate west of it till as far as the country around Arvi and Keratokampos (but not so far as the Mesara or the Asterousia mountains), to judge from the petrography of the jugs and the corresponding geology of this part of Crete.26 An interesting general feature of the jugs at Fournou Korifi is the push-through handle: Peter recognised this as a feature of period II; Whitelaw et al. have tied it in to the South Coast tradition.27 What remains uncertain, without detailed examination, is where the jugs with Myrtos style fans were made that have been found away from Myrtos Fournou Korifi and Pyrgos. They have been identified at sites around the base of the Lasithi massif (Malia, Sphoungaras and Vasiliki, for all of which one might expect a Mirabello source on the grounds of ease of transport), at Ayia Photia (Siteia) and Palaikastro in the far east of Crete, and at Knossos.28 Other sites would not be surprising. The figure is decorated as well as its miniature jug. Apart from paint to highlight the eyebrows, eyes, nose, chin and nipples, there are also two lines round the base of the neck which suggest necklaces (but without pendants) or decorative strands of threads or cloth. There are also seven free-standing blocks of criss-cross lines, in front and behind. The four blocks behind are placed in two rows. In front there is one block above the breasts and two on the lower body, where the one on the left is considerably smaller so as to fit the space below the jug. Between these two blocks is what looks at once like a pubic triangle, again in criss-cross. On each side is a vertical line fringed by diagonal bars. If the intention is to show cloth, we may imagine either a plaid or tartan garment like a blanket (with presumably a hole for the head) that was put on by pulling down over the head or, perhaps, a shirt (indicated in front by the criss-cross block above the breast) and skirt. Either way, the lines and diagonal bars at the sides could represent the means of fastening the garment(s), such as a seam. What then of the front triangle with its criss-crosses? Either it depicts a pubic triangle au naturel (which would mean that it is just happenstance that it has the same decoration as the blocks of criss-cross), or, as Peter prefers,29 it is a covering — a loincloth. But, since the breasts are presumably shown naked, it would be unwise to deny that the pubic area may also be naked (although we may wonder whether the painter would not have painted it solid like the breast, if that was what was intended). We cannot resolve this question. But we can suggest that, in view of the likely clothing in the criss-cross block above the breasts, and the apparent combination of clothes and nakedness (whether or not that includes the pubic area), the painter had a simultaneous double message to spectators and used a see-through approach to make it utterly clear: the figure is clothed; the figure is female. That is what matters. One may also see the painted triangle in a quite different way. In terms of painting the vessel, it makes sense as a version of the Myrtos style fans that has been modified by horizontal bars across the vertical lines. Again, this could be happenstance, or there may be some symbolic allusion. FUNCTION In material terms, the figure forms a jug — nothing more. It is a vessel intended for receiving liquids so as to pour them out again through the spout of the miniature jug. Pouring what, and with how rapid a flow, we cannot tell. Water? Wine? Vinegar? Olive oil? Milk? It would have needed care to avoid splashes in filling the vessel through the miniature jug; and if it was filled by immersion in, say, a lekane fall of liquid, the air escaping from inside would have made a glug-glugging noise. We turn to its possible symbolic function(s) and significance. SIGNIFICANCE Did the vessel have farther functions and significance beyond its being an unusual and anthropomorphic jug that stood once on a stone side-table in the main room of the South-west House at Fournou Korifi? Soon after the publication of Myrtos in 1972, Peter's paper in honour of Doro Levi assembled a group of nine other vessels that he associated with the vessel and discussed thoroughly (so that there is no need to repeat all the information he gives). These vessels, he believed, 'represent one or more Minoan goddesses'.30 To these can be added a vessel from Ayios Myron,31 24 Warren 1972, 209. 25 Whitelaw et al. 1997. 26 Whitelaw et al. 1997, 268 and n. 19. 27 Cf.

Of the two from Phourni, one is female and seems to date to EM II and has a similar spout at the left shoulder; the other may well be male — it could be seen as ithyphallic — and counts as a rhyton since it has two openings, allowing for liquids to be poured in through the opening in place of the left shoulder and to pour out through what appears to be a hollow phallus: this vessel dates to EM III. The vessel from Ayios Myron also has a left shoulder spout/jug and is part of a group dated by the excavator to EM III. The closer parallels in Peter's list and the additions to the Fournou Korifi vessel are the jug-vessels that are females: the Phourni example; Ayios Myron, which is probably female to judge by the left arm encircling the jug to hold it; HM 4137 (EM IIA) from Koumasa,34 with notably a double clay necklace-band, a jug spout (of sorts) held in the crook of the left arm, and vertical lines with diagonal bars for the clothing — all features that resemble the Fournou Korifi vessel; HM 4993 (assigned to EM III by Peter, but it could be EM IIB) from Koumasa, with a spout at the left shoulder and signs of an arm to hold the implicit jug;35 and HM 9399 (assigned to EM III by the excavators, but it could also be EM IIB) from Trapeza,36 but the spout is at the right shoulder.37 However, although these jug-vessels probably form a pattern or tradition of interaction and shared or related attitudes, the Fournou Korifi vessel stands apart for the specific nature of its features, especially its facial details, tall neck, prominent jug and blatant gender.38 It also stands apart as being the only one to come from a settlement context — although that may reflect the imbalance in Early Minoan excavations between tombs and settlements. Is it then a goddess, and in particular a household goddess? And, if not, how else can we characterise it? First, the context. There is nothing other than the vessel and stone stand in Room 92 that suggests that this room must be a shrine, as Whitelaw has shown. Indeed, its size when complete points to its having been, like the Fl-pier rooms in the South-central and South-east Houses, the principal room of its house, where inter alia people — perhaps the whole community — could have gathered from time to time to eat and drink, thus adding a public dimension to the private functioning of the house. If so, this would have equally applied to the other southern houses, which also have large amounts of pottery and gathering spaces. Likewise, it is not difficult to interpret Rooms 91 and 90 as places (pantries) for the secular storage of crockery and preparation of drinks etc for consumption in Room 92. Room 89, with its hearth, three steps and occurrence of the skull of a young male, is more problematic: while Peter detects a strong possibility of a ritual character to the room, the skull (which is fragmentary and was not recognised in the excavation — I sent it down as a pot) may be just something that was missed when/if the dead were retrieved for burial after the EM IIB destruction.39 There is nothing to suggest ritual and veneration, unlike, say, the skulls stacked against the pithos in Ossuary 1 (Space 106) at Myrtos Pyrgos. Whitelaw rightly sees it as the kitchen of the South-west House, even if entered by ladder down from the roof.40 Next, the concept. There are three issues here. One is the notion of an immanent, even incarnational, divinity implicit in a household goddess. I find this hard to credit, principally because it denies (or at the least reduces) the Kierkegaardian concept of the Other, which I believe is a much more probable phenomenon in EBA Cretan (and virtually any other pre-Christian) ritual — and which we find exemplified later on the island in aniconicity,41 the physical size of more important beings (whether divine or human, or a mix of both), and scenes showing the sun and moon far off in the sky or epiphanies seeming to come out of the heavens/sky.42 Of course, we cannot be certain, either way. But 1 do not see how such a relatively small piece as the Fournou Korifi vessel, however well made and despite its being unique at the site and unique in an EM settlement context (but see above), can merit such an absolute label as to be called a goddess. 32 Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997, 540-1, figs. 538-9. 33 Marinatos 1935, 50-1, fig. 3. For these anthropomorphic vessels with a helpful illustration, see now Goodison 2009, 235-6, pi. 40. 34 Xanthoudides 1924,39, pis. 2,19. 'There can be no real doubt that the first of these vessels (i.e. HM 4137) represents an early appearance of the Snake Goddess', writes Branigan (1993, 136). 35 Xanthoudides 1924, 12-13, pi. 19. Two other anthro pomorphic vessels from Koumasa appear male: Xanthoudides 1924, 12, pi. 19: (HM) 4138^1139; see also discussion of Pendlebury et al. (1936, 94).

The possible assignation of HM 4993 and 9399 to EM IIB depends partly on the nature of the white on-dark decoration. I hope there may be a chance to examine these vessels. 37 The positioning of the arms is in general like HM 4137. 38 It is also considerably taller (21.1 cm) than the others, HM 4137 coming next at 15.45 cm. 39 Ed. note: for another view see Driessen this volume, Chapter 11. 40 Whitelaw 2007, fig. 11 — cf.

Goodison 2009.</page><page sequence="5">GODDESS, NYMPH OR HOUSEWIFE; AND WATER WORRIES AT MYRTOS? There is also the issue of chronology, which is relevant because of the danger of extrapolating backwards from Neopalatial times, as has happened all too often in Minoan archaeology. Here Jean-Claude Poursat reminds us that, since the would-be goddess figures stop at the end of Early Minoan, what a long gap that means until the Neopalatial period.43 Finally, what about the almost standard use of goddess language for such pieces as, say, the faience figures from the Temple Repositories of Knossos? The problem here is that such talk, and the presumptions and predispositions inherent in it, can form the anachronistic sub-text and starting-point to identifying, say, Early Minoan clay figures as goddesses. Are other symbolic interpretations possible? Yes. The vessel may have been some sort of amusement, even one aimed at all ages, like a Toby jug.44 Or it may be that the vessel was invested with symbolic and familiar value in being part of the household but not to the extent that it is appropriate to call it a goddess. The figure could have been viewed as, or as related to, a housewife, or mother, or mistress of the household. If the inhabitants of Fournou Korifi did connect her with water, then she could have gained symbolic value from epitomising the daily, and so often female routine of going down to fetch the water and carry it back up the steep hill. Thus she could have come to be seen as a guardian figure — a piece of good luck — for the water supply of the household (and perhaps the rest of the village). If we go one step up, she may even have been endowed with semi-divine powers, like the nymphs of Classical Greece with their special association with water. Either way, this could have meant that there was a special significance, and perhaps a special, talismanic power invested in the figure on the stone stand, making her an important and familiar, if mute part of the household and even the whole community. This invested importance would have been yet stronger if she should happen to be an EM IIA antique in her EM IIB context: that would have brought the blessings of venerable age and memories passed on. Regardless of the date of her manufacture and arrival at Myrtos, we may imagine how she would always have attracted young children and the stories that were told about her and repeated. On these lines, her holding the jug as if it was a baby may well be significant — another message, that would apply to several of the parallels discussed above. At a humdrum level, this could have been (too) the way to carry a full jug, if one did not carry it on the head. If these messages are both valid to some degree, she could then have been seen, probably subliminally, as linking two great essentials of life: water and motherhood.45 Around 1921 as La source this became Picasso's new theme, painting women (in fact the same woman) on the sea shore holding a water jar or a child (FIG. 5.1),46 and drawing women holding jugs as they meet at the spring.47 I find the connection with the Fournou Korifi figure uncanny and immediate. And what was happening then to Picasso then? It was the time when his son was born. It was also the time when he embarked on his Classical Greek phase (a little before he discovered Minoan Crete and the Minotaur). For the ritual significance of water we have interesting, if circumstantial evidence from Pyrgos, the other settlement excavated at Myrtos. For most of its Minoan life it probably used the river Myrtos below the hill for water, where there would have been far more of it than the Troulli valley below Fournou Korifi could offer. However, in the Pyrgos III (MM IIB) period two monumental cisterns were built, suggesting that the river was not then available (probably because of war). But when the settlement was re-inhabited in Pyrgos IV (LM I) after the destruction by fire that ended Pyrgos III, the larger cistern on the north slope of the hill was turned into a rubbish dump, while the smaller one (which held some 23 tonnes of water, when full) became an ornamental feature of the grand Country House on the top of the hill — and was filled with river pebbles. I believe that the process of throwing in the pebbles (which could not have happened all at once) was a ritual, a symbolic way of marking the settlement's returning to its traditional pattern of life, by re connecting it with river (the source of the pebbles as well as the water) and at the same time rendering the (former) cistern useless as a place to store water.48 So was the figure of Fournou Korifi a goddess? I am far from sure. Did she have some special bestowed value as part of the household and small community? I am happy to think that she could well have done. That leaves the question of how she reached Fournou Korifi from the Mirabello region. Did the inhabitants commission her as something special? Or did an enterprising potter/painter/merchant on the north coast, knowing the predilection of people at Myrtos for jugs with fan decoration (since they obtained them from Gournia/Kalo Chorio and had them made more locally), offer her as a piece they would be unable to turn down? Was her journey to Fournou Korifi led by demand or supply? Who knows? She arrived safely, laid buried for centuries until 1968 and for me is a personal goddess 43 Poursat 2008, 72-3, showing too a quiet scepticism about calling the figures/vessels goddesses. 44 'A jug or mug (formerly common) in the form of a stout old man wearing a long and full-skirted coat and a three-cornered hat', Oxford English Dictionary s.v.

It is a mark of the excellence of Peter's investigation of the site that it permits this and several other re-investigations. There is much still to discuss around the question of what identifies a goddess, or god, in the material culture of Bronze Age Crete. It needs sympathetic scepticism and involves re-assessing all the contexts and the long conceptual historiography, so rich in attributes, of the candidates that have been proposed over the last 100 years. And at a time when we emphasise diachronicity in studying this large island, it is essential to test hardest those contexts that may suggest continuities. REFERENCES FYLO = Κ. Kopaka (ed.), FYLO.
