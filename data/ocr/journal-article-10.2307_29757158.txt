<plain_text><page sequence="1">Antler and Tongue New Archaeological Evidence in the Study of the Chu Tomb Guardian by Paola Dematte 1. Introduction The Chu (a) tomb guardians (*) (hereon TG), theriomorphic wooden (2) statues with protruding tongue and deer antlers (Figs. 2-12, except 11), were first discovered in the early 1930's in tombs of the Warring States period (c. mid 5th century-221 B.C.) of the Changsha area, Hunan Province (south-central China. See Cox 1939, and Rugafiori 1968: xvii). Later on, many other TGs were unearthed in Warring States tombs of Hubei, Hunan, and Henan provinces. During the Warring States period this area was the location of the ancient Chu kingdom (11th century-223 B.C.) (Fig. 1). All the graves from which TGs have been excavated have been proven to belong to the nobility of the Chu kingdom. So far no funerary object of the kind has been retrieved outside of Hubei, Hunan, and Henan provinces. As such the TG can be considered first and foremost a Chu funerary object. These statues, about which apparently nothing is recorded in the classical Chinese ritual texts, at the time of their first discovery were given the name 'tomb guardians'. This name was chosen due to the crucial position they occupied in the overall arrangement of the grave, and to their supposed protective function which was assimilated to that of later 'tomb guardians' (Figs. 19-20) (3).

(*) In Chinese Zhengmu Shou (b), Tomb-guarding Beast. (2) According to Wu (1989: 46) there are also a small number of Chu TGs made of clay, which however I have been unable to locate. (3) These later TGs start to exist from the Eastern Han period onwards, but they are very common in the period comprised between the Three Kingdoms and the Tang dynasty, c. 3rd-10th centuries A.D. On the subject see: Fong 1991: 159-94, figs. 14-42; 1991a; Kuwayama 1987: 77 f., figs. 6, 52, 57, 59, [1] 353</page><page sequence="2">The deer antlers, the tongue protruding from the mouth of these unusual sculptures, and their generally monstrous appearance have been interpreted by scholars as the representative features of a supernatural creature who served to ward off evil spirits which might disturb the peaceful sleep of the interred. Although the above interpretation may be valid, a more thorough explanation of these artifacts' meaning, stylistic development, and use will help shed more light on the burial practices and local cults of late Zhou China not recorded in the ritual texts that have reached us today. While the problem of the significance and symbolism of the TG and its relation to Chu culture has been investigated in various ways by Chinese (Shang 1939; Wang 1979; Chen &amp; Yuan 1983) and foreign scholars (4), however, many questions await further investigation. In this paper, in order to give a satisfactory interpretation of the meaning of the TG, I classify the statues typologically, analyse their stylistic evolution, and interpret relevant archaeological evidence. 2. Morphology of the Tomb Guardian The TGs are wooden funerary sculptures which are often lacquered, and possess deer antlers and a protruding tongue. They are usually assembled of at least three parts: i) the base; ii) the body; iii) and the antlers (5). While these statues vary a great deal, nevertheless they all share a rather 'primitive' look. The majority are roughly carved out of the wood timber, so that they retain a square-like appearance. A few are however carved in the round and thus are stylistically more sophisticated. From the massive amount of archaeological evidence now available, we know that the Chu had the technical ability to create high quality wooden or lacquered objects (6), but they only rarely employed it in creating the TGs. Probably these statues were thought of as objects specifically for the dead and therefore not worth much refined work (7). 64; Wang 1987: 52-54. For the excavation reports on specific tombs in which these TGs have been found see: KG, 4, 1973, and WW, 3, 1972, both dating to the Northern Wei dynasty; KGWW, 2, 1981, dating to the Western Wei; KG, 10, 1959 dating to the Sui dynasty; WW, 7, 1972 dating to the Tang dynasty. (4) Salmony 1954 is a specific study on the subject, while Barnard 1972, 1972a, and Loewe 1978 are more general inquiries about the nature of Chu art and symbolism. (5) In few instances only two pieces: the body and the antlers. (6) That Chu woodwork was technically very advanced is clear from the thousands of other wooden and lacquer artifacts recovered archaeologically. See especially Mackenzie 1987, and Lin 1981. (7) Regarding the funerary goods, the chapter 'Lilun' of Xunzi states: '[...] The wooden articles should not completely carved out [...] This shows that these things are not to be used'. From Dubs' translation (1966: 228). 354 [2]</page><page sequence="3">66W zffo our e404 ego*.J~ac: FIg.1Na h h igo uigteWrigSae eid(t-t etr ..;b h ieo Yig h Cucptl rm69to28BC. n h nab rveCnJanlnHont,Hbi</page><page sequence="4">The antlers (8), the most visible of the TG attributes, have been identified as that of a variety of the spotted deer (9). In one TG however, a bark-made structure shaped as deer antler was used as a substitute (Fig. 8. See Salmony 1954: 13, figs. 16-17). Before being placed on the head of the statues, the antlers had to be prepared. First, they were scraped so to create a base for the decoration. Next, the lower extremities were whittled to fit into the holes carved at the top of the statue. Finally, they were decorated with engravings or painted designs (or both). The drawings, which cover all or just part of the antler surface, are arranged in circular bands and usually include geometric and abstract patterns (curls, straight and broken lines, and spirals in the shape of lozenges, etc.). The tines of both the main antler and the branches are instead painted in a homogeneous dark color (10) (see Figs. 4c, 7a). In form and decoration, the body and the base of the TGs vary. The differences of the TGs can be related not only to the time of manufacture, but also to the wealth and the geographical position of the tomb from which they have been retrieved. The lower part of the base of the TG is ordinarily shaped like a cube, while its upper part resembles a truncated pyramid. In the middle of the base is a hole into which the body of the statue was inserted. The size and the shape of the base have changed through time. It appears that whereas in the early times the truncated pyramidal part was taller, it shortened later on. In some cases, in the later pieces the pyramid-shaped part is almost flat, while the cube-shaped section has grown to become the main component of the base (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 64). Finally, the base can be carved with square patterns in high relief and painted in fine details, or be smooth and covered with lacquer painted designs (n). The upper part of the statue which is inserted into the base includes the body, the head, and in some instances the arms and other attributes of the creature (such as the tongue). The body of most of the TGs appears to have developed along three main stages: i) at first it is straight (Fig. 2); ii) then it acquires a winding (Figs. 3-4) or square shape (Fig. 6); iii) and finally it returns to an almost straight line (Fig. 12). The decoration, either painted or carved (or both) (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 64), is another factor upon which it is possible to make typological and stylistical distinctions (8) In some instances the antlers are lacking, because they either rotted away or they were lost. Their former presence is however witnessed by the existence of two holes carved on the top of the statue which served for their insertion. (9) According to Salmony (1954: 4) the Pseudaxis Hortolorum Swinhoe. (10) One set of antler recovered from Changsha and now in the American Museum of Natural History of New York was treated in a slightly different way. The upper tips were severed to expose the hollow inner part of the horn, and apparently animal hairs were inserted in the cavity as a decoration (Salmony 1954: 4, fig. 1). (n) In some cases the base is neither carved nor painted. However it is not clear whether the paint had disappeared or simply never existed on those statues. 356 [4]</page><page sequence="5">A B Fig. 2 - TGs type I: a. from Yutaishan 142, Jiangling county, Hubei (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 88.1); b. provenance unknown, probably Jiangling county (after Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: fig. 2). among the various kinds of TGs. Painted decoration, which is also evident on some very simple and old TGs, covers the entire statue including the antlers with a variety of multicolored drawings (Fig. 2). Some rather old TGs are decorated with geometric or abstract patterns (curling, interlacing, dividing lines; Fig. 2). Others, perhaps of a later era, display many sophisticated drawings, which however tend always to be of a geometric-abstract type; that is, stylized dragons and phoenixes, simplified taotie (c), spiral lozenges ( ^ ), drops (?), small double circles (?), thunder patterns, clouds or cirri, and curls (Fig. 7a). Both types of patterns were widely used by the Chu in the decoration of other lacquer ware, and therefore do not seem to be an exclusive characteristic of the TGs (see Lawton 1982: 178-90, figs. 134-35, 137-38) (12). While in some cases painting was also used to depict facial features, most often it was employed merely to decorate the already carved features (i.e., eyes, teeth, tongue). On the wooden parts of the statue, drawings were painted in yellow, red, and gold colors (of a lacquerous composition) over a black lacquer base. On the antlers the decoration was instead applied directly to the surface without a lacquer base (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 64). Carved decoration appeared on the TG probably slightly later than painting, and (12) This type of decoration was employed also for bronzes of the late Zhou period in various parts of China, and thus appears to be typical of the time rather than typical of the Chu area. See Weber 1968: 115-73, figs. 41-48. [5] 357</page><page sequence="6">is apparent on the relatively smaller surface (13) of the statue base and 'face'. In the statues which have carved decoration, the base is covered with relief square patterns, while the 'face' exhibits tridimensional facial features (i.e., eyes, mouth, teeth). The formal stylistic differences described above are not to be taken as absolute guidelines for dating, since different shapes and decorations depend on various factors, such as, for example, the provenance of the statue or the status of the owner. These factors cause the intermingling and overlapping of the various types. Below, I will however propose an overall classification of the main known TGs based on stylistic and formal criteria that shows also some chronological and geographical significance. 3. A Typological Classification In the past, Chinese scholars have classified the existing TGs in various way (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983, and Jiangling 1984), however due to the limited number of pieces studied or the deficiencies of the analytic criteria employed, none of the existing classifications are today completely acceptable. This classification is based mainly on the data available from the report of the archaeological excavations at the necropolis of Jiangling Yutaishan, Hubei (Fig. lb) (from here on referred to as YTS (14)). Out of a total of 558 tombs excavated, 156 TGs have been retrieved. Since the report of YTS examines only a few types of TG, our study will also include specimens from other Chu tombs (15), and TGs found in the 1930's and 1940's in graves of the Changsha area (pieces which are now housed in Western collections; Salmony 1954: 7-13). (13) Except for the two completely zoomorphic statues of Xinyang Changtaiguan, Hebei, which are completely covered with reptile scales. See Fig. 9. (14) YTS is a slightly hilly area about ten kilometers north of the county town of Jingzhou. The tombs are situated on the southern slopes of YTS, to the east of Jinancheng, the site of the ancient Chu capital Ying, and are surrounded on three sides by the Changhu Lake. The tombs are clustered in four groups on four hillocks following each other from west to east. The bigger grave are usually at the center of each hill. Jiangling 1984: 1-2. (15) A complete summary of all the tombs in which TGs yet were found does not exist, and would also be very hard to compile because not everything is published. However the most important graves or cemeteries where TGs were unearthed besides YTS are: a) in Hubei province: Tianxinguan 1, Wangshan 1 and 2, Shazhong 1, Tengdian 1, Gebeisi 34, Taihuiguan 6, 18, &amp; 50, one from Chengxi and ten from Bomashan (Jiangling county); two tombs at Baizitan (Echeng county); two tombs at Xiaohuangjiatai (Qianjiang county). b) in Hunan province: Liuchengjiao 1, Liufangling 3, Nanjiao 17, Yangwuling 3 (Yinong county) and Yangjiawan 6 (Changsha); Niuxingshan 1 &amp; 2 (Xiangxiang county); Deshan 47 (Changde). c) in Henan province, Xinyang county: Changtaiguan 1 and 2.

Type I The TGs have been previously described as statues bearing deer antlers and a protruding tongue. In Type I we see however some TGs which lack a tongue (16) and a well-defined 'face'. These specimens are decorated with a relatively simple painted design and show no carving in relief. The antlers are fixed on a disk-like head. The (16) Some of the simplest and probably oldest TGs did not have a tongue (Fig. 2), while some other originally had a tongue which was subsequently lost (Fig. 7). As to the object in Fig. 2, it is to be considered merely a deer antler stand. We will return to this later on. [7] 359</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4 - TGs type IIB: a. from a Yutaishan grave (after Zhang 1987: pi. 13); b. from Yutaishan 264 (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 88.2); c. from Yutaishan 354 (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 89.1); d. from Taihuiguan 6, Jiangling county, Hubei (after KG, 6, 1973: 343, fig. 9). body is straight and inserted in a low and smooth pedestal which has the prominent feature of a truncated pyramid (Fig. 2). At present we know of nine such statues. Seven of them come from the YTS necropolis (Jiangling 1984: 107), while the remaining two were recovered from a double burial tomb at Xiaohuang Jiatai, Qianjiang county, Hubei (Fig. 15) (17). AU of them are datable to the early Warring States period. (17) Tomb no. 6.

Type II Type II includes all of the TGs with a beast-like appearance that always exhibit antler and tongue. These can be sub-divided into six (A-F) typological sub-groups according to decoration, shape of the body, and various secondary attributes (18). Some odd statues belonging to this category come from the peripheral Chu area of Hunan (IID-IIE-IIF). Type II, Group A: The main characteristics of the statues of this group (Fig. 3) are: a sinuous shape in the upper part of the body (19), and a rather low pedestal base with a short truncated pyramidal section. The whole statue is covered with very simple waving-line designs arranged in geometrical portions and created by means of painted decoration only. Besides these decorative patterns, the head also has painted facial features. At least twelve examples of this kind are known, all excavated from the YTS cemetery (Jiangling 1984: 108; Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 63 f.). This type of TG was adopted from the time of the early Warring States and persisted until the end of this period. Type II, Group B: The upper parts of the Group IIB statues bodies are sinuous in appearance and are decorated both with painting and carving (Fig. 4). As such, they can be considered a more complex form as opposed to those of the previous group. (18) The secondary attributes (usually the arms, the snake, and sometimes the teeth of the beast) appear only in highly elaborated TGs (groups II-B, II-C, II-F). (19) An early tendency toward a bending body is already visible in one TG of type IA (Fig. 15, right), which can be considered a transitional type (from IA to IIA). [9] 361</page><page sequence="10">A further advancement can be seen in the pedestal which is covered on the surface and on the sides with square patterns in carved relief that almost completely obscure the pyramidal shape. Carving is used also to shape the protruding eyes and other features of the statues face (20). Besides the statues shown in Fig. 4, which are complete and well preserved, two other TGs dating to the middle Warring States period can be included into Group IIB (Fig. 5) (21). Their overall structure is the same as that of other IIB TGs. While they have a sinuous body and a base carved in relief, they lack antlers and tongue, and their facial features are quite indistinct. This is very probably due to bad preservation. Unfortunately, the graphic reproductions of the publication are poor, and therefore it is unclear whether antlers, tongue, and facial features were originally part of the piece. The great majority of TGs so far discovered can be included into Group IIB. 38 have been excavated from the necropolis of YTS and a large number come from other Chu tombs of both Hubei and Hunan, spanning the length of the entire Warring States period. This type was therefore very popular in Chu (22), and it is then very likely that it underwent some stylistic evolution on its own during the over 200 year long Warring States period. I suggest that the most useful features for tracing the stylistic changes of the statues of Group IIB and arranging them chronologically are as follows: 1) the degree of bending of the body (from less to more sinuous), 2) the height of the pedestal (from lower to higher), 3) the amount of carved relief on the base (from less to more abundant). In order to test the above, one would need reproductions of all the TGs of Group IIB so far discovered as well as the dates of the tombs. Unfortunately, not all this material is available (23). Type II, Group C: The common feature of the TGs in Group IIC is the square body of the statue created by the conjunction of head, neck, arms (or tongue) and back of the beast (Fig. 6a-d). In these TGs the body rises from a short socle set as a reverse pyramid over the low base. (20) For more information on the tombs from which these TGs were excavated, see Jiangling 1984: 108; KGXB, 1, 1982: 104; Barnard 1972: 17-22; Salmony 1954: 7-13; Zhang 1987: 196-98. (21) The tombs in which these TGs were found are Bomashan 4 and Gebeisi 34, both in Jiangling county (Hubei). See W, 9, 1964: 29 f.; and KG, 3, 1973: 151-61. (22) Although specimens have been recovered from Hunan tombs, it appears from archaeological evidence that typology IIB had been more widely adopted in Hubei rather than in Hunan, where instead IIC, and other unusual forms, were more common (23) Chinese archaeologists rarely publish a reproduction of every artifact they discover. Besides, unpublished artifacts from China are not available for study to foreign scholars, and many TGs have already disappeared. 362 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 6 - Type HC TGs: a. from Liufangling 3, Changsha, Hunan (after HNWW, 1, 1986: 63, fig. 7); b. from a Changsha grave discovered in the 1930's (after Barnard 1972: fig. 8 J); c. from a Changsha grave discovered in the 1930's {ibid.: fig. 8.9); d. from Niuxingshan 1, Xiangxiang county, Hunan (after WWZLCK, 3, 1980: 112, fig. 42.10). These pieces are decorated with carving and painting. The carved decoration is present more often on the body of the statue than on the base which is often left uncarved. Detailed carving is especially apparent on the face of the creature whose features are first excavated and then painted over. Some of these statues (Fig. 6a-b, d) also have carved features, such as arms, and fangs, which are absent in most TGs. At least four examples of this type are known all coming from Hunan Province. Only two of these can be dated reliably: i) the specimen shown in Fig. 6a from tomb 3 at Liufangling, Changsha, which is datable to the late Warring States period (24); ii) the piece in Fig. 6d, from tomb 1 at Niuxingshan, Xiangxiang county, datable to the early middle Warring States (WWZLCK, 3, 1980: 98-112). The other two (Fig. 6b-c) were uncovered prior to 1949 and the excavation lacking scientific accuracy, have no certain dates (see Barnard 1972: 31-33; Salmony 1954: 11-12, figs. 14-15). (24) For the report on this tomb (Changsha Liufangling), see HNWW, 1, 1986: 58-64. [11] 363</page><page sequence="12">Double-Bodied TGs, IIB1 and HCl In some of the richest Chu tombs of both Hubei and Hunan a small number of double-bodied TGs have been retrieved (Fig. 7a-d). They have elaborate structures and decorations, but their shapes have nonetheless roots in the single-bodied pieces described above in IIB and IIC. These pieces can be subdivided in two groups: IIB1: Double-bodied TGs as elaboration of the single typology IIB (Fig. 7a-c); HCl: Double-bodied TGs as elaboration of the single typology IIC (Fig. 7d). As with the pieces of the sub-types IIB and IIC, these two groups can be differentiated from each other by the shape of the body and the presence of additional elements (such as the arms, and the fangs of the HCl). Both types have two bodies stemming out from a single base which separate above the socle, cross-sect, and end as two heads facing opposite directions. The structures of these two types are, however, different in that IIB1 is created by the conjunction back to back of two S-shaped bodies, while HCl is formed by two square bodies back to back. These types of TG were used especially during the middle Warring States period. There is, however, at least one statue dating to the early Warring States (25). Type IIB1, as IIB, is common in Hubei, while HCl, like IIC, appears to be special to the Hunan area. Type II, Group D: The only statue of this group has a solid and sinuous body, a large base covered by simple carved patterns, and a set of ram instead of deer antlers (Fig. 8). These now little antlers which contrast sharply with the powerful structure of the statue were originally much larger. However due to the long period of time the statues were buried they have decayed and shrunk. Evidence for this process of decay are the two holes on the top of the statue, which are clearly too wide for the present size of the antlers (Salmony 1954: 13, figs. 16-17). This TG has neither painted nor engraved facial features. The few remains of painted decoration throughout the statue suggest however that they may have originally been present. Due to its peculiar shape and the ram rather than deer antlers, this TG can be said to be a regional variation of the more common typologies we have so far examined, and maybe a provincial transformation of the common IIB type. Unfortunately not much is known about its provenance and its date. There is some reason to believe that this piece (now in a Western collection) was recovered during a pseudo-archaeological excavation in the area of Changsha, Hunan, prior to 1949. (25) The one example dating to early Warring States comes from a tomb of the necropolis of Jiangling Yutaishan. While at Yutaishan there are no double-bodied TGs dating to the late Warring States, it is possible that they were still in use elsewhere. 364 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 7 - Double-bodied TGs: a. type IIB1 from Tianxingguan 1, Jiangling county, Hubei (after KGXB, 1, 1982: 102, fig. 28); b. type IIB1 from Wangshan 1, Jiangling county, Hubei (after Barnard 1972: fig. 8.1); c. type IIB1 from Yutaishan 174, Jiangling county, Hubei (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 88 J); d. from an unspecified Changsha grave (after Barnard 1972: fig. 8.2).

Fig. 9 - Type HE TG from Changtaiguan 1, Xinyang county, Henan (after Barnard 1972: fig. 8.6). Type II, Group E: These TGs are fully zoomorphic statues carved in the round and decorated with very detailed painted and engraved designs (Fig. 9). They represent a composite animal creature standing upright on the hind legs with the front legs grasping a snake that hangs from the mouth (26). Besides the protruding tongue and the deer antler, these pieces also have feline ears, and large and round insect eyes. The surface of the statue is covered by scale-like carvings. Only two pieces of this type are presently known. They were excavated from tombs 1 and 2 of Changtaiguan, Xinyang county, Henan (27), and both date back to the early Warring States period. The unusual shape of these TGs might perhaps be explained in terms of regional traditions: the present region of Henan, being closer to the Central Plain, is rather peripheral to the center of classical Chu culture located (26) About snake-devouring creatures, see Wu 1989; Loewe (1982: 124) suggests that the presence of a snake devourer was perhaps considered desirable as a means of protecting the body by consumption by vermin. (27) For details on the tombs and their TGs, see Xinyang 1986: 60-61, 114. 366 [14]</page><page sequence="15">in Hubei (28). The two statues from Changtaiguan are the only TGs known so far to carry a snake in their mouth (29). Fig. 10 - Type IIF TG from Yangwuling 3, Yiyang county, Hunan (HNKGJK, 2, 1984: pi. 15.3). Fig. 11 - Substitutive ritual statuette of a servant from Yutaishan 186 (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 91J). Type II, Group F: The single piece of Group F has a rather unusual shape compared to the rest of the known TGs (Fig. 10). Although the photographic reproduction of this piece is not good (30) one can make out an arched body and a dog-like head with finely carved facial features. Other than this the statue does not appear to bear any painted or carved decoration. Only a first-hand examination of the piece could reveal whether there are any traces of former decorative paintings or carvings (31). The two main features of the TG, the antler and the tongue, are in an unusual position. Instead of flowing down from the mouth along the body, the tongue is pushed forward like a weapon. From the presence of two holes into the body of the statue we can deduce that the no longer extant antlers were fixed on the shoulders rather than on the head of the beast. The statue comes from a recently excavated tomb in Hunan province datable to the late Warring States period (32). Once again, Hunan seems to provide the most intriguing of the TG types. (28) Influences from the Central Plain cultures should be considered as potentials for causing this unusual shape, that seems close to animal design decoration employed in the ritual bronzes. (29) Few other TGs carry something in their mouths, but it is unclear whether these are snakes as well. See Figs. 6a-b, d, and 7d. (30) The original reproduction from the Chinese journal HNKGJK, 2, 1984: pi. 15 J, is very badly printed, and the explanatory text is rather laconic. (31) However due to the problems pointed out above, this is at the moment impossible. (32) The tomb is: 80 Yinong M3. See HNKGJK, 2, 1984: 70. [15] 367</page><page sequence="16">Type III Type III groups the TGs with anthropomorphic facial features. These TGs (Fig. 12) have highly stylized and slightly sinuous bodies, but are equipped with realistic-looking human heads, whose faces, except for the tongue flowing down from the mouth, very much resemble some ritual substitutive statuettes of servants (Fig. 11) commonly found in the tombs of Chu noblewomen and noblemen (33). Even with their human-looking faces, these statues still bear the terrifying aspect of the other TGs. This effect is brought about by the presence of an extremely long tongue which flows out of the mouth lying abandoned along the body, and by the lack of eyes which are described only by means of a thin eyebrow. These simple statues belong to the last stage of the formal development of the TGs. We know of five examples coming from both Hubei and Hunan and datable to the middle and late Warring States period (for reference, see Salmony 1954: 7-8, figs. 5-7; Rawson 1980: 166, fig. 140; Barnard 1972: 17-22; Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 64; Jiang 1946: pi. 33b, 34b &amp; d). The carving on these five figures differs in quality. It is hence possible that they represent different stages in the development of type III. The one with straight body and slightly carved face in Fig. 12d could be considered the oldest, while the British Museum specimen (Fig. 12c), which shows a curved neck and a head almost carved in the round can be relegated to a later date. 4. Analysis of Typological Use To analyze the stylistic development of the statues cited above it is important to have exact provenance and clear photographic reproductions of all the TGs, as well as complete archaeological information regarding all the tombs from which a TG has been retrieved (such as date, gender of the deceased, orientation, type of grave, etc.). However, due to the fact that some TGs were found at an early date in less than scientific excavations and that several tombs were badly damaged we have incomplete information. To mitigate these deficiencies, the following analysis will be based upon the results of the excavation of the Chu necropolis of YTS in Hubei province (34). Here, reliable (33) These ritual statuettes were used to represent the servants of the deceased so that her/his rank would be recognized as s/he entered the underworld. In the more distant past (Shang) it was commonplace to have the servants of the deceased sacrificed and buried with him, but by the Eastern Zhou period this habit was dying out, and the living servants were more often substituted with figurines. This tradition was common among the northern as well as southern states, but in Chu the statuettes were made of wood, while in the north terracotta was more commonly employed. (34) Unfortunately also this archaeological report is not very detailed: not all the discovered TGs are reproduced and other information such as the gender of the deceased is lacking. 368 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 12 - Type III TGs: a. from Yutaishan 555 (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 88.4); b. from unknown grave (after Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 65, fig. 6); c. from a tomb of the Changsha area. The piece is now in the British Museum collection (after Barnard 1972: fig. 8.5); d. from a tomb of the Changsha area (ibid.: fig. 8.7); e. from Niuxingshan 2, Xiangxiang county, Hunan (WWZLCK, 3, 1980: 112, fig. 42.5). dates and other information are available for the majority of the graves, a number of which yielded one TG each (35). (35) 156 TGs out of 558 excavated graves, which equals to 28%. [17] 369</page><page sequence="18">Of the 558 excavated tombs at the YTS site, Chinese archaeologists have been able to date and classify on the base of the funerary articles and pottery seriation, 423 of them (36), into six periods (37). The remaining 135 tombs, which due to bad preservation do not have a clear-cut dating, have been generically termed 'Eastern Zhou'. The TG's typologized above are listed according to seven periods (Table 1). Although this table only presents results limited to YTS, it still provides a base for an interpretation of the stylistic development of the TGs. From the above it is possible to see the frequency of use of the TGs in the YTS tombs through the different time periods. This pattern appears to be valid for other Chu graveyards as well. Notwithstanding the high number of TGs of unclear shape excavated from the YTS site, the sample still appear to be quite representative. TGs were not retrieved from Spring and Autumn tombs in YTS (38), whereas they abound in the tombs of the subsequent Warring States period. In Period III (early Warring States) the predominant TG was type I which is characterized by a simple shape and the lack of tongue. The TG of the next greatest frequency are the zoomorphic TGs (sub-type IIB). In periods IV and V of YTS (middle Warring States) type I and the statues of type II (zoomorphic), particularly of group IIB (carved decoration), predominate. In the last YTS period (late Warring States) the TGs of type II and, in general, the number of TGs and that of the tombs of YTS, drop vertically (i.e., only one painted decoration example and no carved ones), while the first and only type III TG (anthropomorphic) makes an appearance. The evolution indicated by the table for the last period (late Warring States) is of limited usefulness, since during the late Warring States period the area of the Chu capital Ying (d), in whose surroundings the YTS necropolis lays, was almost abandoned by the Chu people, who moved southward (toward Hunan and therefore Changsha), and later eastward towards Shouchun (e) in Anhui to the last Chu capital, under the impeding threat of a Qin invasion. As such, the archaeological findings from Hunan (and especially from the Changsha area) of the middle late and late Warring States period (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983) are of particular significance in studying the final stages of the development of the TGs. Three of the five anthropomorphic TGs of type III come from Hunan. Though the tombs from which they were excavated are generically considered to be Warring States, it is known that the graves of central Hunan often date to the middle late and late (36) The remaining 135 tombs are badly damaged or do not contain items that allow a reliable dating, and have therefore been classified as 'Eastern Zhou'; see: Jiangling 1984: 145. In these graves there have been discovered 15 TGs, one was of typology IIB, while the remaining 14 were too damaged to allow for a classification. See ibid.: 119 f. (37) The six periods are: I middle Spring Autumn (S.A.), II late S.A., Ill early Warring States (W.S.), IV early middle W.S., V late middle W.S., VI late W.S. (38) There is however at least one case of a late Spring Autumn tomb with a TG. See below. 370 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Warring States (Zhang 1988: 430). This appears then to confirm the typological development shown by the TGs of YTS. In sum, the above analysis makes it possible to delineate three stages in the development of the TG types for the area of YTS, which can also be applied to other Chu cemeteries: Stage 1, Early Warring States: Type I predominates. Characteristics of these statues are: i) upright body; ii) formal and decorative simplicity; iii) tendency toward abstraction; iv) presence of antlers, lacking of tongue and facial features. Stage 2, Middle Warring States: Sub-type IIB predominates. Characteristics of the statues are: i) winding body; ii) completely developed bestial appearance through an extensive use of painted and engraved decoration; iii) antlers, tongue, and facial features. Stage 3, Late Warring States Type III predominates. Characteristics of the statues are: i) simple anthropomorphic face; ii) presence of antlers and tongue; iii) scanty decoration; iv) simply carved facial features. From this sequence, that considers for each period/stage only the category with the highest number of statues, it is possible to visualize an ideal development for the TG, which goes from a primitive simplicity of the sculptures without tongue and facial features, to a complex bestial form, and finally develops into the essential simplicity of a human expression. Basic to this development in the appearance of the TG is the face, which in the earlier examples is undefined and later becomes elaborately rendered. This development can be considered from the point of view of a change of taste, which led the Chu in each specific time period to prefer one type over another type of TG. Formal development was also taking place within each type group (39). The scheme in three stages proposed above, suggests a key to discerning the formal development of the statues of the central Chu area (Hubei). Although the three-stage scheme has interpretative value, it is clear that the situation was at each stage more complex (see Table 1). During the early Warring States despite the predominance of very simple statues without tongue and facial features, the zoomorphic TGs were already present with their completely developed structure. In Henan (Changtaiguan (39) It is though possible to suggest that in some sense types IA, IIA, and IIB are different phases in the evolution of the Hubei region TG. [19] 371</page><page sequence="20">tomb 1 and 2) we also find a zoomorphic TG carved in the round (Fig. 9). By the middle Warring States, it appears that all the statues belonged to type II (zoomorphic TGs). In Hubei they bear a classical winding shapes, and in Hunan they employ a square body or other new forms typical of the local regional styles. Lastly, during the late Warring States together with a larger number of anthropomorphic TGs (type III), there appeared, especially in the Hunan region, some peculiar TGs with unusual beast-like shapes. Following this, we propose a summary of the various interpretations of the meaning and function of the TG that have been previously suggested. 5. Previous Interpretations In the past, various scholars have tried to define what the TG represents, and what it meant. Salmony (1954) described the TG as an elaboration of the taotie motif, but strangely saw its origin in India. Hayashi (1972: 123-86) has instead identified the TG with Jiangliang (f), a monstrous creature described in the Shanhaijing. His interpretation, however, is difficult to accept since Jiangliang is described in this text as having a human body and a tiger head (40), which is not the shape of the TG. Mizuno (1937) and lately Wang Ruiming (1979) suggested that the TG is Shanshen (h), the Spirit of the Mountains. Again the starting point for this explanation is a series of descriptions contained in the Shanhaijing, which give details as to the appearance of a number of mountain spirits, none of which really matches the shape of the TG (41). Yet another interpretation sees the TG as the tridimensional representation of the dragon (Peng 1988). However, in this case as well there does not seem to be any particularly convincing relation between the TG's appearance and that of the Chinese dragon. More recently, Chen Yaojun and Yuan Wenqin (1983) have proposed that the TG represents Tubo the Lord of the Underworld, by pointing to both its position in the head compartment of the tomb, and its monstrous appearance. In ancient China the tomb was considered the underground residence of the deceased (42), and its (40) The 'Da Huang Bei Jing' chapter of Shanhaijing says: Tn the middle of the Great Desolation [...] there is also a spirit who eats and grabs snakes; it has a tiger head and a human body, four hoofed legs and long elbows; its name is Jiangliang (8)' (Yuan 1985a: 285). (41) The 'Nan Shan Jing' chapter of Shanhaijing states '[...] From Mount Ju to Qiwu, there is a total of seventeen mountains, [...] all of their spirits have a dragon body and a bird head 0' (Yuan 1985a: 6); and '[...] From Mount Tianyu to Nanyu, there is a total of fourteen mountains, all of their spirits have a dragon body and a human face (k)' (ibid.: 9). In the 'Zhong Shan Jing' chapter it is said: '[...] From Mount Shou to Bing, there is a total of nine mountains, all of their spirits have a dragon body and a human face C)' (ibid.: 137; see also Wang 1979: 85). (42) In the chapter 'Lilun' of Xunzi it is said: 'Hence the appearance of a tomb and its tumulus is like a house' (Dubs 1966: 238). Also worth noting is the fact that in Han times the grave was called house (ju) (m), home (jia) (n), private dwelling (shizhe) (?), everlasting residence (qianwan suishi) (p), everlasting cottage (wannian lushe) (q); see Cheng 1983: 145-272. 372 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Table 1 PERIOD Number of Tombs % of TOT* Tombs with TG TG%* I middle S.A. 1.61% II late S.A. 65 11.65% III early W.S. 115 20.61% 33 28.69% IV early middle W.S. 139 24.91% 89 64.02% V late middle W.S. 56 10.04% 16 28.57% VI late W.S. 39 6.99% SUBTOTAL 423 75.81% 141 33.33% 'Eastern Zhou' 135 24.19% 15 11.11% TOTAL 558 100% 156 27.95% * Calculated on the total of 558 tombs. ** Percent calculated on the total number of the tombs belonging of the period. k** Unclear shape.

The various compartments of the wooden chamber are thus equated by Chen Yuejun and Yuan Wenqin (who base their interpretation on the YTS evidence) with the rooms of the aristocratic villa (43). The front end compartment where the TG is usually found, is thought to correspond to the front hall, tang of these mansions, the place were Tian (w), Heaven, was worshipped. Since the tomb is the underworld representation of the house, the head compartment corresponding to the tang should have been dedicated to the worshipping of Tubo, the counterpart of Heaven in the world of the dead, which the TG is thought to represent. Chen and Yuan also quote the description of this god given in the poem Zhaohun of Chuci as supporting their interpretation: O soul, come back! Go not down to the Land of Darkness, Where the Earth God lies, nine coiled, with dreadful horns on his forehead, And a great humped back and bloody thumbs, pursuing men, swift footed; Three (44) eyes he has in his tiger's head, and his body is like a bull's. O soul come back! Lest you bring on yourself disaster (z). (From Hawkes 1985: 225) Chen and Yuan argue that the above is a very close description of the actual Chu TG. This does not appear to be so. Although some TGs may be said to have a tiger? like head, none has a nine-coiled body resembling that of a bull. Also, this description does not mention any protruding tongue. Furthermore it is unlikely that a figure such as Tubo, which was clearly considered harmful to the hun (aa) soul, would be chosen to protect the tomb and the deceased. The explanation ought therefore to be sought elsewhere. In order to suggest a new explanation for the TG it is crucial to take a closer look at the archaeological evidence pertaining to the TG and the tombs from which this statue has been excavated. (43) This is the development of a theory already put forth some time ago by Yu Weichao (1979: 332-37, esp. 334, &amp; 333, fig. 1), who equated the front, the coffin the side, and rear compartments of the funerary chamber respectedly with the tang (r), the shi (s), the fang (*), and the beitang (u) or xiashi (v) halls of the aristocratic residence. (44) According to Zhang (1987: 197-98), who agrees with Chen's and Yuan's interpretation, the character 'san' (x) should not be read as referring to the number 'three', but as referring to the asterism san (sanxiu) (y), one of the 28 lunar asterisms, which with other six of its kind make up the Tiger Constellation (one of the four seasonal polar constellation of Chinese astronomy). 'San muy would thus mean 'tiger eyes' and not 'three eyes'. 374 [22]</page><page sequence="23">6. The TG and the Tomb: Archae? ological Evidence The 156 TGs of YTS have been excavated from an equal number of Warring States tombs, and, except for one case (45), they were always found in the front case of the funerary chamber, usually in the middle (46), with the face turned inward, towards the coffin (Fig. 13.12). The 156 tombs of YTS equipped with TGs have very specific characteristics which distinguish them from the rest of the graves of the necropolis. They always have a wooden structure that includes at least a funerary chamber (guo) (ab) and a coffin (guan) (ac), and either a set of ritual bronzes or one of substitutive terracotta vessels (Jiangling 1984: 148). The features of the tombs at YTS equipped with TGs occur also in other Chu cemeteries (47), and from their analysis it is possible to draw the following conclusions: 1) In a tomb there could be only one TG per single burial, or no more than one per person in case of multiple burials (QUANTITY); 2) By being placed in the middle of the front room, the TG occupies a very important position in the tomb (POSITION); 3) The TG was a ritual object pk VALUE); o n so Fig. 13 - The wooden burial chamber (guo) of Yutaishan 354: note the TG in the middle of the front compartment (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 40). only in the tombs of the nobility (SOCIAL (45) In YTS tomb 555 the TG was placed in the side compartment. See Jiangling 1984: 49-53, fig. 43. (46) Most of the YTS tombs had only three compartments: the coffin, the side, and front compartments. Since the coffin compartments was completely filled by the coffin, and the side one was too narrow for such a large statue as the TG, the front compartment was the only possible alternative. (47) Cfr. the catalogue of Chu tombs and sites: Chu 1984. [23] 375</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 14 - The joint burial (hezang) at Xiaohuang Jiatai 6, Qianjiang county, Hubei (after JHKG, 4, 1988: 36, fig. 4). 4) As far as we can judge the classical Chu TG came into being around the early Warring States period (or late Spring Autumn), and was used mostly in that period only (TIME). These four pieces of information make up a starting point for interpreting the meaning of the TG. The fact that there is only one TG per Chu tomb is significant, and constitutes a point of departure to study the symbolic meaning of these statues. The tombs of YTS (48) show that the Chu consistently placed only one TG per tomb. It is also worth noting that rather than putting two separate TGs in the same tomb, the Chu adopted instead the more complex double bodied statue for the wealthiest graves. In other cemeteries of Hubei there are examples of multiple burial graves (either xunzang (ad), sacrificial burial, or hezang (ae), husband and wife joint burial) (49), in which more than one TG per tomb is present. This indicates that the number of TG is related to number of corpses per tomb. (48) The TG tombs of YTS are all single burials. (49) Generally xunzang and hezang are distinguished on the base of the size and arrangement of the coffins in the grave. If the coffins are of the same size, and placed side by side they are considered hezang, while if a larger coffin is in the middle and the others are smaller and on the side that is considered xunzang. In the hezang the wife was not killed and interred at the same time of the husband, the grave could in fact be reopened and the corpse be placed in at a different time. Comments on the practice of hezang are contained in the 'Tangong' chapter of Liji. See Couvreur 1950: vol. 1, 109-10. 376 [24]</page><page sequence="25">if ^^^^ C^*\ Fig. 15 - The two type I TGs recovered from Xiaohuang Jiatai 6. On the left the one from the female burial, on the right the one from the male burial (after JHKG, 4, 1988: 39, figs. 1.9-10). Tomb 6 at Xiaowang Jiatai, Qianjiang county, is a husband and wife joint burial with two TGs (JHKG, 4, 1988: 33-42). Two coffins of approximately the same size were placed side by side in the wooden chamber, which is divided into two equally large sections (Fig. 14), each containing a good number of funerary goods. Since the skeletons were well preserved, it has been possible to determine that the one on the east side belonged to a woman, and the other to a man. Although more funerary goods were placed on the man side (fifteen versus eleven), in both compartments there was a TG. Both the TGs recovered from tomb 6, which is datable to the early Warring States period {ibid.: 41), belong to type I (Fig. 15), and thus are consistent with the pattern of typological evolution we have deduced from the YTS excavations. From the evidence of Xiaohuang Jiatai tomb 6 it is also clear that the TG was used in both male and female burials. Women as well as men enjoyed the company of these protective statues in their tombs. The types of statues used for both sexes are equally complex. For example, in a rich grave, Taihuiguan no. 50, Jiangling county, where the skeleton of the interred was identified as that of a woman, a double bodied TG was retrieved (50). Another Hubei tomb, Baizitan no. 5, Echeng county (KGXB, 2, 1983: 223-53), is instead a xunzang or tomb with sacrificial burial. This is evident because of the disposition of the three coffins and of the funerary goods in the wooden chamber (Fig. 16). The main burial (one outer plus one inner coffin) is placed at the center of a six-compartment wooden chamber, while the two smaller coffins are positioned one in the eastern side and the other in the northern side compartments. Since in the grave there were only two TGs (in the west compartment), we have to suppose that one of the xunzang victims was not provided with a TG. Archaeological evidence (50) The tomb dates to the middle Warring States period. See KG, 1, 1977: 61, fig. 7. [25] 377</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 16 - Tomb with sacrificial burial (xunzang): layout of Baizitian 5, Echeng county, Hubei. Note the TGs in upper left compartment, nos. 18-19 (KGXB, 2, 1983: 226, fig. 4). suggests that the TG is associated only with the upper class, thus we can infer that perhaps one of the two victims was not of aristocratic status. This is, however, only a tentative explanation, since we know of upper class tombs without TGs. Baizitan tomb 5 dates to the early middle Warring States (corresponding to YTS period III). The two TGs unearthed there, are poorly reproduced, and it is unclear to what category they might belong. They appear to have an upright body, square in cross section, with some relief carving on the base and on the head. They could thus be considered a variation on the IIB theme due to regional influence (Echeng county is relatively far from the center of classical Chu culture in Jiangling county). A well preserved example of the classical position the TG occupies in the tomb structure is offered by the layout of tomb 354 of YTS (Fig. 13). From this plan it is easy to see how the TG, with its deer antler extending from the centre over most of the front case, appears indeed to protect the grave, and to be the master among the funerary objects. 378 [26]</page><page sequence="27">691 ! " I y I 0_1_2 Fig. 17 - The burial chamber of Changtaiguan 1: note the TGs in the rear compartment surrounded by four ritual statuettes (after Xinyang 1986: insert). Although this arrangement appears to be quite common in the medium size graves of the YTS cemetery (where the front end compartment is the only one wide enough for the TG), in tombs larger than those of YTS (i.e., having more than three compartments), the TG position may vary. The statue is sometimes placed in the front compartment (51), and sometimes in the back, such as in Baizitan 5 (Fig. 14), and Changtaiguan 1 (Fig. 17; Xinyang 1986: insert). Although placed in the back compartment, the TG of Changtaiguan tomb 1 remains always in a central position surrounded as it is by four wooden statuettes of attendants; two women at the east and two men at west side. As we have seen above (? 5) the crucial position that the TG occupies in the front end compartment of most Chu tombs has been used by two Chinese scholars to interpret the meaning and the function of these statues (Chen &amp; Yuan 1983: 39). (51) Such as at Jiangling Tianxinguan, Hubei. See KGXB, 1, 1982: 81, fig. 10.

Although their interpretation is interesting, it is important to remain aware of the fact that the position of the TG in the wooden chambers of YTS, and other medium size graves, seems to be motivated not only by symbolic, but also by practical reasons (see above ? 6). The association of the TG with tombs equipped with: (A) at least one wooden chamber and one coffin; (B) one or more sets of bronze or pottery ritual vessels, clearly indicates that the TG-graves ought to belong to the aristocratic class (Peng 1982). The classical texts (52) are very explicit regarding the rules of grave organization. They state the exact number of coffins and funerary chambers, and the type of ritual vessel that could be interred in a tomb according to the rank of the deceased. The reliability of the texts has been proved by comparing textual prescriptions to archaeological evidence from tombs whose owner's status was known (53). (52) Especially the Tangong' chapter of Liji&gt; the Tianzi' chapter of Zhuangzi, and the 'Lilun' chapter of Xunzi. (53) Such as at the Marquess of Dai tomb, Mawangdui 1, Changsha; see WW, 9, 1972: 52-73; and the King of Yan tomb, Daobaotai 1, Beijing, see WW, 6, 1977: 24. 380 [28]</page><page sequence="29">The last point concerns the dates of use of the TG. From archaeological evidence it appears that the statue was used almost exclusively during the Warring States period. The TG tradition died out with the overthrow of Chu by Qin (223 B.C.), and the subsequent unification of China under the Qin empire (221 B.C.). In the Qin and Han period tombs of the Hubei, and Hunan areas there are in fact no traces of the classical Chu wooden TGs (Mackenzie 1987: 88). In Western Han graves of the former Chu area, there have however been found some strange statues carrying deer antlers, which, notwithstanding some important differences, appear to be the natural descendants of the Chu TG (54). Differently from the former Chu TGs which are zoomorphic or just partly anthropomorphic and are always single entities in the grave, these statues are representations of humans (male and female), do not have the protruding tongue, and at times occur in pair. Also their location in the tomb is not the same as that of the Chu TGs: they are not among the funerary goods inside the grave, but in the tomb corridor which leads to the grave proper. Although this movement of the TG statue from the inside to the outside of the grave, is partly due to the evolution of the structure of the tombs which during the Han period started to give a greater role to the tomb corridor (Wang 1982: 175-79), from this development it is possible to demonstrate that the TG was not a simple grave good, but had instead the specific function of guarding the tomb. This function is particularly clear when we observe the clay image of a kneeling female which has been discovered in a Han tomb at Huaiyang, Henan province (Fig. 18) (55). This statue, whose body is that of a voluptuous, yet monstrous, female with large breasts and a round belly, bears a full set of deer antlers. The monster, placed in the middle of the tomb entrance corridor facing the outside, holds its arms wide open, physically and symbolically preventing anyone from entering the resting place of the deceased. Beside the position, also the apotropaic appearance of this creature appears to play a role as a deterrent to the entering of the grave. A pair of very well preserved kneeling figurines (for which however there is no illustration available) carrying deer antlers has been recovered in the entrance corridor of both tomb 2 and 3 at Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan, dating to the Western Han period. Both couples were finely made with a core of wood and straw rope, and a covering layer of clay (WW, 7, 1974: 40-41). Hints to the existence of similar statues have also been recovered from the corridors leading to the Western Han grave of Cao Zhuan at Xianjiahu (WW, 3, 1979: 1), and to the Han tomb 1 at Xiangbizui (KGXB, 1, 1981: 112), both located nearby the city of Changsha in Hunan Province. (54) Three are the Han tombs from which these statues have been recovered: Changsha Mawangdui 2 &amp; 3 in Hunan (see WW, 7, 1974: 39-63); and Huaiyang 1 in Henan for which no published reference is available. See below. (55) This artifact to my knowledge has not yet been published. I owe the information and the reproduction in Fig. 18 to prof. Cao Guichen of the Henan Wenwu Yanjiusuo, Zhengzhou, Henan, whom I met during my trip to the region in June 1987. [29] 381</page><page sequence="30">One of the characteristics of the Han TGs described above, namely that of occurring in pairs at the entrance of the grave, is typical also of the 'tomb guardian creatures' of the Northern &amp; Southern dynasties, Sui, and Tang (56). Although the pairs of TG of the later periods have mostly leonine bodies with either a human or a lion head (Fig. 19), some example, such as the one in Fig. 20, is more human-like and, in spite of its lack of antlers, appears to have something in common at least with the Han period woman TG from Huaiyang (Fig. 18). All these elements allow to connect the TG tradition of the late Zhou Chu state with the later one of middle imperial China. However, while it is easy to understand how the TG tradition was transformed after Chu was conquered by Qin and in the subsequent Han period and thereafter, explaining why such statues started to be employed rather suddenly around the end of the Spring Autumn and the start of the Warring States period is not such a simple matter (57). 7. Deer Antlers, Antler Stands and Related Objects Although from the archaeological evidence examined so far it appears that the TG with deer antlers and protruding tongue was a new funerary object of the Warring States period whose use was limited to Chu tombs, the habit of burying deer antlers was common in many parts of China long before the appearance of the classical Chu TG. Three deer antler fragments were recovered from two tombs at the Neolithic site of Dawenkou (c. 5th-4th millennium B.C.) in Shandong province (58); and other specimens were discovered at the Shang site of Anyang (Salmony 1954: 4). Deer antlers were also recovered in Spring Autumn and Warring States upper class graves of the Central Plain, as well as of the south, in situations similar to that of the Chu TGs. Deer antlers bearing painted decoration similar to those of the Chu TGs have been recovered from: tomb 2717 at Zhongzhoulu, Luoyang, Henan province (59) (Fig. 21); tomb 7 nearby the ancient Jin city of Changzi in Shanxi province (60); tomb (56) For a very thourogh study of the later TGs, see Fong 1991. In tombs of this later period, the TGs appear as two pairs, one of creatures, one of warriors. I assimilate to the Chu TG only what Fong terms 'tomb guardian creatures' (ibid.: 159-60). (57) Although the TGs are typical of the Warring States period, there is at least one instance of such a statue being discovered in a late Spring Autumn tomb, Liuchengjiao 1, Changsha. See KGXB, 1, 1972: 104. (58) The two tombs are nos. 106 and 133, see Dawenkou 1974: 105, pi. 100.

Beside being painted, all these deer antlers had also their lower extremities whittled. As I pointed out above (? 2) the whittling of the extremities was carried out in order to fix the antlers on top of the TG or some other type of stand. Although no TGs have been recovered from these graves, it is possible that in these non-Chu tombs the deer antlers were attached to simpler stands. These funerary objects are commonly denominated 'deer antler stands' (lujiao zuo) (af), and can ideally be placed half way between the loose deer antlers and the completely developed Chu TG. According to the archaeological evidence, the 'deer antler stands' differently from the Chu TG appear to span all the Zhou (64) period and to be present in both Chu and non-Chu tombs of various parts of China (Mackenzie 1991: 127-28, fn. 57). (61) In tomb 12 one set, and in tomb 14 fourteen fragments, see KGXB, 1, 1957: 111, 116-18. Both graves are datable to the Warring States period. (62) The grave has been dated to c. 330 B.C. The antler were found in the eastern storage compartment of the grave. See WW, 1, 1979: 6.

(64) According to Mackenzie (1991: 127-28, fn. 57) a deer antler stand was also discovered in Han tomb of Zigui, Hubei province. However the examination of the reproduction on JHKG, 1, 1984: 16, fig. 14.4 does not seem to allow such a conclusion. 384 [32]</page><page sequence="33">1 r ? ? ?

Two Western Zhou specimens, cast in bronze, have been recovered from tomb 3 at Jichang, Tunxi county, Anhui province (65) (Fig. 22); and in a grave datable to the late Spring and Autumn period, Shanwan 11, in Xianyang county, Hubei province, archaeologists have discovered a set of deer antlers below which lay three ding-type bronze feet (dingzu) (as) (Fig. 23) (66). It is possible that the three feet made up an antler stand of some sort, or that they belonged to an already rotten structure that supported the antlers. This is, however, unclear from the excavation report. Other bronze antler stands have been discovered in three Eastern Zhou graves: one at Caijiagang, Huainan, Anhui province (67); another at Shaoxing 306, Zhejiang province (Fig. 24) (68); and the last one (Fig. 25) in the burial of Lady Huang Meng (65) Anhut 1987: pis. 42-43.

This last one bears also a short inscription, similar to the ones which are commonly found on Zhou bronze vessels, stating that the object was made by the husband, prince Huang, for the eternal enjoyment of his wife Mengji (69). One of lead, coupled with a set of painted deer antlers, was brought to light from tomb 1 at Zhaogucun, Hui county, Henan province (Ye 1985: 163; Huixian 1956: 110), a grave datable to the Warring States period. Differently from other known deer antler stands, the Zhaogucun one (Fig. 26) is not square, but rather it appears to resemble in shape some tiger-like creatures that function as bases for the drums and antlered birds sculptures often recovered from Chu graves (Fig. 34). Three wooden antler stands come also from the Chu tombs 1 and 2 of Changtaiguan, Xinyang county, Henan province (Fig. 27), which are datable to the early Warring States period (Xinyang 1986: 60-61, 114). These objects are slightly different from the metal stands examined above, and bear some similarities (especially regarding the shape of the base and the overall painted decoration) with the TGs. Due to this fact, these antler stands have been often considered to be true TGs. Since tombs 1 and 2 of Changtaiguan have also yielded a very elaborate TG each (see HE, (69) The inscription runs as follows: 'Prince Huang made this vessel for Lady Huang Mengji to be treasured forever' (*) (KG, 4, 1984: 324, 318, fig. 19). 386 [34]</page><page sequence="35">Fig. 26 - Lead ander stand from Zhaogu 1, Hui county, Henan (after Huixian 1956: pi. 94.23-24). Fig. 27 - Deer antler stand from Changtaiguan 1, Xinyang county, Henan (after Barnard 1972: fig. S.8). Fig. 9), some scholarly publication presents the two tombs as examples of single burials with more than one TG. Tomb 1 is said to have two TGs (one of typology HE, Fig. 9; and one 'antler stand', Fig. 27), and tomb 2, three (one of HE, and two 'antler stands') (70). This is however in contrast with all archaeological evidence, which, as shown above, clearly indicates that there could be at the most one TG per buried corpse. Given the symbolic similarity the deer antler stands share with TGs, the study of the former may help shed some light on the use and previous history of the latter. The two, however, should never be confused and considered to be the same object. The antler stands, which have neither tongue, nor head or body, are only partly predecessors to the TG, and their symbolic significance may only be partly similar. From the above-mentioned archaeological evidence, one can trace the history of the TG from its supposed origins in the burial of deer antlers in the Neolithic graves of Dawenkou in northeastern China, through the use of deer antler stands in the Zhou period, down to the tongued TGs of Chu, and later in the antlered Han kneeling figurines and in the middle imperial ceramic TGs. Although this might appear as a smooth and linear development, we have to take into consideration the possibility (70) Thote (1988: 49) says: *Les grandes sepultures de Chu contiennent en general un, deux, voir trois zhengmushou [...]'. [35] 387</page><page sequence="36">that each of these object, albeit their fundamental relationship, might have served a different function, and might have had a different meaning to the contemporary people. The deer antlers of Dawenkou, for instance, were discovered with deer bones (Dawenkou 1974: 105). This fact may indicate that the animal was sacrificed on the spot, eaten, and partly buried. A practice quite different from the one involving the creation of a statue. We have also to consider the fact that even if we can trace the deer antlers of the Chu TG to an older northern Chinese tradition, that does not account for the presence of the protruding tongue. The true innovation of the Chu people of the Warring States period, was in fact the idea of combining the antlers, which were already used as funerary goods in large parts of China, with a protruding tongue, a symbol apparently more common in the south, to create an entirely new ritual funerary object. But how did that happen and ultimately what is the meaning of the TG? 7. Antler and Tongue: the Symbolic Meaning of the TG Most of the previous studies on the nature TG have not dedicated much space to the analysis the significance of the attributes of the TG (its apotropaic character, antlers, and tongue) (71), but have preferred instead to concentrate on the identification of the statue with gods, spirits, or monsters described in the classical Chinese texts. Although these have been important contributions for the understanding of the function of the TG, they have not succeeded in shedding more light on the significance that this statue with its symbolic attributes had for the Chu. From the analysis of the evolution of the Chu TG, we have seen that its appearance is always changing, varying from undefined, beast-like, and vaguely human, and that its only constant attributes are the deer antlers, the protruding tongue, and the fearful monstrosity. To understand the TG it is therefore necessary to investigate the symbolic meaning of these attributes. The long tongue appears to be a typical southern symbol, since it is a common motif in the funerary art of Chu and other southern lands of China, but it is rarely present in the artifacts of northern China (72). One of the earliest examples of this (71) Except for that of Salmony (1954), which however is partly out of date since archaeological data was practically unavailable at the time Salmony wrote this pioneer work. (72) According to K.C. Chang, tongues were relatively uncommon in north China before the Han dynasty, and the few examples in Shang and Zhou art seem to be of a different nature. See Chang 1972: 5-52, and Mackenzie 1987: 89. One of the few examples of tongue motif from the Central Plain is found on a late Shang bronze axe now housed at the British Museum. See Rawson 1980: 47, pi. 33. Salmony (1954) traced the origin of the tongue motif in southern China to India, my opinion is instead that this symbol originated in southern China itself. 388 [36]</page><page sequence="37">Fig. 28 - Protruding tongue motif from a zun bronze vessel datable to the Shang period excavated at Zhuzhaiju, Funan county, Anhui (after Anhui 1987: pi. 1).

Fig. 30 - Terracotta lamp in the shape of a servant with hanging tongue from Daiyuangang 3021, Guangzhou, Guangdong (after Guangzhou 1981: vol. 1, pi. 83.1). design is the decoration on a bronze zun (ai) vessel datable to the Shang period excavated at Zhuzhaiju, Funan county, Anhui province, which depicts a squatting creature from whose mouth hangs an intricate tongue (Fig. 28; Anhui 1987: pi. 1; WW, 1, 1959; also Hayashi 1972: 171-72, fig. 15.a). Beside the TG, the tongue symbol was used also on other Chu funerary objects, such as the stone mask recovered from a Changsha grave (Jiang 1949: pi. 31.a) (Fig. 29), which may have had a function similar to that of the TG, and the already mentioned statues of phoenixes standing on a tiger with hanging tongue (Fig. 27). The protruding tongue is present among the Han period grave paraphernalia as well. Important examples are the terracotta lamps in the shape of sitting servants, which have been excavated from a number of Eastern and Western Han graves in Guangzhou (73). Fig. 30 shows the one from the Western Han tomb of Daiyuangang no. 3021 in the suburbs of Guangzhou {Guangzhou 1983: vol. 1, pi. 83.1). From the Eastern Han tomb no. 5080 in Guangzhou, was instead recovered a terracotta statuette of a kneeling man with a long and broad tongue (Fig. 31), which the Chinese archaeologists have defined as lzhengmu yongy (*) (tomb guarding figurine) {ibid.: pi. 159.1). Monstrous creatures with long tongues are also painted on the sarcophagus of the Han tomb no. 1, at Mawangdui (Fig. 32; Sun 1973: 247, fig. 1.4, 249, fig. 2.14).

Fig. 32 - One of the creatures with long tongues painted on the coffin of the Marquess of Dai, Mawangdui 1, Changsha (after Sun 1973: 247, fig. 1.4). The tongue has been interpreted as either a symbol of thirst or as a symbol of death (Badner 1966: 14). The two are not necessarily in contrast. Regarding the first possibility it is interesting to point out that the Shang oracle bone graph representing a person with a hanging tongue bending over a vessel (**), has been identified with the modern form yin (am) 'to drink' (Gao 1980: 184). The meaning of thirst may perhaps be interpreted in a broader sense as a thirst for life-giving water, and therefore ultimately for life and rebirth (74). This possibility seems meaningful for its relation with the meaning of death, which appears to be the main theme of the TG. In the Gorgoneion the hanging tongue is seen as the connection with the darkness of the underworld, with 'otherness', and it is interpreted at times as a sexual symbol (Vernant 1985: 36-37). In Asia the tonsue is a svmbol nresent in the cult of the ancestors (75). (74) Cooper (1982: 174) says that the protruding tongue in animal representation can be read at times as a supplication for rain from the sky which is indespensable for the continuation of life and fertility. (75) Salmony (1954: 42, fig. 42) gives the example of the hampatong, poles at whose top are placed wooden carvings of human heads with long hanging tongues, that the Dayaks of Borneo used to erect to the memory of their dead. In addition, in Russian Central Asia (Barlyk steppe, Tuva) there are tomb slabs of the ancient Turks (Tujue) portraying soldiers with a hanging tongue (Basilov 1989: 54-56). It appears that on similar anthropomorphic stones dating to the mid-1st millennium B.C. and associated with the nomadic cemeteries of Tuva and Northern Mongolia there are also depicted images of deer gacobson 1988: 208-9, fig. 5; Volkov 1981: figs. 200-201). 390 [38]</page><page sequence="39">The use of the hanging tongue as a symbol of death may have been caused in Chu as well as in other cultures by the realization that at death creatures tend to open their mouth and let the tongue slip out (76). If the tongue is a symbol of death, the deer antlers placed on the TG are an opposite and complementary symbol: one of long life, and potency. The deer has always been considered by the Chinese an almost divine animal, symbol of ascent to the heavens, longevity, and ultimately immortality. Its figure occurs since the most ancient times in art, literature, and inscriptions (77). Legends report two deer figures very close to the concept of long life: the Longevity Deer (Changshou Lu) (an) (78), and the White Deer (Bailu) (ao). About the latter, the Taiping Youlan quotes a lost chapter of the Paopuzi, the 'Yuce Bian' as saying: 'The deer lives a thousands years. After five hundred years it turns white W (Taiping Youlan 1946: 4150, vol. 7, juan 986. About the Bailu, see also Yuan 1985: 132). According to other legends the God of Longevity, Laoshou (aq), rides a deer, and the deer is the only animal able to find the plant of immortality, or Lingzhicao (*T) (Williams 1976: 116, 209, 328). In addition it is to be noted that the antlers themselves were (and still are) considered by the Chinese to be powerful regenerative, and were used to manufacture medicines known as either lujiao (as) or lu'er (at) for the cure of impotence and infertility (ibid.: 209). These concepts of longevity, immortality, and fertility are as a matter of fact well embodied in the Han period 'woman-TG' from Huaiyang discussed above (Fig. 19), whose prominent breasts and inflated abdomen probably represent pregnancy, and therefore by sympathy, fertility and rebirth. The deer is also often associated with birds and with the concepts of flight, wind, and speed. Figures of flying deer are very common, one example is the white pair 'floating amid clouds' depicted on the coffin of tomb 1 at Mawangdui (Fig. 33). A further connection between deer and birds are the phoenix statues (79) bearing deer antlers on their backs, and standing on a tongued tiger (Fig. 34) which have been (76) Emmons (1925: 33-48) has suggested in his study of North American totem poles that the tongue is symbolic of death because the dead sticks out its tongue, an opinion rejected by Badner (1966: 26). (77) The section 'Xiaoya' of Shijing contains the poem Turning' inspired by the deer figure; see Yu Yufei 1972: 400-403. Deer glyph are found on Shang bronzes and oracle bones; see Hayashi 1986: 40, fig. 27. (78) According to Zhang Du (Tang 1939: 67-68, juan 8) during the Kaiyuan period of the Tang dynasty emperor Xuanzong and his courtiers killed a deer. A piece of the animal was offered to Zhang Guo Lao, a legendary figure, who said that very deer was the one whose life was spared by emperor Wu of the Han eight hundred year before, and therefore must be over a thousand year old. (79) The phoenix, together will the crane, is in China the main symbol of longevity. On the symbolism of the crane and the phoenix see Thote 1988.

A fantastic creature, the Feilian (au), also known as Fengbo (av) the Spirit of the Wind (81), said to have a deer body, a sparrow head, antlers, a snake tail, and the mantle of the leopard (82), has been identified in this (80) Mackenzie 1987: 90-93; Guo 1980: 97. A bronze statue of a crane with antler on the head rather than on the body was brought to light from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at Leigudun, Sui county, Hubei. Zeng was basically a vassal state of Chu, subject to strong Chu cultural influence, that was later absorbed by Chu (Zeng Hou Yi Mu 1989: vol. 1, 250-51, fig. 147). (81) The chapter 'Shitian' of Guangya reports: Tengbo is called Feilian (aw)' (Guangya Shuzheng 1935: 1081). (82) In the commentary to the Chuci Lisao Wang Yi says: 'Feilian is Fengbo. [...] Ying Shao said: "Feilian is a bird spirit able to raise the wind". Jin Xue said: 'The Feilian has the body of the deer, the head of the sparrow, horns, the tail of the snake, and the mantle of the leopard" (ax)' (Chuci Buzhu 1963: 22a, vol. 1, juan 1). 392 [40]</page><page sequence="41">Fig. 34 - Wooden statue of antlered phoenix standing on a tiger from Yutaishan 166 (after Jiangltng 1984: fig. 90). statue (Guo 1980: 97; Zhang et al. 1984: 96-100). These antlered birds may be some sort of substitute for the TG since in the majority of the tombs from which they were retrieved there was no TG (83). Also worth noting is the fact that as the TGs, the bird statues exist only in Warring States upper class tombs; there is only one of them in each grave; and they occupy a prominent position in the grave (tables in Jiangling 1984: 157-90). In addition to the TGs, and the antlered birds, in Chu graves are found also naturalistic wooden figures of deer (Fig. 35), and bird-tiger drum stands (huzuo niaojia gu) (ay) (Fig. 36), which however do not appear to substitute the TG (84). Other two legendary creatures having an auspicious meaning and at times considered to be grave protectors are the Heavenly Deer or Tianlu (az) and the Bixie (ba) (85). (83) Five out of six at YTS (Jiangling 1984: 157-90). (84) Altogether four deer statues and fourteen drums have been recovered in YTS. The deer come from tomb: 331, 50, 394, and 89; and the drums from tomb: 403, 140, 196, 202, 206, 212, 219, 336, 354, 397, 476, 558, 186, 388. Except for tomb 196 which lacks the TG, all the remaining are guanjguo graves with TG, see Jiangling 1984: 157-90. Other deer statues have come from Changsha Liuchengjiao 1 (KGXB, 1, 1972: 69, fig. 10.1); Jiangling Shendian 1 (W, 9, 1973: 12, fig. 4.1), and Bomashan 16 (KG, 3, 1973: 157). (85) The bixie is thought to be a simple wood carving with a human head. See Zhang 1982: 78-81, and Chu 1935. A wooden object carved out of a tree root and shaped as a deer antler excavated out of tomb 1 at Jiangling Mashan has been described by the Chinese archaeologists as a bixie, see Jiangling 1985: 82-83, fig. 68.

The chapter 'Xiyu zhuan' of the Hanshu reports: Tn Wuge Shan [...] there is Taoba', Meng Kan (A.D. 220-65) in the annotation explains: 'Taoba, or Fuba, it resembles a deer and it has a long tail. With one horn it can be the Tianlu, with two horns it can be the Bixie (hhY (86). The Ming encyclopaedia Mingyi Kao compiled by Zhou Qi says: '[...] They are animals. [...] The Tianlu (87) is so called because it brings luck and heavenly blessing; the Bixie is so called because it rids a place of evil influences. In Han times the Tianlu was placed at the doorways, and the Bixie on the entrance steps. At the ancestral temple of Nanyang at the sides of the tablet there are two stone animals, one called Tianlu and the other Bixie (be)' (Zhou 1971: 330-31, juan 10; see also Yuan 1985: 68, and Fong 1991: 186). Thus beside the auspicious meanings of long life and immortality, the deer antlers clearly served also as a sort of defensive device, something that may be related to their natural function. In the miscellaneous notes Sanyu Zhuibi of the Ming scholar Dou Ang (1939: 4) is reported the following: Nowadays the buildings of government officials are surrounded by wooden structures called 'deer antlers'. This is because deer are excitable by nature, and when in a group they make up a circle to form a defensive line with their antlers in order to protect themselves from the attacks of people and animals. Military camps are similarly protected with wooden branches [shaped as deer antlers] facing the outside. These are also called deer antlers (bf). (86) Hanshu 'Xiyuzhuan' chapter in Wang 1983: vol. 2, 1618. (87) The meaning of heavenly blessing of the Tianlu, and in general the auspicious qualities of the deer figure, may also be linked to the pun played between the words /?-deer (bc) and /^-emolument (M), which have the exact same pronunciation. 394 [42]</page><page sequence="43">0 1~5F Fig. 36 - Drum stand from Yutaishan 354 (after Jiangling 1984: fig. 82). [43] 395</page><page sequence="44">The concept of deer antlers as defensive weapons must have been particularly evident to the Chu, who appear to have been very familiar with this animal. If our analysis of the symbols of antler and tongue is correct, we can then interpret the TG as an object created to protect the deceased, that represents death and that at the same time embodies a strong wish for a renewal of life. More specifically we can suggest that, on the one hand the TG was meant to protect the corpse of the deceased from the attacks of the demons of the underworld, and to help the soul po (bs) in its wait for the renewal of life beyond death; and on the other it was probably seen by the Chu as the terrible face of death meant to bring about the inevitable separation between the world of the dead and that of the living, thus performing a sort of protection for the living as well. In this the TG is very close and probably a forerunner of the pair Tianlu ? Bixie which we have discussed above. Since the statue has no fixed canonical structure, and no description in mythological and historical sources or ritual texts matches the appearance of the TG, I have also come to the conclusion that this object is neither the representation of a specific 'god' or 'spirit', nor a specific paraphernalia pertaining to the codified ritual of Zhou times, but rather a representative conglomeration of ritual and popular funerary practices (88) that were beginning to take a new form in the late Zhou period, and that would appear with full strength in the Han and later periods. It is known that the 6th and 5th century B.C. was a period when great cultural changes, and technological advancements were taking place not only in Chu but all over China. The appearance of the TG during the Warring States (5th-3th century B.C.) period can therefore be interpreted as a change in Chu society, and more specifically in its religious and ritual sphere. During this period several states forming the Zhou confederation were enjoying an evident freedom from the central power. Due to its geographical location far from the Central Plain, and to its ethnically diverse population Chu was particularly independent. The weakening the Zhou imperial power in the peripheral areas and the consequent new freedom in ritual matters must have caused in Chu an insurgence of local beliefs which were common in the southern lands, but were previously kept under control by the strict Zhou ritual. The TG, can be said to be a funerary artifact in which northern and southern traditions have mingled. As such the TG is an object truly representative of the complex cultural intermingling of Chu as well as late pre-imperial China. (88) With 'ritual' and 'popular' I intend to distinguish between codified Zhou ritual, and regional practices. It is my belief that the two might at time be quite distinct. 396 [44]</page><page sequence="45">HNKGJK: Hunan Kaogu Jikan HNWW: Hunan Wenwu JHLT: Jianghan Luntan JHKG: Jianghan Kaogu KG: Kaogu KGWW: Kaogu yu Wenwu KGXB: Kaogu Xuebao WW: Wenwu WWZLCK: Wenwu Ziliao Congkan ZYWW: Zhongyuan Wenwu ABBREVIATIONS BIBLIOGRAPHY Anhui Sheng Bowuguan Zang Qingtongqi (1987) Renmin, Shanghai.
