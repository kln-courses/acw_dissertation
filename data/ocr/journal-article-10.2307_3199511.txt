<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tropismes and the Satire of Scientism in Les Caves du Vatican HARLAN R. PATTON T HE FINAL DECADE of the nineteenth century was an im- mensely self-confident time in the sciences, the end of the century in which advances in physical sciences had founded a technology on which modern societies are based.1 Nearly every branch of modern science had seen significant developments in theory and technique in the century, and many discoveries were found to have applications to specific human problems. It was a time deterministic in the extreme, when traditional European theology and anthropocentric classifications were falling to general accep- tance of evolutionary theories and when human volition seemed fated for eventual reduction to physical and chemical principles. Although published some twenty years later, Gide situates his Caves du Vatican in this decade given over to scientism and mecha- nism, a hostile environment in which to place any question of human will, and chooses satire as the vehicle of his investigation of the 1890s. The narrator evokes the scientific atmosphere of the time early in the sotie, when a first reference is made to tropismes, a term generally credited to Jacques Loeb, a French-speaking German scientist who later emigrated to the United States, and who is roughly contemporary2 to the fictional Anthime Armand-Dubois. While later a generally recognized term, it was Loeb's experiments in botany and biology3 which gave acceptance to the word and phenomenon of tropism. Loeb proved that forced movements4 in symmetrical animals, where bilateral tension was the same, were completely predictable. Light striking one eye will cause the animal</page><page sequence="2">Harlan R. Patton to turn toward that side, and to continue in a straight line toward the light source: heliotropism (phototropism) thus exists in animals as it does in plants.5 Extending the principle of predictability thus established, Loeb once wrote that he could conceive of a day when his ideas "may be elaborated into a mathematical theory of human conduct."6 By 1918, when Forced Movements first appeared as a retrospective, Loeb had concluded his experiments along this line, and had gone on to influential work in colloid chemistry. As a man of science in an age enamored of science, Loeb, his work, and his methods were known outside the scientific community, and were familiar to the general reading public of the time.7 Jacques Loeb and his neologism serve to encapsulate the scientism, materialism, and positivism of the real 1890s, as Anthime Armand-Dubois represents them in the mimetic 1890s of Gide's tale. Tropismes are introduced very early in the sotie, and set in type and position to seize the attention of the reader: in a single short paragraph (p. 683),8 the word appears four times, first framed in guillemets, then exclaimed alone, italicized at the end of a sentence, and exclaimed alone once again. The term has unusual impact by its repetition, and as a neologism it is incongruous to Gide's lexicon, in which an archaism such as sotie passes virtually unno- ticed. Tropisme is a password of the age, requisite to the materialis- tic scientist of the 1890s, and serves to locate the narrative chronologically. In this sotie, it also becomes a recurring image, a thematic icon in the text. Having drawn attention to the word and posted it as a beacon near the text's beginning, the narrator makes both overt and oblique references to it throughout the text, relating it to seemingly disparate themes. Like Loeb in his confident opinion that human conduct may become mathematically predict- able, or in the metaphysical universalization he constructed in his Mechanistic Conception of Life,9 the narrator will draw from the simple conclusions of mechanistic predictability implied in An- thime's experiments a universal mechanism, well-suited to this book fascinated with formalism. A contrived experiment recalling aspects of materialistic experimentation, the Sotie's intricacies re- semble one of Anthime's controllable Vexierkasten (p. 684). Tro- pismes, a visual signal in the text, invite analysis of Les Caves du Vatican in light of experimental techniques and conclusions of the time. Anthime Armand-Dubois is the first subject studied in the maze of Les Caves du Vatican. He resembles experimental animals in 36</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review physical detail, including the unexplained lesion below his left ear (pp. 685-6). His "circus movements,"10 his inability to maintain straight linear movement due to an injured side, are typical of the movements noted by Loeb in disabling experiments on bilaterally symmetrical animals such as sharks, dogs, and fish." More remi- niscent of experiments of the time is the means of Anthime's sudden conversion by the apparition of the Virgin. In a sort of celestial acupuncture, she pierces him with the metal rod: " ... quand la tige de metal entra tout a coup dans son flanc, une atroce douleur le per,a, et il s'eveilla dans le noir" (p. 702), a new convert to the Church. Loeb had experimented with artificial parthenogen- esis, 12 and summarized in his Mechanistic Conception of Life an experiment now known to schoolchildren, fertilization of a frog's egg by the insertion of a needle.13 Anthime is transformed, "re- born," after this physical and divine intervention, and the well- known experiment seems directly parodied. After this skewering, Anthime becomes literally "plus catholique que le pape" in the framework of the sotie, offending even firm believers with his complete faith: this parallels temporary extreme results in tropisme research. In a laboratory experiment where the animal was tempo- rarily blinded in one eye, then returned to normal, Loeb found overcompensation toward the side previously blinded.14 Anthime seems the perfect lab animal, mathematically determined to re- spond tropistically in a fashion similar to lesser animals, without intervention of will, intellect, or traditional motivation. The climactic scene of Les Caves du Vatican, the raison d'etre for this rather bizarre book, is the scene leading up to the "unmoti- vated" murder of Amedee Fleurissoire by Lafcadio. Similarities to scientific procedures and experimental methods of the 1890s are evident here, particularly parallels with Loeb's tropisme experi- ments. The physical setting could be that of a laboratory: two subjects in a glass-sided compartment are carefully observed and monitored. Amedee, like a laboratory animal, enters this compart- ment under duress (p. 824). Within these experimental conditions, elements of tropistic response and forced movement become ap- parent. Lafcadio begins with complete detachment and careful observation of Amedee, whose territorial infringement he seems to resent, characterizing him several times as an animal (pp. 825, 829). An odd memory of a gratuitous and dream-like episode from Lafcadio's youth interrupts and seems to humanize the scene, but Loeb notes that "memory images may have a direct orienting 37</page><page sequence="4">Harlan R. Patton influence," and terms them "a second tropism."15 As in the photo- tropism experiments, light conditions are suddenly changed, artifi- cial and controlled levels are substituted for natural ones: "Le soleil cependant s'etait couche. . .. Tout a coup, au plafond voute du wagon, l'electricite jaillit dans le lustre; eclairage trop brutal, aupres de ce crepuscule attendri; et, par crainte qu'il ne troublat le sommeil de son voisin, Fleurissoire tourna le commutateur... Au gre de Fleurissoire cette ampoule bleue versait trop de lumiere encore. ... " (p. 828). Loeb too experimented with rapid changes in intensity of light.16 Amede proves negatively heliotropic, at- tempting to escape the light: various levels are attempted, but none is satisfactory. Unsuited to these conditions, the best Amede can hope to do is demonstrate his preference by choosing the least uncomfortable level. Lafcadio, on the other hand, is positively heliotropic: it is he who turns the light back up (p. 828). Lafcadio feels a genuinely experimental curiosity. Although he prefers to think that "ce n'est pas tant des evenements que j'ai curiosite, que de moi-meme" (p. 829), an egotistical and narcissistic justification, the event alone and its outcome can satisfy his curiosity. Lafcadio's rules for the game17 again involve mathematics, duration, and light: if he can count to twelve without seeing any light in the countryside, Amedee is saved (p. 829). Once the experiment is devised, Lafcadio's response is forced, automatic, and inescapable, comparable to the "twitching or jerking effects caused by a rapidly changing intensity of light" noted by Loeb.18 A light appears, Amede is pushed brusquely toward it, and the murder is done. The careful construction of experimental conditions, the con- stantly-changing artificial light, the careful monitoring of the sub- jects, the criteria established, all recall mechanists' experiments in phototropism. Contemporary experiments seem to serve as a blueprint for the key scene of the book, and in the creation of the first major character in Les Caves du Vatican. Other aspects in Gide's conclu- sions are equally reminiscent of experimental technique. The vari- ous subjects are deprogrammed to the extent possible. Anthime's conversion, like the overcompensation Loeb remarks, proves tem- porary. Julius de Baraglioul returns to his traditional psychological novels, reassured after his temporary trauma. Lafcadio has made no irreversible decision, and retains his original options. Amedee's death is attenuated: if one of the subjects has died by another's gratuitous violence in the maze, his regrettable loss is the price of the experiment. He will be replaced by another of the same race, 38</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review the other half of the Blafafoires (p. 760), and even his mate will scarcely notice. As Loeb extended simple biological conclusions into metaphysi- cal principles, so Gide extended Anthime's experiments to the narrative level in the sotie, using them as a plan in the construction of the book. Gide's irony in his narrative investigation of the 1890s thus extends to the exaggerated scientism of the time, ridiculed by aggrandizement as are other thematic devices. Particulars of Loeb's experiments and important scientific contributions of the time border on the absurd,19 and invite such ridicule. Rheotropism is essential to Loeb's general theory, but it is amusing to read his account of the head movements of a lizard turned to face the window inside a moving train, and later spun on a turntable.20 The absurdity and contrivance of the procedure to one with little knowledge of the theory obstructs the validity of his observations. The same is true of the application of asphalt blacking to the eye of a housefly, in order to watch it creep in spirals on a vertical dowel.21 Scientific procedure crosses into a cruel, voyeuristic, childish curiosity, and the absence of a razor-sharp boundary invites parody. But the ironic detachment and ridicule found within the narra- tive limits of the text escape their bounds as well, and the reader is encouraged to view the entire narrative with the same detached bemusement as in viewing its thematic elements, when Les Caves du Vatican is labelled a sotie. Gide thus describes his book only subsequent to its creation, in his dedication to Jacques Copeau (p. 679). A term long extinct in literature, ordinarily designating cer- tain farcical plays of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,22 Gide selects this genre to describe Les Caves du Vatican as well as two preceding ironic works: the traditional sotie sought to ridicule by aggrandizement and involve the Church in its parody, as does Gide's book. But questions arise immediately concerning the seri- ousness and good faith of the classification. The book is not a theatrical satire, and Gide chooses to designate subsequent stage adaptations as farces. Use of an outmoded description seems purely defensive: Gide implies in his dedication that the word is a protec- tive measure, useful in escaping the criteria common to romans (p. 679). He had feared in an early draft that his ironic tone might be taken seriously,23 and fierce critical reaction proved his fears well grounded.24 His book seems belittled by a label designed to sepa- rate it from other more serious types of literature. Unusually applied, an archaism describing a modern satire, Gide seems by 39</page><page sequence="6">Harlan R. Patton sotie to invite a detached, ironic view of this curious book which invites a detached, ironic view of the grand decade. This poses a question regarding satire as a literary genre: Gide dignifies satire by choosing it for his investigation of the 1890s, but belittles it by calling attention to its facetiousness. Gide's legendary ambiguity extends to satire, and also absorbs the acte gratuit in Les Caves du Vatican: gratuitousness is given little chance for survival in the mechanistic surroundings of the 1890s. Tropistic response seems diametrically opposed to the gratuitous act, but the two become intertwined at the climactic point of the sotie, and each may contain the other. Anthime, confident that tropismes will eventually explain human conduct, and working with small animals only "en attendant de s'attaquer a l'homme," (p. 683) is as incapable of conceiving the acte gratuit as is his brother-in-law Julius de Baraglioul: deterministic mechanism ex- cludes gratuitousness for Anthime, while traditional moral respon- sibility and psychological analysis rule it out for Julius. But tropismes nearly meet the criteria of the acte gratuit. In his mechanis- tic concepts and in experiments to establish tropisms, Loeb allows no place for traditional anthropomorphic motivation in laboratory animals: pleasure and pain cannot account for forced move- ments,25 and both reflex and tropism are "obviously of a purely physico-chemical character."26 Before leaving Europe in 1891, Loeb had conducted experiments27 to test further the ubiquity of helio- tropism, and his experiments proved that creatures who live in total darkness react to directional light. This condition is outside their normal environment. Results led Loeb to conclude that pho- totropism is not only forced, involuntary movement, but also non-adaptive, outside natural selection. While a forced movement and thus predictable, the tropism is as nearly-gratuitous as any Julius (or Gide) might imagine in a novel. The phenomenon nearly meets the criteria for an acte gratuit: it is not conditioned by any anthropomorphic motive, and is without consequence of any sort. Were it not for the predictability which defines the tropism, such a phenomenon would be truly gratuitous. The deterministic tropisme thus is the best example of an acte gratuit in Les Caves du Vatican. The ultimate implied unity between a universally predictable forced movement and a hypothetically unpredictable, uniquely human action is but one of numerous mergings in Gide's sotie. The dialogue between tropismes and the acte gratuit parallels the dia- logue between other seemingly disparate narrative elements and themes, positives and negatives added together which total zero, 40</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review relieving theoretical constraints from either extreme. A highly mechanistic decade is chosen for the literary demonstration of the gratuitous act, and both the decade and the act prove bankrupt, neither providing a satisfying resolution. Satire dignifies the sim- plistic scientism and outmoded contrivances it belittles, transform- ing them into adversaries of sufficient standing to merit opposition. The sotie transforms tropismes to an inquiry into human freedom, and satire itself into an heuristic principle. The sotie becomes a research tool, Les Caves du Vatican a lesson in the avoidance of extremes, and Gide's disclaimer in the dedication proves true: despite the decade and genre chosen, Les Caves du Vatican is not a retour en arriere, but a liberating device to dispose of the ghosts of the past.
