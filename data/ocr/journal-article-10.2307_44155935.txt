<plain_text><page sequence="1">HELLIODORUS PILLAR FROM BESNAGAR: ITS CAPITAL AND WORSHIP Meera I Dass Helliodorus pillar was first mentioned by Cunningham in 1876-77 who thought it was the most novel and curious discovery that he had ever made. It was however, the discovery of inscriptions on the pillar by Lake that turned out to be the most sensational and important. The inscription identified the pillar as a Garudadvaja, consecrated to Vasudeva by Heliodorus, the Greek envoy of Antialkidas from Taxila. The author of the inscription calls himself a bhagavata and mentions Kasiputra Bhagbhadra as the king. A second and smaller inscription talks of three steps towards immortality. The inscription placed the Pillar to second century BCE, a much earlier date than anticipated by Cunningham. Thus, the history of Vasudeva worship had to be revised to an earlier date and contemporary to Buddhism. On the behest of John Marshall, the then Director General of the ASI, D R. Bh√°ndarkar.took up further excavations on this site in 1913. During his extensive</page><page sequence="2">Summaries: Epigraphy &amp; c. 11 37 excavations in this area he discovered a Mauryan period canal and railings but failed to find, (a) the temple of Vasudeva, (b) the capital of Garudadvaja , (c) and, the main deity of the temple. It was however M.D. Khare who could excavate the double apsidal plinth of the Vasudeva temple from under Babaji's house located to the west of the pillar in 1963. He also discovered pits of seven more pillars alongside the Heliodorus Pillar. Out of seven pillars located in a row and aligned north-south, Heliodorus Pillar formed the northern most pillar. The eighth pillar stood a little away to the east of the central column. Shafts of none of the other pillars could be found, although a fragment with inscription found by Lake from the streets of present day Vidisha proclaims to be a Garudadvaja installed in Vasudeva prasadauttama by Gotamaiputra Bhagavata. This shaft is octagonal and may have come from the Heliodorus Pillar site, as there could not have been one more famous temple ( prasadauttama ) of Vasudeva in the region than the one in quesiton. There is a possibility that there were two Garuda dvajas as there were also two taladvajas in front of the temple. It appears therefore, that all these pillars stood in front of the most famous temple of Vasudeva that attracted attention and admiration of Heliodorus from as far away as Taxila. The aim of the present paper is however, to address the issue of the capital of Heliodorus Pillar and to identify it with the capital in Gurjari Mahal museum at Gwalior and to dwell upon the ritualistic importance of the Heliodorus Pillar. The Garuda capital of Heliodorus Pillar is currently at Gwalior Museum and consists of feet of birds shown holding a naga. The tail end of the naga can be seen on one side of the vedika below. The capital was probably found by Cunningham who did not know that Heliodorus Pillar was a Garudadvaja and hence could not make the connection and therefore, did not mention the capital. The later explorers (Lake, Bhandarkar and Khare) knew of the Garudadvaja but do not mention the capital in their reports. The Capital however, reached Gwalior Museum along with the rest of the objects from site museum Besnagar, where the objects found and excavated by Cunningham, Lake and Bhandarkar were earlier kept. All three of them were exploring near Heliodorus Pillar whereas Lake and Bhandarkar also excavated on this site. For the first time this paper brings out the nexus between the Heliodorus Pillar and the Garuda Capital and establishes that the two were part of the same Garudadvaja of Vasudeva at Besnagar. The top part of the capital is missing and it is my contention that if one were to search for the main body of the Garuda then one should search for a bird in the from and not in its anthropomorphic form.</page></plain_text>
