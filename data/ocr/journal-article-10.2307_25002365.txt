<plain_text><page sequence="1">FEMINIST THEOLOGY AND THE POLITICS OF FAILURE Elizabeth A. Pritchard You must have seen them. How could you miss them? If you happened not to catch them on television, they forced you to meet their gaze from ubiquitous posters and magazine covers. They were everywhere. Although not visible now, they are easily summoned as an early installment of American culture's ob session with female characters who appear to be independent and strong but whose power is actually circumscribed by the emotional and authoritarian pull exerted by an absent male. They were "Charlie's angels," of the epony mous 1970s television program. A potent combination of beauty, strength, in telligence, and friendship, the angels deferred to no one except Charlie, their invisible, and therefore unknowable, "boss." It was Charlie's disembodied voice that plotted and rationalized the various contortions of their bodies and brows, their emphatic embodiedness suggesting a decadent fallenness in comparison with that unflappable, almost hypnotic voice. And if ever the viewer wondered whether Charlie was real or was perhaps only a machine or a recording of a voice that sounded "male," the camera would switch to "his" supposed angle of vision, gazing ever so possessively upon an adoring young woman. Charlie was the perfect blank slate with whom the male viewer could identify: "Those angels would obey me, too, if they could be prevented from seeing me as a I really am: a weak, miserable, unattractive, and ill-kept man." Perhaps, too, the show ful filled the fantasies of its women viewers: "I would be willing to work on behalf of an invisible, unknowable authority figure whose bodiliness neither posed a physical threat nor substantiated the unpleasant fact that I must workfor some one else." Charlie was the inscrutable and incomprehensible divine. Charlie re mained stubbornly veiled, and the privilege of his hiddenness was continually reinforced by the not-so-inside joke of the show, namely, the unveiling of the "femaleness" of the angels. The angels were always on display; their boss, how ever, would not submit to our curious and possessive gaze. Consequently, tran scendent Charlie had universal appeal. Charlie resisted being confined to the parochial pleasures of any one demographic audience. Hence, Charlie was</page><page sequence="2">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 51 indeed is-a suitable divinity for us all. What better divinity for pluralistic Amer ica than one that refuses to step into any of its particular versions?' It would seem, however, that a theology that has made it to prime time is not a likely candidate for a contemporary pluralistic and emancipatory politics. Indeed, I recall this bit of television fluff for the purposes of telling a cautionary tale. I wish to caution feminist theologians that a divinity that is proclaimed to defeat all attempts at representation may actually compromise the formation and practice of an emancipatory theology and politics. My fear is not that this argument reinscribes a problematic devaluation of bodiliness and finitude (an important but by now familiar argument); I am also not interested in explor ing the ironies and contradictions of an indescribable and thus unknowable divinity-ironies that are neatly encapsulated in Feuerbach's tease: "A God who is injured by determinate qualities has not the courage and the strength to exist."2 Rather, I argue that a divine that qualifies as divine by virtue of its ability to defeat all attempts at conceptual capture is mystificatory and, ironically, is historically coded as masculine. In order to make my case, in this article I first sketch the antecedent of the notion that the divine, qua divine, defeats all attempts at conceptual capture. This antecedent is the tradition of "negative theology"--a tradition which insists that the divine is ineffable and which often consists of repeated demonstrations that each and every attempt to describe the divine is met with failure. I then dis cuss several feminist theologians' appropriation of the critical and liberative power they claim is contained in the notion that the divine reality is ineffable. I go on to argue that this critical and liberative power is undercut by the mas culinist and elitist bias that is reflected in such a notion. I suggest that what might be retrieved from negative theology is the potentially critical and libera tive lesson of discursive instability minus the ontological baggage of a particular referent being exalted by virtue of its inscrutability. As I demonstrate, a similar strategy is evident in feminist and postmodern theorists' explications of "radical democracy," which argue that the secret to the ongoing production and expan sion of a viable democratic polity inheres in the consistent reminder that signs 11 was quite young when Charlie's Angels was aired. At about the same time, there was a com mercial campaign for a perfume named "Charlie!" It featured what appeared to be a liberated woman strolling about in public while the voice of a man sang the theme song: "Kind of young, kind of now, Charlie!" You can imagine my puzzlement over highly visible women whose comings and goings appeared to be authorized by an unseen "Charlie." Coincidentally, the model who ap peared in this ad campaign became one of "Charlie's angels." 2 Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, trans. George Eliot, 2d ed. (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus, 1989), 15. Feuerbach also writes, "But this God, free from anthropomorphisms, impar tial, passionless, is nothing else than the nature of the understanding itself regarded as objective.... Of God as God no image can be made; but canst thou frame an image of mind?" (35). He argues that for the religious person God does have qualities and is describable; hence, he concludes that a the ology that insists on God's ineffability is a thinly veiled atheism.</page><page sequence="3">52 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion fail to capture referents. I argue instead that an exclusive focus on discursive failure obscures the material aspects of a truly transformative theology and poli tics. And here I reintroduce feminist theology as an enterprise making a contri bution toward a materialist radical democratic praxis. I suspect that some readers will read this piece either as a dismissal of nega tive theology or as its reworking.3 Moreover, for some readers, my desire to dis tribute (some might say "secularize") the privilege of resisting representation, and thus to dispel what they think makes the divine referent unique, entails the abandonment of theology. I might counter with a query as to what it is that is supposed to constitute "theology." For my part, I remain uncomfortable with the category "theology" and thus have no investment in presenting a new and improved version of negative theology. I offer this cautionary tale as a feminist scholar of religion who is grateful to feminist theologians for being unwilling to surrender to the forces of destruction. The Antecedent: Negative Theology The insistence that the divine is what it is precisely because it resists rep resentation is generally associated with the traditions of "negative theology," also called "the via negativa" or "apophatic theology."4 The genealogy of nega tive theology is subject to dispute. A number of commentators spy it at work in ancient Greek, especially Platonic, thought; others credit the commandment of the Decalogue forbidding worship of graven images; some writers insist that it originates in the writings of Philo (ca. 20 B.C.E.-50 C.E.); and still others insist that it properly begins with the first person who explicitly joined the words nega tive and theology, the Christian Pseudo-Dionysius (fifth or sixth century c.E.).5 3 This fixation on the divine referent is what prompts both Jacques Derrida and Theodor W. Adorno, both of whom have been accused of doing a negative theology, to offer a critique of negative theology. Although Derrida acknowledges a resemblance between his work and negative theology in "Differance" (1968), in his Margins of Philosophy, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), 6, he refuses the label and offers a critique of negative theology in "How to Avoid Speaking: Denials," trans. Ken Frieden, in Languages of the Unsayable: The Play of Negativity in Literature and Literary Theory, ed. Sanford Budick and Wolfgang Iser (New York: Columbia Uni versity Press, 1989); and in On the Name, ed. Thomas Dutoit (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995). For Adorno, see, for instance, "On Kierkegaard's Doctrine of Love," Studies in Philosophy and Social Science (formerly Zeitschrift fir Sozialforschung) 8 (1939): 414; "Sacred Fragment: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron," in Quasi Una Fantasia: Essays on Modern Music, trans. Rodney Livingstone (London: Verso, 1992), 230, 236, 243; and Negative Dialectics, trans. E. B. Ashton (New York: Continuum, 1994), 392-93. Despite these critiques, scholars persist in referring to Derrida's and Adorno's projects as instances of negative theology. 4 Apophasis means "unsaying" or "speaking away"; it suggests exclusion rather than opposition, as in "not so." 5 The scholars responsible for the various origins of negative theology are as follows. For the commandment forbidding graven images, or Bilderverbot, see Josef Hochstaffl, Negative Theologie</page><page sequence="4">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 53 Moreover, there are those who see instances of negative theology throughout the history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, suggesting its ready association with transcendental monotheism. The fundamental premise of negative theology is that the divine repels rep resentation and is therefore unknowable. No predicates can be made to stick to the divine lest we be guilty of anthropomorphism or idolatry. This premise is usually illustrated through the repetitive stagings of the denial or failure of representation. For instance, Pseudo-Dionysius declares, "It is not soul or mind, nor does it possess imagination, conviction, speech, or understanding. Nor is it speech per se, understanding per se. It cannot be spoken of and it cannot be grasped by understanding."6 The divine referent calls for description, but each and every description fails to capture the divine. This is what prompts Jacques Derrida to observe that negative theology is "a rhetoric of failure-or ... a rhetoric that renounces knowledge, conceptual determination, and analysis."7 Derrida is partly correct. Negative theology is a rhetoric of failure. But the fail ure in this instance is considered productive. It does not lead to the dismissal of either the relevance or the intelligibility of the divine referent; instead, it is pre cisely what "produces" this referent. The very fact that the divine defies descrip tion is what cathects the reader's investment in this transcendent referent. In order to gamer investment in a divinity that is a chronic "no-show," nega tive theology employs peculiar rhetorical devices. The most significant is the re (Munich: K6sel-Verlag, 1976), 16-23.

He locates a definitive shift in Neoplatonic thought toward what he defines as negative theology in Proclus (although he also refers to Plotinus's negative theology) and, in Christian thought, in Pseudo-Dionysius. This later dating is the result of Mortley's conviction that for any discourse to qualify as negative theology, evidence of a method of negation is necessary in ad dition to the assertion that the ultimate lies beyond discourse; see From Word to Silence, 2:18. 6 Pseudo-Dionysius, "The Mystical Theology," in Psuedo-Dionysius: The Complete Works, trans.

In the rhetoric of negative theology, signification is consistently depicted as confining or as entailing closure. According to Andrew Shanks, "[T]he Via Nega tiva negates any attempt to confine God within one particular, privileged area of creaturely experience."8 Michael Sells, an advocate of what he prefers to call "apophatic theology," writes, "When the semantic gaze is fixed, it is confronted with linguistic idols, the temporal and spatial reifications of a supreme being."9 The circumscription wrought by concepts reflects fixity and stasis-aspects most unbecoming to the infinite. The point these authors try to convey is that God "far surpasses any human attempt at containment."'0 Furthermore, the negation of each and every description is depicted as opening up language so that it may better reflect the unlimitedness of divine reality. Proclus, the fifth-century philosopher of negation, asserts: "Affirma tions pare beings down, but negations open them up, taking them from the circumscribed to the uncircumscribed ... How then can they not be appro priate to the contemplation of the One?"" Raoul Mortley, an expert on the de velopment of negative theology, describes the attraction of the via negativa thus: "For the positive concept encloses, but the negative expands the field of understanding .... The via negativa opens, rather than closes, options."l2 Sells asserts that negative or apophatic theology opens up language: "Language becomes indefinite and open-ended. No closure is reached."'3 John Caputo, who admits that he does not "trust any discourse that is not contaminated by negative theology," writes, "Closure spells trouble.... Closure spells exclu sion.... [C]losure spills blood." Consequently, he urges that we see to it that re ligious traditions and institutions "do not effect closure[; we must] keep them open so that something new or different may happen." To this end, he recom mends that religious traditions insist upon "ignorance" of God; moreover, the effect of this ignorance is "to keep the future open, to have a future."'4 In all these instances, discursive failure vis-a-vis the divine is portrayed as produc tive-productive of the divine per se as well as of an expanded understanding of options, of language, even of a future. Clearly, negative theology is a case of "failure made productive." 8 Andrew Shanks, Civil Society, Civil Religion (Oxford: Blackwell, 1995), 183. 9 Michael A.

As a result, all at tempts to close the loop between logos and theos are destined to fail. Conse quently, this theology of "failure" remains open-ended. Negative theology's logic of "failure made productive" appears to promote iconoclastic and critical thinking. Because negative theology prohibits defini tive descriptions of the divine, it denaturalizes theological representations and prompts critical reflection on the most cherished of theological symbols. It should come as no surprise, then, that negative theology should be reprised in contemporary theologies that seek to destabilize authoritarian regimes that they claim rely upon preponderant and exclusivist renderings of the divine. A num ber of feminist theologians, for instance, insist that an indescribable divinity is part and parcel of their liberationist aims. Negative Theology and Feminist Theology Like negative theologians, feminist theologians object to the presump tion that our descriptions of the divine are conterminous with divinity. For femi nist theologians, the most insidious instance of this concerns the gender of the divinity. A number of feminist theologians, including Mary Daly and Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, have offered compelling arguments as to the analogy be tween a male God and male dominance in society and history.'5 Their argument is that a male divinity justifies women's exclusion from sites of power and sa crality as well as their subordination to elite men. The fundamental premise of negative theology is invoked by these feminists to rebuke the authorizing func tion of a male God. Mary Daly redeploys the tradition of the via negativa as a resource for women in the midst of patriarchal oppression. Women live out the negative way by discovering the androcentrism of God-language and rejecting this language. This negation is correlated with a choice to exclude oneself from patriarchal societies that reflect such androcentrism. Daly writes, "The realization of our exclusion from the world-building process is a neo-negative way, in that we are discovering our previously unknown being, which points our consciousness out ward and inward toward as yet unknown Being, that some would call the hidden God."16 Judith Plaskow argues that the traditional male and hierarchical images for the divine "generate a need for new language that can better express the 15 "If God in 'his' heaven is a father ruling 'his' people, then it is in the 'nature' of things and ac cording to divine plan and the order of the universe that society be male-dominated." Mary Daly, Beyond God the Father (Boston: Beacon, 1973), 13. See also Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, Jesus: Miriam's Child, Sophia's Prophet (New York: Continuum, 1994), 178. Of course, one must also note that male domination persists in societies in which "female" gods are common (e.g., India). 16 Daly, Beyond God the Father, 38.</page><page sequence="7">56 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion meaning of God for a pluralistic and responsible community." The criticism of these traditional images is, she adds, a "criticism of ways of speaking about a reality that, in its full reality, is finally unknowable."'7 Because divine reality is unknowable, Plaskow insists that all descriptions of that divine are merely human creations and are not to be identified with that reality. Maria Pilar Aquino, too, insists upon "God's ineffable absolute mystery" and claims that "God's mystery, as experienced and expressed by women, lies at the center of all theological reflection."'8 Elizabeth Johnson advocates a feminist retrieval of the tradition of the via negativa. According to Johnson, a feminist appropriation of negative the ology allows women to correlate and expand their liberationist theologies with a tradition that rebukes the assumption that descriptions of God are to be taken literally. Johnson's reasoning is similar to that of Plaskow; she writes, "Ultimately the highest human knowledge about God is to know that we do not know." For Johnson, the inability to know God is generative of an open-ended theology: "In the scope of the height and depth, the length and breadth of the incomprehen sible God, language can be set free."'9 No longer descriptive of God, theological language can be playful, risky, and, most importantly, liberating. Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza makes explicit the link between negative theology and liberation. She reasons as follows: "When speaking of G-d, a criti cal theology of liberation does not assume that biblical language is directly referential and descriptive of divine reality. Rather, such theological discourse positions itself within the tradition of 'negative theology,' which recognizes that all language about the divine is incommensurate with divine reality."20 In an other text, Schiissler Fiorenza remarks: "Since G*d radically transcends human experience, no human language, not even that of the Bible, can speak ade 17 Judith Plaskow, Standing Again at Sinai: Judaismfrom a Feminist Perspective (San Fran cisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1990), 134. These comments are contained in a section entitled "God: Reimaging the Unimaginable." 18 Maria Pilar Aquino, Our Cryfor Life: Feminist Theologyfrom Latin America, trans. Dinah Livingstone (Maryknoll, N.Y.: 1993), 10, 130. 19 Elizabeth Johnson, She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Discourse (New York: Crossroad, 1992), 110, 112. 20 Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, But She Said: Feminist Practices of Biblical Interpretation (Boston: Beacon, 1992), 6. In this text, Schiissler Fiorenza explains that her use of "G-d" "is meant to indicate that G-d is 'in a religious sense unnameable' and belongs to the 'realm of the ineffable.' G-d is not G-d's 'proper name.'" This explanation relies, in part, on Rebecca S. Chopp, The Power to Speak: Feminism, Language, God (New York: Crossroad, 1989), 32, whom Schiissler Fiorenza quotes. Subsequently changing her designation for the divine to "G*d," Schiissler Fiorenza explains the change as her response to Jewish feminists who objected to the prior designation as indicating a "very conservative, if not reactionary, theological frame of reference." She also writes, "I do think it is theologically necessary to visibly destabilize our way of thinking and speaking about G*d." Jesus, 191. Another scholar who embraces the emancipatory function of negative theology is Sallie Mc Fague, in Models of God: Theology for an Ecological Nuclear Age (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), 40.</page><page sequence="8">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 57 quately about the Divine."21 Schiissler Fiorenza uses the designation "G*d" to visibly destabilize our thinking and speaking about the divine. She also advo cates recourse to specific forms of negation, and in doing so, she again makes express reference to the tradition of negative theology: The via negativa of classic theology stressed that we are not able to say properly who G*d is but must say again and again who G*d is not. God is not man, not white, not father, not king, not ruler, not Lord. She is also not woman, not mother, not queen, not Lady. Since, however, Christian tradition and theology for the most part use masculine language for the Divine, theology must focus on the inadequacy of such masculine lan guage, imagery, and titles and reject their exclusive use for speaking about G*d. The same applies to Marian symbolic language and images that identify Mary of Nazareth with the eternal feminine or eternal otherness. Such a critical rejection and deconstruction of kyriocentric masculinity and femininity as determinative for the language about G*d is one of the most important tasks not only of feminist theology but of all Christian theology.22 Schiissler Fiorenza wishes to avoid any possibility that the divine will be con fused with the predominantly male imagery with which the divine is described. Hence, she insists upon an explicit negation of all designations as inapplicable to the divine. These feminists also endorse efforts to offer multiple designations for the divine. Schiissler Fiorenza, for instance, recommends not just the deconstruc tion and critique of symbols for God, but also their "proliferation" and "amp lification." For her, "G*d is the G*d of liberation and well-being," and hence affirmative discourse about the divine ought to reflect communal utopian de sires. Nonetheless, Schiissler Fiorenza cautions her readers that all affirmative language of the divine must be understood as "only analogical since G*d always transcends human desires for liberation and our images of salvation."23 Thus, however much these feminists might provide linkages between the divine and historical struggles for liberation, they insist that ultimately the divine remains impervious to linguistic mediation. For Mary Daly, negativity entails one's rejection or negation of all andro centric naming; consequently, the realm or divinity toward which one is jour neying is "unknown" or "hidden." This suggests that she associates true divinity with a "region" beyond knowing; and indeed she insists on the transcendental 21 Schiissler Fiorenza,Jesus, 179. 22 Ibid. (Schiissler Fiorenza's emphasis). Kyriocentric is derived from the Greek word for "lord," kyrios. To draw attention to the complex patterns of dominance (e.g., race, class, sexuality) that intersect with gender, Schiissler Fiorenza has coined the term kyriarchy. This term more accu rately reflects the multiple manifestations of societal dominance than does the term patriarchy. 23 Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">58 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion character of the God of liberation. Both Plaskow and Johnson outrightly assert that the divine is unknowable. Schiissler Fiorenza has claimed that her position is that the divine is "un speakable" but not "incomprehensible."24 This claim is in part borne out by her advocating the practice of negating descriptions of the divine. I would suggest, however, that the distinction between "unspeakable" and "unknowable" may not be tenable. To say that the divine "radically transcends human experience" and that "all language about the divine is incommensurate with divine reality" seems to me tantamount to saying that this "reality" transcends knowledge. Can we know something that we cannot speak about? A reality that can be neither expe rienced nor described would seem to be a reality that cannot be known; in other words, access to the very stuff that makes for knowledge is what is being denied here. I will have to let readers decide about this distinction. Notwithstanding this distinction, as subsequent discussion will demonstrate, Schiissler Fiorenza makes two critical moves that I claim are crucial to feminist theologians who wish to surmount the difficulties of espousing a negative theology. I suggest that feminist theologians consider the possibility that a hidden, unspeakable, or unknowable divinity-a divinity that repels all attempts at predication-may undermine or constrain their efforts on behalf of religious, cultural, and political emancipation. More specifically, I would caution that feminist theologians' advocacy of such a divinity incurs the risk of mystification and its attendant elitism (which are contrary to feminist politics). In this think ing, the sublime status of the divine is conveyed through the failure of human signification and comprehension. But the idea of someone or something that is exalted precisely because it transcends representation, and thus knowledge, is usually a prime target of a hermeneutics of suspicion. A stream of denials, prohibitions, and proclaimed failures of knowledge would ordinarily lead one to suspect that privilege is being protected. Elizabeth Johnson notes that her embrace of an incomprehensible divinity is endorsed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy. She refers to the First Vatican Council (1869-70): "Divine mysteries of their very nature so excel the created intellect that even when they have been given in revelation and accepted in faith, that very faith still keeps them veiled in a sort of obscurity."25 Why does Johnson not notice that the exaltation of mystery fits quite well with an authori tarian church structure? Would there be any reason to suppose that an autho ritative and exclusive body would object to a theology that is predicated upon the failure of human rationality? Not at all-mystery justifies that body's status as exalted guardians. The divine must be kept veiled by those "in the know." Shielded from view by a series of "nots," the ineffable divine will not submit to seeing, naming or knowing. Hence, the divine repels the only means by which 24 Elisabeth Schissler Fiorenza, communication with author, April 14, 1999. 25 Josef Neuner and Jacques Dupuis, eds., The Christian Faith in the Doctrinal Documents of the Catholic Church (New York: Alba House, 1981), 45-46; quoted in Johnson, 112.</page><page sequence="10">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 59 humans may adjudicate accountability. But is it not one of the ruses of authority to mask itself? to have pretensions of being above scrutiny, above the law? The question, too, must be asked: If a divinity that is a white, domineering male con tributes to social relations of dominance, why is an unknowable one conducive to egalitarian relations? Indeed, I would submit that such veiling is a prerogative of elite males. It is important to recall that the ability to deflect or avoid the gaze of scrutiny has consistently served as an index of male privilege. In a recent book addressing the subject of idolatry, Moshe Habertal and Avishai Margalit write, "The sense of the gap between God and his worshippers is based on the fact that they can never see his image, even in a representation. This may be compared to the kings of Persia, who would speak to their subjects from behind a screen and were never seen."26 Plenty of theologians from the "Abrahamic" traditions find no contradiction in statements that both negate all descriptions and likenesses of the divine and assert the maleness of divinity. The contemporary philoso pher of religion Don Cupitt writes, "By the negative theology we usually under stand the doctrine that so emphasizes God's transcendence as to remove him [!] beyond the reach of descriptive language."27 Probably the most outrageous example of this conflation is contained in the following excerpt articulating a tenth-century Islamic school of theology: [N]o place comprehends him [the divine], no time passes over him.... [H]e is not comparable with men and does not resemble creatures in any respect.... [H]e is unlike whatever occurs to the mind or is pic tured in the imagination.... [E]yes do not see him, sight does not attain him, imagination does not comprehend him.... [H]e is too holy to be touched by women or to have consort or children.28 Commentary like this suggests that there is a ready association between that which defies scrutiny and maleness. Indeed, some feminists combine ref erences to the divinity's maleness and "his" transcendence, without seeming to notice or to feel compelled to elaborate upon the implications of the association. For instance, in her discussion of kabbalism, Judith Plaskow points to the sub ordinate relation of the immanent and feminine aspect of the divine as com 26 Moshe Habertal and Avishai Margalit, Idolatry, trans.

Hence, although she refers to the "in effable, masculine Godhead," she nonetheless insists that the divine reality is unknowable and unimaginable-an insistence that supposedly serves as a neu tral starting point for a feminist reimaging of the divine.29 And although Mary Daly early on advocated a "neo-negative" theology and a concomitant "hidden God," remarks contained in a subsequent work testify to her insight that a di vinity who defies scrutiny-that is, an absent or hidden divinity, or what is com monly referred to as the deus absconditus-is nonetheless clearly male. Daly wryly observes: The "omnipresent" god is not in fact "commonplace," because he is no place. Correctly named, his "omnipresence" is "omniabsence." His absence everywhere is named as "presence" everywhere, and the "pres ence" consists precisely in this false naming. The ubiquity of false nam ing masks the ominous Absence which is the essence of the patriarchal god. It confers upon him infinite worth in the rarified realm of Reversal Religion's value system. The infinite absence of divinity in the patriar chal god is the ultimate scarcity-rarified to the point of Zero.30 Unrepresentable and unknowable, this divinity is a deadbeat dad. One pre sumes, accordingly, that Daly would disown her early advocacy of a "hidden God." The gendered elitism of an unrepresentable, and thus unknowable, di vinity is reinforced by characterizations that depict as "feminine," "childish," or "vulgar," or as "ignorant masses," those persons who claim to have knowledge of the divine, who have a habit of attributing characteristics to the divine, or who make use of images of the divine. The first Christian author to use the designa tion "negative theology," Pseudo-Dionysius, repeatedly conveys the elitism that is associated with an unknowable divinity: "Let your respect for the hidden God be shown in knowledge that comes from the intellect and is unseen. Keep these things of God unshared and undefiled by the uninitiated."31 Pseudo-Dionysius subsequently remarks: [T]he inspired hierarchs have transmitted these things not in... undis guised conceptions, but in the sacred symbols. For not everyone is holy and, as scripture affirms, knowledge is not for everyone.... And I am 29 Plaskow, 140. Mercy Amba Oduyoye notes the tensions between God's maleness and "his" purported transcendence, but does not elaborate upon them. She writes: "By and large the idea of God attracts male imagery in all three religions (Christianity, Islam, and traditional [African] reli gion), in spite of the fact that everyone knows God does not have a body. This maleness, however, does not seem to be a cause for concern, as the language for talking about God uses no gender spe cific pronouns. God's 'maleness' is further masked by appellations of God that suggest androgyny."

This notion concerning them ... should not be divulged to the vulgar. For this kind of speculation is more suitable for the elite."33 In a book on the first Christian iconoclastic controversy, Jaroslav Pelikan quotes an earlier scholar as follows: "[T]he icons proved victorious .... This was an affray be tween the masculine and feminine. Against the immaterial principle of male ness there had arisen and conquered... the essence of womanhood, the divinity of spiritualized matter."34 The late-nineteenth-century classicist and brother to the cardinal of the same name, F. W. Newman, critiques a poet's desire to see God's face: "[H]e drops out of rational and spiritual religion into a credu lity which has everywhere induced baneful idolatry, assimilating God to man. A face? and why not a hand? why not a foot? Does God need eyes and nose? To suppose it, is to abandon the first principles of manly religion, and go back into ancient puerilities."35 Some readers may object that the problem with these various examples is simply that negative theology has heretofore not been negative enough. These readers might argue that despite the seeming thoroughness of negative the ology, not all descriptions have been sloughed off and gender references have tenaciously clung to the divine referent. Hence, these same readers might sug gest that the feminist aim in appropriating negative theology is to make negative theology consistent and to realize its potentially radical political implications. In other words, they would insist that the task of feminist theologians is to polish off the remaining vestiges of gender that mar declarations of divine ineffability. Recalling my example of television's transcendent "Charlie," I would sug gest, instead, the possibility that all these examples indicate that the ability to resist representation is widely, if not always consciously, regarded as a preroga tive of elite males. In other words, these examples do not simply illustrate habit ual male pronoun usage, they indicate that elitism and "maleness" are perfectly 32 Ibid., 199-200. 33 Moses Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, in A Maimonides Reader, ed.

Consequently, I would argue that the advocacy of a hidden God is problematic in the context of a society in which poverty and pornography have a "feminine" face and in which "objective" scholarship conceals the interests of elite men. Moreover, I contend that it is difficult to reconcile the contrast between feminist theologians' painstaking efforts to demystify their own social location and interests and their recommendations of a divinity that deflects such determinations. Although a divinity that invites a variety of names (because no one name or rule will stick and thereby be sanctioned) appears to support a democratic plu ralism, it compromises another feature of democracy: consent made possible by disclosure. Feminist theologians are engaged in the dangerous process of at tempting to elicit readers' loyalty to a divinity that they declare is ultimately un representable. Elaine Scarry analyzes an analogous danger in advertising. Scarry cautions her readers as follows: [T]he possibilities for compelling belief become much more emphatic when the product disappears. What is widely considered most offensive about advertising is that "all this" is being done on behalf of a product in order to sell it. At the same time, the saving grace of commercials has al ways been the product, for the product betrays the motive for the drama, and this provides the single check on the believability of the ideologies embedded there. It is the only invitation to critical thought; it is the locus of skepticism and disbelief in what without it [the product] would merely entrance. When advertisements become severed from any concrete, purchasable products, all checks are lifted.36 Scarry calls advertising a "theatre of belief."37 Surely, theology is also engaged in the construction of a theater of belief. What feminist theologians need to notice is the hierarchical and authoritative gesture that is contained in the advocacy of that which defies representation but is nonetheless to be believed in. The fact that it is easy to overlook the undemocratic elements adhering to a feminist advocacy of negative theology may indicate that the acceptance of and deferral to that which defies scrutiny and comprehension is an all-too-common occur rence in modern capitalist societies, in which rigid hierarchies of race, class, and gender, marketing manipulation, globalization, bureaucratization, and severe time pressures in the interest of increased productivity constrain citizens' ability to inspect and participate in decision-making processes. Rather than contributing to an emancipatory democratic practice, then, negative theology appears to violate feminist theologians' espousal of a herme neutics of suspicion and their insistence upon the imperative of self-disclosure.38 36 Elaine Scarry, Resisting Representation (New York: Oxford, 1994), 40, emphasis added. 37 Ibid. 38 Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz writes, "All theology has to start with self-disclosure."

Consequently, negative theology lends authorization to elitist and mystifi catory institutions, and reflects and reinforces the widely held assumption that resisting representation is a prerogative of elite males. Hence, I urge feminist theologians to consider disavowing negative theology. Of course, there are those readers who will insist that there is no need to be deterministic. These readers would argue that feminists are at liberty to unburden negative theology from its potentially regressive characteristics and uses and to harness its critical and liberative lesson. But is there a way to harness the critical and liberative power of discursive failure without collaborating in mystification? What might such a strategy look like? Radical Democratic Feminist Theory Such a strategy might look like the work of the postmodern feminist theorist Judith Butler. Butler exploits the emancipatory potential that she claims is con tained in the failure of signs to capture referents-a failure that results from the referent's lying outside the confining grasp of concept and image. Butler argues that this failure is constitutive of a radical democratic politics. According to Butler, no definitive definitions of "women," "race," "free dom," and so on, can be supplied, given that all signs fail to capture the ref erents to which they refer. But in this failure, she claims, lies the very possibility of a radical democratic politics of contesting definitions. Butler agrees that although everything we see is language, not everything is language: "This radi cal difference between referent and signified is the site where the materiality of language and that of the world which it seeks to signify are perpetually nego tiated.... Although the referent cannot be said to exist apart from the signified, it nevertheless cannot be reduced to it."39 If one wishes to testify to the irre ducibility of the referent to language, one is hard-pressed to do so given the ref erent's dependence upon language. Hence, the only way we can attest that the world is not reducible to language is, first, by insisting that language fails to grab hold of referents and, second, by capitalizing upon that failure: The "referent persists only as kind of absence or loss, that which language does not capture, but, instead, that which impels language repeatedly to attempt that capture, that circumscription-and to fail. This loss takes its place in language as an insistent call or demand that, while in language, is never fully of language" (67 [Butler's emphasis]). It is precisely this resistance to conceptual capture, on the part of an ob ject or person, that prevents the naturalization of certain versions of things and persons. In other words, all discursive formations are not final but rather con 39 Judith Butler, Bodies That Matter (New York: Routledge, 1993), 69. All subsequent refer ences to this book appear parenthetically in the text and notes.</page><page sequence="15">64 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion tingent. Although to all appearances the word and referent are indissoluble, the referent continually pushes against its representation, prompting various and shifting attempts at naming. This antagonism between word and referent is what preempts the closure of identity-the antithesis of radical democratic con testation. Butler maintains that politics is contingent upon the preservation of an "outside," that is, the remainder of the referent that is not fully captured in any particular representation. She differentiates the "outside" she is advocating from the outside that is generated via the "violence of exclusion" (53), which is a byproduct of identity politics. Identity politics functions by excluding all that de viates from a presumed template of the normal. For instance, a predominant version of liberal politics imagines the public space as properly inhabited by educated middle- or upper-class white men. These men are unencumbered by bodily and familial considerations, which are handled by the "private" sphere of a feminine household. Hence, the public space of liberalism is made pos sible by an "outside" composed of excluded white women, as well as black men and women, homosexuals, poor persons, immigrants, and so on. The norma tivity and coherence of the liberal public sphere depends upon these exclusions. Butler wishes to retain the critical power of the outside without having it result from forced exclusion: The task is to reconfigure this necessary "outside" as a future horizon, one in which the violence of exclusion is perpetually in the process of being overcome. But of equal importance is the preservation of the out side, the site where discourse meets its limits, where the opacity of what is not included in a given regime of truth acts as a disruptive site of lin guistic impropriety and unrepresentability, illuminating the violent and contingent boundaries of that normative regime precisely through the inability of that regime to represent that which might pose a fundamen tal threat to its continuity. In this sense radical and inclusive represen tability is not precisely the goal: to include, to speak as, to bring in every marginal and excluded position within a given discourse is to claim that a singular discourse meets its limits nowhere, that it can and will domes ticate all signs of difference. (53 [emphasis added]) Butler's answer to such forced exclusions is not representational inclusivity. Her insistence that there is always a remainder that eludes representation and that every act of representation necessarily entails some form of exclusion precludes such inclusivity. Moreover, Butler argues that pretensions to inclusivity are not the stuff of democratic politics. Inclusivity is often a euphemism for identity politics, which pivots from a dominant rendering of the normative and which attempts to foreclose the ongoing contestation that is at the heart of radical democratic politics. Consequently, Butler reconfigures the "outside" of signification so that it is no longer seen as the abject other. Instead, the "remainder" that resists in</page><page sequence="16">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 65 corporation in prevailing definitions becomes the catalyst of a radical demo cratic politics: No signifier can be radically representative, for every signifier is the site of a perpetual meconnaisance; it produces the expectation of unity, a full and final recognition that can never be achieved. Paradoxically, thefail ure of such signifiers-"women" is the one that comes to mind-fully to describe the constituency they name is precisely what constitutes these signifiers as sites of phantasmatic investment and discursive rearticula tion. It is what opens the signifier to new meanings and new possibilities for political resignification. It is this open-ended and performative func tion of the signifier that seems to me to be crucial to a radical demo cratic notion of futurity. (191 [emphasis added])40 Butler claims that it is "paradoxically" the failure of signifiers to capture refer ents that garners our investment in that signifier. If words and referents are assumed to be identical, there is no point in investing in "significant" change. The only signifiers that yield a return on investment are those which are recog nized as failing to capture their referents and, hence, as offering room for demo cratic contestation. That Butler sees discursive "failure" as productive is signaled not only by her reference to "investment" but also by her reference to "futurity": "This instability in all discursive fixing is the promise of a teleologically unconstrained futurity for the political signifier. In this sense, the failure of any ideological formation to establish itself as necessary is part of its democratic promise" (195 [emphasis added]; see also 192). In Butler's scheme, democracy is contingent upon discursive failure. For her, the interminable tussles of word and referent are at center stage in the political arena. These scuffles of signification beget representational open-endedness, which in turn constitutes democratic politics. For Butler, the association of representational open-endedness with democracy appears to be a matter of common sense; she often pairs the concepts, as in "the open and democratizing potential" (221). Hence, the measure of Butler's demo cratic liberty is discursive open-endedness. Butler is not the only postmodern theorist to invest in the lucrative potential of "significant failure." Butler contextualizes her politics of antagonism through reference to the work of the radical democratic theorist Chantal Mouffe. According to Mouffe, democracy should be understood as a "discursive surface of inscription" characterized by a plurality and antagonism of definitions.41 Her 40 Butler reiterates her point: "To understand 'women' as a permanent site of contest, or as a feminist site of agonistic struggle, is to presume that there can be no closure on the category and that, for politically significant reasons, there ought never to be. That the category can never be de scriptive is the very condition of its political efficacy" (221). 41 Chantal Mouffe, "Democratic Politics Today," preface to Dimensions of Radical Democracy: Pluralism, Citizenship, and Community, ed. Chantal Mouffe (London: Verso, 1992), 13. All subse quent references to this book appear parenthetically in the text and notes.</page><page sequence="17">66 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion version of radical democratic politics requires that articulations "should always be recreated and renegotiated" (14). Mouffe contrasts her notion of radical democracy with Habermasian scenarios that require "undistorted communica tion" and a "final rational reconciliation of value claims" (13). Mouffe elaborates upon this point: By showing that such a consensus is a conceptual impossibility, it [radi cal democratic politics] does not put in jeopardy the democratic ideal as some would argue. On the contrary, it protects pluralist democracy against any attempts of closure. Indeed such a rejection constitutes an important guarantee that the dynamics of the democratic process will be kept alive.... The fact that this must be envisaged as an unending process should not be cause for despair, because the desire to reach a final destination can only lead to the elimination of the political and to the destruction of democracy.42 Politics is made possible because signification fails. If it were successful, the dreaded "closure" would result and politics would be annulled. Consequently, there can be no hope of a final reconciliation of word and referent in Mouffe's version of democratic politics. The logical consequence of this necessary im possibility of reconciling word and referent is that "radical democracy also means the radical impossibility of a fully achieved democracy" (14). In short, the viability of democracy paradoxically requires its failure. Both negative theology and radical democratic theory exploit the produc tivity of discursive failure. Just as the failure to reconcile word and referent in the case of the divine referent is portrayed as enabling an open-ended theology, these postmodern political theorists insist that an open-ended politics is enabled by the recognition that all signs fail to catch hold of their referents. Although neither Butler nor Mouffe references theology, one cannot help but entertain the idea that what one sees here is the distribution of a divine privilege. After all, if the idea that language fails to grab hold proves to be a goad to critical thought, why not allow all referents to enjoy the benefits of more judicious descriptions and to outgrow their signs that have become too snug? What's good for God ought to be good for the globe. As I see it, the critical lesson of negative theology consists in its exploiting discursive failure in order to destabilize hegemonic definitions and to prompt open-ended inquiry. This lesson is undercut, however, if the strategy is re served only for the divine and if it is understood to reflect an ontological reality whereby the divine is said to be beyond experience, naming, and knowing. In this schema, discursive failure suggests mystification and reinscribes male 42 Chantal Mouffe, "Democracy, Power, and the Political," in Democracy and Difference: Con testing the Boundaries of the Political, ed. Seyla Benhabib (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), 255.</page><page sequence="18">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 67 privilege. But Butler and Mouffe's insistence that all referents resist concep tual capture disperses the mystification that adheres to the unrepresentable and unknowable divine referent (which is exalted precisely on that account). If the power to resist representation ceases to be the perquisite of divinity, then it is no longer tagged with the aura of authority and the exceptionalism of an elite (male) prerogative. Moreover, instead of testifying to a hypostatized tran scendence, discursive instability or failure-in the case of a radical democratic praxis-testifies to the irreducibility and resistance of referents, as well as to the necessity that all realities are subject to ongoing contestation and negotiation in a radical democracy. In other words, discursive instability would no longer be mortgaged to an ontological claim, namely, that the supreme reality is ineffable; it would, instead, reflect a pragmatic and political strategy. Are there perhaps theologians who are already wise to the need for a dis tribution of the divine privilege of resisting representation? There is evidence that Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza is engaged in such a process of distribution. Schiissler Fiorenza argues for the open-endedness of "scriptures"; she also de stabilizes the referent of the termsfeminism and wo/men.43 Following her ex ample, feminist theologians might rethink their theological claims. In so doing, feminist theologians' embrace of discursive instability would no longer entail their shielding the divine male from scrutiny, nor their endorsing a "reality" that is constituted precisely by the failure of human comprehension. If feminist theo logians dispense with the ontological argument of divine ineffability (an argu ment which reflects mystification and entails contradiction) and focus instead on the political repercussions of all talk, including talk of the divine, the di vine might become a model for critical and liberating thought and action, rather than an exalted referent that lies outside the bounds of human experience and knowledge. The Politics of "Failure" I suggest that feminist theologians take heed of postmodern feminist theo rists' more democratic efforts to exploit discursive failure. At the same time, I would argue that postmodern feminist theorists have something to learn from feminist theologians. Indeed, Schiissler Fiorenza's explication of radical demo cratic politics may actually be preferable to that of Butler and Mouffe. Schiiss ler Fiorenza's vision of radical democratic politics includes attention to material 43 See Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, "Transforming the Legacy of The Woman's Bible," in troduction to Searching the Scriptures, ed. Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza (New York: Crossroad, 1993), 1:1-24. See also her "Feminist Liberation Theology as Critical Sophialogy," introduction to The Power of Naming, ed.

In short, Schiissler Fiorenza does not assume that the only thing necessary for a radical democracy is discursive instability. Butler's radical democratic politics is preoccupied with matters of rep resentation-indeed, of representationalfailure. Her focus on representation, however, obscures the material and historical causes of oppression, as well as the material and institutional resources that are necessary for democratic deci sion making. Intent upon policing the intersection of sign and referent, Butler and Mouffe tend to ignore the class, race, gender, and ethnic antagonisms fueled in part by competitive capitalism and its division of labor-that thwart collective struggles for democracy and liberation. Consequently, there is no mention made of the material arrangements that enable persons to contest their "authorized" representation and exclusion and to offer revisions of their singu lar and collective identities. All eyes are fixed on the waltz of sign and referent; meanwhile, the democratic institutions that enable contestation, and the mate rial and cultural arrangements that block or conduct access to such institutions, are ignored. It is precisely this focus on representation as the diagnosis and solution to social conflict that is the target of Teresa Ebert in her recent book Ludic Feminism and After. Ebert offers "a critique of... a feminism that is founded upon poststructuralist assumptions about linguistic play, difference, and the pri ority of discourse and thus substitutes a politics of representation for radical social transformation."44 The politics of representation, or what she also terms "cultural politics," does not enact democratic and just societal arrangements but rather constructs a textual theater of signification, resignification, remetaphori zation, and redescription. I contend that Ebert's description is fitting in relation to Butler and Mouffe. Moreover, Ebert challenges feminists to go beyond the politics of representation in support of a politics that engages the "material base of the social formation that in fact conditions cultural politics."45 Radical democratic theorists such as Butler and Mouffe portray oppression as emanating primarily from the false assumption that there is no gap between sign and referent. In other words, they portray social domination as arising from linguistic reification. This portrayal suggests that were readers simply to recog nize the gap between sign and referent, social transformation would follow. But ler's goal is to reconfigure the "necessary outside" such that all referents would remain outside their significations. The problem with this argument is that it suggests that by merely creating an outside to the discursive arena, that arena will thereby become a wonderfully plural, critical, open-ended, and democratic space. In other words, the mere creation of an "outside" transforms that which 44 Teresa L. Ebert, Ludic Feminism and After: Postmodernism, Desire, and Labor in Late Capi talism (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 3. 45 Ibid., 15.</page><page sequence="20">Pritchard: Feminist Theology and the Politics of Failure 69 is now "inside." But, as Nancy Fraser has argued, "declaring a deliberative arena to be a space where extant status distinctions are bracketed and neutral ized is not sufficient to make it so."46 So, too, genuine freedom-which includes material well-being-demands more than the disqualification of discursive "closure." It demands specification as to what needs to be in place so that all persons may participate in the arena of pluralistic and democratic contestation. A strict adherence to "openness" as against "closure" preempts the possi bility that radical democratic theorists will provide descriptions of the mate rial and institutional arrangements that might constitute the actual space of a democracy. Here again I see an interesting analogy between theology and po litical theory. The prohibition against depicting the divine is analogous (and, for some, directly related) to the reluctance to sketch, in even the barest of outlines, a workable utopia.47 But if we censor the positing of substantive alternatives to the status quo of liberal capitalism because such alternatives are seen as entailing "closure," we assist in the process of eliminating alternatives to liberal capitalism; indeed, we lend authorization to liberal capitalism by continually reinforcing a rhetoric in which freedom consists merely in interpretational open-endedness. Hence, any project with an affinity to negative theology-that is, any project that relies upon the critical and liberative power of discursive in stability or failure-is in danger of reducing emancipation to merely securing a provision for interpretational open-endedness while ignoring the materialist elements that would make possible the exploitation of this provision and the im perative of universal well-being. If postmodern feminist theorists can be faulted for ignoring the materi alist elements of emancipation, feminist theologians ought to be credited for addressing them. For example, Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza argues that femi nist liberationists cannot "rest with the play of multiple meanings, languages, and images." Instead, they must submit all discourses to ethical judgment as to whether they enable real resurrection, namely, the realization of a "world free from hunger, abuse, and injustice."48 Schiissler Fiorenza ardently embraces the liberatory value of open-endedness in interpretation.49 For instance, she reap 46 Nancy Fraser, "Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy," in Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1992), 115. 47 This linkage is made explicit, for instance, by early adherents of critical theory who claim to be following Marx (and, even earlier, Kant); see, for example, Adorno, Negative Dialectics (cited in n. 3), 207; and related discussion in Martin Jay, The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frank furt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-1950 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1973), 51. 48 Schiissler Fiorenza, Jesus, 120, 121. 49 Schiissler Fiorenza insists that "The chapters of this book have not been concerned with es tablishing 'definite' closed readings of biblical texts nor with providing closure to debated issues in feminist christology.... I have argued that the road of a critical feminist christological inquiry must be variegated, inclusive, and open-ended but still remain engaged and committed." Ibid., 187.</page><page sequence="21">70 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion propriates the open-ended and ambiguous gospel proclamation of the empty tomb-a proclamation made by women-to contest "malestream" biblical read ings that canonize male visions of the resurrected Jesus as testimonials to male authority and leadership in churches. At the same time, however, the contri bution of this proclamation to liberatory interpretation is not just its open endedness but also its insistence on "the bodily materiality of resurrection." That the body is "not there" does not signify a casting off of the body; rather, it heralds that the "Resurrected One" returns to earth, to tread the path of strug gle and victory on the "open road" toward Galilee.50 Schiissler Fiorenza endorses negative theology as a strategy for rebuking and preempting discursive closure vis-a-vis the divine. But this strategy does not preclude her from describing the space of a radical democratic politics. This space, the assembly or ekkljsia of "wo/men," is chiefly a "hermeneutical space" characterized as an "open space."51 But the ekklesia of wo/men is also a "counter-public-sphere" composed of citizens, specifically a "discipleship of equals" who struggle for liberation from kyriarchal oppression. As part of this struggle, the ekklesia of wo/men engages in a praxis of radical democratic poli tics. Schiissler Fiorenza specifies norms and imperatives that are to reflect and inform the democratic practices that govern this oppositional political space, in cluding economic equality, equal access, and self-determination.52 Her descrip tion of this assembly as reflecting "a variety of religious-theological and feminist perspectives" and "ecumenical, interreligious, multicultural, and global voices" complements Seyla Benhabib's critique of "the fiction of a general deliberative assembly in which the united people express their will"-a fiction which be longs, according to Benhabib, to the early history of democratic theory. Ben habib urges democratic theory to move toward a model of "loosely associated, multiple foci of opinion formation and dissemination which affect one another in free and spontaneous processes of communication."53 Schiissler Fiorenza's vision of assembly appears to be the sort of association Benhabib has in mind. Despite the fact, then, that Schiissler Fiorenza embraces negative theology as part of her strategy for emancipation, there are elements within her texts that allow her to avoid some of the problems associated with a politics that has affini ties to a negative theology. Most importantly, Schiissler Fiorenza is not pre pared to abandon theology to reactionary forces. Instead, she wishes to correlate 50 Ibid., 123-24. 51 Ibid., 98,128. 52 For elaboration of the ekklesia of wo/men, see Schiissler Fiorenza, But She Said (cited in n. 20), 7, 5, 11, 119.

To accomplish this, however, Schiissler Fiorenza may wish to risk identifying the divine with the ekklesia's praxis of radical democratic politics. She suggests this in her intriguing recom mendation of a theological strategy of the via practica.54 Conclusion Negative theology is adopted by feminist theologians because the claim to be able to define or represent the divine is thought to entail the naturalization and sacralization of hierarchical and androcentric relationships. Hence, to de construct this idolatrous divinity, and to be consistent, feminists adopt theo logical strategies that eradicate all traces of idolatry and reification. I have ar gued that feminist appropriations of negative theology may actually compromise feminists' emancipatory politics, because an ineffable divinity is not only elitist and mystificatory, it is also, ironically, historically coded as male. Moreover, I have shown that even if emancipatory projects do not address the exaltation of an ineffable divine referent, but rather exploit discursive failure for the pur poses of democratic contestation, their nearly exclusive focus on representation obscures understandings of, and remedies for, asymmetrical material arrange ments of power. There is, however, another reason why I remain unconvinced that a God that is considered to be unnameable and unknowable does the work it is claimed to do on behalf of struggles for emancipation. A god who is considered to be "God" precisely because "he" deflects all predicates-what one might call a "Teflon God"-cannot take sides. The unknowable God is a neutral God. This is precisely why James Cone's "black God" is so radical and unnerving. Cone justi fies his black God as follows: "Living in a world of white oppressors, blacks have no time for a neutral God." At the least, a neutral God isn't all that effective. At the most, a neutral God is unanswerable to moral and political dilemmas; and, by remaining above the fray, this God authorizes the status quo. Nonetheless, Cone loses his nerve. He writes, "The transcendence of God prevents us from deifying our own experiences, which results in pantheism.... God is always more than our experiences of God."55 The transcendent God always has an exit strategy. With this qualification, Cone marshals the very argument that dis misses his black God. With one hand Cone unveils God, and with the other he veils God once again. If all scholarship is either for or against the oppressed, then it seems that the divine is either for or against the oppressed, period.56 54 Schiissler Fiorenza, Jesus, 180.

(Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1990), 70,77. 56 Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, In Memory of Her (New York: Crossroad, 1983), 6.</page><page sequence="23">72 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion I cannot help but be convinced that it is a losing strategy to insist on a God who is redemptive but who simultaneously, qua divine, is inscrutable, let alone to insist on one whose inscrutability, per se, is proclaimed to be redemptive. Liber ationists claim that their God identifies with their struggles for emancipation, that their God is a saving God-but then they add the transcendent proviso. Why not let the first claim stand? Rather than scrupulously avoiding any taint of idolatrous "closure," feminist theologians may wish to risk identifying their divine in order to avoid collabo rating in mystification and to remove any vestiges of divine neutrality. I do not doubt for a moment that feminist theologians will remain wary of presenting what could be considered a finite, limited God. The repercussions of doing so include accusations of idolatry, anthropomorphism, primitiveness, vulgarity, childishness, and the like. Nonetheless, I urge feminist theologians to beware of the regulatory function that adheres to charges of "idolatry" lest they defeat the emancipatory aims of their project. Feminist theologians might steer clear of this nettlesome issue by con tinuing the work of distributing the privilege of resisting representation to all referents (which are not thereby hypostatized as transcendent or fundamen tally unknowable), and by delineating the materialist dimensions of a just and pluralistic utopia. Both of these moves, which I have argued are evident in Schiissler Fiorenza, avoid the problems I have identified in negative theology and in emancipatory projects that bear a resemblance to negative theology. Whether one insists on calling this resultant strategy a negative theology is up to the reader. But if feminist theologians wish to assign a particular role to the divine ref erent in their emancipatory projects, they might consider identifying the divine with a reinvigorated praxis of radical democratic politics-one that would be willing to contemplate visions of a just life. If the divine is identified with such a praxis, the identity of the divine will always be subject to contestation not because the divine qua divine resists scrutiny, but because contestation is a predominant characteristic of this praxis. Hence, rather than declaring from the get-go that the divine is divine because it resists definitive representation and cognition (i.e., is "ineffable"), feminists ought better to let the process of contes tation do its work. If feminist theologians join a collective rebuke of theologi cal claims and seek to authorize this move by making recourse to a veiled refer ent, they are in danger of preempting the process of democratic contestation and negotiation. So, too, feminists might have much to gain by remaining true to their declared starting point of experience. Rather than insisting that what makes the divine "divine" is that it "radically transcends human experience" (and thereby tacitly supporting the veiling of the male divine referent), femi nists might better argue that, based upon their experience, certain depictions of the divine are, for reasons of exclusivity or quality, just not liberating.</page></plain_text>
