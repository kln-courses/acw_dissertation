<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shamanism and Christianity: Modern-Day Tlingit Elders Look at the Past Sergei Kan, Dartmouth College Abstract. Shamanism, a key element of the precontact Tlingit culture, was seen by Christian missionaries as one of the worst manifestations of paganism. A relentless campaign waged against the shamans by the missionaries, with the help of mili- tary and civil authorities, succeeded: by the final decades of the nineteenth century, the Tlingit had converted to Christianity, and by the I930s most of the shamans had disappeared. In their effort to reconcile Christianity and the "traditional cul- ture," modern-day Tlingit elders construct various interpretations of shamanism. The article examines these accounts as indigenous history and as ideological state- ments that challenge the notion of the inferiority of the aboriginal Tlingit religion to Christianity. Almost two decades ago Fogelson (1974: io6) criticized American ethno- historians for not paying enough attention to "the native interpretations of critical events and significant historical personages." He contrasted our own Western notion of "objective" "ethnohistory" with that of indige- nous history, which he called "ethno-ethnohistory" (ibid.). Even though few ethnohistorians today would quarrel with Fogelson's position, studies that focus on the Native North Americans' own views and interpretations of the past remain rare, with much of our research still concerned exclu- sively with "what really happened." In the last few years, however, several innovative works on specific North American Indian modes of histori- cal consciousness have finally appeared, notably Harkin's (1988a) elegant analysis of Heiltsuk narratives of their ancestors' first encounter with the Europeans and Brightman's (1990) fascinating paper on the Manitoba Cree traditions of the primitive anthropomorphic "races" chronologically more ancient and culturally less complex than contemporary Cree themselves. Studies like these show a highly developed sense of historical con- Ethnohistory 38:4 (Fall I99I).

Fogelson 1989: 139-40) and a serious effort to rethink the past in light of more recent experiences. They also demonstrate that the past can be used to make sense of the present, to justify and explain the cur- rent predicament of the indigenous people of North America.1 Finally, they reveal that this changing historical discourse has developed in the context of a dialogue with Euro-American ideologies. In fact the "dialogi- cal" nature of many of the postcontact Native American oral traditions makes them particularly complex and interesting for ethnohistorians (cf. Harkin i988a: ioz; see also Harkin i988b). They are, after all, attempts by the colonized people to defend their past against various efforts by Euro- Americans to impose their own, often critical, interpretations on Indian history. To complicate matters even further, some of the key elements of Western ideology, such as Christianity, have been accepted by many Native Americans, so that they now often use Christian concepts to reinterpret their own past. However, while accepting Christianity, they often reject the standard missionary view of traditional Indian religions as "primitive" and "pagan." In this article I examine one attempt by the elders in a modern-day Native American society to rethink its pre-Christian religion by affirming its validity while acknowledging the greater wisdom and power of Chris- tianity. In the course of my intermittent work with informants from Sitka, Angoon, Kake, and a number of other mostly northern Tlingit commu- nities from I979 to 1987, I collected several narratives and heard many statements about the nineteenth-century shamans and their responses to Christianity. These comments ranged from occasional negative character- izations of shamans as "witch doctors" to some very strong endorsements of these religious practitioners as healers, wise men, and prophets. Many comments fell between the two extremes and exhibited some ambiguous feelings about an aspect of indigenous Tlingit culture that once drew heavy fire from missionaries and other zealous agents of Westernization. In I979- 80, when I first heard these stories, I did not pay much attention to them, dismissing them as a recent invention, a rhetorical "use of the past" for ideological purposes by elderly Christian Tlingit. A more careful look at this ethnographic material has shown that this case is more complex. First, some of the narratives about the shamans predicting the coming of the Europeans and a new and more powerful religion appear to be not recent but rather old. Second, underlying some of these narratives is the historical fact that in the early contact period shamans were curious about the newcomers' spiritual power and were be- ginning to use Christian paraphernalia and ritual acts. In other words, as in much of the rest of North America (cf. Spier I935; Suttles 1957), incor- 364</page><page sequence="3">Shamanism and Christianity poration of Christian ritual acts and objects into indigenous ceremonial activities often preceded intense firsthand contacts with Europeans and conversion to Christianity. Finally, these stories were not simply created for nonnative consumption but played (and continue to play) an important role in my elderly informants' own worldview. At the same time, they are being passed on to subsequent generations of Tlingit as agreed-upon tribal history and will undoubtedly become that in the future. Thus, contempo- rary Tlingit narratives and comments about shamans are valuable sources of two kinds of information: the more factual history of the nineteenth- century shamans' response to Christianity and the continuously changing native view of these religious practitioners. Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Shamanism Nineteenth-century Tlingit shamanism, as we understand it from the exist- ing historical and ethnographic sources, was a classical circumpolar type. The centrality of shamanism in Tlingit culture was first pointed out by Swanton (I908: 463), who wrote, "It would appear that, taking the people of the north Pacific coast as a whole, shamanism reached its climax among the Tlingit." The shaman (ixt') was the key intermediary between humans and other-than-human persons and powers of the world. He cured the sick, controlled the weather, brought success in war and in fishing and hunt- ing, foretold the future, communicated with other shamans at a distance, received news about faraway people and places, found and brought back to their families those who were lost or captured by the anthropomorphic land otter people (sing. k6oshdaa kda), revealed and neutralized the evil actions of witches, and made public demonstrations of his2 power in vari- ous awe-inspiring ways. The shaman could do all these things because he was inspired by and controlled one or, more often, several acquired or in- herited superhuman spirits (sing. yeik). Each of these spirits had a personal name, a special song, and associated regalia. During his initial solitary quest for power and throughout his life, the shaman had to observe a strict regimen of prolonged fasting, thirsting, purging, and sexual abstinence and was forbidden to cut or comb his hair. Every localized clan had at least one ixt', so that larger villages composed of several clans usually had several resident shamans.3 Christianity and the Tlingit4 The first Tlingit encounter with Christianity occurred in Sitka in the mid- I83os when Fr. Ivan Veniaminov began his proselytizing work in the native 365</page><page sequence="4">Sergei Kan community bordering on Novo-Arkhangel'sk, a fort established in 1804 as the capital of Russian America. At that time relations between the two settlements were rather strained, with the Russians rarely venturing outside their palisade. In fact, Veniaminov could begin visiting the native homes only after a devastating smallpox epidemic of 1837-38 killed off many elders and shamans, upholders of traditional religion. The epidemic some- what undermined the natives' trust in their own healers and demonstrated to them the power of the Russians, who seemed invincible to the new and terrifying disease. Gradually, some of the Tlingit began accepting baptism along with vaccination. The first converts included some Tlingit women married to Russian men as well as a few native clan leaders courted by the Russian-American Company and attracted by the splendor of the Ortho- dox ritual and the possibility of establishing ties with the high-ranking company officials who acted as their godfathers. From the I84os to the i86os the Orthodox church continued its mis- sionizing efforts in southeastern Alaska, focusing mainly on Sitka but also making occasional visits to the surrounding northern villages and to the Stikine area in the south (Tikhmenev 1978; Veniaminov 1984 [1840]; Kan 1985, I988, I99ob, forthcoming). By I867, when Russia sold Alaska to the United States, the Orthodox church claimed over four hundred Tlingit converts. This might seem to be an impressive figure, but in fact even in Sitka the baptized natives did not constitute the majority. Moreover, the existing records suggest that most of these converts had only a vague understanding of Orthodoxy, attended services infrequently, and often failed to confess or receive communion. Few church marriages or burials took place; most Tlingit continued to cremate their dead. While for a few Tlingit Christianity might have already become a significant part of their worldview, most converts, in my opinion, saw it simply as an additional source of spiritual power and material benefit. Thus, some of them began adding prayers addressed to the Russian "Great Spirit" to the traditional magical formulas when seeking success in hunting, fishing, or trade (Kan I985: I98). Of course, one of the major obstacles to Tlingit Christianization was the limited contact they had with the Russians, even in Sitka, not to mention other communities. In order to keep the natives out of Novo- Arkhangel'sk, the Russians built a separate church for them on the border of the two communities, with the Indians having to enter it from their village and the clergy from inside the town. Most importantly, as long as the Tlingit remained politically independent from the Europeans, most of them saw no need to embrace Russian ways as thoroughly as, for ex- 366</page><page sequence="5">Shamanism and Christianity ample, the Aleuts, whom the Tlingit saw as subservient to the Russians (Veniaminov 1984 [I840]: 434). The situation changed significantly after the American arrival in 1867 and especially after the establishment of a Presbyterian mission in 1878. The Americans brought numerous trade items of higher quality and jobs in mining, canneries, and lumbering, which many Tlingit were eager to perform to earn money. Much of this new wealth was channeled into the traditional system of potlatching, but some of the younger "nouveaux riches" began accumulating wealth for their own and their nuclear fami- lies' use. A more serious blow to the traditional social order was American political domination, which resulted in encroachment on native subsis- tence resources and interference in their internal affairs. A few attempts at resistance resulted in a show of force by the American men-of-war patrol- ling the coast, making submission to the newcomers' power and authority inevitable (Hinckley I972; Kan 1985). Backed by the military and civil authorities, Presbyterians attacked such key aspects of the indigenous culture as communal living in large winter houses, matrilineal descent and inheritance, slavery, blood revenge, accusations of witchcraft, and, of course, shamanism. The Presbyterians also relied on American military might to enforce school attendance among the young in Sitka and several other Tlingit communities. Initially, many native parents were interested in having their children learn the ways of the powerful newcomers (especially reading and writing), but they did not want the youngsters to turn their backs on the traditional values and practices attacked by the zealous American reformers. The price paid by these Tlingit children for acquiring the new knowl- edge was high. In the Presbyterian boarding school in Sitka, the center of Protestant education, the use of the native language was forbidden, while the students were indoctrinated in American Protestant values and presented with a bleak picture of their own parents' way of life. Most schoolchildren, even those already baptized in the Orthodox church, were pressured to become Presbyterians. The school graduates were encouraged to intermarry, disregarding the fundamental law of moiety exogamy, and set up nuclear family households in "Boston-style" cottages built near the mission, away from the "evil influence" of their heathen kin. Some of these men and women, who formed the core of the Presbyterian Church of Sitka (officially established in 1884), thoroughly internalized these exoge- nous beliefs and attitudes, while others seemed to vacillate between the two cultures, taking part in potlatches one day and confessing the next (records of the First Presbyterian Church of Sitka, Billman Collection). The 367</page><page sequence="6">Sergei Kan heavy-handed tactics of the Presbyterian missionaries discouraged many older natives from joining their church. In fact, by the late i88os, Tlingit membership in the Presbyterian Church of Sitka had begun to decline. During the same period, the Russian Orthodox church, which re- mained in Alaska after 1867, revitalized its missionary efforts and managed to attract most of the more conservative Tlingit in Sitka as well as a sig- nificant portion of the Indian population of Killisnoo and neighboring An- goon, Hoonah, and Juneau. By the I9Ios all of the Tlingit villages had been Christianized by the Presbyterian and the Russian Orthodox missions. The sudden success of Orthodoxy (see Kan I985, I987, I988, forthcom- ing) owed much to the overzealousness of the Presbyterians. At the same time, Orthodoxy, at least in Sitka and Juneau, seemed to appeal to the more conservative segment of the native population, which was less will- ing to abandon such key aspects of the traditional culture as the solidarity of clan relatives and potlatching.5 While both churches attacked the "old customs,"6 the Presbyterians were much more thorough in their efforts to "civilize" the Indians and had much greater control over their parish- ioners than the understaffed Orthodox church. In addition, Orthodox Christianity, with its emphasis on ritual and the use of sacred objects, was much more susceptible to native reinterpretation and indigenization than the more cerebral Presbyterianism. Finally, the Russian church's greater use of the native language also attracted the more conservative Tlingit. In the first half of this century a number of other denominations, in- cluding the Salvation Army and several fundamentalist and charismatic churches, gained their own converts among the Tlingit. For almost a cen- tury now, Christianity has been an important part of Tlingit culture, pro- viding new sources of spiritual power and emotional well-being as well as new social institutions for strengthening intravillage solidarity. It has also become a source of new rhetoric for describing and evaluating traditional culture as well as contemporary life. The degree of commitment of indi- vidual Tlingit to Christian principles varies significantly, from the die-hard Presbyterians who reject most of the "old customs" (e.g., refuse to take part in potlatches) to those elderly Orthodox church members who have managed rather successfully to syncretize Christian and indigenous beliefs and practices, especially in mortuary rituals (see Kan I987, I989a).7 Prior to the tolerant era of the I960s, the Tlingit had to hide their traditional practices from the clergy and other whites and to be defen- sive when trying to explain the "old customs" to non-Tlingit. Thus, while the potlatch was never outlawed in Alaska, as it had been in Canada, missionaries and civil authorities frequently interfered with this "heathen ceremony" and chastised the Tlingit repeatedly for being "wasteful" and 368</page><page sequence="7">Shamanism and Christianity 369 "old-fashioned." Having always been very sensitive to public criticism and wanting very much to be accepted as equals by the dominant society, the Tlingit have tried hard to justify their pre-Christian beliefs and ceremonies, downplaying their "religious" nature and emphasizing their social func- tions and their important role in maintaining Tlingit identity (Kan I989a). Many devout native people have also felt the need to reconcile Christianity and the "old customs" in their own minds to avoid cognitive dissonance. In the last few decades, the nonnative clergy has eased its accultura- tive pressure considerably, professing to tolerate indigenous customs as long as they do not directly contradict Christian teachings. Today Tlingit elders feel more free to discuss the old ways with their children and grandchildren as well as with nonnatives. Nevertheless, many of them continue to worry about the contradictions between Christian and pre- Christian beliefs and practices. Those elders nowadays formally referred to as "tradition-bearers" are currently constructing their own version of the "old customs" and passing it on to younger generations through "Indian education" classes and various public occasions (Kan i989a, I99oa). A number of these elders have become my informants, teachers, and friends since 1979. In our conversations, shamanism was often mentioned, since it has been one of the key aspects of the nineteenth-century Tlingit cul- ture that they, in their effort to reconcile the two cultural and religious traditions, have had particular difficulty with. Missionary Attitudes towards Shamanism To appreciate this difficulty, we have to look at the missionaries' own view of and struggle against the ixt', whom the Orthodox and the Protestant clergymen alike regarded as an archenemy. To begin with, they correctly identified the shaman as the main religious figure in Tlingit society and the only full-time practitioner who enjoyed great authority and respect in his community (Veniaminov 1984 [1840]: 400, 435). In fact, some missionaries of both churches characterized the entire Tlingit religion as "shamanism" and placed it low on the evolutionary ladder (Kamenskii I985 [I906]: 8i- 91; Kan g99ob). Thus, for example, a Presbyterian minister who served in southeastern Alaska in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries wrote that "the ikt [sic] was superstitiously regarded as an all-powerful being. His word was absolute, and he was revered as a god" (Jones 1914: I58). Bad feelings between the missionaries and the shamans were mutual. The latter saw their position in Tlingit society threatened by the priests and ministers and often discouraged their relatives and neighbors from at- tending church services. Appalled by the shaman's appearance, his use of</page><page sequence="8">Sergei Kan 370 various material objects ("idols," "fetishes"), and especially the dramatic trance he entered in order to do his job, missionaries often referred to him as "a servant of Satan" and saw him as an epitome of ignorant heathenism. While some of the missionaries admitted being impressed with a certain strange psychic power possessed by the ixt', many believed him to be a fraud and his healing to be quackery, aimed at enriching him at the ex- pense of his gullible patients (Willard 1884; Young 1927: I46). In fact, the clergy correctly identified native trust in the shamans as an obstacle in win- ning them over to Western biomedicine.8 Finally, missionaries blamed the shamans for the persistence of beliefs in witchcraft and for the persecution of alleged witches, which not only continued after the American arrival but may even have intensified during that era of accelerated social change. American efforts to free those accused of witchcraft were the main context in which shamans and missionaries confronted each other and in which the latter used force. In addition to preaching constantly against shamanism and witchcraft, Presbyterian missionaries, backed by the navy, the army, and the Alaskan civil authorities, tried to expel the most notori- ous shamans from their communities and even to arrest them (see, for example, Wyatt I989: 68-69). Among the shamans' secular enemies, one man, Commander Henry Glass of the U.S. Navy, gained special admira- tion among the Presbyterian missionaries. According to one Russian priest who labored in Sitka in the I89os, hunting shamans was his favorite pastime and sport. A captured sha- man was usually invited aboard his boat and received with honor. Glass would talk to him in a friendly manner, inquiring about his life, the number of his yeik [spirits], the extent of their strength and power, etc. Then he would announce that he was also a shaman who owned yeik and suggested that they compete against each other. Upon his order, a charged electric battery was brought out. The shaman was asked to hold the wires in his hands, while the two poles were being connected. The shaman's body would begin to twist. His own people, witnessing his strange and funny poses and hearing his screams and moans, became frightened. The shaman himself learned a practical lesson about the power of his white colleague. But the captain did not stop at that. Shamans always left his boat with their heads shaved and covered with oil paint, and having promised not to practice shaman- ism anymore. (Kamenskii I985 [I906]: 85-86; cf. Glass I890) While this Russian missionary found Glass's methods somewhat excessive, he himself demanded that members of the Archangel Michael Society of</page><page sequence="9">Shamanism and Christianity Mutual Aid, which he established among the Sitka Tlingit in 1896, "no longer believe in shamanistic spirits" (Kamenskii 1985 [I906]: III). The Shamans' Fate in the Postcontact Era What effects did this anti-shamanistic propaganda and these activities have on the shamans? Initially, they resisted missionary pressure, waging their own anti-Christian campaign and later trying to hide from their enemies and conduct their activities underground. Thus, shamans disappeared from Sitka by 900o or I9I0 but continued to practice in more isolated, smaller communities, like Angoon and Klukwaan, until at least the I930S. The Sitka and Juneau Tlingit occasionally went to these villages to seek help, and, according to my informants, as late as the I95os there were still some indi- viduals in conservative communities who, while not full-fledged shamans, were reputed to be fortune-tellers and spiritual healers. At the same time, rather early in their contact with missionaries, Tlingit shamans began taking advantage of the new sources of power introduced by the Russians and Americans. References to the shamans' use of crosses and other sacred objects from Christian worship, as well as instances of their imitation of church services, can be found in several ethnographic accounts (e.g., Emmons I945; Oberg 1973: 19) and were con- firmed by my own informants (see below).9 As early as the I83os or I84os some shamans began to accept baptism; unlike the nineteenth-century priest Veniaminov, however, I am not convinced that by joining the Russian church they were actually renouncing their craft.10 Gradually, the shamans surrendered their role as religious practition- ers to the missionaries, not simply because of brute force but because of their own inability to combat devastating diseases introduced by the Euro- peans. While some shamans tried to fight the new diseases, for instance, by adding smallpox spirits to their repertoire of helping agents, many shamans were perceived by their communities as incapable of serving their new needs. Thus, Veniaminov (1984 [1840]: 400) reported that in Sitka the Tlingit were saying that the present-day shamans were much weaker than the old ones and were attributing that decline to the fact that the former were intemperate and weak. The shamans' decline might also be explained by the fact that the Tlingit were losing trust in their power. Humiliated and persecuted, unable to combat new diseases or perform their healing seances without the fear of punishment, shamans increas- ingly lost their hold on the native community, becoming less and less relevant to its social and religious life. Among the manifestations of this 37I</page><page sequence="10">Sergei Kan process were the refusal of some of the prominent shamans' descendants to accept the call by inheriting their paraphernalia and by insisting that the shamans' corpses be disposed of, not above ground, in accordance with tradition, but by burial, which prevented their guardian spirits from being inherited (de Laguna I972: 671). The fact that this began in the I89os, if not earlier, suggests that some Tlingit began to have strong doubts about the shamans' power soon after their acceptance of Christianity. Modern-Day Elders Look at Shamanism Before presenting the ethnographic data I collected from Tlingit infor- mants on the subject of shamanism, I must comment briefly about their background. Most of them ranged in age from sixty to ninety and came mainly from Sitka and Angoon; the rest lived in Kake, Hoonah, Yakutat, and other Tlingit communities. Most of the discussions were conducted in English, with occasional Tlingit words and phrases.11 The issue of sha- manism was discussed in detail with about twenty elders, who belonged to several churches, including Orthodox, Presbyterian, Salvation Army, and Assembly of God. A few of them had seen shamans perform or had at least known the persons allegedly possessing shamanistic power.12 Others had heard about well-known shamans from their own older relatives. Very few of them dismissed or condemned shamanism totally. Even a very devout sixty-year-old Episcopalian woman who emphatically stated that "God and the ixt' do not go together" and that the shaman "served Satan" men- tioned that he did have "a gift from God but turned it into evil." Thus, even the more Americanized older Tlingit who profess not to believe in the power of the ixt' tend to take that power seriously, refusing, for ex- ample, to touch or even look at the shamans' regalia and paraphernalia or to come near their graves for fear of being hurt by guardian spirits. Some of my middle-aged informants, who said that today shamanism has no place in Tlingit life, admitted that if they had lived in the old days, they, like everybody else, would have believed in the ixt'. A few of the oldest and most conservative elders (who tend to be Rus- sian Orthodox) embraced shamanistic beliefs wholeheartedly and claimed that they saw no contradictions between them and Christianity. When asked why all the shamans had disappeared, one of them responded, "When the Tlingit decided to live like the white man, all the medicine men had to go." Another elderly traditionalist commented that shamans could no longer exist because "people do not live right anymore and are not pure." Most of the informants positioned themselves between these two 37z</page><page sequence="11">Shamanism and Christianity extreme views, neither totally condemning nor fully accepting shaman- ism. They tried to divide the shamans into good and bad ones and to differentiate between those shamanistic activities that resembled Chris- tian practices and those that were clearly "heathen." Hence many of the elders spoke about the shamans as "prophets," "healers," "Indian doctors," "spirit men," or "medicine men." They emphasized such positive functions as fighting witches (an activity that they, unlike the missionaries, saw as a useful service to the community), healing, finding missing persons, and upholding morality. One elderly woman from Yakutat, a loyal Presbyte- rian church member, said: "What the white people call 'witch doctor' was no witch doctor at all. He fought against evil spirits. He fought against witches. The ixt's were real God's people. They taught us about the Ten Commandments. 'Do not kill.' 'Do not steal.' 'Do not commit adultery.'" The notion that the teachings of the old-time shamans contained elements of the Old and/or the New Testament was popular with many of my in- formants. Some spoke of the shaman having a "gift from the Holy Spirit." Others compared him to Moses, who taught the people about the Ten Commandments, or to John the Baptist, who foretold and facilitated the coming of Christ. In fact, for these elders the Bible served as a rich source of images in which to couch an "old-fashioned" phenomenon like shamanism and make it more palatable to themselves and their younger native and non- native audiences. When describing the shaman's trance, several informants compared his imitation of the voices of the different spirits to the Apostles' speaking different languages after they had received the Holy Spirit or to the charismatic church members' speaking in tongues. Shamanistic healing was likened to Christ's miraculous healing by laying hands on the afflicted or to the feats of modern-day faith healers. At least one person drew a parallel between the fasting and other taboos observed by the shaman in training to the restrictions imposed on a man entering the priesthood. "Both of them walk a narrow path," he concluded. One of my best informants, a very knowledgeable and reflective man in his sixties, a member of a fundamentalist church who claimed not to believe in shamanism but respected the old-time "Indian doctors," offered the following justification for the existence of shamans: "In the absence of Christianity, I am sure that God in Heaven allowed [for the existence of] a bulwark against the rampaging evil. The ultra-evil was held at bay by the presence of these noted practitioners." Another informant of the same age, who claimed to have read about "primitive" shamans in Asia, insisted that the Tlingit ixt' was not like them at all. Yet despite these comparisons between shamanism and biblical religion, none of my informants likened 373</page><page sequence="12">Sergei Kan the power of the ixt' to that of God himself. As one man put it: "I do not want to be dogmatic, but I think their [shamans'] power was different from God's power. They were more like the prophets mentioned in the Bible who could foretell the future." Some people appealed to modern popular science and psychology to explain the ixt's power. Several persons spoke of him as a "great psy- chiatrist," a "person who practiced telepathy," or the one who possessed "extrasensory perception or the sixth sense." One elderly woman, trying to rationalize the effects of witchcraft on the human body, explained: "The medicine man was a psychiatrist. He told you what was wrong with you. For example, if you hated somebody, that hatred inside of you was making you sick. He could help you deal with that problem." In their effort to downplay the more "heathen" elements of shaman- ism, some of the elders were critical of the shaman's use of rattles, masks, and other paraphernalia. The same woman who called the ixt' a psy- chiatrist pointed out that he "made a mistake when he started wearing crowns, rattles, and bone necklaces and to brag about himself. That is evil!" Another one asserted that "the medicine men were okay until they decided to make themselves big by using rattles, charms, and so forth. Pride is no good!" A third informant compared the use of rattles and other paraphernalia to "a primitive type of voodoo" and contrasted it with the use of "pure" spiritual power by the few "good" shamans. Many of the people I spoke to separated the good "medicine men" from the bad "witch doctors" (the latter term was popular among the whites in Alaska around the turn of the century). The good "doctors" did not harm anybody and did not ask for payment for their services. The bad ones were greedy and jealous of one another and would use their power to kill or otherwise harm other shamans or ordinary persons. The good ones could cure without using any paraphernalia; the bad ones could not. Thus, these informants have taken many of the actual characteristics and prac- tices of the old-time ixt' that the missionaries condemned (e.g., the spiri- tual combats between rival shamans) and applied them to the "bad witch doctors," while creating a category of pure "healers" and "prophets." Some insisted that the more recent shamans tended to be bad or at least weaker than the "real old-time Indian doctors." Others echoed the missionaries when they said that many of the more recent shamans were impostors. Thus they accepted some of the criticism leveled by the whites against the shamans, without rejecting their belief in shamanistic power altogether. According to my informants, the best proof of the power and wisdom of these good old-time shamans was the ability of some of them to predict the coming of the Europeans and especially of Christianity, which they 374</page><page sequence="13">Shamanism and Christianity 375 had allegedly recognized and welcomed as a superior religion. A number of people I spoke to knew about specific shamans who had that reputa- tion, remembered their names and the names of their villages, and gave some details about their prophecies. One knowledgeable informant spoke about two shamans from Klukwaan who predicted the European arrival after their spirits had gone out to sea and had seen the European ships. Another told about a powerful ixt' named Shawaan (?) who often spoke about the various technological miracles that the whites would someday bring to southeastern Alaska, including the "four-eyed monster" (automo- bile) and "a box through which people could talk to each other" (radio and telephone). He also allegedly announced that someday ordinary people, rather than just witches, would be able to fly in the air. A third informant told of a shaman who warned the people to expect trouble from the first Europeans, with their "powerful water" (liquor) and firearms, but encour- aged them to trust the next group of newcomers, "with long hair and long beards" (Orthodox missionaries), who were going "to bring a new and more powerful teaching" to the Tlingit. In several narratives a shaman uses a Russian Orthodox crucifix, holy water, and other sacred objects and substances, speaks "Russian" (actually Church Slavonic), and imitates an Orthodox priest in various other ways. The following narrative was recorded from William Nelson, an elderly Angoon man who was a churchgoer as well as a very knowledgeable traditionalist of noble origin: There once lived a man in the Angoon area who was very sick-he had a strong internal bleeding. One night he saw a man coming through the door. He had a long beard and white hair [looked like a Russian priest]. He was coming closer and closer but then disappeared. He went into the shaman's body. It was a power, a healing power spirit. We call it kugawasu yeik [good luck spirit]. After that the sick man became a shaman; he would sing shaman's songs at night. He was getting the power. Pretty soon his bleeding stopped-no more blood came out of his mouth. He felt good and decided to go to the beach to get some fresh water from a stream. When he scooped up some water, on the bot- tom of his cup he saw a cross. He drank the water with the cross.13 That night he began making noises like a shaman does when the spirit comes down on him. He was speaking Russian. People knew it was Russian because the Russian boats were already visiting them at that time. He owned a Russian axe and every time he spoke Russian he would pick it up. That is when the Russian spirit came down on him.</page><page sequence="14">Sergei Kan We call it Andoshi yahaayi [Russian spirit]. He used that axe to chase away the evil spirits that made his patients sick. He told the people that every seventh day this yeik would come down on him and that on that day the house had to be cleaned very thoroughly. He was a strong ixt' and he had two powers-the healing good luck spirit (kugawasu yeik) and the Russian spirit (An6oshi yahaayi). He could tell when somebody was going to be healed or when witches were doing some wicked things. He lived a long time ago but the Russians were already here. He died in a cave near Angoon. In this story the protagonist still acts as a traditional shaman who simply adds a new guardian spirit to his repertoire. Apparently this is a very powerful spirit (yeik or yahaayi), since it helps the ixt' recover from a life-threatening illness. With the new spirit come new material objects, a secular one-(axe) and a sacred one (crucifix), as well as a new language. Of course, any pre-Christian yeik manifested itself similarly through its own special song, mask, voice, and language. At the same time, this new Christian ("Russian") spirit uses the shaman as a mouthpiece for a new form of ritual observance, the celebration of the seventh day of the week. The narrator admits that the Russians were already in southeastern Alaska when this happened but insists that the Angoon ixt' did not travel to Sitka to visit the Russian church there and had not been baptized. In other accounts, the shaman is described as having suffered a tem- porary death when his soul left the body and visited heaven. Upon the soul's return, the shaman comes back to life and begins teaching the people to clean their houses prior to the seventh sacred day and to rest on that day.14 The most elaborate account of a shaman's prophecy that incorpo- rated elements of Christian teaching comes from the village of Kake and describes the events that took place in the nineteenth century in a commu- nity located in Tebenkof Bay on Kuiu Island, the original home of some of the Kake people. I recorded several versions of that story from three Kake informants in I979, while Billman, an ethnographer from Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, who worked in the I96os and the early I970s, collected similar accounts from informants in several communities outside Kake (transcripts of these accounts are housed in the Billman Collection). The gist of the story is that a local shaman who goes into the moun- tains comes back with the warning that, despite the starvation that is coming, the people should not touch the first run of sockeye salmon. In order to avoid a terrible illness they must wait for the next run. In some versions of this story, the people are told to wait until God or spirits purify the fish, kept in a net, and make it edible. The people disobey and soon fall victim to some unknown disease that causes high fever and blisters or 376</page><page sequence="15">Shamanism and Christianity sores all over the body, followed by blood coming out of the mouth, and then death. In some versions, afflicted men run around, waving their fists or spears as if trying to kill some unknown spirits. The entire village is destroyed except for one or two survivors who tell the story to the people of Kake. The inhabitants of a neighboring village erect a cross on the spot where the victims' bodies lie. Some of the older informants claimed to have seen the remains of a village on that spot when they were younger. The cross was allegedly still visible a few decades ago. It is unclear what happened to the shaman himself. According to some versions of this story, the same shaman told the people about observing the Sabbath and especially warned them not to use any sharp objects on that day. He also taught them how to make crosses and spoke in some unknown language, "probably Hebrew." One infor- mant claimed that the shaman wore a "towel" around his neck and lifted his hands up into the air (i.e., dressed and acted like an Orthodox priest). Depending on the storyteller's background, some versions of this narra- tive place much greater emphasis on the Christian nature of this shaman's prophecies. One man insisted that it was God or "the High Above Spirit," not an ordinary yeik, that the Tebenkof Bay shaman was communicating with. Another informant said that God was testing the people and that all they had to do was to wait one more day for him to purify the fish, but they refused to obey God and were punished by him. Some of my informants denied that the disease that destroyed the people of Tebenkof Bay was an epidemic. However, others insisted that it was in fact smallpox (cf. Peck 1975: 5-7). One of Billman's informants located the event in the early I83os, when her great-grandmother was a young girl. This, of course, was the time of a terrible smallpox epidemic that swept through many Tlingit communities, possibly including the Tebenkof Bay area. This epidemic, the fact that several informants claimed to be direct descendants of its survivors, and that the location of the unfortu- nate village is well established suggest that these events may very well have taken place. It is also reasonable to assume that a local shaman was called upon to deal with this terrible affliction. The people's response to the dis- ease was similar to the way Tlingit in other villages dealt with epidemics. For example, as de Laguna (I97z: 7I0) was told in Yakutat: "Epidemics were believed to be the work of spirits that came in boats, sometimes pad- dling in canoes, or riding in a sailing ship or even in a steamboat. They were invisible to any eyes but those of the shaman. In the boat were all those who had previously died of the disease, and in this way they traveled to the Land of the Dead. ... Some persons received such disease spirits as their yeik, and so became shamans." Even though the Tebenkof Bay story does not mention the spirits of 377</page><page sequence="16">Sergei Kan the disease or their origin, the fact that the fish is blamed for it suggests some connection between the water and the illness. The physical mani- festations of the illness are also reminiscent of smallpox. The fact that epidemics were terribly frightening and confusing to the Tlingit is con- firmed by the Russians who observed some of the sick Sitka Indians in the late I83os eating snow and desperately jumping into the cold water of the ocean, hoping to relieve their fever. They also mention that the afflicted appealed to the shamans for help and that curing seances were performed, but to no avail (Veniaminov I984 [1840]: 434; Tikhmenev 1978: I98-99). If this story originated in the mid-nineteenth century, Kuiu area people had already had some contact with the Russians and other Europeans. They might even have heard about the Russian Orthodox church, and it is possible that a few of them had already been to Sitka, had seen its ritu- als, and had been baptized. It is true that the shaman's interpretation of the disease is very traditional: prohibitions on eating certain foods (ligaas) were quite common in the pre-Christian Tlingit religion. The first run of fish or other "first fruits" were often shared with the whole community, given to the poor and the old, or treated in other special ways. Setting aside fish and other edibles and keeping them in a container that is not to be touched by ritually unprepared laypeople is a common theme in Tlingit mythology. In fact, in some versions, the Tebenkof Bay story has nothing to do with the prediction of Christianity, and these versions might actually be the original ones. However, many of them have a strong moralizing flavor. The ultimate cause of the disease is not some unseen evil spirits but the Supreme Spirit or God who punished people for their impatience and the violation of his taboo. Traditionally, illness or death were com- mon forms of punishment for violating a taboo. It is interesting that some storytellers add mistreatment of small birds by children, a typical Tlingit violation (ligaas) that brings about death and illness, as another reason for the punishment suffered by the unfortunate village. Finally, the story casts the shaman in the powerful role of a prophet or messenger between mankind and a new spirit that is more powerful than the yeik. Even if the original Tebenkof Bay shaman was not the same man who introduced the first elements of Christianity to the people of that area, his ability to inter- pret the meaning of the new disease might have been seen by subsequent generations as a sign of unusual wisdom. Like other shamans, he could not cure the new disease but could explain why it came, couching his interpre- tation in traditional cultural idioms while adding new symbols borrowed from a new source of superhuman power. While stories about the shamans predicting the coming of the whites are rather common, I collected very few narratives about actual encoun- 378</page><page sequence="17">Shamanism and Christianity ters between missionaries and shamans. Several informants said that the early missionaries were impressed with the power of the ixt' and allegedly even acknowledged that it was spiritual power. Persons who persecuted shamans harshly are viewed unsympathetically by the Tlingit elders. Thus, the above-mentioned efforts of zealots like Commander Glass were often mentioned, but instead of describing how shamans were humiliated when their hair was cut short, several elders claimed that the whites were afraid to harm those medicine men, who threatened to use their power to kill any person who touched the scissors. The most interesting account of this kind deals with a Hoonah sha- man who was asked by his village to kill a Presbyterian missionary. For several days this powerful ixt' tried to use his spirits to kill the enemy. Finally, he gave up, announcing that there was nothing he could do. "This man's soul is like a big round rock covered with ice. You can't lift it--your hands are too short and it slips away." As the narrator explained: "This was the shaman's way of saying that the man's soul was pure and that he possessed a higher power. The shaman also said that the missionary was bringing them the good news and the beginning of a new life. He came with love and not hate and he was telling them the truth. After that the village accepted Christianity. This story demonstrates the power of the Lord." Interpretation What do these narratives tell us about the fate of the Tlingit shamans in the postcontact period and about the modern-day Tlingit elders' interpre- tation of shamanism? To begin with, it appears that at least some of these stories, like the ones about the events in Tebenkof Bay or the confrontation between an ixt' and a missionary in Hoonah, are not recent inventions but accounts (however modified) of actual events that took place after contact. Thus, for example, the story about an Angoon ixt' who acquired a power- ful spirit from a Russian was told to me by an elderly man who claimed to have learned it in his younger days. The nineteenth-century origin of this story, or at least of this type of story, is confirmed by Swanton (90o8: 465), who was told in Sitka in 1904 that in the Angoon area there was a shaman who claimed to have acquired his power from "a big Russian." If such narratives refer to the actual events that took place in the nineteenth century, we are dealing here with the shamans' response to mys- terious new phenomena brought about by Europeans and Americans. The shamans, like the rest of the Tlingit, were trying to comprehend not only powerful new diseases but the impressive wealth and military might of the newcomers. Because in the traditional Tlingit culture such things were 379</page><page sequence="18">Sergei Kan linked to the possession of spiritual power, the shamans must have con- cluded that the white man had a lot of it (Kan 1985; cf. Harkin I988a, i988b). This idea must have been reinforced by the whites' invincibility to epidemic diseases and their possession of antidotes to them. The fact that the missionaries were involved in administering vaccines undoubtedly contributed to the clergy's high stature in the eyes of the Tlingit religious specialists and laypersons (cf. Veniaminov I984 [1840]: 434). However, instead of surrendering to this new power, nineteenth- century shamans tried to harness it for their own purposes, borrow- ing magical objects, substances, and formulas from their Euro-American rivals. To do so they did not even have to have a face-to-face encounter with a priest but could rely on stories about the mysterious rites con- ducted in Sitka, stories that had undoubtedly circulated throughout Tlingit country since the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is quite possible that these borrowings appeared to the shamans' tribesmen as independent inventions. The idea that the shamans could predict the coming of the "People from under the Clouds" made perfect sense in light of the indigenous Tlingit worldview. The shamans, the only persons capable of traveling through time and space, had to predict this important event. In fact, it is quite conceivable that a shaman from a village that had not yet experi- enced white contact would be foretelling the arrival of the Europeans on the basis of the rumors rapidly spreading throughout the Northwest Coast. All this suggests that my own informants and other twentieth-century Tlingit who have told stories about the old-time shamans predicting the European arrival have been drawing upon earlier accounts with deep roots in the nineteenth century. Of course, they have tended to rethink and re- interpret these narratives in light of their own historical experience. It is not surprising that such stories have become especially popular since the I960s, when the Tlingit were no longer subject to heavy-handed mission- ary control and criticism. These narratives play a very important function in the modern-day Tlingit worldview. They refuse to accept the Euro- Americans' condescending view of shamanism and other aspects of the precontact native religion, though they do concede the ultimate validity of Christianity as the postcontact religion of the Tlingit people. In these narratives the ixt' serves as a powerful and wise mediator between the past and the present, between the old-time religion, which is portrayed as valid but incomplete, and the new one, which is recognized as superior to it. In some sense it is irrelevant whether the narratives I collected go back one hundred years or are more recent. What is essential is that today they play the role of what Fogelson (I989: I43) calls "epitomizing events," that is, 380</page><page sequence="19">Shamanism and Christianity "narratives that condense, encapsulate, and dramatize long-term historical processes. Such events are inventions but have such compelling qualities and explanatory power that they spread rapidly through the group and soon take on an ethnohistorical reality of their own." In Harkin's (i988a: o10) terms, such events "mediate between radically different yet consecu- tive synchronic states, whose conjuncture was... more subtle and gradual: and yet these epitomizing events provide meaningful cultural symbols and mnemonic devices for the rupture." The fact that the old-time shamans could predict the coming of Chris- tianity denies the whites their claim of being the givers of truth to the "backward" Indians. As many of my informants insisted: "The white people did not teach us anything new; we had already known about the true religion. We knew about the Great Spirit up in heaven even though we did not worship him the way we do today.'5 The only new thing that the white people brought to us was the Holy Bible." To assert one's equality with the whites by refusing to see them as givers is particularly important to the society where those receiving a gift have traditionally been seen as less powerful than those giving it. Finally, this view of the old-time shamans as wise prophets and healers relieves some of the modern-day elders of the burden of having to reconcile their devotion to Christianity with their belief in, or at least respect for, the indigenous religion. If the old-time shamans were frauds, why would one still be afraid of touching their paraphernalia, and how would one explain all their miraculous feats, portrayed in numerous stories passed down from generation to generation? In the opinion of contemporary Tlingit elders, their own noble ancestors had to be telling the truth about the powerful medicine men of yesterday. Conclusion The aim of this article has been to demonstrate the importance of paying at- tention to indigenous versions of history in reaching a much more thorough understanding of the past and present experience of Native North Ameri- cans. For many of them, history is not just some events that happened in the past but a vital force that continues to shape the present. Despite the impact of the written Western culture, oral traditions continue to be passed down from generation to generation, particularly in such societies as the Tlingit, where rank, status, and prestige still depend on one's pedigree and knowledge of it. At the same time, accounts about and interpretations of the past are constantly being reshaped in response to more recent and current events 38i</page><page sequence="20">Sergei Kan and experiences. This has always occurred, because few oral traditions remain forever unchanging. However, since the arrival of Europeans and especially since the establishment of American political domination, his- tory has become hotly contested between the colonizers and the colonized. Until recently, the former, particularly those determined to "civilize the natives," tried to denigrate that history and contrast the heathen "old customs" with the new culture of the "competent Christian citizens" (a favorite Presbyterian term). Native Americans, however, while accepting (or being forced to accept) many of the changes introduced by the domi- nant society, have tried to maintain their own version of the past, which emphasizes the virtues of the ancestors and downplays their vices. Thus the relationship between missionary and native versions of Tlingit history can be seen as a moral dialogue (cf. Burkhart 1989) in which the two sides use some of the same language (i.e., Christianity) and describe some of the same events but often disagree on their meaning. The new rhetoric of Christianity is even used by the Indians to criticize the whites. For example, many of the persons cited in this article said that the Euro-Americans themselves have not lived up to the teachings of Christ, and that it is the Tlingit who are the true Christians and have "always followed the Ten Commandments." Thus the tables have been turned on the colonizers, whose own ideology becomes a weapon in the hands of the colonized (cf. Comaroff 1985). The material presented here also challenges the notion of the exis- tence of a monolithic "Tlingit culture" equally shared by members of that society. As I have shown recently (Kan I989a), there is considerable dis- agreement among the Tlingit on the role of the potlatch in modern-day society and on the meaning of its specific symbols. Similarly, shamanism is looked upon somewhat differently by individual Tlingit, depending on their religious affiliation, age, education, and other factors. The goal of the ethnographer is to represent these divergent views rather than gloss over them. Up until now, none of the ethnographers working in southeastern Alaska have paid much attention to these issues. Determined to gain data with which to reconstruct the nineteenth-century ("traditional") Tlingit culture, scholars trained in the Boasian tradition collected numerous nar- ratives, but the latter tended not to deal with Tlingit-white relations. Thus, for example, Swanton (I909: i)-who acknowledged in the intro- duction to a major collection of Tlingit myths and stories that one of his key informants, Katishan, was a church member who showed a "moral- izing tendency"-did not find it important to consider that Christianity might have colored this man's version of the myths of the Raven cycle. 38z</page><page sequence="21">Shamanism and Christianity Similarly, while de Laguna's (1960, 1972) remarkably detailed works on the culture and history of two Tlingit villages, Angoon and Yakutat, are aimed at reconstructing their eighteenth- and nineteenth-century histories, native representations of postcontact events involving whites are given short shrift.16 It is not my intention here to criticize my predecessors, whose work has been a major inspiration and a source of valuable data. In fact, much of my own ethnographic and ethnohistorical research has also aimed at reconstructing and analyzing the Tlingit culture prior to its dramatic trans- formation in the I9oos (see Kan I989b). What I am arguing, however, is that in order to construct a truly comprehensive ethnohistory of Northwest Coast and other Native North American societies, we must incorporate more of Fogelson's ethno-ethnohistory into it. To succeed in this project we, anthropologists and ethnohistorians, will have to enlist the help of archaeologists, linguists, folklorists, and, of course, native historians them- selves.17 Notes I would like to express my gratitude to those Tlingit elders who over the years have taught me so much about their culture and history, especially Mark Jacobs, Jr., Charlie Joseph, Thomas Young, Jimmy George, Matthew Fred, George Jim, William Nelson, and Moses Rose. One of these elders, Jimmy George, passed away in the summer of I990 at the age of one hundred when I was writing this article, and so it is dedicated to him. However, it expresses my own opinions and interpretations rather than those of my Tlingit teachers. I would also like to thank my academic teacher, Raymond D. Fogelson, for introducing me to ethnohistory and ethno-ethnohistory, and the anonymous reviewers of this article for their helpful comments. The research for and writing of the article were supported by a Summer Stipend from the National Endowment for the Humanities and by a grant from the Phillips Fund of the American Philosophical Society. i For a fine recent discussion of indigenous South American perspectives on the past (including European contact and colonization), see Hill 1988. Turner's (1988) commentary on these essays is of special interest because it raises general theoretical issues concerning the relationship between "myth" and "history" in non-Western cultures. In his essay Turner uses the term ethno-ethnohistory but (surprisingly) does not credit Fogelson with coining it. z Most of the Tlingit shamans were male, even though there were some power- ful female ones as well. Throughout this article I refer to shamans with the masculine pronoun. 3 For details on Tlingit shamanism see Veniaminov 1984 [I840]; Krause 1956 [1885]; Kamenskii 1985 [I906]; Swanton 1908; de Laguna 197z, I987. 4 This brief overview is based on Kan I985, I987, I988, I99ob, forthcoming. 5 Unlike Sitka and Juneau, which became American towns with substantial native populations, Tlingit villages, especially in the north, were composed almost 383</page><page sequence="22">Sergei Kan entirely of conservative people, so that there was not much difference between those who joined the Russian Orthodox church and those who became Pres- byterian. In addition, people in the villages were more likely to go back and forth between the different churches, a phenomenon that continues to this day. 6 The term old customs was introduced by the Protestants and was frequently used by Euro-Americans and Indians alike to describe the various indigenous practices and beliefs in a somewhat pejorative way. It is still used today by some of the older Tlingit. 7 For biographical information on modern-day Tlingit elders who comfortably combine indigenous and Christian beliefs and practices, see Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1987: 443-510; 1990: 521-57. 8 Thus Governor John Brady, who started his career in Sitka as a Presbyterian missionary, tried once to dissuade some Sitka Indians from relying on a sha- man during the 1898 epidemic of tuberculosis. He invited them to his office and displayed some physiological charts, explaining the cause of the disease and telling them that white people suffered from it as well. Having listened to the lecture, one Tlingit elder replied: "Well, that is what the white men say. We are Indians, and we know that there are witches" (Hinckley i982: 254). 9 Cf. McClellan 1975, 2: 529-63 on the Inland Tlingit, Tagish, and Tutchone shamans. o1 Cf. de Laguna 1972: 723 on Yakutat in the early I9oos. 11 Because shamanism remains a rather sensitive topic for many of the elders, I do not mention their names in this article. z1 Some informants said that when they, as young children, saw an ixt' perform, they still believed in his power; others claimed that they had already lost that belief. One elderly woman, who had been raised in a devout Christian family in Sitka, told of throwing sand at an Angoon ixt' and thus forcing him to stop a seance when, as a young girl, she saw him perform on her aunt. 13 Compare the Orthodox ritual of consecrating the water by immersing a cross in a full container, performed on the feast of Epiphany. The Tlingit called this ceremony "baptizing the cross." 14 Cf. McClellan 1975, 2: 553-63 on the Inland Tlingit and their Athapaskan neighbors. 15 While the precontact Tlingit religion might have included a vaguely defined concept of a supreme being or spirit, many of the modern-day elders firmly believe that such a notion existed and that their ancestors prayed to "Our Spirit Above," although only in times of great trouble rather than constantly, as Chris- tians do (for more details see de Laguna 1972: 8Iz-i6 and Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1990: z16, 438). i6 A few references in de Laguna's study of Yakutat support my findings. Her elderly informants, interviewed in the late I940S and the early I95os, spoke about a female shaman who predicted the coming of the Russians (de Laguna 1972: 713) and compared shamans' guardian spirits to angels or to the Holy Ghost (ibid.: 68z). 17 One very promising project is being carried out by two linguist-folklorists and speakers of the Tlingit language (one of whom is a Tlingit herself), Richard and Nora Marks Dauenhauer, who since the late I96os have been collecting, transcribing, translating, and analyzing Tlingit oral traditions. So far they have published two bilingual volumes (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1987, 1990) in a series that promises to include various other genres of Tlingit folklore. 384</page><page sequence="23">Shamanism and Christianity 385 References Archival Source Billman Collection.
