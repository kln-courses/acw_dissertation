Elton Institute for Educational Technology, University of Surrey 36 'The fact that the intelligence is not the subtlest, the most powerful and appropriate instrument for grasping the truth, is only one more reason for beginning with the intelligence, and not with an unconscious intuition, not with an unquestioned faith in presentiments. It is life which, little by little, case by case, allows us to notice what is most important for our heart, for our mind is taught us not by reasoning but by other powers. And then it is the intelli- gence itself which, acknowledging their superiority, abdicates, by reasoning, before them and accepts the role of becoming their collaborator and servant. Experimental faith'. Marcel Proust 1. Introduction In this paper I shall attempt to bring out some of the limi- tations under which we as educational researchers conduct our work, and question some largely unquestioned assump- tions in educational research. Much of it has been prompted by a most thought-provoking article1 to which I shall frequently refer. To illustrate how I intend to approach my task, I shall start with some questions relating to cause and effect. Wrigley exemplifies some of the pitfalls connected with these through the well-known story of the researcher who gave his subjects samples of (a) whisky and water, (b) brandy and water, (c) rum and water, and concluded that the intoxicating factor was water, the common element. He uses this story to indicate that it is possible to identify causes incorrectly. This is clearly true in that story, but when applied to educational research, I submit that the real pitfall in logic is to fail to question the assumption that there is a cause-effect relationship. In other words, in educa- tional research we should ask 'Is there a causal relationship?' before we ask 'What is the causal relationship?' Thus, it is a common experience, that we tend to learn better when we enjoy it. But do we enjoy it because we are learning better or do we learn better because we are enjoying it? Which is cause, which effect? Few would deny that the learning and the enjoying occur simultaneously and that neither precedes the other. In that case, while there clearly is a relationship between the two, it cannot be causal.2 3 I want to stress that I am not concerned here with spurious correlations,4 which Wrigley does treat, but with acceptedly non-spurious ones. Here Wrigley uses the contro- versy, which arose when a correlation was first established between smoking and lung cancer, to illustrate that the statistical evidence does not allow one to say which is the cause and which the effect, or indeed that both may not be effects of a common cause. The possibility that is not raised - and it would be exceedingly unlikely in the illustration quoted, but is likely in connection with the experience to which I have referred - is that there may be non-spurious correlations which cannot be interpreted in terms of cause and effect. I shall be concerned with considerations like the above, considerations which question normally unquestioned assumptions in research methodology and the criteria which I shall discuss will be intrinsic to the research. I say this because there are also extrinsic criteria, with which I shall not be concerned. They concern the value of the research and I might illustrate them by going back to Wrigley's story of the drunkard. The question raised there was what made him drunk, a question to be answered by a physiologist. To a sociologist, a more relevant question would be what made him drink it. Which questions in a given situation are the more valuable to ask is a problem that often faces educa- tional researchers. It is a problem that they ought to tackle before they consider the ones raised in this article. 2. Thematic models of scientific research It is always difficult to challenge implicitly agreed pre- suppositions and the assumption that scientific investiga- tions are based on cause-effect relationships is certainly one of these. I therefore turn to an idea proposed by Gerald Holton of themata in science. These must not be confused with Kuhn's concept of a paradigm, for while paradigms change, themata persist. Holton stresses6 'the antiquity and paucity of themes' and claims that 'over the centuries the number and kind of chief thematic elements have changed little'. He goes on to say that 'the - usually unacknowledged - presuppositions pervading the work of scientists have long included also the thematic couples of ... reductionism and holism, ... hierarchical structure and unity, the use of mechanisms versus teleological and anthropomorphic modes of approach'. Cause-effect relations are closely connected to the thema of hierarchical structures, and the wish to find them is certainly ancient7 - 'felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas'. What about the opposite half of this thematic couple, unity? Both themata were discussed by the stoics,8 who distinguished between 'the asymmetrical cause-effect relation and the symmetrical relation of mutual cause and interaction'. The essential pre-requisite for the existence of cause-effect relations has been very well formulated by Sambursky9 when he writes that 'the causal law in its strict sense can be applied only to systems which can be (nearly) isolated from the rest of the world and which can be sub- jected to recurrence, i.e. where the same constellation can be (nearly) restored'. It has been the great strength of physics that many of its systems have been of this kind, but what comes so clearly out of the '(nearly)' in Sambursky's formulation is that the isolation of such a system always involves an approximation and that our first task in a parti- cular investigation should always be to judge just how good this approximation is. If we look at the systems of physics from this point of view, we find broadly speaking the following categories in terms of a measured variable (the dependent variable) which depends on one or more variables which we can alter (the independent variables); (a) The independent variables do not depend on each other, in which case we can vary one without varying any of the others. This allows the classical research design of 'isolation of variables' and is the one where physics has had its greatest successes, e.g. quantum mechanics. Its mathematical expression is through linear differential equations. (b) The independent variables do depend on each other. Here the mathematical expression is through non- linear differential equations and physics has been much less successful, e.g. in hydrodynamics or meteorology. (c) All variables depend on each other, so that it is not possible to describe one as dependent on others. (d) A special case of (c) arises when it is possible to isolate '(nearly)' two such mutually dependent variables from all others, such as in the feedback systems that are common in electrical engineering. Of the above, only (a) and (b) can be interpreted in terms of cause and effect, and the distinction between them is based on how far we are able to isolate the variables from each other, even approximately. On the other hand, (c) and</page><page sequence="2">(d) are fundamentally different. In the language of the stoics we have here a 'symmetrical relation of mutual cause and interaction' and in modern times the importance of this was probably first realised by Saussure in his study of lin- guistics. He distinguishes10 between diachronic perspectives suitable for events which are separated in time, so that cause-effect relations can exist, and synchronic perspectives suitable for events which happen at the same time and affect each other mutually. The really crucial aspect was the realisation that here was a system, i.e. language, which obviously developed in time and yet could not be under- stood in terms of cause-effect relationships, but only in synchronic perspective. This paradox, that events which are contingent on history - as all events are - may require a non-historical analysis, needs further elucidation. A first rection could be that in that case there is no way in which one can make any predictions for the future, an essential pre-requisite for any scientific enquiry, but this fortunately is not so. What does happen is that present patterns probabilistically develop into future patterns, in the way that one weather chart leads to another. This is exactly one of those points where our normal scientific thought processes need a jolt. Cause and effect is not the only basis on which to make predictions. We find similar realisations that events may require a 'structural rather than causal explanation'11 elsewhere. Thus Leach12 writes of the anthropologist Levi-Strauss that in the latter's view 'the universals of human culture exist only at the level of structure, never at the level of manifest fact. We may usefully compare the patterning of relations which links together sets of human behaviours, but we shall not learn anything if we simply compare single cultural items as isolates'. Similar considerations underlie the idea of the 'unwritten laws' of a society, which are as old as Sophocles' Antigone,13 and the 'hidden curriculum' in education.14 They involve the basic premise that in synchronic perspective we have to study, not the facts, but the relations between the facts, and that any structure must be looked for in the pattern of these relations. Even in physics, these ideas have recently gained ground in terms of the so-called bootstrap theory of elementary particles and its possible relationship to Eastern philosophy.15, 16 3. The influence of physics on educational research Having got back to physics, I would like to analysu a little more closely the influence that ideas in physics have had and perhaps ought to have on educational research. The traditional view is well expressed by Kelvin, when he said: 17 'I often say that when you can measure what you are speak- ing about and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind'. However, the measurement of an event necessitates the isolation of the latter from others and its usefulness may further depend on the existence of a unified mathematical theory into which the numerical results of the measurement can be fitted. When such a theory does not exist, and18 'up to the present psychological theory has succeeded hardly at all in unifying itself by the use of colligating concepts, as physical theory did in the seventeenth century', then the danger of 'garbage in - garbage out' is very real, as Wrigley1 recognises. While views, such as those of Kelvin, have undoubtedly had considerable effect on research in the human sciences, the more recent influence of physicists has been of a quite different kind. Perhaps the first research contact between physics and education arose from a discussion between Einstein and Piaget19 on the development of a child's con- ception of time. This is significant in that Piaget's research has always been primarily qualitative and observational rather than psychometric. The importance of insightful observation, as opposed to measurement, has of course always been recognised in physics - one need only think of Rontgen's discovery of X-rays - and so it is not surprising that Piaget's work on the development of concept formation is now in turn beginning to influence physics teaching.20, 21 A fascinating sidelight on the interconnections between developments in thought is provided by the fact that the young Einstein in turn was strongly influenced by his head- master in Switzerland,22 Jost Winteler, who, with Saussure, was one of the founders of modern linguistics. A more recent and less exalted contact between physics and education is that between Parlett and King at M.I.T.23 during which Parlett developed the methods of illuminative evaluation, which again owe more to insightful observation than to measurement. On a more philosophical plane I would like to touch on two problems raised by Wrigley,1 those Qf 'false dichotomies' and of 'reification'. In physics there are indeed dichotomies, which at one time appeared irreconcilable, such as the wave or particle nature of light, but, following Bohr's Prin- ciple of Complementarity, we now interpret these as simpli- fied models of a more complicated reality, which are valid in restricted and mutually exclusive domains of investi- gation. Bohr always stressed that similar interpretations were likely to be valid in similar situations in the human sciences, and there is indeed evidence that his ideas were influenced by those of William James in psychology.24 Could such a situation occur when we investigate educa- tional reality through either psychometric or illuminative methods? If this is so, then the dichotomy is not false; it is real but resolvable in terms of complementarity. Turning to the reification of mental concepts, such as 'energy' or 'electron' in physics and 'human ability factors' or 'mental energy' in psychology, it is not helpful to label these 'as being only manners of speech, easy ways of putt- ing into comparatively concrete terms what are really very abstract ideas', as Godfrey Thomson is quotedI as having described them. The question is not whether they are real or abstract, but whether they are valid or invalid, i.e. whether they are accepted as in accordance with the general theory of the subject or not. For this we require firstly a general theory to exist, and we have already seen that this is apparently not the case in psychology, and secondly, if the theory exists, a procedure for acceptance. In natural science the latter is provided by the mechanism of what Ziman25 calls 'public knowledqe'. Finally, I would like to refer to a problem in statistics, also raised by Wrigley,1 namely that of the level of signi- ficance. If an experimental result is significant at the 10% level, then there is a 1 in 10 chance that it is spurious. If we consider the enormous number of experimental results reported at the 10% significance level in the psychometric literature, it is therefore effectively certain that many of them are spurious. In physics, this problem arose when cosmic rays were first observed in photographs and 'spurious coincidences' occurred. While it is obviously necessary to refine experimental procedures so as to decrease the probability that any result obtained is spurious, the real test that physicists apply is a non-statistical one. As Ziman26 says: 'The essential point is to think about and to investigate the actual mechanism of the connection (between two variables) ... The proper use of statistical methods is to test 37</page><page sequence="3">38 theoretical hypotheses, not to generate them out of the computer'. Here again, physics with its unified body of theory is of course in a much more favourable position than the human sciences, but his maxim still applies in the latter. 4. The language of the human sciences I now want to turn to the phrase 'up to the present' in the sentence in which Braithwaite18 referred to the absence of a unified psychological theory. The unification of physical theory undoubtedly came about through the power of mathematics. Not until it was possible to describe physical phenomena in mathematical terms, so that the logic inherent in mathematics could be employed, were huge generalisations like Newton's law of gravitation possible. It is not however at all obvious that the language and logic of mathematics is equally applicable to investigations in the human sciences. Another of Holton's thematic couples, reductionism and holism, may be valid here, for mathe- matics in its present form is essentially reductionist. If we are looking for a more holist language, in which perhaps to express the human sciences, we indeed may have to look no further than - language. It is therefore significant that Levi-Strauss derives his approach to anthropology from Saussure's work on language and assumes27 that 'other modes of cultural expression, such as kinship systems and folk taxonomies, are organised like human language'. Even if it should turn out that the proper mode in which to express the logic of the human sciences is through lan- guage and not through mathematics, this does not mean that mathematics would play no role in the human sciences. Just as we need language in order that we can use mathe- matics in the physical sciences, so we may need mathematics in order to use language appropriately in the human sciences. But these are speculations. 5. Relevance to educational research What is the relevance of all this for the practising educational researcher? Let us go back to Holton's thematic couples: (ai hierarchical structure - unity (b) reductionism - holism (c) mechanisms - technological and anthropo- morphic modes. Each represents a dichotomy of opposites which how- ever in Bohr's view are essential complementaries when applied to a research methodology. Being true opposites, and not merely the opposite ends of a continuous spectrum, they inevitably polarise their advocates unless they accept that reality is too complicated to fit either of the opposites wholly. Each sees one aspect of the reality, complementary to that of the other, and what he sees is predicated by the view point from which he observes. The choice between opposing methodologies is not therefore between right and wrong, but between appropriate and inappropriate. The crucial judgement that a researcher must make at the very beginning of his research is which methodology is appro- priate for the research which he wishes to pursue. If he chooses an inappropriate one, he will still get results - research is like that - but they will be meaningless. It is in this sense that we must interpet the plea28 that 'evaluation research need not be arbitrarily squeezed into unwitting presumptions derived from the classical experimental model' because 'programmes in the field cannot be treated, observed or measured in ways which artificially strip them from their context'. A guideline can be given to judge what is appropriate. It is contained in Sambursky's '(nearly)'. The more it is possible to isolate events from the rest of the world, the more appropriate are the themata listed in the left-hand column at the beginning of this section. In such cases we choose a research design which aims at discovering direct cause and effect relationships. At the opposite extreme, when it is not possible to isolate events, we find the right- hand column more appropriate and choose a research design which aims to find the underlying pattern in the relationships between events. Further, if my conjecture concerning language is correct, then the former research design requires us to express our thoughts in mathematical terms, while the latter requires us to express them in lan- guage terms. Considerations such as these may help us understand the cause of the often bemoaned gap between educational re- searchers and practising teachers. Researchers like to obtain precise results and this is normally only possible by simplify- ing situations to such an extent that events in them become isolated. This in turn is likely to reduce the relevance of the results to the needs of practising teachers. We have indeed here an uncertainty relation which states that the more precisely anything is known the less relevant it is and con- versely. I would conjecture that this may well be a funda- mental law of the social sciences and that we shall have to live with it until the day, if ever, that we have a unified theory of the social sciences. Let me finally illustrate the points made in this section through a simple example. At a recent conference, which I attended, someone again regretted the fact that so often in schools, teachers do not use overhead projectors, although they are available and research has shown that they can be helpful in teaching. Now teachers are not obtuse, and so the research which concentrated on the thing itself, had rationa- lised their failure in terms of a fear or dislike of gadgets Since their homes are full of gadgets - tape recorders washing machines, etc. - this is clearly absurd. Had research concentrated on the pattern, the classroom situa- tion, quite different considerations would have arisen, relat- ing for instance to discipline, lesson preparation and flexi- bility. These cannot be expressed in terms as 'hard' as the results of pre- and post-tests in parallel lessons with and without a projector, but they may be more relevant to the classroom. Conclusion The purpose of this article has not been to preach a counsel of despair, but to attempt to bring out the intrinsic limita- tions under which we as educational researchers conduct our work. This attempt has led me inevitably into philo- sophical and epistemological considerations in which I am far from expert, but they are considerations without which the results of our research lose much of their meaning. hope that others, more expert than myself, may take them further.
