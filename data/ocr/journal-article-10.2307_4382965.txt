<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art and Ideas IN GRADE school, children are traditionally introduced to homonyms, synonyms, and antonyms as if they were completely comparable categories. Same-sound, same-meaning, opposite-meaning: as if meanings could be paired with the same exactitude as sounds. Only later does one begin to realize that whereas "hear" and "here" can truly be said to be twins, "quick" and "fast" are only two among a whole family of minimally similar siblings-while "hot" is to "cold," not what negative three is to positive three, or north to south, but more what Alice's Through-the-Looking Glass world is to her home world: one of an infinite number of games played out on a mirror-image chessboard. For some reason, this discovery is easier to make about synonyms than it is about antonyms: we can accept the notion of many samenesses much more easily than we can the idea of many opposites. If your mind functions, as mine does, somewhat like a military strategist-by distinguishing among available alternatives, and then grouping these alternatives into appropriate categories-the refusal of opposites to align themselves neatly into rival armies can be quite frustrating. Our response to this potential for chaos is to allow certain things to become commonly accepted as the polarities; somebody does the sorting for us once, and we no longer bother to do it every time. One of the more long-standing polarities in the realm of creative endeavor is the distinction between "art for art's sake" and "art for a purpose." We have become so used to thinking of these as opposites that we no longer bother to set up the argument; we simply launch into it midstream, siding with Oscar Wilde on the one hand or Leon Trotsky on the other. There is no need for a scorecard in this game-we know all the players without being told, as formalism, aestheticism, and style obediently line up on one side, realism, moralism, and content on the other. But what if art-for-art's-sake and art-for-a-purpose are really on the same side? They both, after all, involve pursuit of a consciously held ideology; it is only the ideology itself that differs. The artist who fanatically sets out to paint a picture of nothing is in almost the same position as the man who is told: "Don't think of a purple cow"-the task, once conceived, is its own un- doing. Even Whistler, who elsewhere painted pictures so abstract they generated lawsuits, also painted his mother-an overdetermined subject if there ever was one. The artist of pure form and the artist of pure meaning (as if there could be such a thing as either one) must both be rigidly in control of their medium. Neither artist can allow the slightest whiff of that supposed opposite to enter his work-and hence he must work constantly with that op- posite in mind. Perhaps the real opposition, then, is between conscious art and un- conscious art-between the creations of an artist with theories and firm in- tentions, and the creations of someone who avoids conscious control. Think of rigid selectivity and pruned-down presentation on the one hand, and then of found art, free self-expression, and spontaneity on the other. Think of vulgar chaos versus mannered restraint, personality-all-over-the page versus complete abstraction, the-artist-as-child versus the-artist-as-mature- craftsman. In concrete terms, think of Andy Warhol's art and the prose of William Gass. Yet the minute we get into specifics, this distinction too breaks down. The great artists, like many of the not-so-great, are neither fully in control nor at the mercy of their art. Whereas most of us can keep one or at most two balls in the air, these artists are fantastic jugglers-with both the grace and the breathtaking clumsiness of W. C. Fields. Take Dickens, for example. The issue of control and intention is a fascinating one with him, because he wrote in a format (serial publication) and for an audience (mass market) that would seem to preclude acute atten- tion to form-and yet his sentences, besides being among the most beautiful ever written, occasionally collect into themselves crucial meanings that reverberate throughout and beyond the novels in which they are lodged. In Dombey and Son, for instance, Dickens says of the young hero (who is remembering the adventure in which he first met the heroine): "He pampered and cherished it in his memory, especially that part of it with which he had been associated, until it became the spoiled child of his fancy, and took its own way, and did what it liked with it." The sentence itself mimics the image it describes, sweeping Dickens along on the strength of its anthropomorphic "fancy"-and yet no sentence could be more clearly the product of the author who wrote it, more solidly the manifestation of his craft. To say that this art is either conscious or unconscious is merely foolish. And one wants, finally, to say the same thing about the issue of art and ideology, the degree to which art is either "for art's sake" or "for a purpose." It is simply not a fair question. At a recent reading of her work, the short-story writer and political activist Grace Paley was asked by a member of the audience: "How do you think your politics have influenced your writing, and vice versa?" "Well," she answered, chewing her gum thoughtfully, "the time I spend on politics takes away from the time I could be writing." Then she paused a little, and said: "And the time I spend writing takes away from the time I could be doing politics." Quite possibly that's about all that can be said.</page></plain_text>
