<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS HEYD Rock Art Aesthetics: Trace on Rock, Mark of Spirit, Window on Land The beauty and artistic quality of these drawings was probably not intended. ... Regardless of their prehistoric purpose, many panels are works of art. 1 After traveling three hundred kilometers, mostly on unsealed roads, northwest from Cairns in Northern Queensland, Australia, one arrives in Laura.2 In this interior, generally dry region, which all the same is home to beautiful tropical birds, such as kookaburras and black cockatoos, there are generous river valleys where number- less "flying foxes" (fruit bats) congregate and where several kinds of edible yams and various fruit-bearing trees can be found-if one knows where to look. Hidden under the valleys' cliff and large boulder overhangs there are shelters protecting from rain and sun richly expressive paintings and engravings. The area is known for its rock art images of spirit beings called "quinkans," but many other representations may also be discerned on the countless rock panels made by Aborigines until they were forced to take leave of their ancient ways by the European administrators of the land. Each rock art panel has its own character. In some, images of powerful women predominate; in oth- ers there are representations of death adders (a kind of poisonous snake); and in yet others, there are interconnected images of yams and men. The rock art of the Laura region has been the subject of significant research, including archae- ological excavations at selected sites.3 The aim of such research is "extracting information on prehistoric cultural systems."4 More specifically, an understanding is sought of the methods by which rock art was made, of the "chronological, geographical and structural patterning" exhib- ited, or of the "functional relationships [of rock art] with ideology, social organisation, economy and so on."'5 Such aims, of course, are reason- able goals for sciences such as archaeology and anthropology. In the process, however, very lit- tle is said about these marks from the point of view of aesthetics.6 In my experience rock art can be as aestheti- cally stimulating as works that have their roots in the art practices, conceptions, and conventions which, although they originated in modern Eu- rope, are now represented in most parts of the world (I call this the modern European art con- text).7 This seems to me a sufficient reason to pay more attention to specific aspects of rock art's aesthetics.8 In the following I begin by con- sidering the question of its art status. Next, I pro- ceed to discuss some of the features of impor- tance in the aesthetic appreciation of rock art. I close by proposing that rock art provides a deeply eloquent perspective on the continuity of art mak- ing among human beings, on the makers of rock art, and on the lands in which rock art is placed. I. ROCK ART AND "ART" Rock art can be found worldwide. It is located mostly under cliff overhangs and inside caves, but also on boulders and on ground-level rock The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 57:4 Fall 1999</page><page sequence="2">452 plates. Rock art is very diverse in character, rang- ing from simple scratch marks to elaborate painted arrangements combining anthropomorphic, zoo- morphic, and other types of marks into often- times highly engaging "wall-scapes." (Drawings or paintings located on nonportable rock surfaces usually are referred to as "pictographs," while nonmobile rock surfaces that have been pecked, scratched, or abraded generally are spoken of as "petroglyphs.") Some rock art panels likely date back 32,000 years (notably, the lately discovered Cave Chauvet, France), while others have been made as recently as the 1920s and 1930s.9 Al- though there are exceptions (for example, the con- temporary geoglyphs next to the coastal high- way on the island of Hawaii),10 the term "rock art" generally is reserved for pictographs and petroglyphs carried out outside the direct influ- ence of modem European societies. This distin- guishing fact about most rock art may prompt the question whether it is legitimate to call these cultural manifestations "art." It had formerly been assumed that even when artifacts resemble those that would qualify as art in modem societies of European culture, such items should instead be classed according to the function that they seemed to perform in their so- cieties of origin. The justification for this policy may have been that art making, like other sym- bolic activities, is highly dependent on concep- tual determinations. Paint dripped on a canvas by Jackson Pollock is a central part of his art making, while a similar action done by Leonardo da Vinci is not part of da Vinci's, since neither da Vinci nor his contemporaries would have un- derstood such activity as part of art making- even if we might find such drips of his aestheti- cally interesting. It may be argued a fortiori that rock art should not be classed as art because the ways of making and thinking of things that char- acterize art making for us are highly specific to us: only we can make art, it might be argued, because only we have the concepts requisite for making (what we think of as) art." The situa- tion may be compared to situations involving sacramental activities: although anyone can say the words corresponding to a marriage vow, the speaking of the words only counts as a genuine vow if the participants have a sufficient grasp of the concepts corresponding to the words spoken. Hence, on this view, even if a particular rock art panel contained the same visual information as The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism a certain piece by an artist from the modern Eu- ropean context, one should count only the lat- terl2 as art. Recently, thinking has changed in (at least parts of) the contemporary artworld on the question regarding artifacts from outside its own context. Traditional artl3 from small-scale societies, that is, art that is relatively free of the influences em- anating from modern Europe, formerly often housed in the ethnological wings of museums of natural history, is now increasingly being shown alongside modem European fine art or in newly established ethnic or area art museums.14 This change of attitude is given theoretical support, for example, by H. Gene Blocker. He argues that the "peoples who make and use such artifacts manifest enough of the relevant artistic and aes- thetic attitudes and dispositions to justify us in calling such artifacts 'works of art' and treating them as such."' 5 It seems that Blocker is arguing that the use of the appellation "art" should be controlled by more general criteria than those affixed by an object's affiliation to the art context set by the modern cultures rooted in Europe. So, on Blocker's view, even if in some traditional society people do not have our modern European concept of art be- cause they exist outside that context, if they dis- play attitudes relevantly similar to those that they would display if they had our concept of art, then they do have art. Blocker' s proposal, if suc- cessful, has the virtue common to good transla- tions, since on his account, we should be able to understand something that formerly was opaque to us (namely, why we may feel compelled to speak of art in the case of items from traditional societies). His proposal, of course, also runs the characteristic danger of translations, in that all translation obscures some of the specific features of the items translated. In so obscuring the orig- inal, it denatures and appropriates the original by equating it with something from one's own context, which may lead to the practical conse- quence that one may (mistakenly) feel thereby authorized to deal with this item in ways famil- iar to us. This seems to be something about which Larry Shiner, for example, has been concerned. Shiner argues that, since the conception "art" is a construction with its roots entirely in the modem European context, the application of this term to artifacts from other, very different, soci- eties issues in a form of cultural appropriation</page><page sequence="3">Heyd Rock Art Aesthetics: Trace on Rocks, Mark of Spirit Window on Land 453 through the deracination of objects made for other purposes and in other cultural settings. He ar- gues that bestowing the title "art" on such items is simply a ploy for our art institutions to main- tain control over the cultural margins. Shiner claims that, ultimately, through this strategy our art institutions seek to retain the power of mak- ing differentiations between "authentic," "fake," and "tourist art."'6 Whether translation and its correlative, inter- pretation, necessarily involve appropriation is a long-standing problem, of course, well rehearsed in the anthropological literature.'7 Without try- ing to do justice here to this involved subject, I would propose that the problematic aspects of translation and interpretation can largely be avoided by increasing the degree to which the items in question are described in their speci- ficity: the idea is to recover as much as possible the experience-loads that those items carried in their cultures of origin.'8 That is, I propose that we speak of art if some central aspects (such as artistic and aesthetic attitudes) constitutive of our concept of art are given, but to grant that, as such, our category will only provide a very imprecise understanding of objects originating in cultur- ally remote societies. When applied to rock art, this analysis means that, on the basis of the struc- tural demands of making paintings and engrav- ings (which require, for example, artistic and aesthetic judgment), one may argue that much rock art making likely was accompanied by the relevant attitudes, and hence, prima facie, should count as art. In order to avoid merely identifying rock art with our categories, and thereby evacu- ating it of its particular aesthetic meanings, at- tention must be paid to the specific features ap- preciable in rock art. II. AESTHETIC APPRECIATION: INTEGRITY, IDENTITY, CONDITIONS What is relevant to the aesthetic appreciation of rock art? Following the model sketched above, it may be adequate to begin by applying the cate- gories from our own cultural milieu that seem relevant. So, in the case of pictographs and pet- roglyphs, one would attend to the quality of the lines, the combination of colors, the composi- tion, the stories apparently told, the relation of parts to wholes, and so on. The special charac- teristics of rock art, however, quickly may lead to certain fundamental queries. One may won- der, for example, whether pictographs and pet- roglyphs have the integrity that we expect in au- tonomous artworks, given that often it is quite unclear where a particular painting or engrav- ing begins or ends. That is, if one has a large rock wall covered with marks, should one think of each discernible image as an independent unit, or should all of the images together be seen as one composition?' Moreover, should one even think of some (or all) of the unmarked rock sur- face as part of the unit to be appreciated aes- thetically? These may seem difficult problems, but we can, in fact, take advice from artworks of the modern European context. Painters since the Middle Ages, for example, have made triptychs and diptychs. There are no hard and fast rules about whether the parts of such works are to be appreciated as independent units or as parts mak- ing up a whole; rather, one feels at liberty to move back and forth from one kind of appreciation to the other. Similarly, in appreciating a rock art panel we may move from appreciating each of the discernible marks to the appreciation of groups of marks and of whole panels. With regard to whether any part of the unmarked rock wall should be considered, we may note that contem- porary painters and sculptors have sometimes left unmarked some of the surface (canvas, stone, etc.) on which they worked. Such unmarked surfaces have then been offered for aesthetic appreciation in their relation to the marked surfaces. It would seem that we may do the same with regard to rock art. One may also wonder whether individual art- works can be identified if a rock art panel has gone through accretions and deletions as a result of over-painting or over-engraving. Such changes would seem to jeopardize the identity of the original work(s) present.20 One need not, how- ever, suppose that the work status of a rock art panel is undermined by such multiplicity of in- terventions. Such panels would seem to function as palimpsests, that is, as pieces with multiple authors, each of whom builds on the contribu- tion(s) of her or his predecessor(s).2l Consequently, if one can tell which marks are superimposed on which others, one may judge each layer for its relationship with earlier marks. In other words, a single rock wall space may integrate several compositions, each one of which can be consid-</page><page sequence="4">454 ered on its own merits, where one of the merits consists in the skillful integration of new marks with previously existing ones. The resulting pa- limpsest is a kind of multiauthored collage of the type that we also find in the accretion of buildings in old parts of certain cities; despite their multiple architectural authors acting across a span of time, such urban quarters can have an aesthetic identity as wholes, while their parts can be of significant aesthetic interest as inde- pendent units as well. In the case of petroglyphs and pictographs, a number of additional questions may arise re- garding the aspects relevant in their apprecia- tion. Here I propose to take a hint from Paul Ziff, who, in his discussion of what makes something a fit object of aesthetic attention, claims that items "such as paintings and pieces of sculpture are best thought of as scores awaiting realiza- tion in actual performance."22 Ziff s idea is that, while anything viewed may be appreciated aes- thetically, all things have their conditions. For example, aesthetic appreciation even of master- piece paintings may fail if viewing is to take place in the dark or by a blind person, while musical pieces, in contrast, may perhaps be appreciated as much (or even more fully) without illumina- tion or by nonsighted persons. With respect to rock art, one would like to know what the essential conditions are for the "performances" of the "scores" presented so that one does not fail to attend to the relevant aspects. So, we might ask, is knowledge of the makers' ideas relevant for the appreciation of pictographs or petroglyphs? Should the fact that rock art is made on rock be considered? Should the relation of the panel to the surroundings be noted? In an- swer to these questions I propose that one choose a broad approach that takes into account as aes- thetically significant more rather than fewer of the perceivable aspects. I advocate this approach based on the assumption that if some perceiv- able aspect of a work may be the result of a choice on the part of its makers then the onus to show that the aspect in question is not aestheti- cally significant is on us. I believe that the result of my approach is to widen and, thereby likely to deepen, our appreciation. One's appreciation of a particular panel may be increased, for example, if one has the guid- ance of consultants from the makers' society or The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism ethnographic records. Such accounts may be use- ful in figuring out where to look and how to come up with certain meaningful ways of read- ing complex images that one otherwise would fail to appreciate in this way. Moreover, since rock art seems to achieve its effectiveness par- tially through the stability and durability of rock-which proposes its shape, hardness, color, grain, and even its sonority23 to the aesthetic appreciator-the fact that rock art is made on rock seems quite relevant. That is, given the avail- ability of various other surfaces, both stationary, such as tree trunks (usable for dendroglyphs) or sandy areas (usable for sand sculptures), and mobile materials such as wood, stone, animal hides, and cloth (exemplified in portable art), the presence of rock art on a particular surface has determinate contrastive aesthetic value. Each rock art site also constitutes a very par- ticular perspective, or window, on the surround- ing land. My experience in the Laura region is that some panels are only viewable lying down inside narrow cracks under potentially crushing rock slabs. Other sites (for example, in the Lake of the Woods area in Ontario, Canada) may only be viewed properly from watercraft on rivers and lakes. Much in contrast to portable art (encom- passing most paintings and sculptures), rock art is in a place.24 Portable art, as displayed in mu- seums and galleries of contemporary art, is sup- posed to be autonomous; its aesthetic values are assumed to be retrievable independently, regard- less of the place where the items are displayed. Consequently, art museums and galleries tend to be places that neutralize the surroundings, so that the rooms in the New South Wales Art Gallery are- not much different from the rooms in the Vancouver Art Gallery in their effect on the aes- thetic appreciation of an Anselm Kiefer or a Vermeer painting. Rock art, however, is utterly dependent on, and hence in dialogue with, the place it is in, since it cannot be moved without altering its nature. Therefore, the particular sur- roundings of rock art panels seem quite relevant to their aesthetic appreciation. One may ask, however, whether for us aes- thetically attending to rock art, which after all is directed at people from cultures very different from ours, must merely be a form of superficial "cultural tourism." That is, what significance can rock art have for us?</page><page sequence="5">Heyd Rock Art Aesthetics: Trace on Rocks, Mark of Spirit Window on Land 455 III. SIGNIFICANCE: ART, EARLIER SOJOURNERS, LAND Although one should not expect individuals from the modern European context to recover exactly the meanings perceived in rock art by its mak- ers,25 nonetheless many people who travel to rock art sites note that their visits were mean- ingful to them. We may consider, for example, the following poem, which reflects the expen- ence of a recent nonindigenous visitor to an Australian rock art site. "Red Hands" If I painted red ochre on my own hand and placed it on a rock before me, could I partake of the ancient mystery I am beckoned to from the stone? Could I stand serious while I scraped and mixed dusty smelling rock into red paint with my spit or with water I carried sweaty and bloody from the grass cuts up the ridge? When I painted it on, one finger smoothing it onto the other hand, and stretched my hand out in front of me to press it on the rock, would I understand the voices expressed by a single red gesture? And could I see them living? Or would I simply be placing my hand on a piece of rock, here, above the silver, whispering gum trees.26 This poem exquisitely combines attention to the trace of physical activity, to its probable im- portance as a representation of the makers' be- liefs, and to its rootedness in a particular place in the land, while also showing sensitivity to the danger of cultural intrusiveness entailed through overinterpretation. It emblematically points to the significance that rock art can have for us in terms of an experiential understanding of the long an- cestry of art making in human existence, of the life-world of earlier sojourners in the land, and of the land itself, which remains as an enduring backdrop to human activity. "Red Hands" is about a rock art site in the Laura region. One occasionally sees "positive" images of hands, such as those described here, even though much more common are stencil, or "negative," images of hands, produced by blow- ing pigment, such as red ochre, mingled with a solvent, such as water, onto one's hands placed on a rock wall. Such hand images may be found singly or in multiples, sometimes covering rock walls in their entirety; they tend to be aestheti- cally attractive, and, despite their simplicity, even beautiful. The existence of simple imagery, such as the representation of hands, next to more elaborate representations of emus, kangaroos, flying foxes, and human beings makes it apparent that, at least occasionally, rock art was made by the rel- atively unskilled. (From the size of some of the hand representations, it is evident that even chil- dren made them at times.) When one also takes into account that going back as far as 32,000 years one can find extremely accomplished represen- tations of animals, painted even with a certain sense of perspective (as in Cave Chauvet), it seems that, rather than unidirectional progression from simple to complex, art making that exhibits a great range of skill characterizes the human con- dition for a much greater period than we may have thought possible.27 In other words, rock art provides firsthand, experiential evidence for the view that there may be an underlying fundamen- tal continuity across time and space in human- ity's capacity for exhibiting artistic and aesthetic attitudes and dispositions.28 Along with natural markers in the landscape, rock art constitutes a memory tablet for the itinerant.29 In contrast with its natural counter- parts, however, rock art sites are clear reminders that certain stretches of land are "permeated by meanings."30 This becomes very clear to the city dweller who arrives in a place like the Aus- tralian "bush." While the land at first looks much the same over great distances, its various parts may quickly gain particular identities after one learns of the rock art sites that are to be found there. By pointing out the fact that human be- ings stopped long enough at a certain place to make rock art, such sites estrange the land.3' We may think here of other aesthetic interven- tions in the land, such as Christo's wrapped coastlines and islands; without turning the land into an artifact (as agriculture or mining does),</page><page sequence="6">456 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism rock art transforms land into landscape, that is, into "a terrain in which cultural features have," at least partially, "taken the place of those nat- ural elements that map the world of mobile peo- ples."32 The transformation of land into landscape ef- fected through rock art calls to mind that rock art is a mark of spirit. Although radically in- complete (since we lack most of the cultural context of their makers), if considered as "scores awaiting realization in actual performance," the marks on rock reveal, at least in part, their mak- ers' gestures. That is, we are provided with traces of the spirit of earlier sojourners of the land who rested long enough in the vicinity to make paint- ings and engravings on rock. Ultimately, the aes- thetic appreciation of rock art may lead us to a sympathetic understanding of the indigenous women and men who created it. After the transformation of land into landscape through the presence of rock art, land may not be seen as wholly alien or as mere resource any- more. By intimating that the land has been seen as home before, rock art returns our gaze to the landscape, inviting its aesthetic appreciation in turn.33 Insofar as rock art is in the land, its pres- ence makes the land resonate with it: the beauty of the traces on rock recalls the beauty of the land.

I use the terms "modem European" in the manner that "Western" is frequently used, but I prefer the prior terms be- cause they are specific in their reference to a period and a source of influence in a way that the relative spatial-orientation term "Western" cannot be. 8. My proposal to consider rock art from the point of view of aesthetics peripherally touches the debate in anthropol- ogy regarding "art for art's sake" in Paleolithic art. That de- bate concerned the question whether "Palaeolithic [human beings] were artists simply because they appreciated beauti- ful things, and that therefore their artistic work had no spe- cial functional aim." Peter J. Ucko and Andr6e Rosenfeld, "Critical Analysis of Interpretations, and Conclusions and Problems from Palaeolithic Cave Art," in Anthropology and Art: Readings in Cross-cultural Aesthetics, ed. Charlotte M. Otten (Garden City, NY: Natural History Press, 1971), p. 252. Among anthropologists this point of view was re- jected "early on" (p. 252), although Ucko and Rosenfeld argue that aesthetic pleasure may well have been the motive for some types of parietal art (p. 281). See also John Halver- son, "Art for Art's Sake in the Paleolithic," CurrentAnthro- pology 28 (1987): 63-89, for a recent revival of the "art for art's sake" thesis. It seems to me that even if Paleolithic art had other than aesthetic functions, this does not mean that "what matters then is not whether the sculpture or painting is beautiful by our standards," as E. H. Gombrich claims in The Story of Art (Oxford: Phaidon, 1984), p. 23. Rather, my view is that, independent of the particular motivations for the production of rock art, it is legitimate for us to take an interest in rock art from the point of view of aesthetics, be- cause it is legitimate to take such interest in any object or ac- tivity if we find it aesthetically stimulating. For a developed defense of this -view see Katya Mandoki, Prosaica: Intro- duccion a la Estftica de lo Cotidiano (Mexico: Grijalbo, 1994). 9. See, e.g., Ken Mulvaney, "What to Do on a Rainy Day: Reminiscences of Mirriuwung and Gadjerong Artists," Rock Art Research 13 (1996): 3-20. Although there may be important differences between Paleolithic and later rock art (as argued by Ucko and Rosenfeld, for example), and be- tween rock art from one location and another, I do not dis- cuss rock art in terms of those distinctions because my in- terest is in aspects of its aesthetics of relevance across time and space. 10. See Clement W. Meighan, "Human Nature and Rock Art Production," RockArt Research 13 (1996): 68. The term</page><page sequence="7">Heyd Rock Art Aesthetics: Trace on Rocks, Mark of Spirit Window on Land 457 "geoglyphs" refers to rock arrangements placed on rock sur- faces. 11. This, for example, seems to be the upshot of Jerrold Levinson's "intentional-historical characterization of art- making." He argues that "if another culture has art, it must have art in our sense, more or less." See "Extending Art His- torically" in his The Pleasures ofAesthetics: Philosophical Es- says (Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 154. Although he is willing to grant that we may speak of art "in culturally remote (including temporally remote, e.g., prehistoric) contexts" (p. 154), on his view this is justified only because those cultural manifestations are either progenitors of our artworks or be- cause they were aimed "at the same kinds of reception or ex- periencing normative for later art" (pp. 168-169). 12. The institutional theory of art (see George Dickie, "The New Institutional Theory of Art," and Arthur Danto, "The Artistic Enfranchisement of Real Objects: The Art- world," both in Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology, ed. George Dickie, Richard Sclafani, and Ronald Roblin [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1989], pp. 171-182 and pp. 196-205, re- spectively) also supports this kind of judgment, since ac- cording to this theory, art requires the existence of appropri- ate institutions, including artists, art-appreciating people, and so on. Quite likely one or another (if not all) of the req- uisite features would be missing in the case of rock art, since the institutions required are those common to the modern European artworld. 13. I prefer the expression "traditional art" for objects from traditional, small-scale societies that in the literature have been referred to by a variety of terms, including "prim- itive art"' (see H. Gene Blocker, The Aesthetics of Primitive Art [Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1994]) and "tribal art" (see Denis Dutton, "Tribal Art and Artifact," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 51 [1993]: 13-22), because "traditional art" probably is the least loaded in meaning and most descriptive in effect. 14. See, for example, Eleanor Heartney, "Recontextualiz- ing African Altars," Art in America 82 (1994): 58-65, which discusses a recent traveling show organized by the Museum for African Art. 15.

See, e.g., James Clifford, "Histories of the Tribal and the Modem," in his The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth- Century Ethnography Literature, and Art (Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1988), pp. 189-214. 18. Also see Kendall L. Walton, "Categories of Art," Philosophical Review 49 (1970): 337. He argues that "(some) facts about the origins of works of art have an essential role in criticism, that aesthetic judgments rest on them in an ab- solutely fundamental way." Knowing the originary context of candidate artworks becomes problematic in a special sense when we come to think of the "beginning of art"; pre- sumably there must be nonart objects that differ only slightly from the first work of art, and one may wonder how this difference is to be defined (see Levinson, and see Whit- ney Davis, "Beginning the History of Art," The Journal of Aesthetics andArt Criticism 51 [1993]: 327-350, for discus- sion). I think that the correct way out of this problem is pointed at by Davis when he claims that we assign art status to Paleolithic art like the Lascaux paintings "retrochrono- logically" (p. 346) through a kind of "delayed activation" (p. 329). This seems to suggest that our procedure is to apply the term "art" provisionally to certain candidate items and, once we have the specifics of each item's context, decide whether we should repeal the designation or, alternatively, expand the concept "art" to keep the item in question within the category. (This account of how we proceed may be de- scribed as indebted to Wittgenstein's idea of family resem- blances or to Quine's notion of interdependence of beliefs.) 19. See Halverson, and Paul G. Bahn in his commentary on Halverson (included in Halverson's "Art for Art's Sake in the Paleolithic," p. 73), on the appropriateness of suppos- ing there to be composition in rock art panels. 20. The problem posed here seems similar to the classical problem posed for personal identity, given changes in a per- son's character and the loss and gain of memories over time. 21. Cf. Davis, "Beginning the History of Art," p. 338. 22. Paul Ziff, "Anything Viewed," in his Antiaesthetics: An Appreciation of the Cow with the Subtile Nose (Dor- drecht: D. Reidel, 1984), p. 134. 23. See Steven J. Waller, "Sound Reflection as an Expla- nation for the Content and Context of Rock Art," Rock Art Research 10 (1993): 91-101. 24. Notably, most contemporary earthworks and land art similarly depend on their particular location. The affinity in this respect between contemporary earthworks/land art and rock art has been noted by a number of authors, e.g., John Beardsley, Earthworks and Beyond: Contemporary Art in the Landscape (New York: Abbeville Press, 1984), p. 8; and Lucy R. Lippard, Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art of Prehistory (New York: Pantheon, 1983). One may want to include in the category of environment-dependent art cer- tain, though by no means all, architectural works, since many belonging to the modernist tradition were intended to be au- tonomous. 25. Denis Dutton makes the case that, in contrast to the situation with regard to contemporary conceptual art, the re- covery of the meanings of traditional art objects is not merely a matter of having appropriate concepts for their in- terpretation; rather, "the actual constituting interpretations of tribal artists normally entail perceptual distinctions," in "Tribal Art and Artifact," p. 20. Hence he concludes that, given sufficient knowledge of the cultural context of tradi- tional art objects, their distinctive meanings can be found in the "aesthetic qualities which have intentionally been placed in the objects to be seen," ibid. (Also see Walton, "Cate- gories of Art," pp. 366-367, who argues that "perceiving a work in a certain category or set of categories is a skill that must be acquired by training.") The trouble with most rock art is, of course, that we generally lack sufficient knowledge of its cultural context to "read out" the meanings that it may be intended to convey. 26.
