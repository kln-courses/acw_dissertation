<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS SCIENCE AND PERSONS I PROFESSOR Polanyi's Gifford Lectures' for 1951-52 form an extremely interesting and learned book which covers a great deal of ground-science, politics, law, art, philosophy, and religion-all are involved to various extents. But it is an extremely difficult book to review for a number of reasons. First, because it attempts to face up to difficulties wluch works on the philosophy of science often seek to avoid. These difficulties are all connected with the fact that persons are involved in the making of science and also enter into the subject-matter of some of its branches. The process of personification-applied even to inammate objects-which was so prevalent in the ancient world, obviously had to be abandoned if physical science was to develop. A tradition was thus established which has persisted even up to the time of the rise of a science of persons, so that it is perfectly legitimate to be ornithomorphic in studying persons if you find observations on sea- gulls helpful; but it is quite heretical to be anthropomorphic, even when you are studying davOpwrros himself. The upshot of all this is that if we want to know what other people think about persons it is not to science but to literature that we must go. It is also customary to abstract from the fact of participation of persons in science, even when we are discussing the philosophy of science. It is becoming recogmsed, nevertheless, that a three-termed relation is involved in the pursuit of science, the three domains of whuch are: (i) persons; (ii) language used by persons; (iii) the subject-matter to which the language refers. If we abstract from the first and third we are said to be talking syntax-we are dealing only with the language, without reference to the persons using it or to the subjecct-matter referred to. If we ignore persons and deal with the language in its relation to subject-matter then we are pursuing semantics; and if we take into account the rble of persons then we are engaged in pragmatics. So far pragmatics seems to be the least studied of these topics, and also to be dominated largely by the behaviouristic attitude which itself m effect abstracts from persons as such. It will be seen, therefore, that Polanyl, in not availing himself of the custo- mary methods of avoiding the notion of person, has set lumself a very difficult task. A second feature of this book which creates difficulties for the reviewer is the method of presentation, which is intuitive rather than xPcrsonal Knowledge Towards a post-critical philosophy By Michael Polanyl.

Sometimes highly debatable assertions are made with little or no preparation, such as: ' tautologies are necessarily true, but mathematics is not ' (p. 187) or ' we are jointly aware of the retinal image and of the adaptive effort ' [of accommodation] (p. 362); or' we shall see that biology is an expansion of the theory of knowledge into a theory of all kinds of biotic acluevements '(p. 347). Such an assertion may then be succeeded by another statement wluch is said to follow from the former one, although the con- nection between the two statements is not always clear (at least to one dull- witted reviewer) and the following of one from the other far from obvious. Thirdly, the author uses a somewhat unusual vocabulary. For example, abundant use is made of the following words: artlculaton (not in the anatormcal sense); achievement (not in the heraldic sense); coefficient (not in the mathematical sense); convivial (not in the dictionary sense); comprehension, comrmtment, fiduciary, focal observaton, subsidiary awareness, passion and passionate, rational (in several senses). These are all key words, essential to the understanding of the book; but the reader is not in all cases told in what senses they are used. It is hoped therefore that the following notes may be helpful. There is a good index and a dictionary is useful but not in every case. For example, according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary the word convivial means 'of or belonging to a feast or banquet, festive; fond of feasting and good company, jovial,' (as we should expect from the meaning of the Latin word convivium). But Polanyi does not use it in this sense at all. In the section enttled ' Pure Conviviality' of the chapter headed ' Conviviality' we are told nothing about feasts or banquets, but on page 209 we read of' the primitive senti- ments of fellowship that exist previous to articulation among all groups of men and even among animals. Evidence of the primordial character of such conviviality and of the lively emotions engendered and gratified by its interplay is supplied by the experience both of ammals and men.' Also on the same page we learn that 'a newly hatched chicken soon learns to join the flock around its mother and to seek protection under her wings '. On the next page we are renunded that ' The comprehensive scope of con- vivial relations has been expressed by K6hler in the aphorism that a solitary chimpanzee is not a chimpanzee', and that 'Compamonshlp among men is often sustained and enjoyed in silence '. The author thus appears to have generalised the dictionary meamng of' convivial' by not restricting it to feastmg. He is using it in contrast to ' objective ' in one sense of this word. Our attitude towards our fellow creatures is objective in this sense if It is that of a detached observer, outside the system (whlch includes those fellow creatures) under observation but having no part m it; and it is convivial if it is one of fellowship with them, accompamed by a feeling of' being in it together '. The word commitment is used in the dictionary sense of' engagement 66</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS that restricts freedom of action '. Thus the author speaks of his ' commit- ment to personal knowledge' (p. 327) distinguislung between ' the personal in us, which actvely enters into our commitments, and our subjective states, in which we merely endure our feelings. This distmcuon establishes the conception of the personal, which is neither subjective nor objective. In so far as the personal subrmts to requirements acknowledged by itself as independent of itself, it is not subjective; but in so far as it is an acton guided by individual passions, it is not objective either. It transcends the distmction between subjectve and objectve' (p. 300). On page 363 we see how widely this notion also is generalised: '. . . biology has been revealed as an appreciaton of commitment. To swallow something in the hope that it may be wholesome is clearly a commitment, and so is every act of seeing things in one particular way. I have suggested . . . that . . . com- mitment may be acknowledged even at the vegetative level, since it is of the essence of a living organism that each part relies for its function on the presence and proper functoning of a number of other parts Comminutment may then be graded by steps of increasing consciousness; namely, from primordial, vegetative commitment of a centre of being, function and growth, to primitive commitment of the actve-perceptive centre, and hence . . . to responsible comminutments of the consciously deliberating person. . . . Biology is a responsible commnutment which appraises other commitments.' The chapter headed 'The Logic of Achievement' covers such diverse topics as the distinction between right and wrong working of a machine or the organs of an animal's body; between causes and reasons; between logic and psychology; originality in animals; equipotentiality in embryos; and (strangely enough) logical levels in the sense of the distinction between science and metascience. The use of the word achievement is illustrated by the following passage on page 357: . I have distinguished two kinds of biological achievements, namely, (1) achievements performed by the rational concurrence of several parts with fixed functions and (2) achievements performed by the equipotential interplay of all parts of a system. . . . Embryogenesis appears to be a comprehensive achievement due to the rational combmation of these two types of rational principles. The analysis of the process by which living beings are formed corresponds to the logic of achievement, as illustrated by the manner in which we find out how a machine works.. The meaning of experimental embryology Is thus dependent on personal knowledge: both m respect of the unspecifiable knowledge of true shapes, and m respect of the appreciation of the process by which highly significant shapes and structures are brought into existence. This situation has caused uneasiness among scienntists. 67</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS The word articulate is used in the sense in which it is used by Edward Fitzgerald in And, strange to tell, among the Earthen Lot Some could arnculate, while others not. The chapter headed ' Artculation' begins with the types of learning in arumals, passes on to the use and abuse of language m human relations and ends with a section on mathematical heunstics. There is an error on page 86 in this chapter. Instead of saying: ' the infinite set X counts all numbers ' it would be more correct to say: ' Xo is the cardinal number of the set of all natural numbers' ('all numbers' would include real and complex numbers); and 'next larger infinite set' is meaningless; what is meant is 'next larger cardinal number'. Also X, enumerates the set of all real functions of a real variable, but the set of all curves has cardinal N,. The ways in which some of the other words mentioned above are used may be illustrated by the following, from the Preface: I regard knowing as an active comprehension of the things known, an action that requires skill. Skilful knowing and doing is performed by subordinating a set of particulars, as clues or tools, to the shaping of a skilful achievement, whether practical or theoretical. We may then be said to become ' subsidiarily aware ' of these particulars within our ' focal awareness ' of the coherent entity that we achieve. Clues and tools are things used as such and not observed m themselves. They are made to function as extensions of our bodily equipment and this mvolves a certain change m our own being. Acts of comprehension are to this extent irreversible and also non-cntical. For we cannot possess any fixed framework with which the re-shaping of our hitherto fixed framework could be critically tested. Personal knowledge is an mtellectual commitment, and as such inherently hazardous. Only affirmations that could be false can be said to convey objectve knowledge of this kind. I have shown that into every act of knowing there enters a passionate con- tribution of the person knowing what is bemg known, and that this coefficient is no mere imperfecuon but a vital component of his knowledge. The word 'fiduciary' seems to be used in the sense given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, ' of the nature of, proceeding from, or founded on trust or confidence'. As examples of its use we may quote: The fiduciary passions which induce a confident utterance about the facts are personal, because they submit to the facts as universally valid, but when we reflect on this act non- commitally its passion is reduced to subjectivity (p. 303). A fiduciary philosophy does not eliminate doubt, but (like Chnstanity) says that we should hold on to what we truly believe, even when realizing the absurdly remote chances of tdus enterprise, trusting the unfathomable ntimatnons that call upon us to do so (p. 318). Throughout the book the author seems to be haunted by the rival claims of belief and doubt and by the inescapability of both. On page o109 68</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS he says: 'I am attempting to resolve by conceptual reform the apparent self-contradiction entailed in believing what I might conceivably doubt.' The author is opposed to positivistic and utilitarian attitudes towards science while criticisng also what he calls Objectivism. What he means by this may perhaps be gathered from the following passage on page 16 modem man has set up as the ideal of knowledge the conception of natural science as a set of statements which is ' objective ' m the sense that its substance Is entirely determined by observation, even while its presentation may be shaped by convention. This conception, stemming from a craving rooted in the very depths of our culture, would be shattered if the intuition of rationality m nature had to be acknowledged as a justifiable and indeed essential part of scientific theory. That is why scientific theory is represented as a mere economical description of facts; or as embodying a conventional policy for drawing empirical inferences; or as a working hypothesis, suited to man's practical convemnience- mterpretations that all deliberately overlook the rational core of science. On the next page the author speaks of the ' indispensable intellectual powers and their passionate participation in the act of knowing. It is to these powers and to this participation that I am referring in the title of this book as " Personal Knowledge ".' He has already given hints of his own attitude. To say that the discovery of objectve truth m science consists in the apprehension of a rationality which commands our respect and arouses our contemplative admiration, that such discovery, while using the experience of our senses as clues, transcends this experience by embracing the vision of a reality beyond the impressions of our senses, a vision which speaks for itself in guiding us to an ever deeper understanding of reality-such an account of scientific procedure would be generally shrugged aside as out-dated Platonism: a piece of mystery-mon- germg unworthy of an enlightened age (p. 5). by this time it should be clear how far-reaching are m my own opinion the changes in outlook that are required in order to establish a stable alternative to the objectivist position. I cannot hope to do more m this book than to exhibit a possibility which like-minded people may wish to explore. I shall go on, therefore, to repeat my fundamental belief that, m spite of the hazards involved, I am called upon to search for the truth and state my findings (p. 315). But is not the search for truth in natural science a search in which we never know when we have caught up with our quarry? We do not know which of our current beliefs are true because we do not know what discoveries the future may have m store for us which will require their revision. Is not this the reason why we must be content with belief? On page 313 Polanyi says: Only an activity can go wrong, and all activity Incurs the risk of failure. To believe something is a mental act: you can ncither believe nor disbelieve a passive experience. It follows that you can only believe something that rmght be false. This is my argument in a nutshell; I shall now elaborate it m some detail. 69</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS But in the course of this elaboration we are presented, on page 315, with the following statements which seem (to the present reviewer) to throw the matter into complete confusion: Therefore, though every person may believe something different to be true, there is only one truth. Thius can be substantiated as follows. The function of the word 'true' is to complete such utterances as '"p" is true', wluch are equivalent to an act of assent of the form ' I believe p '. [On the next page we are told that] ' The concept of comminutment postulates that there is no difference, except in emphasis, between saying 'I believe p' or ' " p " is true'. Both utterances emphatically put into words that I am confidently asserting p as a fact. This is something I am doing m the act of uttering the words m question, and is quite different from my reporting that I have done this m the past, or that somebody else has either done tlus or is doing it now. If I report " I believed p" or " X believes p ", I am not comnuttming myself m respect to p and hence no utterance linking "p " to " true " corresponds to these reports; they issue in no assertion of the sentence p as true, be it m relation to my own past or to other people's beliefs. There remains therefore only one truth to speak about. Polanyi has much to say about the Laplacean intelligence which ' would embrace in the same formula the movements of the largest bodies m the umverse and those of the lightest atom'. His remarks about ' the menace to all cultural values, including those of science, by an acceptance of a con- ception of man derived from a Laplacean ideal of knowledge and by the conduct of human affairs m the light of such a conception' recall what I. D. Suttle wrote about the taboo on tenderness m The Origins of Love and Hate and what Aldous Huxley says about organised lovelessness in The Perennial Philosophy. The last of the four parts into which Polanyi's book is divided is cluefly devoted to problems of biology and biological methodology. The notion of person was eliminated from physical thinking at an early stage; how far .t, in one form or another, should be retamined in biology has been a matter of heated debate for centuries. For a long time orthodoxy m biology has required close adherence to the example of physics both in method and in explanatory hypotheses. It has been much easier to follow a successful model and to borrow ready made hypotheses than to invent new ones suggested by the observed subject-matter. No alternative to this procedure in biology has so far had a sufficiently spectacular success to persuade biolo- gists to follow it. On all these topics Polanyi makes Interesting suggestions. His book is a challenge to orthodoxy In many fields. We may conclude with his own statement of the aim of his book which is given on page 381: Its aim is to re-equip men with the faculties which centuries of critical thought have taught them to distrust. The reader has been mvited to use these faculties and contemplate thus a picture of things restored to their fairly obvious nature. This is all the book was meant to do. For once men have been made to realise 70</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS the crippling mutilations imposed by an objectivist framework many fresh minds will turn to the task of reinterpreting the world as it is, and as it then once more will be seen to be. But will our politicians with their dangling deterrents and misguided numissiles-themselves among the products of the objectivist framework-give us time in which to use these faculties? J. H.
