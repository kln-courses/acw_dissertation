<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poet: Julius Caesar and the Democracy to Come Nicholas Royle You have to let yourself be charged', as they say in English.1 How are we to murder the poet today? Tear him to pieces? 'Today : what a word, already in pieces. 'To': to day. 'Today , that is to say this, now, these present times', this 'today that is a double word, prepositionally a bit mad, touched by 'to' as towards, in the direction of, as far as, until, at, for, of, before, before the hour of, this 'today is perhaps not yet. What is the place, if there is one, of this 'to'? What is this 'to' that marks time, in English, from Shakespeare to this day? How to hear W in the democracy to come? In question is 'something that remains to be thought', Jacques Derrida declares, 'not something that is certain to happen tomorrow, not the democracy (national or interna- tional, state or trans-state) of the fiiture , but a democracy that must have the structure of a promise - and thus the memory ofthat which carries the fixture, the to-come, here and now.2 It is a matter of the experi- ence of a promise, the appeal of and to 'a new tone', as he describes it, at the end of The Other Heading , 'beyond the "revolutionary day". At the end of the day, it is today in pieces. Derrida writes: Already the days are numbered: at another speed, the day is announced, the day is coming, when the day reaches its end. The day is announced when the day (the visibility of the image and the publicity of the public, but also the unity of daily rhythm, but also the phenomenality of the political, but also perhaps, and at the same time, its very essence) will no longer be the ratio essendi, the reason or the ration of the telemetatheoretical effects that we have just been speaking about. Has the day ever been the measure of all things, as one pretends to believe?3</page><page sequence="2">40 Oxford Literary Review ťTear him to pieces , take him out, take him inside you.4 You're talking in my mind, through my lips, its only you. 'What is't o'clock?' (2.2.1 14, 2.4.23). As Hélène Cixous remarks in her extraordinary essay 'What is it o'clock?', that is the question at the heart of Julius Caesar .5 'What, Lucius, ho! / I cannot by the progress of the stars / Give guess how near to day' (2.1.1-3). Brutus's words, their curiously unfinished syntax, mark the uncertain beginning of the great orchard scene'. How near 'to day' is this now? Is this today? A little later, the conspirators Decius, Casca and Cinna reiterate the uncertainty: DECIUS Here lies the east, doth not the day break here? CASCA No. CINNA O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day. CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceived. Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises. (2.1.101-6) 'Today' is the time of murder, of what is planned, feared, waited for. Calpúrnia, Caesar's wife, tells him: 'You shall not stir out of your house today (2.2.9). 'What say the augurers?' asks Caesar. To which his servant replies: 'They would not have you to stir forth today (2.2.37-8). 'Do not go forth today' (2.2.50), Calpúrnia insists: 'We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House / And he shall say you are not well today' (2.2.52-3). Caesar appears to have decided: 'tell [the senators] I will not come today... /... / I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius' (2.2.62, 64). At the end of Act 2, scene 2, Caesar says: I am to blame to be thus waited for. Now, Cinna, now, Metellus. What, Trebonius, I have an hour's talk in store for you. Remember that you call on me today. (2.2.1 19-22) As Marvin Spevack observes, 'blame' here is perhaps an adjective: the First Folio (1623) has 'too blame'. How much to blame is Caesar to be thus waited for? 'Remember... today': the 'to' of 'today' signals</page><page sequence="3">Nicholas Roy le 41 motion towards, at the same time as excess, hyperbole, exorbitance. Of the movement from W to 'too', E. A. Abbott concludes: 'The transi- tion from the meaning of progressive motion to that of "increasingly" or "excessively", and from "excessively" to the modern "to excess", is too natural to require more than mention (§73). 'To' is ťtoo natural'. 'Too': untranslatable hyperbole, supplement or addition invisible in Shakespearean English. 'Too', as Abbott notes, ťis only an emphatic form of "to"... [It] is often spelt "to" by Elizabethan writers (Sonnets 38, 86); and conversely, "too" is found for "to" (Sonnets 56, 135)'. 6 Thus, in Sonnet 56, 'today is 'too daie': 'although too daie thou fill / Thy hungrie eies...'.7 There is a 'to'-effect to Julius Caesar. 'To': how to translate?8 'The time is out of joint'. Derrida suggests that, in saying this, Hamlet 'thereby opened one of those breaches, often they are poetic and thinking peepholes [meurtrières], through which Shakespeare will have kept watch over the English language and at the same time signed its body, with the same unprecedented stroke of some arrow'.9 Shakespeare is already in the château. Peggy Kamuf translates ' meurtrières as 'peepholes': one might also think of 'loopholes', a term that would refer to the slits in the walls of the castle as well as to forms of ambiguity or double-meaning (the loophole as the way out of a contract, for example). This second sense of 'loophole' is what, up 'to' Derrida, might have been called an anachronism. The OED dates the first figurative use of 'loophole' to 1663. But anachronism, in Shakespeare as in Derrida, proves a loophole.10 ' Meurtrières also means 'murderesses' and 'murder-holes'. 'To' would, perhaps, be a murder- hole. ' Meurtrières appears already to generate a sense of strangeness, not only to do with the oblique evocation of the uncanniness of the female genitals and ghostly feminization of Shakespeare's act of keeping watch over the English language, but also to do with an act (the act of murdering) that is prescribed but has perhaps not (yet) taken place.11 Julius Caesar gives us to think the time, the time of today as the time of murder: when does Caesar die? When does 'the poet' die? As Derrida says of Hamlet 'One must indeed know at what moment death took place, really took place, and this is always the moment of a murder'.12 Shakespeare's Hamlet has a decisive role in Derrida's thinking in the exposition of the democracy to come. Hamlets 'The time is out of</page><page sequence="4">42 Oxford Literary Review joint' is the epigraph that watches over Spectres of Marx, though it appears in numerous other texts as well.13 The 'New International' is, in part, elaborated out of Shakespeare: the 'New International' is, we are told, "out of joint", without coordination, without party, without country, without national community (International before, across, and beyond any national determination), without co-citizenship, without common belonging to a class' (SM 85). Derrida's preoccupa- tion with Hamlet has directed attention to a new sense of the political in the reading of Shakespeare.14 Yet in its staging of questions of friendship, tyranny and the destruction of the Roman republic, the mob, the epitaph or funeral speech, the power of spirits and spectrality, and what he has termed 'the homo-fraternal and phallogo- centric schema' (PF 306), Julius Caesar might appear to offer a more obvious focus for the exploration of Derrida's concerns. Before anything else, however, Julius Caesar is a sort of sister-play to Hamlet in its out of jointedness by the clock. Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time' (1.3.33), observes Cicero, letting this 'disposèd' sound in at least doubly antithetical fashion. 'Disposèd' means both 'inclined' (time anthropomorphized, as if in a strange affair of internal time consciousness) and settled' or ordered' (time as what we might call external, spatialized, objective). It is possible to be well disposed' (that is to say, well employed', as in All Is True , 1.2.117) or 'ill-disposed' (that is to say 'unwell', 'bad-tempered', as in Troilus and Cressida, 2.3.70). But to be strangely disposèd or disposèd to what is strange, strangely disposèd to strangeness? 'Strange-disposèd': this striking double-word or two-fold appears nowhere else in Shakespeare's writings. 'Disposèd' to (or 'unto')? 'To' haunts the sense, along with the ghostliness of the gift, legacy or bequeathal ('to dispose' in the sense of 'to bestow': cf. Julius Caesar , 3.1.178). Cicero's formulation suggests how 'disposèd' is already strange to itself: the posing is at once a disposing, placing a dis-placing, time apart from itself, time (in) pieces. As in for example Macbeth (where it comes and comes back insistently), 'strange' would perhaps be Shakespeare's word for 'uncanny', unheimlich. Cicero is responding to Cascas expressing belief in omens, in 'prodigies' (1.3.28) and 'porten- tous things':</page><page sequence="5">Nicholas Royle 43 CASCA For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon. CICERO Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time. But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? CASCA He doth, for he did bid Antonio Send word to you he would be there tomorrow. (1.3.31-8) The strangeness of this strange-disposèd time' is traced through the tenses of the lines that follow, leading to 'tomorrow'. The 'to' of 'tomorrow' conveys that sense of movement towards which eerily transfers, iterates and reiterates itself in the 'to' of 'today and 'tonighť. As if to equate these 'tos, Cicero and Casca both deploy the present tense ('Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?', 'He doth'). The 'to' of 'tomorrow' is not to come: it 'comes' already. As if to cover over this strange disposition of tense and time, Casca concludes by returning 'tomorrow' to the future: 'he did bid Antonio / Send word to you he would be there tomorrow'. But the momentary concord ('Comes Caesar.. .tomorrow?', 'He doth') seems to dispose of the future, opening in turn perhaps towards a thinking of what Derrida has referred to as a "now" without present'.15 The 'to' of 'tomorrow' here will have prefigured the 'to' that characterizes the appearance of 'tonight' at two crucial, linked moments which we will come to later. The insane anachronism of the clock in Julius Caesar . This medieval invention that strikes in Act 2, scene 1 is one of Shakespeare's most dramatic, metadramatic anachronisms.16 It takes us to the heart perhaps of what Derrida has called the stroke [le coup], the 'unprecedented stroke of some arrow' (SM 18), the 'stroke of genius', 'the signature of the Thing "Shakespeare"' (SM 22). What is this Shakespearean stroke, this coup of the signature of the poet? What is the time of this coup de théâtre? What is't o' clock?</page><page sequence="6">44 Oxford Literary Review Clock strikes BRUTUS Peace, count the clock. CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three. TREBONIUS 'Tis time to part. CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no. (2.1.192-4) The anachronism of the Elizabethan clock in ancient Rome strikes the note of artifice, of that contretemps of ironic consciousness' that Derrida detects elsewhere in Shakespeare.17 We might link this to Thomas M. Greenes contention that A text that somehow acknowl- edges its historicity self-consciously would seem better fitted to survive its potential estrangement than a text that represses history.'18 Shakespeare s coup concerns a peculiarly ironic specialization of time. Shakespearean anachronism inscribes its own ghostly 'to come', submitting to the incalculable and 'unknown . As Cassius remarks of the assassination: 'How many ages hence / Shall this our lofty scene be acted over / In states unborn and accents yet unknown!' (3.1.1 1 1-13). Phyllis Rackin comments that at this moment 'Shakespeare's English audience was reminded of their situation in the playhouse and the actors' status as actors representing an event that had taken place so long ago that even the English language the actors were in fact speaking was yet unknown.' She suggests that an anachronistic moment such as this 'invades the time-frame of the audience... its effect is no less striking than that of a character stepping off the stage to invade the audience s physical space or addressing them directly to invade their psychological space'.19 O my democratic friends. (PF 306) Rackin foregrounds the disruptive and dislocating effects of anachronisms: they 'can dissolve the distance between past events and present audience in the eternal present of dramatic performance'.20 To whom does she think she is addressing these words? In what present? Having assassinated Caesar the conspirators cry out 'Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!' (3.1.78), but the cry is already doubled, theatrical, an iteration, crying out to be cried out. Cinna: 'Run hence, proclaim,</page><page sequence="7">Nicholas Royle 45 cry it about the streets' (3.1.78-9); Cassius: 'Some to the common pulpits, and cry out, "liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"' (3.1.80-1); Brutus: 'Lets all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"' (3.1.110). For Rackin, Shakespeares plebeian characters' in particular 'belong to the ephemeral present moment of theatrical performance, the modern, and socially degraded, world of the Renaissance public theatre'.21 The aporetic disjunction between what she at one point calls 'the eternal present of dramatic performance' and at another this ephemeral present moment of theatrical performance' is perhaps illustrative of a more general presentism characteristic of Shakespearean criticism and historiography. The plebeians or 'tag-rag people', as Casca calls them, are always already ťin the theatre' (1.2.252-4). Shakespeare's poetry cries out for another thinking of what we are here trying to explore under the rubric of the strange- disposèd time' of his poetic or thinking peepholes'. 'Tear him to pieces.' Jacques Derrida does not name any poets in 'Che cos'è la poesia'.22 If he tears up the poet, he does so indirectly, tearing himself up too. There is a certain anthropomorphism at work in this brief, elliptical essay, a haunting transubstantiation: the poem says 'destroy me' (227). It says: 'Eat, drink, swallow my letter, carry it, transport it in you' (229). Not only are no poets named, but the word 'poetry' itself becomes radically displaced, first by the term 'poetic', then by the neologism of the 'poematic' (233). The poematic is characterized by what 'can reflect language or speak poetry, but ... never relates back to itself'. It entails the logic and experience of what Derrida calls the 'demon of the heart'. He writes: 'This "demon of the heart" never gathers itself together, rather it loses itself and goes astray (delirium or mania), it exposes itself to chance, it would rather let itself be torn to pieces by what bears down upon it' (235). There is a cryptic tension, it seems, between this figure of demonization and what Derrida tells us in his great essay on Valéry, 'Qual Quelle': 'At a certain point in history, for reasons to be analysed, the poet ceased being considered the prey of a foreign voice, in mania, delirium, enthusiasm, or inspira- tion. Poetic "hallucination" is then accommodated under the rubric of the "regime": a simple elaboration of hearing-oneself-speak, a</page><page sequence="8">46 Oxford Literary Review regulated, normed exchange of the same and the other, within the limits tolerated by a kind of general organization, that is, an individual, social, historical system, etc.'23 If Derrida stresses a certain domestication of the figure of the poet and a certain normativization of poetic "hallucination", he neverthe- less affirms a demonic poematic or poematic demonization, the madness of the poem, which is also to say the madness of the gift and the madness of the poem as gift. He opens up the possibilities of other ways of thinking 'hallucination and 'the "regime"'. How might we try to think the gift of the poem' (235) in the context of Julius Caesar ? ťChe cos'è la poesia is written in the second person ('tu'). It addresses itself to you, regarding the time of a signature and its dispersion, a certain now' which would be the experience of a 'to come': in French ' désormais (a word Derrida elsewhere describes as 'one of the most beautiful, and one of the most untranslatable, words... in the French language'24), in English, 'henceforth', 'henceforward', 'from now on'. Derrida writes: 'You will call poem from now on [emphasis added: N.R.] a certain passion of the singular mark, the signature that repeats its dispersion, each time beyond the logos, ahuman, barely domestic, not reappropriable into the family of the subject' (235). No Julius Caesar &gt; no Shakespeare, no drama without 'learning by heart'. From now on. It is a question of a '"political" translation (a translation into and of the political) that would twist the 'history of friendship', a 'scansion', as Derrida names it, 'which would have introduced dissymmetry, separation and infinite distance in a Greek philia [friendship] which did not tolerate them but nevertheless called for them (PF 232). The democracy to come is "a matter of thinking an alterity without hierar- chical difference at the root of democracy : 'this democracy would free a certain interpretation of equality by removing it from the phallogo- centric schema of fraternity (PF 232). The question of poetry, the poetic or poematic offers, perhaps, a way of scanning this 'political' translation. Speaking of rhyme, of 'the insane linking [ appariement , 'matching', 'mating', 'coupling'] of a couple', he notes that 'a friend- ship should always be poetic. Before being philosophical, friendship concerns the gift of the poem' (PF 166). Before engaging with what Julius Caesar might be explicitly analysing with regard to questions of monarchy, democracy, republicanism and a well-established view of</page><page sequence="9">Nicholas Royle 47 Rome as 'the best historical model of the mixed regime', it would be a matter of trying to construe the logic of multiple voices that is the condition of any such engagement.25 Before encountering the apparent division of social space into public and private, a division on which (as Richard Halpern stresses) all classical political theory has relied,26 there is the question of what Derrida calls writing in the voice, its 'differential vibration . 27 Caesar will thus perhaps open to that call to come' which, as Derrida evokes it in the polyphonic drama of quotation marks at the end of 'Psyche: Inventions of the Other, 'happens only in multiple voices'.28 Water wells up there, at the origin, imaginary. Like a mirage or buried spring: uncanny.29 As Samuel Weber shows in an admirable recent essay on 'uncanny thinking', the uncanny and the theatrical belong together. He writes: 'A theatrical scenario ... never takes place "once and for all" but rather "one scene at a time". It is singular and yet repetitive, ongoing and yet never complete. It is both nearby and distant, familiar and strange.'30 But can we even speak of "one scene at a time'", a phrase that Weber is careful to put in quotation marks? Where will Julius Caesar have begun? We have perhaps not yet begun to take the measure of the strange dispositions of language in Shakespeare's work. We require another vocabulary, new 'concepts' to elaborate what is going on where, for example, criticism has for so many years, even centuries, talked about 'mirror scenes in Shakespeare', larger scenes 'in miniature' or 'vignette', one speech or phrase or character or episode 'echoing' another.31 Here is Act 3, scene 3, what is often referred to as the Cinna episode. The location is a street in Rome: Enter CINNA THE POET, and after him the PLEBEIANS CINNA THE POET I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unluckily charge my fantasy. I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth. 1 PLEBEIAN What is your name? 2 PLEBEIAN Whither are you going? 3 PLEBEIAN Where do you dwell? 4 PLEBEIAN Are you a married man or a bachelor?</page><page sequence="10">48 Oxford Literary Review 2 PLEBEIAN Answer every man directly. 1 PLEBEIAN Ay, and briefly 4 PLEBEIAN Ay, and wisely 3 PLEBEIAN Ay, and truly, you were best. CINNA THE POET What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor. 2 PLEBEIAN That's as much as to say they are fools that marry. Youll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly. CINNA THE POET Directly I am going to Caesar s funeral. 1 PLEBEIAN As a friend or an enemy?

CINNA THE POET I am not Cinna the conspirator. 4 PLEBEIAN It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going. 3 PLEBEIAN Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho, firebrands! To Brutus', to Cassius', burn all! Some to Decius' house, and some to Cascas, some to Ligarius'! Away, go! Exeunt all the Plebeians [forcing out Cinna] In Romeo and Juliet , Romeo remarks of his name: ťHad I it written, I would tear the word' (2.1.99). But the name can only be plucked out of your heart. In the name of the name (not only 'Cinna but also 'the poet'), Cinna is to be torn to pieces. In Norths translation of Plutarch (from which Shakespeare is borrowing here) we read:</page><page sequence="11">Nicholas Royle 49 But there was a poet called Cinna, who had been no partaker of the conspiracy but was alway one of Caesars chiefest friends. He dreamed, the night before, that Caesar bade him to supper with him and that, he refusing to go, Caesar was very importunate with him and compelled him, so that at length he led him by the hand into a great dark place, where, being marvellously afraid, he was driven to follow him in spite of his heart. This dream put him all night into a fever. And yet, notwithstanding, the next morning when he heard that they carried Caesar s body to burial, being ashamed not to accompany his funerals, he went out of his house, and thrust himself into the press of the common people that were in a great uproar. And because some one called him by his name, Cinna, the people thinking he had been that Cinna who in an oration he made had spoken very evil of Caesar, they falling upon him in their rage slew him outright in the market-place.32 Norths Plutarch goes on to state that the 'fickle and unconstant multitude' had 'torn poor Cinna the poet in pieces'.33 ťIn pieces' or 'to pieces'? Shakespeare prefers 'to' - ťTear him to pieces, he's a conspir- ator.' But Shakespeare also keeps to a certain now, deepens and divides, encrypts it we might say. From now on. The poet is to be torn to pieces, perhaps. We never hear anything more of the poet.34 But we also will never have heard about anything else. Such would be the strange-disposèd time' in which the poet is to be torn to pieces. In a slight and doubtless improper deformation of an archaic (Spenserian) usage, we might say that the poet is to-torn. ('To-tear': this is to tear in pieces, the prefix ťto' as 'asunder'. To sunder, to tear asunder. From Orpheus to Cinna and beyond, the poet is to be torn to pieces, to-torn.) Norman N. Holland remarks that 'Cinna's death serves as an echo to Caesar's' and argues that '[t]he Cinna episode, as a miniature of Caesar's death, identifies Brutus' motives with those of the mob and establishes the attitude of the play toward the assassination'.35 We categorize it by Act and Scene number (3.3: is it by chance, I wonder, that the Christological 33 imprints itself here, just as Shakespeare's Caesar, unlike Suetonius' or Plutarch's, is said to have</page><page sequence="12">50 Oxford Literary Review 'three and thirty wounds [5.1.53]?). It is termed episode', miniature' or even (in the phrasing of Frank Kermode) a little insertion.36 Holland speaks of Cinna s death echoing Caesars and establishing] the attitude of the play toward [this] assassination. But things are perhaps stranger, more complex and cryptic than such descriptions might suggest. The 'to-torn of Cinna directs us to what Samuel Weber, in a related context, has called ťthe theatrical derangement of the "work"'.37 'Then to answer : What is the name? What is your destination? Where do you come from? What are the politics of Julius Caesaři What are the politics of deconstruction? Answer directly, answer all of these questions at once, briefly, wisely and truly. How 'to answer'? As William Archer put it in a theatre-review in 1898 .Julius Caesarhas 'no comic relief'.38 At once because and in spite of appearing so close to comical, this is the stuff of terror.39 The poet's life is suspended, paralysed in the time of this 'to', picking up from the spectral 'to' that lingers tacitly at the end of the initial barrage of the plebeians' questions: you were best [to]'. Cinna knows: 'to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly' - it is impossible. The scene, if it is one, the 'to-torn' of the poet (which is also the time of the today of the murder of Caesar, the 'strange-disposèd time' of the play) might be read as a theatrical prefiguring of a remark Derrida makes in Politics of Friendship: 'it is impossible to address only one person, only one man, only one woman. To put it bluntly and without pathos, such an address would have to be each time one single time , and all iterability would have to be excluded from the structure of the trace' (PF 215). Derrida goes on to refer to this as precisely a 'drama (ibid). Julius Caesar seems to inscribe a thinking of 'theatrical derangement' in terms of what we might call the iteraphonic.40 There is a spectrality of address already under way. The words of one character eerily repeat, singularly, without that character's knowledge or control. This would be the language of peepholes, an uncanny thinking of contagion prior to the socius or mass, or to any distinction between public and private. To consider just a few instances, by way of moving towards a conclusion: to 'answer directly' (3.3.9, 14-15, 21) is a demand made already in the opening words of the play, when one of the tribunes, Murellus, informed by a cobbler that the cobbler is, 'as you would say, a cobbler', demands: 'But what trade art thou? Answer me directly</page><page sequence="13">Nicholas Royle 51 (1.1.10-12). The 'Cinna episode' is a strange replaying of the so-called opening scene. The opening scene is itself spooked: it is mutely revisited in the very next scene, when we learn that Murellus and his fellow tribune Flavius are already put to silence' (1.2.275). 41 But the iteraphonic also interrupts, overturns and disposes quite differently the sequentiality of acts and scenes: the time of the poem, of the work as writing, disposes you to the sense of the opening scene as already haunted by the so-called Cinna episode. Act 3 scene 3 opens onto other times, above all to the time of reading as to come. The time of the words of 'the poet' (to be torn to pieces) engulfs the play of which it is ostensibly a part. It is no longer a question of saying that one scene or one speech echoes' an earlier one, in the 'strange-disposèd time' of the iteraphonic. 'I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar', begins Cinna the poet, in that astonishing four-line soliloquy the fourth line of which leads him, finds him led forth, into the madness of the day. In North's Plutarch you read that Cinna 'dreamed, the night before, that Caesar bade him to supper'. Shakespeare interrupts, or we might say iterrupts the time. 'Tonight', at this strange moment in Julius Caesar , is strangely before today. The 'to' comes to belong to a past that never existed. As Abbott observes apropos this rare usage of 'to': ' To was [on occasion] used [by Shakespeare] without any notion of "motion toward the future" in to-night (last night)' (§190).42 But the singular, dreaming 'tonight' in Act 3, scene 3 is already iteraphonic, a striking repetition of the account of Calpurnia's dream, earlier in the play, before the assassination, but at the same time, the same 'tonight'. As Caesar says: 'She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, / Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts / Did run pure blood' (2.2.76-8). Who says 'I dreamt tonight'? At least three speakers, we might suppose. Caesar may appear to speak for Calpúrnia, in place of her ('She dreamt tonight'), but this in fact only underscores the dream's peculiarity and power.43 The almost incredible effacement of the presence of woman in Julius Caesar is integral to the cold, lucid exposi- tion of its homo-fraternal, phallogocentric schema. Prior to any determination of Portia as 'female terrorist',44 or blood as a 'trope of gender',45 or Brutus as (in Antony's final declaration) 'a man!' (5. 5. 75), 46 however, the logic of the iteraphonic would entail turning our ears to what Derrida has described as 'sexual differences in the</page><page sequence="14">52 Oxford Literary Review plural'. He writes: 'Why don't we turn our ears toward a call which addresses and provokes above all else , above and beyond whatever says "me", my "body", as a "man" or a "woman", or my sex? To turn one's ears to the other when it speaks to "whom", to "what", to "this" "who" which has not yet been assigned an identity or, for example, since we have to speak of it, to either one sex or the other?'47 'What is't o'clock?' Iteraphonically this question recurs, or occurs twice, in separate scenes involving two characters who never hear each other speak: 'What is't o'clock?' (2.2.114), asks Caesar; 'What is't o'clock?', asks Portia (2.4.23). I dreamt tonight of the democracy to come. You are talking in my mind, through my lips, it's only you. I have been trying to evoke a few, perhaps especially explicit instances of the iteraphonic in Julius Caesar . If the signature of the poet is to be felt here, we should also have to reckon with a thinking of the iteraphonic as unbounded generalization'48: in Cinna's four-line soliloquy at the start of Act 3 scene 3 we might also pick up on the strange appearance or reappearance of will' (a celebrated signature- word that occurs twenty-seven times in thirty-six lines in the preceding scene: see 3.2.1 26-6 1)49 or the phrase 'forth of doors' that weirdly iterates Antony's description of the blood leaving Caesar's body as 'rushing out of doors' (3.2.170). It would be possible to elaborate notions of the iteraphonic or, perhaps, iteraesthesia (for it is a matter of a specialization of sense and feeling) across the entirety of Shakespeare's text, thus engaging with micrological analyses of apparently single words such as 'blood', 'noble', 'honourable', 'man', 'friend' or, perhaps, 'to'. Julius Caesar is an inexhaustibly rich text for any attempt to think about the nature and politics of friendship. In this play, perhaps more deliberately and succinctly than in any other of Shakespeare's works, we are brought up against the strangeness of a friend and friends. In Julius Caesar Trebonius, Brutus and Caesar can be 'like friends' (2.2.127), uncertainly 'as' friends, similar to but not the same as 'friends'; it is apparently possible to 'befriend [one]self (2.4.29); 'friend' can mean 'lover' or vice versa (2.3.6); yet at other moments the distinction between 'lovers' ('Romans, countrymen, and lovers' (3.2.13), as Brutus addresses the people) and 'friends' ('Friends, Romans, countrymen' (3.2.65), as Antony addresses them) can appear</page><page sequence="15">Nicholas Royle 53 decisive; and above all, perhaps, friends can do you a good turn by turning against you, indeed by disposing of you altogether (as Brutus puts it, in what is perhaps the most shocking formulation of friend- ship in the play: 'So are we Caesars friends, that have abridged / His time of fearing death' (3.1.103-4)). 'Friendship would be unheimlich ' suggests Derrida. He asks: 'How would unheimlich , uncanny , translate into Greek? Why not translate it by atóposr. outside all place or placeless, without family or familiarity, outside of self, expatriate, extraordinary, extravagant, absurd or mad, weird, unsuitable, strange but also "a stranger to"?' (PF 178). A stranger to friend. Kirby Farrell has suggested that there is a 'deep taboo in [Shakespeare's] plays against attempts to seize the future by force'.50 Julius Caesar dramatizes the 'strange-disposèd time' of the 'being-promise of a promise' (SM 105). It is a play about attempts to predict and seize the future, and in particular about faith in friendship. In the aftermath of Caesar's murder Brutus claims to know the future, as regards the friendship of Antony. He tells Cassius: 'I know that we shall have him well to friend' (3.1.143). Abbott notes of the 'to' in 'to friend' here: 'Toy from meaning "like", came into the meaning of "representation", "equivalence", "apposition"' (§189). Has the meaning of 'to' come, or is it still to come? What is this 'to friend'? It is as if Brutus says to Cassius: O my friend, there are friends: I know the future, we will certainly have Antony as friend. Ironized by the knowledge that there can be no such knowledge, no grounds for such knowledge, the 'to' is the mark of interruption, the very disjunction with the future. Is there (in Derrida's terms) a 'suitable' reading of Shakespeare's play? Julius Caesar is a stranger to friend. Atópos of the iteraphonic. The play can always be torn to pieces. As is obvious from its stage history, it is susceptible to innumerable different 'political' readings and renditions, including those of ostensibly 'politically opposing' kinds.51 Eighteenth-century productions presenting Brutus as hero, and thus promoting what Francis Gentleman (writing in 1770) called 'one of the noblest principles that actuates the human mind, the love of national liberty', generally entailed tearing the play to pieces by omitting, in particular, the so-called Cinna episode.52 The time of Shakespeare's play is haunted by this, just as strangely as it is by the ghost of Caesar, by the ghost of Caesar in the play but also by the</page><page sequence="16">54 Oxford Literary Review ghost of Caesar as Shakespeare, the play as the ghost of Caesar. Double is the ghost, the ghost is always (at least) double. Great play of the two: a play of two parts, two central characters', two poets, two Caesars.53 As Brutus discovers, reading can always call up a ghost: Let me see, let me see, is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. Enter the GHOST OF CAESAR How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here? (4.3.273-5) How to answer? Julius Caesar keeps W, keeps to itself. 'Et tu. Brute? (3.1.76). This familiar but strange, strangely familiar, anachronistic foreign language at the heart of Julius Caesar is the only Latin in all of Shakespeare s so- called Roman plays.54 How would one hear this V«'? How would it have sounded, how should it sound, in what language or languages? In accents yet unknown, a new international? Rhyming with, haunted by you? You, too? Suetonius records that Caesar at this moment spoke Greek: Kai go tskvov? In English: ťYou too, my child?'55 (The use of the word tskvov, it may be recalled, is linked to the not uncommon belief that Brutus was Caesar's illegitimate son.) The Latin phrase in Julius Caesar stems to circle around and back on itself, a sort of palindrome in the ear (et tu...rb...ut te), petering out, interrupted. 'Tu' falls, brutish in reverse. I conclude with a supplement, centuries later, in translation. You might have clocked it from the start: Before all else I am seeking to produce effects {sur toi, on you . What do they do here in order to avoid the plural? Their grammar is very bizarre. I would not have been able to love you in English, you are untranslatable. Or I would have had recourse, more than ever, to anachronistic procedures, even more retro, I would have made you theatrical, divine. Do you think it would have changed something, you, toi, this singular in disuse?).56</page><page sequence="17">Nicholas Roy le 55 Notes 1 Jacques Derrida, 'Circumfession', in Jacques Derrida, trans.

For Gilles Deleuze also, Hamlets 'The time is out of joint' marks a crucial moment in the history of philosophy and conceptions of temporality: 'Time out of joint, the door off its hinges, signifies the first great Kantian reversal: movement is now subordinated to time. Time is no longer related to the movement it measures, but rather movement to the time that conditions it.... It is Hamlet ... who completes the emancipation of time.... Hamlet is the first hero who truly needed time in order to act, whereas earlier heroes were subject to time as the consequence of an original movement (Aeschylus) or an aberrant action (Sophocles).... Time is no longer the cosmic time of an original celestial movement, nor is it the rural time of derived meteorological movements. It has become the time of the city and nothing other, the pure order of time.' See Gilles Deleuze, Essays Critical and Clinical, trans. Daniel W. Smith and Michael A.

As Decius tells him, the dream 'Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck / Reviving blood and that great men shall press / For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance' (2.2.87-9). The Norton editors gloss the final line: 'Heraldic colours and emblems ("tinctures", "stains", and "cognizance"); venerated properties of saints ("tinctures", "stains", and "relics"): see Norton p. 1555. As David Kaula has argued, the account of Calpurnias dream is strongly suggestive of 'the medieval cult of the Holy Blood, which featured not only the proliferation of phials of Christ s blood but also stories about bleeding statues and paintings of Chrisť. See David Kaula, ' "Let Us Be Sacrificers": Religious Motifs in Julius Caesar , Shakespeare Studies 14 (1981), 204. Cf. also Gail Kern Paster who observes: 'Caesar, as Decius Brutus anticipates, responds positively to this sacerdotal image of himself (perhaps even becoming a victim of witty anachronism on Shakespeare s part in Caesar s ignorance of basic Christian typology about the self-sacrificial nature of the Christ he is made to resemble here). See Pasters essay, "'In the spirit of men there is no blood": Blood as Trope of Gender in Julius Caesar , Shakespeare Quarterly 40:3 (1989), 294. Anachronism here is not simply a matter of being 'witty', however: the Christifìcation of Caesar is in keeping with the plays more general dramatization and questioning of what Derrida has referred to as 'the Christianization of frater- nization, or fraternization as the essential structure of Christianization (PF 96). 18 See his essay 'History and Anachronism', in The Vulnerable Text: Essays on Renaissance Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), p. 224. Shakespeare's exploration of 'strange-disposèd time' is, however, perhaps more radical than is suggested by Greene's conception of 'potential estrangement', which would seem to imply some logic of originary non-estrangement. 19 Phyllis Rackin, Stages of History: Shakespeare's English Chronicles , p. 94. 20 Stages of History, p. 94. 21 Stages of History, p. 103. 22 Jacques Derrida, 'Che cos'è la poesia?', trans.

They argue that '[t]he essence of Roman republicanism consisted of its mixed constitution or regime' (p. 198). They thus follow Kurt von Fritz whose study The Theory of the Mixed Constitution in Antiquity: A Critical Analysis ofPolybius Political Ideas (New York: Columbia University Press, 1954) provides an especially detailed account of the notion of the mixed constitution or regime as comprising the three elements of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy. Kayser and Lettieri seek to situate Shakespeare's work in an Elizabethan context : 'Fully conscious of the depraved conditions of monarchy gone awry (tyranny) and the bestial proclivity of democracy (anarchy), many late sixteenth-century Englishmen advanced the notion that some semblance of a mixed regime was necessary to establish an effective and stable polity' (p.200). 26 Richard Halpern, 'That Shakespeherian Mob: Mass Culture and the Literary Public Sphere', Shakespeare Among the Moderns (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1997), p. 78. 27 Jacques Derrida, 'Dialanguages', in Points...

He goes on to say that the theatrical scenario is 'present and passing. It is marked not by acts or even by actors but rather by acting. Its tense and temporality is that of the present participle. [It is] "presenting" rather than "present"' (p. 7). I would associate this thinking of the present participle with the 'to' (the 'coming' as never completely come, as still keeping, indeed as structured by, the 'to come').

Spevack, pp. 170-1. 33 'The Life of Marcus Brutus', p. 171. 3 Rather, in Act 4, scene 3, we are presented with the figure of another poet, a 'cynic', a 'jigging fool' who is dismissed by Brutus for not knowing his time: 'Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence! / ... / I'll know his humour when he knows his time' (4.3.13 4-6). 'Time' here of course carries a double sense, both 'proper occasion' and sense of rhythm or 'poetic metre' (see Spevack, p. 126 n.). The question remains: what is the time of the poet? Norman N. Holland, 'The "Cinna" and "Cynické" Episodes in Julius Caesar' Shakespeare Quarterly , 11:1 (1960), 441, 443. 36 He suggests that the 'little insertion of this scene (3.3) was meant as an ironic denial that poets, except by unhappy chance, have anything to do with polities', before adding: yet this is an intensely political play, a fact that has a controlling influence over its language'. See Frank Kermode, Shakespeare's Language (London: Penguin, 2000), p. 86. 37 Samuel Weber, 'Uncanny Thinking', p. 30. 38 William Archer, review of a performance of Julius Caesar , produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree, at Her Majesty's Theatre, London; reprinted in Shakespeare in the Theatre: An Anthology of Criticism, ed.

See, for example, 'Mole', trans. Ian Maclachlan and Michael Syrotinski, in L'animal autobiographique: Autour de Jacques Derrida , ed. Marie-Louise Mallet (Paris: Galilée, 1999), pp. 558- 9; and 'Night writing: deconstruction reading polities', pp. 126-7. 41 This 'to' -effect ('to silence' = 'to death') is, again, peculiarly Shakespearean: as Spevack notes, in Plutarch we are told only that Murellus and Flavius are 'deprived ... of their Tribuneships' (p. 157). 42 Elsewhere, 'tonight' indeed carries this sense of 'motion toward the future' - hence, for example, Cassius' asking Casca 'Will you sup with me tonight?' (1.2.277) or Brutus' telling Lucilius and Titinius: 'bid the commanders / Prepare to lodge their companies tonight' (4.3.139-40). Cassius' death is described specifically in terms of a movement 'to night' (retained as two words in Spevack s edition). Titinius declares: 'But Cassius is no more. O setting sun, / As in thy red rays thou dost sink</page><page sequence="22">60 Oxford Literary Review to night, / So in his red blood Cassius* day is seť (5.3.60-2). Cynthia Marshall picks up on a similar sense of paradox in this context, though she reads the scene and the place' of Calpúrnia rather differently: 'That [Calpúrnia] is denied even the articulation of her dream, which is narrated by the appropriating Caesar, demonstrates an effacement of her linguistic presence; Calpúrnia is largely without the power of words in the play. But her relative muteness also confers on Calpúrnia the paradoxical freedom of one unconfmed by limiting verbal structures.'
