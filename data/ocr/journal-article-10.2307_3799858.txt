<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The World of the Walrus. By Richard Perry. Taplinger Publishing Company, New York. 1968. 162pp. $5.95. The walrus is most unusual in appearance and occupies a region which, until recently, was visited by relatively few adventurers, explorers, and com- mercial hunters. Quite understandably a signifi- cant portion of the early literature includes folklore and anthropomorphic interpretations of impression- istic observers. As Perry points out in his introduction, the pres- ent body of knowledge concerning walrus is frag- mentary and often contradictory. His stated objec- tive is to sort out the facts "in order to lay bare the unexpectedly remarkable truth of walrus life and society." Unfortunately, the book does not achieve this objective. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming stems from insufficient firsthand knowledge of the wal- rus and its environment, with the result that the author was himself unable to sort fact from infer- ence. In addition, there were several instances where erroneous statements were made, or hypoth- eses advanced to explain morphologic characteris- tics or behavioral traits recorded in the literature. Readability of the book is fair to poor due pri- marily to a somewhat rambling style of writing and poor organization of material included in the 16 chapters. Material taken from the literature is poorly referenced and misspellings occur in both scientific names and the names of authors. Despite the numerous shortcomings of this book, it is a compendium of findings by others about a most interesting and unusual animal. To that ex- tent it is a useful addition to any natural history library.-JOHN J. BURNs, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Nome. The Management and Conservation of Biologi- cal Resources. By John D. Black. F. A. Davis Company, Philadelphia. 1968. 339pp. $7.50. Although this book is intended for beginning stu- dents in wildlife conservation, it contains much in- formation useful to advanced students. The reader need not be technically inclined, for the book ex- plains all topics in simple matter using as little sci- entific terminology as possible. The book will therefore be used as a reference by many of the lay public and is also an excellent beginning text for wildlife conservation. A vast amount of knowledge has been synthe- sized and included in this publication. The author begins by describing the reasons why wildlife con- servation is needed. Basic information such as ele- mentary ecology, soil and water relationships with plants and animals, and the fundamentals of life are included early in this volume. Special chapters devoted to specific topics follow. These include grasslands, forests, fishes, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates, game, song, and predatory birds, game and predatory mammals, furbearers, and sev- eral others. All of these topics are brought together as an existing intricate relationship between each other. Throughout the book, the topics are dis- cussed from the point of view that all forms of life are dependent on each other for subsistence. Dr. Black has been professor of zoology at North- east Missouri State College for the last 14 years. He has written many articles for publication in various scientific journals. He received the "Con- servation Educator of the Year" award in 1967 given by the Missouri Department of Conservation, and has been active in conservation oriented or- ganizations for many years. This well written book by a truly great author is a monumental task itself. Its accurate informa- tion will go a long way in reaching the lay public as well as students in wildlife conservation.- RICHARD D. CRAWFORD, Northeast Missouri State College, Kirksville. Ecological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds. By David Lack. Methuen and Co., Ltd., Lon- don. 409pp. 1968. 84 shillings (In U. S.: Barnes and Noble, New York. $13.50). It is seldom that a new book crosses a reviewer's desk that leaves him with a feeling that a vast amount of hitherto discrete and disconnected ma- terial, culled from innumerable sources, has been given a new value, a more certain and a better oriented usefulness and that the future work of students in the area of its coverage will from then on have a firm basis from which to advance. This, in brief, is what David Lack's new volume does, and the more the present reviewer re-reads por- tions of it, the greater is his conviction that this is so. For many years, decades, even longer periods of time, ornithologists, particularly devoted amateurs, have published observations and data on birds of all families and of all parts of the world. Lack has spread his nets widely and effectively in this vast sea of print, and has evaluated and appraised with admirable discretion and critical interpretation, the multitude and variety of his "catch." The result is a book that students of avian breeding biology will find a reliable and comprehensive reference, and a stimulating basis from which to extend their inves- tigations. The volume deals with ecological adaptations only, and does not attempt to include purely be- havioral ones. This is something that many read- ers may regret, but it would have more than dou- 447</page><page sequence="2">448 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 33, No. 2, April 1969 bled the size of the book if the attempt were made to bring both fields together in a single and inter- related presentation. Eventually this will have to be done, but it may be argued that behavioral mechanisms, alterations, and adaptations have a temporal relation to ecological factors other than merely coincidental. They may precede, and, in a sense, prepare the way for them, or they may fol- low and capitalize upon them. It may be hoped that until such a comprehen- sive analysis of the interrelations as well as the relatively independent development and operations of the ethological and the ecological adaptations of birds is available, an avian ethologist may produce a companion volume to the present one on the be- havioral mechanisms and the many adaptations in- volved in the breeding habits of birds of all groups and areas on an equally broad and comprehensive scale. It will not be easy as purely behavioral data lend themselves less readily to tabulation and di- rect comparison than do ecological facts and sta- tistics. In the book before us the author presents his survey and discussion in two parts. The first deals with the adaptive significance and value of nesting dispersion, from solitary to various degrees of colonial breeding, and of the various aspects of the pair-bond, from monogamy to polygyny, and to promiscuity. The second treats of the factors in- fluencing clutch size, number of clutches, egg size, duration of the incubation and nestling and fledg- ling periods, and the age of first breeding. Lack considers all of these as ecological adaptations be- cause all of them have a direct bearing on the ef- fective fecundity of each of the species involved. This effective fecundity, in turn, is the ultimate measure of the "appraisal" of natural selection on each species, and this natural value judgment is obviously basic to the evolution of all the adapta- tions each of them exhibits. Lack's final and over- all conclusions, at the very close of his book are that, ". . . all the adaptations discussed in this book are the result of natural selection, and that on present evidence no other means is needed to ac- count for them." Lack explains that he is primarily concerned with interpreting those adaptations to the external environment that affect the number of young raised, and that he is secondarily interested, as corollaries, in such closely related ones that deter- mine the degree of nesting dispersion, the various forms of pair-bonds, clutch size, egg size, etc. The degree to which the discussions and the data on each item are both broad and yet accurate is most impressive. As an example of the wealth of information the author has been able to amass and to condense, we may take a statement dealing with the nesting dispersion in passerine birds, "... Allowing for fractional entries, the nesting disper- sion is known for 86 3/4 passerine families or sub- families, of which 72 7/12 normally nest solitarily. This total includes two families omitted from Table 1 because their pair-bond is not known . . . while part of the Ploceinae and of the Icteridae have ten- tatively been classed as colonial as they have small nesting territories in groups. The parasitic birds have been excluded because their nesting disper- sion is that of their host species, and so have the Corcoracinae, because though each nest is solitary, several females may lay in it, so it is hard to know whether to call them solitary or colonial . . ." To take another example, in his discussion of trends in clutch size, size of eggs, and growth rate in seabirds, Lack summarizes his data by stating that the, ". . . offshore-feeding as compared with the inshore-feeding seabirds lay one egg instead of two or three, have longer incubation and fledging periods and start breeding at a greater age, while with some exceptions the young form big tem- porary fat stores and are independent of their par- ents at fledging, whereas those of inshore feeders are fed by their parents for several further weeks. ..." These are no simple conclusions based on mere tabulations, but are obviously critical evaluations of a very large body of facts, carefully weighed and pruned of instances that presented dubious or con- tradictory elements. In families such as the Icter- idae and the Ploceinae, whose members reveal an unusual diversity of breeding habits, Lack has given more detailed discussion than for more uni- formly behaving groups. His realization that fami- lies of birds are not necessarily comparable units, and that their mode of life is more important than their placement in a taxonomic system, has caused the author to present separate accounts for each such ecological entity. This is shown in even a mere listing of some chapter headings: Nesting Dispersal and the Pair-bond in Cursorial Land Birds; Wading and Littoral Birds; Fresh water Aquatic Birds; Colonial Seabirds; Cooperative Breeding; Brood Parasites, etc. The main portion of the book is divided into some two dozen convenient chapters, and these are followed by some eighteen appendices, each of which is an admirable and concise summary of a large amount of information that has been filtered through the fine and critical meshes of the author's long preoccupation with their various elements and concepts. In a few instances it seems that certain species not mentioned should have been discussed. Thus, in the accounts of the gulls, we find no de- scription of such a landlocked, insectivorous, and hence, for a gull, aberrant species as the Franklin's gull of the Great Basin of western North America. In preparing this review I have twice attempted to summarize the contents of individual chapters, and each time have come to realize clearly that each is already a summary. It is only possible to urge all interested students of avian breeding hab-</page><page sequence="3">RECENT BOOKS 449 its to read the book and not to be satisfied with this review. To do justice to the rich contents of Lack's book would require many, many pages, and these, if properly effective, would cause their read- ers to get the book anyway. It need only be added that the volume is attrac- tively printed, remarkably free from typographical errors, is well indexed, and has a long but well selected bibliography of references used in the text.-HERBERT FRIEDMANN, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Exposition Park, Los Angeles, California 90007.
