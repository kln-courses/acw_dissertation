<plain_text><page sequence="1">have, after six years of abstinence, taken to smoking a pipe again, and derive great satisfaction from it. Far more important, I feel much more energetic. Even my mood swings have abated. Before my system ad- justed to dialysis, I developed com- mon, unpleasant symptoms-cramps, dizzy spells, intense itching, a feeling sometimes of being unable to catch my breath, even terrible searing heart- burn and hiccups from my medica- tion. (Dialysis patients take lots of pills; I gulp down eight every morn- ing, five at lunch, five at dinner and three before I go to bed.) All those symptoms have now passed. Dialysis is terribly expensive- $25,000 or so a year in a hospital, about $8,500 a year at home, but I'm very lucky. Almost all of the 20 percent of my dialysis costs that Med- icare does not cover is picked up by the New York State Department of Health-most other states have simi- lar programs-and the rest by my medical insurance carriers. It looks now ,as if I won't be out of pocket more than $1,000 a year. What does the future hold? I could stay on dialysis for the rest of my life, however long that may be. The rec- ord for longevity on a kidney ma- chine, the last time I checked, was fourteen years, and if I stay on di- alysis I aim to break the record. Or I could opt for a transplant. However, no one in my family is capable of donating a kidney to me, and the statistics on cadaver transplants are not too encouraging. Half reject within two years, about two-third within five. Some patients have had two or three transplants. If I get a kidney transplant and my body rejects the new kidney, I would simply go back on dialysis again. But, of course, I would go back in poorer shape than before because I would have had one major operation to put the kidney in, another major opera- tion to take it out, and all the while it was in me I would have been get- ting powerful drugs to suppress my body's rejection mechanism. Meanwhile, new breakthroughs seem to be on the horizon for dialy- sis. Smaller, portable machines, for example. Even more exciting, some physicians are experimenting with sor- bents, edible substances that, when eaten, would absorb waste products and bind them to the stool for ex- cretion. Sorbents would decrease the number of times a week a kidney patient would have to dialyze. So I'm going to make the best of things, and when the time comes my physician and I will decide whether I should have a transplant. Meanwhile, every day, when I am immersed in work or some leisure activity, I com- pletely forget for hours at a time that a kidney machine keeps me alive. And when I remember, the realization in- tensifies whatever I am doing. It sharpens my senses land heightens my appreciation of even such a simple thing as a beautiful spring day. I savor all the golden moments. Most important, being a dialysis patient has brought my wife, always close to me, immeasurably closer. That's worth everything. Even that schooner of beer.

THE IMPACT OF FEDERAL FUNDING Long-Term Dialysis Programs: New Selection Criteria, New Problems The following transcript is adapted from a case con- ference held in the Barnes and Wohl Hospitals, St. Louis, Missouri. The participants are members of the Departments of Internal Medicine and Pathology of the Washington University School of Medicine. Dr. Renee Fox, professor and chairman of the De- partment of Sociology at the University of Pennsyl- vania and co-author of the book The Courage to Fail, was a guest at the conference. CASE 1. A twenty-three-year-old woman w.as admitted to Barnes Hospital because of kidney failure. The patient had systemic lupus erythematosus since 1967 and was treated with steroids with good results. Over the next seven years she was hospitalized once for a stroke which resolved completely and once for control of high blood pressure. Otherwise she remained well. She completed college and taught physically handicapped children. She married and was living happily with her husband in a newly purchased home. In August 1974 upper respiratory tract symptoms and diffuse abdominal pain prompted her hospitalization elsewhere. During that hospitalization she became in- creasingly short of breath and transferred to Barnes Hos- pital in severe respiratory distress. She was found to have kidney, heart, and respiratory failure and was treated with various measures including hemodialysis. Over time there was a general improvement in her condition but her kidney failure persisted. The patient was accepted into the hemodialysis pro- gram and discharged in mid-September 1974. She and her husband entered training for home dialysis and reno- vated their basement for that purpose. She returned to her position as a teacher. Six months after discharge, the patient was functioning as a normal member of so- ciety and had maintained a normal relationship with her husband and her family. xA Hastings Center Report, June 1976 r J I - - - .01 8</page><page sequence="2">CASE 2. After several hospitalizations for early stages of severe kidney disease, a twenty-five-year-old woman was admitted to Barnes Hospital in September 1973 with overt kidney failure. In addition, she had severe high blood pressure, heart failure, and severe edema. Multiple seizures occurred and she was taken into the dialysis program. Improvement was prompt, and she was transferred to a hemodialysis center near her home five weeks after admission. The patient did poorly while on long-term outpatient dialysis. She frequently missed appointments and even skipped scheduled dialyses. She was often admitted to the hospital with fluid overload, and had gained as much as twenty pounds in a four-week period. Her diet and blood pressure were always out of control. Several observers described her as "hostile," and on numerous occasions she stated that she hated dialysis and wanted to be "normal." Her social history is of special interest. She was the youngest of seven children and had an eleventh-grade education. Both parents died when she was twelve years old. She lived with a brother and his wife until she was seventeen, when she married. She and her husband had one child, a daughter, who was four years old when they separated. The patient and her daughter lived in a rural town on a welfare income of approximately $150 a month. She also received food stamps and public aid support for her medical expenses. She had never been employed. Although she frequently expressed concern about the care of her daughter, and often used this as a reason to leave the hospital against medical advice, she spent much of her time drinking in a local tavern. She frequently left home to drink without having found someone to take care of her child. She did not handle her household or her finances adequately. When a cadaver kidney became available in November 1974, transplantation was performed. She was hospital- ized again in February 1975 with pneumonia but signed out against advice after five days. She has failed to return for outpatient visits, despite several telephone contacts, although we know she has done reasonably well from other sources. DR. GERALD PERKOFF: We would like to use the problems presented by these two patients as a basis for our discussion of the social and ethical issues that relate to long-term hemodialysis. Since the way in which dialysis units function has changed over the years, we thought it would be worthwhile to begin with the history of this particular dialysis unit. DR. EDUARDO SLATOPOLSKY: Our long-term dialysis program was started in 1966. At that time only two patients were receiving long-term hemodialysis; pres- ently we are taking care of 150 patients, and this year we will probably perform close to 20,000 dialyses. When we started, we did not have adequate space, personnel, or money-only one room and one arti- ficial kidney-and it was difficult for us to accept K most of the patients who required long-term hemo- dialysis. Fortunately, over a period of five years, this picture began to change, and there now is much bet- ter support for hemodialysis units. DR. PERKOFF: Despite the difficulties in the "old days," the morale in the unit was high. Everybody was terribly interested in what was going on and everybody worked far harder than they might have under other circumstances. Is that a correct estimate? DR. SLATOPOLSKY: I think so; also our staff was fine. You need very special kinds of nurses in a di- alysis unit. We had them then, and we have them now. They work long hours and have a demanding job, but at the same time they receive recognition for their superior work and believe that they are contributing to the care of sick patients. The dialysis unit, like an intensive care unit, is a place for nurses who are interested in action and not in making beds and writing bureaucratic reports. The physician looks at the nurse as an equal and respects her for her ability and dedication to her work. The dialysis unit is like a family. It is the contribution of all the mem- bers that makes the program a success or a failure. The selection of patients is different from what it used to be. Like any other unit in the country, we have become more liberal in accepting patients for dialysis. At present, we accept many patients who never would have been considered for dialysis ten years ago. But, regardless of how big your unit is, it is very likely that in a short period of time you will have more patients who require treatment than available openings, and a difficult situation may de- velop. I believe that if the present trend continues, we are going to find ourselves with scores of thou- sands of patients receiving dialysis in the next twenty years. DR. PERKOFF: Dr. Morrison, how do you select patients now? How do people get into the unit? DR. AUBREY MORRISON: When dialysis was first in- troduced in 1963, many arbitrary criteria were used for the acceptance of patients for hemodialysis, such as age limits, intelligence, and many other criteria which we would probably consider illogical today. Many of these decisions could be criticized in terms of making value judgments about patients. The ad- vent of federal funding removed the fiscal restraints formerly placed on many patients in terms of de- ciding whether or not to accept them for long-term dialysis. This covers approximately 90 percent of the patients coming for dialysis. At this point, some centers will accept the patient's desire to live as the criterion for selection. Certain criteria, however, based on medical decisions are probably very important. For example, one would be hesitant to accept patients with terminal metastatic malignancy, severe congestive heart failure (in whom the additional stress would probably worsen the congestive heart failure) or severe chronic obstructive lung disease. These are medical contraindications. There are also psychiatric contraindications to accep- tance. Thus, some patients are obviously poor can- A J Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences / -1-1. - -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I 9</page><page sequence="3">Y didates and others are obviously good candidates for long-term hemodialysis. However, a large proportion of patients fall into a gray zone. DR. PERKOFF: The question of "poor candidates" relates to the social problem these patients have. Miss McKevitt, will you address this topic for us? MISS PATRICIA MCKEVITT: There are a number of social and psychologic implications in hemodialysis for the dialysis patient, for his family and for the dialysis team. Although the psychosocial problems of dialysis are very complex and difficult for the patient and family to deal with, these issues also represent a significant dilemma to the dialysis team in terms of patient selection procedures and the limited alloca- tion of resources. As we are aware, a significant investment of manpower and public monies is used to treat these patients. For example, for the second patient in the protocol, it is estimated that medical care cost ranged in the neighborhood of $100,000 over the past year and a half. As part of the work-up that is performed on each patient being considered for dialysis, a psychosocial evaluation is prepared. In my opinion, at this point in time, the primary purpose of the evaluation is to iden- tify the premorbid social and psychologic problems the patient has. Then, by superimposing our knowl- edge of the many problems and pressures that dialy- sis creates, we can predict the social and psychologic problems which will be created or exacerbated by dialysis. These problems are not contraindications for selecting patients. Rather, the social and psycho- logic implications are noted and we are aware of the multiple problems the patient, family and staff must cope with. Initially, the psychologic responses that the patients have involve a sense of loss of physical integrity, a great deal of uncertainty about the future, a sense of living on borrowed time, and conflicts surround- ing their dependence upon a machine in order to live. These different stresses create a variety of reactions -anger, frustration, depression-and these are the kind of reactions that we try to help the patients re- solve while they are being initiated into their treat- ment. Of course, the psychologic and social problems of dialysis are ongoing-the uncertainty, the pressure that it places on the family to learn and to accommo- date to home dialysis, and the pressure it places on the spouse of having someone's life in his own hands. Not only is financial planning needed for treatment, but also additional financial and family problems arise when the patient cannot go back to work. The roles and responsibilities within the family are often altered, creating problems both for the person who has to give up power and responsibility, and for the person who has to accept new responsibilities. DR. PERKOFF: It is usually the patient who gives up power and responsibility? MISS MCKEVITT: Yes. If the patient is able to work a 40-hour week, sometimes the amount of energy to socialize and to participate in family and community activities is restricted. DR. PERKOFF: Thank you very much. Mrs. Fran- zen, will you go on from here and tell us a little bit about the problems which you encounter in the unit from a nursing point of view? MRS. PENNY FRANZEN: We very much encourage in- volvement on the patient's part. We like the patients to get involved in their care. We encourage them to set up their own machines and show them how to test the coils. We go to the point of having patients insert their own needles. Some patients determine their own clotting times, their own blood pressures, etc. As nurses, we like to think we are there for more than just sticking needles into patients, running machines for six to seven hours, taking needles out and sending the patients on their way. We like the patients to feel involved, to feel that they are a part of something, even if it is just setting up and getting on a machine. We find that the patient's response to this approach varies. Some patients are very enthusi- astic and get involved; they are really fun. It is fun for us and it gives us positive reinforcement. DR. PERKOFF: Do those patients have an impact on other patients in the unit? MRS. FRANZEN: They certainly do. Some of the pa- tients see them and say, "Can you really stick your- self?" Other patients sometimes say, "I don't think I could ever do that." We do not push the fact that some patients are really independent-we just make the other patients aware of it. There are patients who totally reject getting involved at all. The attitude that we, as a group of nurses, gain from the latter pa- tients is "Look, I am carrying the burden of having the disease-you at least owe me putting me on the machine and taking care of me." We try to work around this. DR. PERKOFF: I would assume the second patient we talked about today has some of the same prob- lems. MRS. FRANZEN: Yes. She was a real challenge to work with and she had a personality of her own. We really tried to work with her but, being in the satellite unit, we did not have a lot of regular contact with her. DR. PERKOFF: Did she make people angry? MRS. FRANZEN: Yes. I cannot speak for the whole group, but I would get angry with her. I worked in the acute dialysis room for awhile and, after being called in on several occasions to dialyze her because she was overloaded with fluid, I at one time asked, "What do you want from us?" All she said was that she wanted to live a normal life, which we could not offer her. DR. PERKOFF: Dr. Fox, you have a feel now for the kind of unit we have here and, as you can rec- ognize, the problems that we face are the ones every- one deals with. What is your view of this kind of situation? DR. RENEE C. FOX: I would like to emphasize the kinds of phenomena that are being dealt with in this unit, which might be premonitory of biomedical, so- cial and ethical problems that not only dialysis and Hastings Center Report, June 1976 C K J 1 - -~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 10</page><page sequence="4">Under the provisions of Section 299-1 of Public Law 92-603, pa- tients with end-stage renal disease who require hemodialysis or trans- plantation are eligible for Medicare, which will pay 80 percent of their costs. The program, administered through the Social Security Admin- istration, covers any individual in- sured under Social Security as well as a qualified individual's spouse and dependent children. While 90 to 95 percent of di- alysis and transplant patients are now eligible for Medicare, some individuals do not qualify: those who have never acquired fully or currently insured Social Security status, indigent persons, certain government employees, persons who have never worked, some farm and migratory workers, certain clergymen, staffs of some nonprofit organizations, and some foreigners. The program, which went into effect July 1, 1973, has proved more costly than anticipated. More than 23,000 patients are now en- rolled at a total cost of more than $300 million a year-about 50 per- cent higher than expected. Gov- ernment officials estimate that by the 1980s some 50,000 patients will be enrolled at a cost of $1 billion a year. Other experts predict even higher figures-perhaps 70,000 to 80,000 patients and $2 billion. The high cost of the program ap- pears to be a result of what a draft report of the House Ways and Means oversight committee called a "lack of vigorous and timely management." Reimbursement is limited by law to treatment in or supervised by kidney disease cen- ters which meet DHEW require- ments. Centers are still being paid under an interim arrangement lim- iting reimbursement to $150 a treatment but permitting higher payments if higher costs can be documented. These costs can vary enormously since patients who per- form home dialysis cost about $8,000 a year while in-center di- alysis can cost up to $30,000 a year. Social Security officials have been unable to determine whether the interim payments are too large or too little. It has also been dif- ficult to obtain data from the hun- dred or so profit-making kidney disease centers. In addition, the program has no standards that spe- cify precisely what services a phy- sician is supposed to perform for his retainer. Some physicians may claim over $100,000 a year and provide only routine care. The kidney disease program, which many see as an experiment in national health insurance, high- lights many of the cost control and administrative problems that will plague a national medical plan. transplantation will be facing in the future, but also other aspects of our health care system. However "exotic" dialysis and transplantation may seem to be when compared with other more "routine" and less dramatic forms of treatment, they seem to me to anticipate some of the problems that will eventually confront more commonplace kinds of medical care. But first, I want to backtrack a bit to comment on the picture that has been presented of your dialysis unit. It has been described as a small, closely knit, familial kind of unit with a sense of oneness in the face of the common challenges and stresses that con- front the medical team. A high level of understanding of the roles that each of the members of this complex health care team face and a high level of morale and esprit are part of that unity. The earliest medical groups that pioneered dialysis and transplantation had these characteristics. Never was a situation more grim than in those "black years" of clinical research on dialysis and transplantation when uncertainty, risk, "failure" and death were omnipresent. But, par- adoxically, never was the spirit of the patients, of the nurses, of the technicians, of the social workers and of the physicians higher. Your unit here seems to have developed and retained something like that kind of feeling: intimacy, meaningful commitment and expectancy. I have become increasingly aware of the existence of a number of dialysis units in the United States in which your kind of familial, dedicated and hopeful morale no longer exists. To some extent, this is an unintended consequence of the passage in 1972 of Public Law 92-603, which extended financial cover- age under Medicare to the treatment costs of dialysis and renal transplantation. Ostensibly, this looks like K the kind of needed fiscal development that we have been waiting for in our entire health care delivery system. In fact, as you remember, in the 1960's when our involvement in the war in Southeast Asia was at its height, there was a sense in which dialysis and transplantation became symbolic of everything that was wrong with our system of delivery of health care. Recurrently we heard the following kind of statement made: "We have billions of dollars to spend on war, death and destruction, but we do not have enough money for everybody who needs to be treated with a dialysis machine, or who needs a transplant to have one." Now we do provide such coverage, and in a rather chastening way we find ourselves confronted with a whole new series of problems. It is almost as if we were discovering that equality (at least when simply or mechanistically defined) is not enough to make for an ideal health care delivery system. Some dialysis units are experiencing a loss of the sense of morale that you still enjoy, and beyond that of belief in the whole dialysis enterprise. Now that di- alysis is financially available to all it has become harder for some teams to justify denying this mode of treatment to anyone in renal failure. Yet they doubt that it is medically, socially, psychologically or finan- cially correct to just use the machine for all such pa- tients. Some units are beginning to experience problems that grow out of the changing social as well as medi- cal composition of the patients who now come to di- alysis. Again, in terms of ultimate American beliefs in justice, equality and universalism, it is good that peo- ple who are poor as well as those who are rich, peo- ple who live in the inner city as well as those from the suburbs and the exurbs, can now have access to A&lt; Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences ? J ol 11</page><page sequence="5">these modalities of treatment if they need them. But patients who are economically deprived, who have a minimum of formal education, who do not have intact families, who are dispirited by their unemployment and poverty present a whole array of problems that have implications for their experiences with dialysis. For example, it may not be possible to offer them di- alysis if the plumbing in their homes is inadequate, or if there is no family member on whom they can rely for operating the machine. Even in-hospital dialysis begins to raise certain kinds of questions. The sec- ond patient, for example, becomes a more frequent kind of experience now for many dialysis units than the first patient who, aside from her lupus erythema- tosus, is almost too good to be true. She is young, well educated, middle-class, and has a good marriage. DR. PERKOFF: I would like to amplify-the person who cannot undergo dialysis at home because the home is not adequate or because his educational level is not adequate contributes to what Dr. Slatopolsky described earlier as the "full" center. The fact that the patient occupies a bed impacts the ability to take another patient into the program. So, the entire change in social class affects the main program as well as the outside program. DR. FOX: Yes, very much so. In addition, the pas- sage of Public Law 92-603 raises some other spectre- like questions. Most prominently, there is the whole question of why renal disease and not other cata- strophic diseases is being covered in this way. The answer lies partly in the fact that the National Kidney Foundation campaigned for the particular disease entity around which they are organized. In fact, one of the officers of the National Kidney Foundation went to Washington and appeared before the House of Representatives with his wife, who gave him dialy- sis in that chamber. Its emotional impact on the Con- gressmen and Congresswomen present was enormous. It was a shrewd tactic, but it begins to raise some very, very difficult questions if you keep in mind the total health care system. There is the whole question of whether this is the way we want to reform our health care system, through lobbying for particular disease groups. There is also the question of how much all this will cost the taxpayers of America, and whether this is the proper allocation of irreducibly scarce resources. There is still another area of consideration. As the comments made by the nurse and the social worker have suggested, in order for people to do well with di- alysis, a special combination of total compliance and active collegial collaboration with the medical team is called for. Two sets of counter-attitudes have to be brought together. On the one hand, for example, pa- tients receiving dialysis have to be scrupulous about their diet, their medications, and taking care of their shunt or fistula. On the other hand, if patients just lie passively on the machine, and let the machine, the nurse or the technician do everything, dialysis does not work very well. The degree of input the patient makes to the dialysis process seems to make a dif- K ference in the quality of the medical results. As a so- cial scientist, I would hypothesize that this blend of acquiescence and active collaboration ideally re- quired by dialysis is more frequently present in people who come from certain kinds of social backgrounds than from others. It is inequitably distributed, in this sense, making it potentially easier, for example, for middle-class, educated persons to comply and col- laborate in this way than for persons from more deprived backgrounds. The "quality of life" that many patients experience on dialysis presents still other problems. It is not un- common for them to refer to that machine as a "mi- raculous monster," or some reasonable facsimile of that phrase. Although they view the machine as "miraculously" rescuing them from death, they also regard it as a constantly fettering, anthropomorphic presence in their life. Typically, such patients look forward to a transplant as a deliverance even though they are sufficiently expert in their own condition and the state of the art so that they know they will even- tually experience a rejection, which will return them to dialysis, which will make them eligible for another transplant and, subsequently, another rejection reac- tion-in an endless wheel. Neither dialysis nor trans- plantation releases patients from this chronic way of dying. Now that dialysis is financially available to all it has become harder for some teams to justify denying this mode of treatment to any- one in renal failure. Yet they doubt that it is medically, socially, psychologically or finan- cially correct to use the machine for all cases. Renee Fox DR. PERKOFF: Your comments have been directed, quite appropriately, at the way the patient interacts in this setting, but I know that in the course of your work you encountered many physicians who dealt with this sort of problem. What kinds of people are they? DR. FOX: To begin with, the way the members of the medical team feel about dialysis seems to make an impact on how well patients do with this treatment. For example, the mecca of hemodialysis is still Seat- tle, where the belief in this form of therapy is high. Dr. Belding Scribner, inventor and godfather of the shunt which makes long-term dialysis possible, is professor of medicine there. He and the medical pro- fessionals who work with him believe in the "good- ness" of dialysis. The community of Seattle is proud of the dialysis enterprise. A kind of self-fulfilling prophecy is involved here. The fact that the medical team and patients have faith in dialysis, and especially 2 Hastings Center Report, June 1976 I.- 12</page><page sequence="6">home dialysis, has felicitous consequences for how well this treatment works in Seattle. But it is also true that Seattle has a certain social composition. In contrast to Philadelphia, for instance, where I live and work, Seattle has no extremes of wealth and poverty, and the population is predominantly white and Protestant. It is a much more homogeneous and solidly middle-class kind of populace. As a conse- quence, some of the more recent social problems with which other dialysis centers are now grappling are not as salient in the Seattle experience. But my general impression is that compared with the 1950s and even the 1960s, more physicians and nurses are now involved in dialysis who are skeptical about its merits, and yet who feel compelled to continue to do it despite their reservations. DR. PERKOFF: Does it seem to make a great differ- ence when that happens? DR. FOX: Yes, it does. Peculiarly enough, those per- forming dialysis who have some historic perspective on its evolution, as your team here does, seem to be subject to more strain in some of the centers I have seen than those medical professionals who are rela- tively new to the field. The people who are just com- ing into the field are fresh to it; they do not compare the situation now with "the good old days" when di- alysis units were small, closely knit, inspired, familial. The life history of a nurse in association with dialysis, incidentally, tends to be short. There is a high turn- over in this area, perhaps because some of the stresses we have identified are borne particularly by nurses and technicians who run the dialysis ma- chines, every day and night, and who have to deal in a face to face, personified way with the prob- lems and dilemmas of dialysis. It is virtually a socio- logic axiom that regardless of how cheerfully the members of the medical team may present them- selves to the patients, if in their heart of hearts they have deep doubts about the dialysis enterprise, it is likely that patients will pick up these doubts. In some dialysis units, the solidaristic community of patients who are experts in their own diseases, who actively and passively collaborate in their treatment, and who initiate new patients into what might be called the "culture" of dialysis no longer exists. When such a community is present, it gives a great deal of support to the members of the medical team as well as to the patients. A second source of sup- port and morale common both to patients and medi- cal professionals in this situation is a vigorous re- search program, and the hope of a scientific "break- through" with positive clinical implications that it holds forth. In the 1950s as compared with the 1970s, more such research was occurring in con- junction with the early development of dialysis and renal transplantation. When there are no significant research vistas and when there is insufficient patient Y solidarity to be generative of patient clubs (like the "Adrenalectomy Club" and the "Mended Hearts Club" that existed on the metabolic ward I studied earlier), staff morale is more difficult to maintain. K A DR. PERKOFF: Frequently, we justify research in academic medical centers as our academic respon- sibility to contribute to knowledge. Clearly, that is so, and clearly also, research is a valued item in society. But basically what you said is that the research in a renal unit provides a psychologic support system for people who are dealing with an otherwise chronic and indeterminant kind of outcome. DR. FOX: I think of research as serving the func- tion of ritualizing optimism in this respect. From a sociologic or anthropologic point of view, this sug- gests that scientific research has magical as well as scientific implications. For example, the current phy- sicianly hope that a "breakthrough" in the area of immunology may be imminent, from which may not only come a better understanding of the rejection reaction, but also of cancer, helps to make it possible for people to go on in this still grim, uncertainty- fraught field of transplantion. One of the primary functions of magic, anthropologists have taught us, is to ritualize optimism in the face of uncertainty, risk and a high emotional vested interest in outcome. So, there is an element of "scientific magic" here. In the way of final remarks, I think we should men- tion that although the two patients presented today are representative of some of the most positive po- tentialities and greatest problems of dialysis, they are unrepresentative in at least one way. Both pa- tients are women, whereas a greater number of pa- tients with end-stage renal disease are men. In home dialysis, for example, the role reversal implied when the patient on the machine is a man, and the person helping to dialyze him is a woman-his wife-is problematic for some couples. There is one last major phenomenon associated with the cases presented that we have not mentioned. Should "the will to live" be a major criterion in determining whether to subject a patient to dialysis or to continue dialysis once begun? If so, then how would one tell whether or not the second patient wants to live? On one level, it would seem that this woman is signalling to the medical team that she does not want to stay alive if this is the way it has to be done. But the patient also seems to be indicating that she does not want to die. How does one appraise the quality of such patients' desire to live, and should one try to? And over this whole area of consideration looms the question of whether an unconscious or conscious decision of a patient not to continue with dialysis is a suicidal act, or simply a decision to die a "natural death." Here one begins to catch sight of some of the most awesome moral and metaphysical dilemmas that face medical professionals, patients and their families involved with dialysis.
