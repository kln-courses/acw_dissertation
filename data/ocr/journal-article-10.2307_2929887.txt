<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc Eli Blanchard On Still Life In 1974 and 1976 there appeared in France and Switzerland two imposing books, Le Grand Siecle de la nature morte en France and La vie silencieuse en France.' The first book deals with still life in the seventeenth century and the other with still life in the eighteenth century. First attracted by the lavish photography, the reader is soon disappointed to find that most of the copious text accompanying the photographs is actually nothing more nor less than a narrative reconstructing the lives of some of the more famous still life painters. Accordingly, the description of objects originally set apart from the course of daily life is replaced by the story of the men and women who are thought to have practiced still life as a "divertissement," an exercise to take their minds away from the preoccupations of real history (war, famine, class conflicts, etc.). In a book designed to extoll the virtues of an unduly neglected genre, Mssrs. Fare have managed to perpetuate a tradition of exclusion which goes from Pliny, who disparaged still life as riparographia or "low painting," to Lebrun, who advised his students never to take their eyes from the realities of classical history and epic poetry. In this tradition the denial of a still life effect is based on the principle that the representation of objects of daily life is static only because it is severed from the narrative sequence with which the object is associated. As Proust remarked in the course of his meditation on the work of the painter Elstir, there is something extremely provoking in a painting leaving us with the picture of an unfinished meal and forcing us, at least so we think, to rewrite the story suggested by the decor. IFare, Michel, Le grand sicle de la Nature morte le J7e sicle en France: (Paris, Fribourg, 1974); Michel et Fabrice Fare, La vie silencieuse en France (La nature morte au XVIIe), (Paris, Fribourg, 1976). 276</page><page sequence="2">Marc Eli Blanchard I I will argue that all still life is a challenge to narrativity and constitutes a praise of the virtues of description. It is as though time, the time it takes to paint stories, had stopped and the painter, refusing to assert his authority, had attempted to suggest that there is, in the representation of space composed, yet unappropriated, of rooms not entered, of tables not cleared, a time made for meditation and repose. Just as descriptions in a novel often cause a delay in the narrative (we are invited to inspect Balzac's pension Vauquer before reading about the inextricable life story of each of the characters; we stop with Bloom one foot in the door of Burton's restaurant to gaze at the crowd of wolfers and guzzlers, only to decide upon inspection that this is not where we want to eat), still life represents tableaux that do not move us. Or do they? This reference to a static quality in the representation of daily things has always been included in the term "still life." Yet it is interesting that the stillness is usually taken as connoting a minor mode, often if not always tranquil, sometimes elegiac, mournful or awesome. A still life, after all, is only a "nature morte." That the absence perceived in still life painting has led to a negative approach to it, there can be no doubt. Friedlander, whose famous work on landscape and still life devotes the lion's share to the study of landscape painting, feels that a few pages at the end of his book are more than enough to deal with the problems of still life proper. He is not alone in this.2 Still life lacks a subject, and while the reader of a novel can well imagine how an interior described in the book would look in reality, while the spectator of a landscape painting can read the many ways in which this landscape is filled with suggestions of human presence, a still life painting is immediately interpreted as denying a human presence. It is said that Balzac, contemplating a certain pastoral landscape with only a house and no characters visible in it exclaimed: "But what are 2Fridelainder, Max J., Landscape; portrait; still life, (Oxford, 1949). Most of the criticism on still life takes for granted the tradition of still life as a minor genre, i.e., subordinates a study of still life itself to historical and narrative considerations. 277</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies they are doing in there? I wonder what they are talking about. Was the harvest good? Are they in arrears?". Thus, for the narrator and his reader, the notion of a representation without human figure lacks meaning. This might explain the compromises attempted from the beginning of the history of still life to combine the representation of things with that of an agent, a person or a simulacrum charged with displaying them. Such is the case from Barbieri's "Game Vendor" where a shopkeeper is shown proudly offering choice game, to de Chirico's "The Uncertainty of the Past" where a naked torso mounts guard over a huge display of fresh bananas.3 In painting where there seems to be absolutely no indication of human presence one can even notice a trace, a faint suggestion of life. Thus, in works of the mannerist or grotesque tradition, a basket or a bowl filled with fruit or vegetables will still show drops of water on a skin too plump and juicy for words. Elsewhere, utensils carefully positioned on a kitchen table temporarily abandoned byfthe mistress of the house or her servant, silverware, misplaced, overturned or carefully balanced atop a cupboard, a fruit cut up by a mysterious preparer and whose parts do not actually match, all point to the invisible hand of the painter and suggest an outside reference. But to approach still life painting from the outside is to make the representation of objects in it the mere product of an ideology, whose references are to a narrative text, a story underlying the painting and which can only be reconstructed outside the limits of that painting. This reconstruction involves either an investigation of the historical sources of the painting or the elaboration of a structural model for a class of paintings, a genre of which the painting under study is only a part. In the first case, the reader is only given an equivalent or an analogue of the work. This is the ideology of the Fare books. In the other case, the search for a deductive model which would account for an organization, a prag- matics of space, is based on the reduction of objects to topoi of possible actions. If there are live figures in the painting, what do they do in the painting? How do they fit in with the objects 3Marin, Louis, Etudes s&amp;miologiques, (Paris, 1971), pp. 92-94. 278</page><page sequence="4">Marc Eli Blanchard around them? If there are no live figures, what is the position of each object vs. the other and how is this position suggestive of the conclusion of or the prelude to an action? The question then is less of the purpose they fulfill than of the place they occupy. Thus Louis Marin tries to show that the same historical references which explain paintings by Poussin and Lebrun will also explain paintings of still life and interiors by Baugin and Chardin. According to Marin, a historical account of the development of still life painting in terms of an ascending bourgeoisie's preference for middle class interiors instead of heroic scenes can be paralled with a semiotic analysis showing that the principles of still life composition are similar to those of noble painting. In this interpretive context, there is no functional difference between the representation of a person and that of an object: both serve to construct the narrative space of a subject. Let us note in passing that this structural interpretation is actually based on an anthropomorphic view of the narrative process, i.e., that narratives can only be understood in terms of the action of animate subjects upon objects animate or inanimate (a view which structural- ists also tend to reject because it would make the interpretation of narrative dependent on the ineffable, and ultimately unstructurable existence of a human subject). There is a tradition of this difference, however, and it is a religious one. In the Middle Ages, when most scholars agree that still life as such is inexistent (it is generally agreed that the tradition of still life painting begins with the 1504 painting of a fowl hung on a wall by Jacopo da Barbari), paintings of saints are adorned on their back side with representations of objects or instruments emblematic of the saint and emphasizing the religious context of the image on the front. Thus Sterling can give as an example of emerging still life a "Virgin with child" by an artist from the circle of Roger van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes, where the obverse of the painting is occupied by the painting of a niche with a washbowl and books on one side and of a towel on the other.4 Here the ornamental motif is still conceived in a purely 4Sterling, Charles, Still Life Painting from Antiquity to the Present Time, a new revised edition, transl. by J. Emmons, (Paris, New York, 1959), plate 9. 279</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies religious context (the purification suggested by the washbowl and the towel, the knowledge and wisdom associated with reading the Scriptures). However, with this dual disposition the painter has made possible a shift from subject to context in the mind of the spectator. He has made possible the juxtaposition of a painting of a Virgin on one side, with objects which serve not only as indexes but also effectively substitute for it, on the other. Because those objects are represented on the other side of the canvas they occupy their own space, distinct from that occupied by the representation of the Virgin.5 The spectator is thus invited to explore contextual references for the work before him by investigating what if anything exists on the other side of established religious reality. But the passage, the travel to a beyond of the sacred representa- tion is still relatively safe. What the religious spectator discovers is that the back of the painting is designed merely to remind him of the importance of the front side. It is as though he were allowed to find behind the sacred picture (the Virgin) another picture, that of a common reality prearranged in conformity with divine inspiration. It is interesting to note that what is being described here as a passage from the symbolic object to its context actually occurs the other way around in medieval life. More often than not, as Sterling is quick to note, it is the contextual reference which appears to pave the way for a religious reading of the painting. Thus single objects, instead of being painted on the obverse of a canvas or an inlaid panel which must be turned over for them to appear, are positioned on the folding section of a tryptich or polyptich usually closed and opened only in conjunction with a religious service. In this way, the spectator is made to appreciate the secret religious value of daily life. Only at certain times will he be allowed to graduate from a vision of the object of daily use to the ritual object inside the polyptich. The apprehension of reality can thus be made in two ways, each one bringing out a different aspect of the relationship between subject and context and thus making it possible to posit two distinct methods through which the 5Sterling, pp. 28-29. 280</page><page sequence="6">Marc Eli Blanchard descriptive intent of the painter relates to a narrative project. Either the spectator is led from the sacred picture-and the familiar narrative behind it-to the attributes on the back (and the descrip- tive mood they require) or the reverse. That a picture of the Virgin is worth a thousand words, that it is itself representative of the story of God become man as Christ, there is very little doubt. Most of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance are full of pictures representing variations on the story of Christ: first with the Annunciation and then with the Divine Child. Yet the fact that this representation is often arrived at through the depiction of objects of daily life points to a fundamental ambiguity in the religious vision of the believer. On the one hand, the world is comprehensible only in terms of the religious figures explaining it, giving it support (the Virgin and the story of Christ), and the presence of these figures need only be suggested to illuminate the pictures of any variety of objects in whose presence they happen to have been staged. The spectator is then able to order the world according to an origin, a principle of explanation, and the painting before him is merely a testimony of how the world is in accordance with this principle. Everywhere the believer looks he sees the divine presence. Simple objects of daily life which may also have a function in the certification of the religious symbol, in the sense that they are its metonyms (the washbowl means purity of body and the sacred books mean purity of mind, both of which are requisites for a contemplation of the Virgin), now appear themselves symbolic of it: they repeat it. And repeating it they make it clear. They are transparent. They are mere vehicles or media. The books, whose lines we cannot read, speak clearly to the story of the dogma; the washbowl's picture is understandable only in terms of the function it brings to mind; the unused towel is waiting to accommodate the user of the washbowl. Left to themselves, however, these objects become opaque. It is as if their representation could only be read deductively in relation to a model: the still life on the back of the canvas receives its life (its raison d'eitre) from the front of it. The representation of everyday reality is thus included in and guaranteed 281</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies by that of the principal episodes in a religious narrative ordering every Christian existence. On the other hand, once the spectator is confronted with this reality, he is also free to do exactly the reverse. From a contemplation of the object, he can also infer the divine presence. His feeling of religious relevance is thus paradoxically enhanced by the percep- tion of a lack of destination and purpose in the object as such, and this is where the vicinity, the contiguousness of the two representations (that of the saint or the Virgin on the front and the other on the back of the canvas or on a separate part of the polyptich which can be folded over) is of capital importance. Temporarily confused by the irruption of a profane reality, the spectator knows how to assuage his passing doubts: he simply opens the polyptich or turns over the canvas. Through this super- imposition, the world becomes clear anew. In some paintings where the still life, instead of being separated from the representation of a religious character, is contiguous with it, the dichotomy of reference between front and back of the canvas turns into a dialectic between parts of the same scene. The spectator's gaze wanders ceaselessly from the subject of the painting to the object in it. This is very clear with a miniature by the Master of Mary of Burgundy in the Bodleian Library where a scene of adoration of the Magi in the upper right section of the miniature is framed by pictures of objects with various degrees of symbolism. Thus a peacock feather emerging from a vase on the upper left is a traditional allusion to the Virgin while also a counterpart to a bunch of flowers in a glass at the bottom right and to the fruit in a bowl at the base of the miniature, themselves probable analogues of the gifts brought by the Wise Men in the story on the upper right. The other objects, encased on the left, are not forgotten either. Thus the empty vase is a reminder a contrario of the vase full of flowers, and the empty plate above it, of the plates with food on the lower right. It is with this dialectic that the emancipation of still life begins and that the problems associated with describing an object, any object outside its narrative context, take their full importance. 282</page><page sequence="8">Marc Eli Blanchard The fundamental problem, however, is one of code and context, or to put it another way, the relationship between metaphorical and metonymical order, and the difficulty inherent in breaking the relationship between metonymical and metaphorical process. For, if there always is a necessary connection between code and context of the locutor, the listener, the painter and his spectator, this special connection is guaranteed by the teleology implicit in the elaboration of any work of art: the meaning of any part of the message cannot be separated from the totality of the message itself and this totality is a religious one. A religious connotation is thus automatically the representation of any part of the profane world. Or rather it is impossible to conceive of a world not explained by a reference to religion. Any medieval representation which does not reflect this principle exposes itself to censure and there is indeed little trace of such painting in the Middle Ages, because the meaninglessness resulting from an absence of relation between the Christian ideal and the representation of a profane context can always be prevented by a reference to a narrative telos. A very interesting paradigm for this Weltanschaaung is supplied by Augustine in Book 10 of his Confessions, where he reviews areas of his physical life which he still has difficulty integrating with the Christian dogma. He writes of his fear that the pleasure of the senses may harm his faith and he asks for God's assistance in controlling impulses detrimental to his religious experience. Because of the frightening possibility that objects, things in the world, especially those that excite the senses, may have a power of their own, Augustine is not quite able to integrate the outside world with the new ideology to which he has now made allegiance. He finds that the temptations of his past and present fantasy life remain and are not simply eliminated by the story of his conversion. In this sense, his description of objects, particularly those pleasurable to his sight, reminds us of the painting of separate objects in still life where Christian ideology is made problematic by the apparent lack of a narrative frame of reference: For light, the queen of colors, pervades all that I see, wherever I am throughout the day, and by the ever-changing pattern of its rays it entices me even when I am occupied with something else and take no special note of it. 283</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies ... But the true light is the light which Tobias saw when, though his eyes were blind, he taught his son the path he should follow in life, and himself led the way, charity guiding his steps so that he did not stray.6 This problematics is made very clear by a painting by Paolo Uccello in the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino, "The profanation of the Host," which displays a single object, albeit placing it in a context and giving it a meaning which prevents us from considering it autonomous. The Host is not a "Ding as Sich." Not only is it generally a part of the Christian liturgy and history but here it is also the object of a secular narrative inscribed on a polyptich which can be opened and where the action can be displayed. In fact, the Uccello polyptich does not describe a particular object. By referring to the ritual of the Host it does not consider the Host as such. Ony the narrative leading to the punishment incurred for the profanation, i.e., taking the object out of its sacred context, is treated by the painter. The woman sells the Host to the pawnbroker to redeem her cloak, on the one hand, and the pawnbroker and his family attempt to burn the Host in the fireplace, on the other hand, Yet, if there can be no doubt about the enormity of the crime, there is more to the story than the play of a transgression motif. To eat the Host as one would any food, is, of course, a crime in the perspective of the Church. But it is also a symbolic gesture leading to the end of a representation based on mediation. As Hegel showed so well, only animals eat whatever they desire because the only way they can appropriate an object, a part of the world, is to make it consubstantial with their own body. In still life painting, the object is no longer mediated, repeating something else beside it (in the way in which the picture of an object repeats or illustrates a concept). It is present and it tempts as an unexpected dish would tempt the appetite. The narrative disappears and what was supposed to have been but an illustration and a proof of the divine presence becomes an indication of lack and trespass albeit of another kind-of a chance taken with the constraints of signification. Sacred objects, divested of the 6Saint Augustine, Confessions, X, 34, trans. R. S. Pine-Cofin, (Baltimore, 1961), pp. 239-240. 284</page><page sequence="10">Marc Eli Blanchard religious context which protects them and maintains them each in their specific place, become symbols of all that threatens the established order and spells chaos. From simple indexes and adorn- ments they now have become traces of a world which is either absent or associated with the Other. There are in medieval literature and culture various instances of such a play with the Other.7 But perhaps the clearest example is the painting by a Netherlandish master (about 1580) now at the Abbe-Museum in Eindhoven, where a table covered with victuals stands between a servant and a scene entitled "Temptation of Christ" which she is presumably spying on.8 The representation of lavish food displays against a religious background is meant to warn of the dangers of unmediated desire. Yet unlike the "Profanation of the Host," most still life do not trigger a narrative which would place them in an explicit context. Conse- quently they remain uncommitted and play with a transgression they faintly suggest and faintly oppose. For a good part of the late Middle Ages and until the end of the seventeenth century, that is, until a change in economic condi- tions made the representation of a mundane world (money, the bourgeois interior, the vicissitudes of daily life) acceptable, still life painting is taboo, and what little of it there is only serves to remind the Christian of the dangers of description. Whence the severe paintings by the "Maitres de la Realite," the "vanites" full of skulls and bones, the paintings of the five senses. There, depiction is symbolic and symbolic in one way only. It shows the 70n this, see Curtius, E. R., European Literature and the Late Latin Middle Ages, trans. W. Trask, (New York, 1953), pp. 183-202: A description of the "ideal landscape" is not always as innocent as it appears at first. It is interesting to note that the grove, which is viewed only as a happy place in Late Latin literature by Curtius, becomes the gate of Hell in Dante. See also this fascinating example given by Curtius (p. 200): When Paradise was to be represented on the stage, there were stage directions such as those at the beginning of the Anglo-French play of Adam: "Sint in eo (in paradise) diversae arbores et fructus in eis dependentes ut amoenissimus locus videatur". Is this to say that the spectators were allowed to succumb to the fascination with the forbidden fruit as long as they could remain within the confines of the theatrical representation? 'In Bergstrom, Ingvar, Dutch Still Life painting in the seventeenth century, (New York, 1956), p. 23. 285</page><page sequence="11">Yale French Studies inverse of narrative painting, by displaying the lack, the vacuum created by the lack of spiritual reality. From the end of the seventeenth century and well up to the appearance of Cubist and abstract painting, when the distinction between subject and object, inside and outside is finally exploded, still life painting remains an ambiguous metonym in the world of metaphorical representation. The later period, particularly the eighteenth century in which bourgeois historicism establishes production and the product itself as the ultimate paradigm, is full of the seductions of still life. It is the period of Chardin and de la Porte, of Largilliere. Yet even after the Cubist explosion, there remains a sense of the separation, the exclusiveness of still life. Both Braque and Picasso enjoy and further its tradition. That the status of still life is determined by a struggle between the safe resolution of narrative and the opeh vagaries of the unknown description, is clear. A painting by Rubens, "Philopoemen, general of the Achaeans, recognized by a maid servant" at the Louvre makes this undebatable (See Plate 1). Heaped on a table up front, albeit Plate 1: "Philopoemen, general of the Achaeans, recognized by a maid servant": with permission of the Louvre. 286</page><page sequence="12">Marc Eli Blanchard partially in the shade, victuals seem to fill up the room and offer themselves to the spectator without prior solicitation or warning. Due to the indistinct accumulation of poultry and vegetables, the painting is more overwhelming than exciting. The light is poor all around the room. Only the victuals, most of which are of a startling white, are visible. It is only when, barely recovering from the dazzle of food display, the spectator turns his attention to the left of the painting that he notices there a scene with a commotion between three characters, one of whom is presumably Philopoemen trying to avoid recognition. There is probably a link with the fact that the food on the table, although plainly visible, is hard to recognize, and the fact that Philopoemen, incognito, is hiding in the kitchen. More generally, however, it is the display of objects without apparent function or finality which obfuscates the reality of what goes on in a painting. It is because he is temporarily dazzled by the display of food that the spectator fails to identify and localize important events. Thrown to the left, the historical scene of recognition thus represents the saving grace and the morality of the still life it is associated with. It also suggests, however, that the production and the contempla- tion of any still life is based on an undecidable. If the representation of objects without human figure tends to conceal a relation to a hidden or undiscovered human presence, this relation remains unclear (why is the kitchen table loaded with so much food and why was it left to a maidservant to identify the general?-Even Plutarch does not say). In any case, the delay in the narrative is only temporary. Philopoemen cannot stop being what he is and history, his story, must continue. But let us dwell on the relation between the two parts of the painting. It is obvious that the table on which the fowl are laid out represents a tableau de genre. More to the point, this tableau de genre only hints at the action. To be sure, dead animals are part of a cycle (hunting and cooking) interrupted by the unexpected intrusion of Philopoemen: the old servant is in charge of preparing the meals for the army camping beyond the frame of reference of the painting. However, whether the painter meant to refer to past (the killing and gathering of animals for the kitchen) or future action (the cooking and preparation of 287</page><page sequence="13">Yale French Studies the food for the army), Rubens' painting represents an intermission, a separate moment in the succession of events. And it is the privileging of the separate moment which poses a problem. The representation of the necessities of daily life by implying a reference to a human subject is directly associated with that of narrative continuum in general. Still life is authorized by a conceptual reference to time past. It exists only in relation to that time: the time when the object produced by the painting was something else than this object-in-the-painting. This relation to the past is soon duplicated by another one, which is paralled to it: the object in the painting which has a relation to the real object in the past (e.g., the dead animals were live animals before they became game) also has one to a real object in the future. Those pieces of game will soon constitute part of someone's festive dinner. For the moment, however seized, frozen by the hand of the painter, they are timeless, taken out of a continuum. Rubens' "Philopoemen"-which is supposed to be Rubens' only still life, the painter having always concentrated on historical or mythological paintings-has to this day been considered unfinished. It is also thought to be very much unlike Rubens in general and many critics see in the painting the joint hand of Snyders and Rubens. Snyders would have worked on the still life part and Rubens on the incipient historical part. Be that as it may, this dual assessment of the unfinished quality and of joint authorship only sets in better relief the momentary quality of "Philopoemen. " In the context of an undecidable, still life now takes the form of a metaphor: previously an index of the divine presence, it has now become a representation, a sign of its absence. Soon, we'll have the vanites with skulls and bones where nonnarrativeness (that is to say, the quality of a narrative no longer organized in reference to the divine word) subtly undermines the still life mode. It should be noted again that this metaphorization of still life, which occurs around the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century, is not simply a reflection of historical develop- ments (the rise of the bourgeoisie). It expresses a structural necessity. Already in the wall-paintings of Pompei, skulls and bones often accompany the display of victuals. Because no connection can be 288</page><page sequence="14">Marc Eli Blanchard made there with the development of a theme of the guilty conscience, it must be admitted that the presence of the skull is a functional one. It serves to pose the question of reality: what is it that we think we enjoy in the representation of still life painting? An affirmation or a denial? On the other hand, the painters of the late seventeenth and eighteenth century, the Chardin and de la Porte whom Diderot thought were playing a trick on nature itself, those of the nineteenth and even the Cubists and the contemporary painters, enjoy the illusion. There too, the heritage is an old one. It goes back to Pliny's stories of Apelle and Zeuxis attempting to fool one another by competing for the ultimate realism. In this tradition, it is indeed idleness which is glorified. Time is allowed for luxurious contempla- tion, in the certainty that the present exists and that it is well deserved. It is interesting to see how this vision is actually the result of a reversal of signs. The objects, which with seventeenth- and sixteenth-century painters were signalling the dangers of desire, have now become the profane "instruments de la musique," the "armes de l'intelligence" in a display of symbolic vocabulary. Metaphysics has been expelled from representation. Yet, when one comes really close to a work by Chardin, one discovers the lines of the drawing and colors of the painting have also lost something: seen close up, they are nothing like what they appear at a distance. The discovery of idle time has now been internalized as a form of the painting itself. Narrative reference has now been replaced by a search for structure free from the motivations of reality which will continue until the abstract painters. Basically, however, still life remains the special locus of the insertion of an idle representation into reality. And it is to determine the exact point of this insertion which I will be attempting here. It is this special locus which I have chosen to examine here by studying a painting which belongs to the negative first category: the "Still Life with Chess" (ca. 1630) by Baugin, one of the acknowledged "Maitres de la Realite." Because paintings of the first category are the ones which really present the problematics of still life as that of an imposible difference, it is with them that I have chosen to begin. (See Plate 2) 289</page><page sequence="15">Yale French Studies Plate 2: "Still Life with Chess": with permission of the Louvre II This painting by Baugin has been understood in terms of its symbolic content. The objects are only in reference to modes of living of which the painter seems to disapprove: the dissipation and debauchery suggested by the knave of clubs, whose heart appears, as if by some trick, outside his body-an allusion, perhaps, to the romantic adventures of adventurous young men. Another refer- ence can be made to the five senses (through the mirror, the flowers, the bread, the wine and the mandolin, but it is weak: the mirror does not really reflect, the mandolin is turned over on the table, the bread has not been broken, and neither the purse nor the chess case has been opened). Finally, an investigation into Renais- sance and post-Renaissance symbology suggests that Baugin may have followed a strictly pre-established iconology.9 The three carnations would stand for the Trinity; the bread and the wine for the Eucharist. The painting would thus be divided according to two 9See: Guy de Tervarent, Attributs et symboles dans I'art profane (1450-1600), (Geneva, 1958). 290</page><page sequence="16">Marc Eli Blanchard areas of reference: one, profane in the forefront, the other religious in the background. This may be a transference from the famous scheme of "Christ and Mary in the house of Martha," where Christ and his mother are usually placed in the background of a painting whose forefront is occupied by a display of victuals (Velazquez, Aertsen, Beuckelaer and others). The morality is evident: beware of the pleasures of the flesh. This interpretation, however, is too simplistic. The suggestion that some of the objects are indexes of lewdness is ambiguous. For instance, while it seems plausible to interpret the bread and the wine as indexes of the Eucharist, they are also part of an emblematics of all the senses (in the picture: taste, touch, sight). The division of the painting in two areas of meaning, two semantic fields, thus turns into a superimposition inextricably linking the sensible with the intelligible and pleasure with the pain of restraint. Besides, evil in the form of debauchery has really not been allowed to enter the representation, and while there is in some of the objects a reference to potential dissipation, they remain pure themselves: unaffected by the greed or the waste with which they might be associated, they are not a part of the context to which they only allude. With this distinction between the object as index of dissipation and the object as nonreferential but standing for itself, a representation emerges outside a fixed interpretive context. Paradoxically, because of the alleged intention of the painter to use objects in his painting as merely referring to something else which morality forbids him to detail-to detail it would be to display it and to display it would be tantamount to succumbing to the temptation (the mandolin, the knave of clubs) or to appearing sacri- legious (the Trinity, the bread and the wine)-his painting remains only the painting of those objects. In a curious sense, what still life painting offers is a residue. That which remains in the process of looking beyond the object is actually not an adequation of the form of the object with a form in the mind but rather the result of the complete fulfillment of the descriptor's purpose. In the process of referring to something else which it isn't but for which it stands, the representation makes perfectly clear that what it is is obscure. 291</page><page sequence="17">Yale French Studies Thus the mirror is a mirror in which we cannot see the reflection of the world. The question then is: what is a mirror which doesn't reflect? What is an instrument which is not to be played or a deck of cards that is not to be used? Though there is in these objects an indication of the use to which they can be put, their present fate is now to be useless. Yet in this uselessness there is the suggestion of a temptation: not simply that they might be used, but that they might be interesting in themselves. A painting like Baugin's makes apparent the prestiges of still life: it displays the lack which it cannot fulfill. While this particular still life offers these prestiges in the context of a specific reading chart (the five senses, the Eucharist and the Trinity vs. the pleasures of the Flesh), elsewhere Baugin can suggest the same ambivalence between the full and the empty without an accompaning lexicon; in vitro. I am thinking of his "Dessert with Wafers" at the Louvre (see Plate 3), in which the presentation of objects on the table cannot be referred to an underlying text because the possibility of such a text has been blocked (where is the invisible, improbable guest who will Plate 3: "Dessert with Wafers": with permission of the Louvre 292</page><page sequence="18">Marc Eli Blanchard take part in this supper?). In a tradition which also includes post-Renaissance mysticism (see, for instance, a painting by Juan Sanchez Cota'n of fruit and vegetables staged in a niche), Baugin has deliberately obscured the background of his painting. The "Dessert with Wafers" blocks all interpretive attempt by placing the objects on the table within our reach and yet severing them from a context which would help us desire them: they are without shadows and are as inedible as paper rolls. They do not mean anything to us. The "Still Life with Chess" then can only be meaningful by reference to a context and its allegory of the five senses is one that must conceivably be read without being seen. If this is truly the case, however, the painter is requiring of us that we use the representation of objects on the canvas to check our sensory perceptions without indulging in those perceptions. But this is impossible. While each of the objects is clearly separated from the other, some of them appear problematic (the mandolin is face down; and more ambiguously, the wine in the crystal glass can be drunk either as liquor or as the blood of Christ). Moreover, while all the other objects stand well on their own, the reference to one single bead is rather strange, as beads are usually threaded together. Finally, an uncommon extension of representational space to the very edges of the canvas distinguishes this particular still life from most others. Here the painter has deliberately not adopted the sort of space-saving composition found in later seventeenth- and eighteenth- century painting. While his intent may have been to indicate a reference to a text which the objects in the painting make manifest, much as an emblem would bring to mind an aphorism or a poem, his obsession with the pertinence of these objects has in effect produced a representation through which it is not the object-in-context (e.g., the pearl as an index of the courtesan) but the object-out-of-context, the construct, which now appears to be in the painting. To be sure, in an allegory of the five senses, the painter cannot produce objects qua objects. He subordinates the perception of these objects to the memorization of a text which makes them pertinent. One of the best ways he can do this is to direct the attention of the 293</page><page sequence="19">Yale French Studies spectator away from the temptations of the object (for instance, the sensuous ways in which the red orange body of the mandolin is lying over the open music book or the way in which the golden bread foams up in the space of its twin loaves) and onto a rational understanding of the interplay of symbols and figures in the representation. Thus, while it can be said that a purse is an allusion to gambling debts, a mandolin, to the pleasures of debauch- ery, and more specifically, that every object in this painting carries with it a different moral symbol, the book, the mandolin and the purse are also constructed in the same manner. They are divided into sections: lined or "ruled." For that matter all the objects in the painting testify to the artist's geometric obsession. The mirror-plate on the wall is an octagon; the wine glass is octagonal too; the dual disposition of the flowers in the glass bowl (pointing forward to the left, and backward to the right) emphasizes the bipartite division of space according to which all the objects in the painting are disposed from left to right. The bread is made of two adjoining pieces. The cards are laid out at three different angles. Finally the checkers on the chessboard complement the cobblestones on the wall. In contradistinction, a study of a later painting, say, a still life by Chardin, will show no discrepancy between a smooth design and uniform color tones promoting volume and shape. In cases where the compositional intent seems clear-see for instance the "Sting Ray," where a triangular or pyramidal space model immedi- ately calls to mind the symbolic patter of the Crucifixion-the display of colors manages to create an emotional effect which actually transcends the rational symbolism in the design. Thus our revulsion before the bloody body of the fish in the "Sting Ray" actually blocks our memory of the Crucifixion. More generally, the tones of Chardin, the thickness of his paint, prevent us from thinking of his painting in terms of sole composition and design. My point, however, is not that Baugin's paintings are geometric and not sensuous while those of Chardin are. Baugin's construction of space actually evades or rather transcends, as attempted represen- tation of pure space the representation of all the specific objects 294</page><page sequence="20">Marc Eli Blanchard in the painting. Stripped of their ancillary function, these objects are reduced to ornamental status (the mandolin is not to be played, the bread not to be eaten, and so on). Yet precisely because there is no perceptible relationship between specific color effects (the black mirror, the black and white chess, the gold purse, the red carnations) and the homogeneous composition (all the objects are mere con- structs in a uniform grid pattern) these ornaments seem to beg the question of their destinaton. The question is no longer what use is an object whose ancillary function has been put in doubt once it has been made an objet d'art (this is particularly the case for the one unthreaded bead and the glass of untouched wine, which have been arbitrarily removed from a daily life context). The question is now of the status of an object like the single glass of wine whose pure transparent design prevents any suggestion that it is indeed meant to ornate or decorate. In this context, the book open, but partially covered by the mandolin, the strings which could be pulled to open the purse reaching beneath the chesscase are a testimony to the hesitation of the painter as to the status of these objects. It is as if he has played with our desire by hiding a part of them and preventing their-full assumption as objects of daily use as well as objets d'art. Also the whole painting is foreshortened, almost truncated. There is no perspective onto a background, a landscape, as is common in many examples of still life. Even more important, the objects are carefully clustered around one another (the strings under the chesscase are an extreme example), so that the notion of a separate space, a background against which these objects could be measured and take their meaning is prevented: "By-work" is the translation of Nebengeschafte: secondary business or busyness, the activity or operation from the sidelines or nearby. The parergon inscribes something extra, exterior to the specific field (here, of pure reason and Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone), but where transcendent exteriority touches, plays with, brushes, rubs or presses against the limit and intervenes internally only insofar as the inside is missing. Missing something and is itself missing. Sirce reason is "conscious of her inability to satisfy her moral need," she has recourse to the parergon, to grace, mysteries, miracles. She requires a supplementary "by-work." Certainly the 295</page><page sequence="21">Yale French Studies adjunct is a threat. Its function is critical. It entails a risk and enjoys itself at the expense of transforming the theory. 10 This space in which, precisely because of the excessive attention to exterior design, objects tend to appear well defined, offers only an impoverished mimesis of reality. It is only an installation space: a rarefied, neutral space where objects are only there to suggest a disposition, a meaning, which will place them further from us. There is something philosophically intriguing about a representa- tion of this sort. First, it attempts to suggest that the criteria for aesthetic vision and aesthetic judgment are not to be defined in Kantian terms of "purposiveness without purpose," i.e., as enabling us to derive pleasure from the coherence of form and content without worrying about the truth of this representation and its relevance to the outside world, but rather in terms of the readability of the message it offers. The representation contributes a message while making perfectly clear that in the message questions are raised as to the function of representation. Second, it also suggests that the construction of space in early seventeenth-century painting is the result of an ambiguous process where greater emphasis is placed on form and design than on substance. Well delineated, made glamorous even, forms of daily life are not to be trusted. If they appear enticing, it is only to satisfy the condition that the message they convey be absolutely clear: the more attractive the mandolin, the purse, the chesscase, the clearer also the message which, by denying the object its ancillary qualities (the mandolin is face down, the purse is drawn shut, the chesscase is not to be opened), gives it a purely aesthetic status. In this sense then the painting is totally appropriate. It displays a painterly context where the art of the painter manages to compensate for the moral reprobation attached to the narrative in which the object could presumably enter. The technique is familiar to proponents and opponents of the theory of redeeming social values: the work of art persuasively represents that which is reprehensible only because the representational process shortcircuits the representation by making I'Derrida on Kant in "The Parergon", trans. C. Owens, October, 1979, pp. 3-40. 296</page><page sequence="22">Marc Eli Blanchard its glamour both the condition and the limit of its understanding. Thus forty years later, in his preface to Phedre, Racine will claim to have made sin more repulsive by exposing the dangers of it. There is in this gamble more than the unconscious desire to transgress that which is taboo. With this process, the painted object is isolated. Stripped of its potential for temptation, it is fixated as pure representation. To what purpose? Perhaps the answer can be found in Descartes' meditation on the famous piece of wax. There Descartes concludes his investigation by showing that the perception of an object can only be precise and complete if this perception is cleared by operation of the understanding. In the case of the melting wax, as in the case of the hats and cloaks I see from my window down the street, I cannot be mistaken about the meaning of what I see so long as I can rely on my judgment to correct erroneous first impressions. Thus, for Descartes, there is no such thing as a "cire toute nue" without attributes or accidents. Such an entity could only be known through the understanding. However, when a clear and distinct perception overrules a confused sensation, does it simply replace it or does it allow it to subsist as a precipitate, a residue of the senses? For what was there in the first perception that was clear and distinct, and of which the least animal might not be capable? But when I distinguish between the wax itself and its eternal qualities, and, just as if I had stripped it of its garments, contemplate it laid bare before me, there may assuredly remain some touch of error in my judgment, but my conception of the wax can only be the conception of a human mind. (My emphasis)1I And if the latter is the case, what then is the status of the residual sensation? In Baugin's painting, even after we have properly recognized all the objects and deciphered them according to a glossary of images and symbols, we are confronted with the form (the accidents) of the objects stripped of their literal meaning and yet immobilized in their original appearance. Because the image in a painting is meant to arrest our contemplation and the physical immobility of the objects on the canvas predicates the meaning of 11Descartes, Meditations, 2, trans. A. Wollaston, (Baltimore, 1960), p. 115. 297</page><page sequence="23">Yale French Studies the scene before us on a play between our successive perceptions even after we have perceived the proper reference of the painting, the "Still Life with Chess" leaves us with an uninterpreted residue, something which may well be the fiction of the painting itself. By fiction I mean an artificial resolution of the contradictions inherent in the representational process. On the one hand, the scene in the painting appears to transcend the referential (secular) context of the objects in it: it seeks to derive its real meaning from a religious reference only. On the other hand, however, the religious reference to which the painter has pledged himself is transcended by the artistic imperative governing all painting: that the truth of the representation is enhanced by the illusion-i.e., the untruth-of the artefact. Because of this illusion the painting endures as fantasy even after it has been properly referenced. It cannot be explained away. Here the "Maitre de la Realite" has unwittingly reasserted that which he was presumably trying to deny: the dissipation which some of the objects can invite in their reference to the appetences of daily life. This is a paradox, the result, not of the painter's unconscious desire for the forbidden, but of his struggle with the constraints of reference. Not willing, or perhaps not able, for historical reasons, to test those constraints, he has chosen not to force the paradox. 12 His painting is based on an act of faith. No wonder that a century later it will be this very paradox that a Largilliere and a Delaporte will want to exploit by seeking, much as creative writers with their figures, the ultimate flourish in their descriptions.
