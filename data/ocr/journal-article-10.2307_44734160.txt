Viano General Motors Research Laboratories Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT This paper describes the mathematical modeling of occupant kinematics in rollover accidents using the MVMA 2-D occupant motion simulation software. What little information is available on the kinematics of vehicle occupants during rollover accidents has been obtained either after the fact by accident reconstruction or by expensive experimentally-staged events. The paper describes the use of less expensive analytical techniques to graphically illustrate the applicability of occupant motion simulation computer models to this problem. ROLLOVER CRASHES are a complicated accident event, involving long duration vehicle motions and multiple contacts of occupants within the vehicle. If ejection occurs during the rollover accident, there is an increased risk of occupant injury (1-4).* Significant occupant protection is afforded by the use of seatbelts which are effective in reducing the risk of injury (5*6) , particularly injury of the neck which may involve long-term disability such as quadriplegia (6). The mechanism of cervical spine injury is not well understood, as are the occupant contacts associated with injury occurrence. In addition, there is controversy whether vehicle deformation during the rollover accident is a factor in injury production. The current technical opinion holds that vehicle ^Numbers in parenthesis designate references at the end of the paper. deformations are not a causal factor in occupant injury, but rather the consequence of complicated vehicle dynamics during the accident (7). Accident factors influencing the rollover event have been recently discussed (8) and information on the biomechanics of injuries that are typical in rollover accidents are becoming better understood (9» 10). It has long been recognized that certain motor vehicles have a greater tendency to be involved in rollover accidents probably due to particular driver behavior and vehicle characteristics. Small cars (11-13)» trucks and uti l i ty vehicles ( 1 4- 1 7) are involved with a higher frequency than large passenger cars in rollover accidents and ejection is a particularly important associated factor. Efforts have been undertaken to experimentally evaluate passenger car, truck, and utility vehicle dynamics during rollover. The structural crashwor th i ness of the vehicle has been investigated (18,19); and, procedures have been established for lateral rollover testing using a dolly carriage (20). Since many accidents involve primarily lateral motion of the vehicle from curb tripping (21,22), two- dimensional analytical simulations have been made of the roll dynamics to better understand vehicle and occupant factors associated with injury. The current attempt was to use the state-of-the-art occupant dynamics simulation (23.24) to investigate factors involved in a lateral rollover accident which effect occupant dynamics. In the following, a dolly rollover test was mathematically simulated and changes in vehicle characteristics were made to study their influence on occupant dynamics. The analytical tool chosen for the two- dimensional simulation of a pure rollover is the MVMA 2-D occupant motion simulation computer program (1). Figure 1 is a schematic of the vehicle occupant configured for the most traditional simulation using the software. Among the features available for use of the software are: 4.205 0096- 736X/85/9304-0205$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">4.206 D. H. ROBBINS AND D. C. VIANO - Occupant or pedestrian with a nine segment body linkage - Generation of forces on the occupant due to interaction with vehicle structures and restraint systems Capability for inclusion of vertical, horizontal, and rotational vehicle crash pul ses Prediction of occupant motions and responses such as HIC, femur loads, and neck forces Capability to model intrusion of vehicle regions such as roof and side door structures - Graphical display of results in the form of acceleration and force plots as a function of time Computer-generated animation of occupant motions during the time period of the impact event DATA REQUIRED FOR OPERATION OF MODEL A schematic of the side view of a typical seated occupant is shown in Figure 2. From the rear, this occupant would appear as is shown in Figure 3« These geometric view concepts were developed during a project entitled "Baseline Data for Describing Occupant Side Impacts and Pedestrian Front Impacts in Two Dimensions" (24). The occupant/vehicle configuration shown in Figure 4 is based on the MVMA baseline and represents the configuration of an anthropomorphic test device in the driver position of a 1973 Buick prior to a dolly rollover test conducted at the General Motors Proving Grounds. Any other vehicle geometry, occupant size, or occupant position could have been used in developing a configuration with the overall features of Figure 4. Definition of the rollover event must be supplied to the MVMA 2-D model in terms of known vehicle motions. In cases where test data are available, these can be derived either from accel erometers mounted in the test vehicle or from high speed motion pictures of the event. In the case of a real crash event, a reconstruction of the vehicle trajectory would be required based on the estimates of initial velocity, vehicle contact points with the ground, final resting location, and extent of damage to the vehicle. In the example case of the 1973 Buick test rollover, both vehicle accel erometer data and movies of the event were available. Use of the movies was selected as the simplest and most accurate procedure to determine vehicle position and rotation angle as a function of time for this case as has been discussed by Robbins (25). Plots of vehicle position and angle as derived from the movies are shown in Figures 5» 6, and 7. OUTPUT GENERATED BY MODEL Output from the model is generated in the form of tables and graphical displays. Standard output is in the form of tables of a large number of physical variables such as: - vehicle motions - body segment motion, velocity, and accelerations forces generated by contacts between the occupant and the vehicle as a function of time forces, torques, and relative motions at all joint structures post-processed quantities such as HIC, resultant accelerations at specified locations in the head and neck, and femur loads. Graphical displays are available as plots of the physical variables versus either time or other variables. Occupant motions can be presented in an animated display or movie of the occupant moving within the vehicle during the impact event. Example plots of forces generated by the head and hip regions of the occupant as a function of time are shown in Figure 8 and 9» and, compressive and shear force on the neck in Figures 10 and 11. Figure 12 illustrates the vehicle and occupant kinematics from the moment the vehicle is released from the dolly at a velocity of 29.6 mph until the vehicle is nearing its final rest point after about 2000 mi 1 1 i seconds . The most striking feature shown by these three figures is the large number of individual dynamic interactions which take place. The head interacts with doors and the roof on both sides of the vehicle. The torso and legs also interact with- structures on both sides of the vehicle. Body segment accelerations are moderate throughout the event. The individual head contacts do not appear to be of a level which would lead to fatal injuries. The first in a sequence of major contact events takes place at about 200 milliseconds. The vehicle begins to drop toward the ground after release from the dolly. During this period the vehicle/occupant combination is in freefall. The seat cushion exerts just enough force to cause the occupant to move toward the roof . The contact of the vehicle tires with the ground at about 300 milliseconds initiates the rollover sequence. The vehicle has passed 90 degrees of roll by 480 milliseconds which is about the same time the occupant has dropped, largely through freefall, toward the passenger door. Between 400 and 600 milliseconds there are several contacts of the torso and head with the door and roof structures. In addition, there is restraining action of the knees and feet by the instrument panel as was observed in the impact test movies.</page><page sequence="3">OCCUPANT KINEMATICS 4.207 The test movies show production of roof crush during the period between about 700 and 800 milliseconds. Figure 10 shows the head of the occupant well away from the roof during this period. Movies taken with a vehicle-mounted camera also do not show evidence of dummy/ vehicle contact during this period. After the roof contacts the ground while the vehicle is I80 degrees inverted, the vehicle again becomes airborne with the occupant compartment rotating through 270 degrees at about 1200 milliseconds. The driver door restrains the occupant from ejection at this point and redirects his motion toward the opposite side of the vehicle. Final contacts with the passenger door occur near the end of the simulation when the vehicle wheels again contact the ground essentially stopping the horizontal motion of the vehicle. The driver once again moves across the vehicle to contact the passenger side structure. Seat cushion forces are large during this last interaction. PARAMETER VARIATIONS Four additional exercises were conducted to examine aspects of roof crush and ejection. All used the baseline data set discussed above as a starting point. The first variation involved inclusion of roof crush. Timing and duration of the roof crush were based on that period of time during the baseline run when the vehicle was inverted and in contact with the ground as estimated from the test movies. An arbitrary deflection of roof structures downward into the vehicle was initiated at 700 milliseconds. By 800 milliseconds the roof structures intruded into the occupant compartment by more than 7 inches. After 800 milliseconds, the roof structures held the deformed position. The entire roof, represented by four contact panels, was used to define the crush zone. For additional parameter studies, these panels could have been skewed one way or the other to represent crush on only one side of the vehicle. Figure 13 shows vehicle and occupant kinematics for this computer exercise. It should be noted that the location of the head of the occupant at 72O and SkO milliseconds is not near the roof. It is not until after 900 milliseconds that head contact with the vehicle is again observed. Even though there are more contacts of the head with the roof in the case of roof crush, their level of force is no larger than those contacts observed when the roof remained intact. Figure 1A shows the second parameter variation where the passenger door is presumed to be forced open near the end of the exercise. This was accomplished in the data set by moving the passenger door and window contact surfaces away from the vehicle when the vehicle finishes its roll and lands upright during a forcible lateral interaction between the vehicle tires and the ground at about I700 milliseconds. The occupant is shown being ejected at the end of the simulation while still moving at close to 15 mph. It should be noted that all interactions with the passenger door and window structures were the same as in the baseline case until I700 mi 1 1 i seconds . Figure 15 shows the third parameter variation which simulated the case where there was no passenger door at anytime during the simulation. Ejection occurred shortly after 500 milliseconds while the vehicle was in a primarily rotational mode. The result was that the occupant was flipped up into the air as the result of head and shoulder contacts with the roof structures near the passenger door. By 2000 milliseconds, the end of the simulation, the occupant is beginning to fall toward the ground . Figure l6 shows yet another case of ejection by eliminating the driver door. In this case the driver is ejected at 1200 milliseconds. This occurs as the vehicle becomes airborne after roof and driver side contact with the ground. The driver is literally dumped out onto the ground and could be trapped under the vehicle as both entities continue their simulated movement. CONCLUSIONS The basic conclusion which was reached during activity on this project is that simulation is a useful technique for the study of rollovers. Although two-dimensional techniques are limited to "pure" rolls, it is anticipated that three-dimensional techniques will be equally applicable to the general probi em. In addition, it has been found that computer graphics is an exceptionally valuable tool for study of occupant and vehicle motions in the mind-boggling geometry of a rollover. Animation of the rollover event, similar to high speed impact test movies, is valuable. These can be supplemented with individual frames from the dynamic event to study contact interactions at specific time points in detail. Finally, in order to utilize simulation effectively, particular attention must be paid to the following i terns in preparing input data: quality detailed accident definition or reconstruct i on correlation of observed occupant/vehicle contact points with injuries vehicle interior geometry and material property definition Although these i terns are important and critical to the success of any simulation exercise, it should be noted that model use is inexpensive compared with full-scale tests. As a result, it is possible to estimate a range of values for parameters which are not well-defined. This can be followed by multiple exercises in order to see how changing parameter values affects occupant dynamics.</page><page sequence="4">4.208 D. H. ROBBINS AND D. C. VIANO REFERENCES 1. D. F.
