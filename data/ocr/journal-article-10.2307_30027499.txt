The gender system of Oneida has two genders that include reference to females. These two genders can be dis- tinguished on the basis of six semantic components. These six components are identified and their interactions reveal that they can be ranked in importance. Oneida's complex pronominal system has undergone several reanalyses and the current com- plexity in the feminine genders offers a rich potential for further reanalysis. Introduction. A standard analysis of Oneida (Lounsbury 1953) identifies four genders: a masculine, a neuter that is seldom distinguished from one of the feminines, and two femi- nines. Each of the two feminine genders has uses that allow reference to nonfemales and on that basis they are given the labels "feminine-zoic" (FZ) and "feminine-indefinite" (FI), but anyone who has spent much time with speakers of Oneida knows that a speaker's choice of gender for referring to a female can reveal a good deal about how that speaker sees that female. The choice may be saying something about the age, size, grace- fulness, or dignity of the female or the relationship between her and the speaker. Exactly what that choice means depends very strongly on the verbal context and the social relationships involved. This paper is an effort to explain that dependence in terms of six semantic components and it is based on data from the variety of Oneida spoken in Wisconsin. Gender in Oneida is marked in the third person pronominal prefixes of verbs and those prefixes map reference to both sub- ject and object.2 The two feminine genders are distinguished in the singular but not in the dual or plural. For any parti- cular combination of subject and object pronominals there may be other distinctions that are neutralized, the most common being a neutralization between FZ and the neuter and a neutral- ization between FI and the plural. Gender distinctions are comparatively recent developments in the Iroquoian languages. Chafe (1977) argues that the proto- language first distinguished indefinite from specific reference in the third person pronominals. Later a human-nonhuman dis- tinction developed and only after that did a gender system develop. 3 The feminine genders in Oneida, which closely resemble those in Mohawk and Onondaga, retain those earlier distinctions. In fact Boas (1909), and Barbeau (1915) following him, called FI the "indefinite person" and FZ the "nonmasculine". 125</page><page sequence="2">126 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 26, No. 2 The labels used here originate with Lounsbury (1953) with some adaptation from Hewitt (1903, 1928). Lounsbury also used the term "feminine diminutive" (Lounsbury 1953:67, 69, 70) but it is not clear that this was meant as an alternative label for FZ or as a component of FZ. The six components that make up the distinction between the two feminine genders are the following: (1) indefiniteness (2) animacy (3) humanness (4) size and gracefulness (5) age (6) special relationship. The first three operate under fairly tight grammatical control while the last three tend to be more covert and operate under pragmatic control. To understand how they all interact it is necessary to take a look at each component and its role in the pronominal system. Indefiniteness. There are a variety of ways that the Oneida pronominal system handles reference to indefinite persons when the specific gender of the referent is either unknown (one, somebody, a person) or irrelevant (nonspecific they, people in general). The use of FI is one fairly common way, but it is certainly not the only way. The masculine gender is also used both in the singular and in the plural. Whether the latter is a fairly recent development perhaps borrowed from English usage is not known. The masculine plural is regularly used for groups containing a mixture of males and females (the feminine plural is used for groups that are exclusively made up of females); so, this use is quite similar to the indefinite use of English "they." There are also cases, again like English, where the second person singular functions as an indefinite. There are even times when FZ can be used with an indefinite meaning.. In uhka? ok yakonuhwaktanihe? someone is sick FI is used and the reference is to any indefinite person, male or female. In uhka? ok yonuhwaktanihe? with the same meaning FZ is used and the reference is now restricted to certain kinds of females but it is still clearly indefinite. It does seem to be the case, however, that FZ can have an indefinite reference only when some other phrase in the sentence demands it. Expres- sions such as uhka? ok someone, yah uhka? no one, tsi? ka:yA: whoever, and katsa? ka:y~: which one are sufficiently indefinite so that even FZ can have an indefinite force with them. The masculine gender also would be indefinite in such contexts. But without such explicit indefinite words the FZ does not carry the indefinite component. Animacy. One very clear contrast between the two feminine genders is that FI does not coreference anything inanimate. This is left exclusively to FZ. One might normally expect animacy to be marked in the contrast between neuter and the</page><page sequence="3">Two Feminine Genders 127 otllher genders (rather than in the c:(ntr':as t )betw(Y,rl the two feminline genders), but the problem is that tIhere is some ques- tion as to whether Oneida even hlas a neuter gender as a morpho- logical category. In fact for closely related Mohawk where the facts are quite similar Bonvillain (1973) has argued that neuter exists only as a covert semantic category and not as a morphologically distinct gender. Lounsbury's (1953) analysis implies a separate neuter gender but its status is extremely fragile. Intransitive verbs can often be interpreted as tran- sitives with a neuter as either subject or object. There is only one contrast that "prevents the complete merging of the zero person category with the third person neuter" (Lounsbury 1953:51). Since many verbs mark their transitivity outside the pronominal system, the minimal contrast is not very common. Where it does occur, as with the root -hwatase- twist, the contrast for speakers usually centers on something else. Kahwata:se: it twists it and yohwata:se: it is twisted differ for speakers in that the former would be used for something mechanical such as a toy that has been wound up and the latter would be used for a more natural instance of twisting such as a vine twisting around a tree.4 If it is hard to distinguish neuter from a zero person, it is almost equally difficult to distinguish it from FZ. Lounsbury's (1953) charting of the pronominal prefixes identi- fies only a few contrasts. But even those contrasts are ignored for some verb roots and there is considerable variation among speakers on others.5 The result of all this is that even if a separate neuter gender does exist, its form is almost always identical to FZ. Humanness. Within the scope of animate beings FI is used only for human beings, but FZ can be used for both animals and human beings. Just as we saw that Fl is not the only mechanism for reference to indefinites, FZ is not the only mechanism for reference to animals. The Oneidas tell many tales in which animals are anthropomorphized and in these the masculine gender is often used to refer to some indefinite animal. Even when the reference is not particularly anthropomorphic the masculine gender is quite typical. FZ tends to indicate a generic sense as much as an indefinite sense. In the plural the feminine gender is used almost exclusively unless there is some reason to call special attention to the fact that the plural collection is only male animals. Size and gracefulness. Under certain conditions to he described later, FI is used to convey the impression that the female referred to is small, graceful, dainty, or petite, and FZ in contrast is used to convey the impression the female is large, awkward, or aggressive. This component is not available to speakers in all contexts, but when it is, the contrast between the two genders is consistent.</page><page sequence="4">128 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 26, No. 2 Age. Lounsbury (1953) describes this component as the principal contrast when a choice is not forced by the compo- nents of indefiniteness, humanness, or animacy. There are some informants the author has encountered who have been quite out- spoken in denying this component. They insist that there( are no circumstances under which the choice between FI and FZ reveals anything about the age of the referents that is not. already revealed by some other linguistic cue. There are other speakers, mostly male, who almost as strongly insist that FZ signals greater age than FI with the dividing line placed somewhat vaguely around adolescence. This is in some contrast to Lounsbury's earlier generalization that there was a tendency for FZ to be used for adult active women and FI for young girls and old women. In any case, it is clearly not linguistically required that younger females be coreferenced by FI or that older females be coreferenced by FZ; it is something left to the discretion of the speaker. Special relationship. There are many cases in which the choice of pronominal is entirely decided by the relationship the speaker has to the female being talked about. In analyzing the variety of Oneida spoken in Canada, Michelson (1982) notes that speakers using the FZ sometimes are signaling "an indif- ferent or detached attitude," sometimes a lack of respect, and sometimes an acknowledgement that the referent has authority or power over them. Bonvillain (1973) found for Mohawk that referents "regarded in some prestigeful or respectful way by the speaker" would be signalled by FI but that FZ may or may not have negative connotations. Chafe (personal communication) suggests that for Onondaga the FI signals among other things an empathy with the referent while the FZ signals an impersonal attitude. These observations suggest something of the flavor of an intimate versus formal distinction, but for the Wisconsin dialect of Oneida that would be too simple a label. It is true that close relatives very strongly tend to be coreferenced with FI but there are many cases of close friends coreferenced with FZ. Whatever the choice, it rarely changes over the course of a lifetime even if the relationship changes in its degree of intimacy. The pronominal choice need not be reciprocal so that A may refer to B with consistent use of FI even though B refers to A consistently with FZ. When one meets a female for the first few times, in the words of many native speakers "one gets a certain feeling about a person," which may well be based on the age, size, gracefulness, kin relation, or even empathy and that feeling determines the pronominal choice. Thereafter the consistency of pronominal choice may say as much about the relationship as the choice itself. With so many positive characteristics associated with FI and with so many if not negative at least not positive charac- teristics associated with FZ, it would seem that using FZ for some females would have connotations of rudeness. But this is</page><page sequence="5">Two Feminine Genders 129 only true if the speaker has established the practice of con- sistently using the FI in the past. Otherwise informants insist that there is nothing rude or disrespectful in the use of FZ. Interaction among the components. There are three kinds of evidence that can be looked at to learn how these six com- ponents interact and to establish a general ranking among them. One is at the level of morphology, to see how the components in the two feminine pronominals interact with similar semantic components in the verb stems to which they get attached. A second is at the discourse level, to see how the pronominals make coherent reference in narrative texts. And the third is to look at the special influence of the kinship vocabulary. Consider first the interaction between the semantic com- ponents in the pronominals and those in verb stems. Take for example the component of humanness. Barking is an animal activity, so one would expect that if the FI pronominal with its component of humanness were used with the verb -hnyanyu- bark, then there might be an incompatibility. And yehnyanyuhe? she is barking does indeed strike speakers as peculiar. A few speakers allow that it could be used in a metaphoric sense to describe someone's coughing (just as bark is sometimes used in English) but most speakers reject the form as contradictory. Similarly the root -thoska- animal young may quite freely take the FZ pronominal but with the FI pronominal it is either rejected as impossible or interpreted by a few speakers as referring to a very close pet who might be thought of as a mem- ber of the family. When the verb stem contains a specifically human compo- nent, then the reverse situation is true. The root -ksat- child is specifically human so the contrast between the FI in wa?yakoksa?tayA:ta:ne? and the FZ in wayoksatayA:tI:ne? which both mean she is going to have a child does not distinguish people from animals but rather among people. When the verb stem contains roots that are not specifically marked as either human or animal, than the pronominal contrast can add that dis- tinction. The root -wil- offspring is such a root. So yowilayAt':sle? she is pregnant will refer to an animal since the FZ pronominal is used and yakowilayAtV:sle? she is pregnant will refer to a woman since the FI pronominal is used. It seems clear then that only when the verb stem does not contain some incompatible component will the feminine pronominals have the option of contrasting human from animal. It is more difficult to do the same sort of testing with the component of indefiniteness simply because there do not seem to be any verb stems that specifically include that compo- nent. Nevertheless we have already seen that when the sur- rounding syntax contains a component of indefiniteness (with expressions such as someone, which one, etc.) the FI pronominal is normally used. If the FZ is used it signals a referent that must clearly be characterized by one of the other semantic</page><page sequence="6">130 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 26, No. 2 components, usually animal. It is apparently easier for the FZ to be used in an indefinite context than it is for the FI to be used in an animal context. It is similarly difficult to test the interactions with stems containing a component of inanimacy since those compo- nents can only be identified through the pronominal prefixes and as we have seen in those pronominal prefixes the distinc- tion between neuter and FZ has virtually disappeared. There are several verb stems that contain age components. And the interactions of those stems with the two feminines are reveal- ing. When the verb stem.contains the meaning young, then the FZ tends to be marked for size. Both ka? nityakoyiha? with FI and ka? nityoykha? with the FZ mean she's young but the latter implies the referent is larger. That at least is the most com- mon reaction of speakers. But there is another interpretation that is sometimes given and that is that the FZ form implies that the referent is unexpectedly young or just appears young without really being young. Similar interpretations occur for kaya?taseha? FZ young girl and yeyataseha? FI young girl where the former is more likely to be thought of as bigger and the latter as more petite. Again a secondary interpretation of the FZ form where a component of FZ (older) is at odds with a com- ponent of the verb stem (young) is that the referent is either unexpectedly young or only apparently young. When the verb stem contains the meaning old, then the two feminines are less likely to suggest a contrast in size than they are to suggest a contrast in the relationship between the speaker and the referent with FI implying a closer relation- ship. So in yoksttha? FZ and yakoksttha? FI both meaning she is old the latter implies a closer relationship between the speaker and the referent. The same is true with the contrast between yokwAnY:ta? FZ and yakokwAna:ta? FI, which also mean she is old. With verb stems such as -ohslayelit- to come of age, -ukwe?tayA- to be middle aged, or -atoty- to grow up the use of FZ proniminals strikes speakers as peculiar and difficult to interpret. With these verbs of aging the FI is by far the pre- ferred pronominal. It is apparent from these last few remarks that the neatness that characterized the interaction between pronominal and verb stem in the case of the human-animal dis- tinction is missing in the age distinctions. If we now turn to the size component, we find that if the verb stem involves size, then the contrast between the feminine pronominals is likely to signal an age distinction. For exam- ple yekwanA FI and kakwani FZ both mean she is big but the for- mer is more likely to refer to someone who is young and big and the latter to someone who is older and big. When it was de- scribed earlier, the size component was more than just physical size. Elements of daintiness and gracefulness were also a part of it. Verb stems that mean dainty, petite, or graceful seem to be lacking in Oneida so it is impossible to test how they</page><page sequence="7">Two Feminine Genders 131 interact with the pronominals. Semantically close verb stems such as -tsatst- and -yatahnilu- which both mean strong act differently from -kwanA- big. Yetsatst with FI implies the referent is small and strong or unexpectedly strong. Katsatst with FZ implies a bigger referent. Although speakers usually deny that there is anything dis- respectful in the use of FZ, there are contexts in which it is at least a little bit negative. One such context is in the interaction of the feminine pronominals and the verb stems for good and bad. We expect that the contrast between yeksa?taksA with FI and kaksataksA with FZ, which both mean bad child, would involve a size distinction since child implies the age component young. That is certainly part of the contrast. There is, however, also an implication of impishness with the FI form and of bullying with the FZ form. With the pair yeksati:y6 with the FI and kaksati:yo with the FZ, which both mean good child, we again expect a size distinction. That dis- tinction exists but there is an additional implication that the FZ form refers to a more homely child. So even though the two feminines do not usually have positive or negative connota- tions, they may when the verb stems predicate positive or nega- tive denotations. In those cases in which the verb stem does not contain a component of size, age, or humanness and the context does not require an indefinite or neuter interpretation, then the unmarked interpretation of the choice of feminine is as a marker of the relationship between the speaker and the refer- ent. Even though FZ is occasionally used between close friends, it is more common for FI to indicate a closer relationship and without any context to the contrary that will be the normal interpretation. One other observation may be worth making at this point and that is an apparent difference between male and female speakers in using the two feminines. When asked to translate into Oneida a verb with the subject she, male speakers tend to use FZ as a citation form, provided there is no context, lin- guistic or otherwise, that militates against it. In similar situations female speakers tend to use FI as the citation form for translation. This may be related to the fact that one of the terms for my wife uses the FZ khekstvha (literally my old lady). Another way to gather evidence on how the two feminines are used besides seeing how they interact with the semantic components in particular verb stems is to see how they are used in narrative texts. The text collection produced by the WPA Writers' Project in Oneida in 1938-39 provides an extensive data base for exploring this question. Before examining this evidence a few words on agreement in general are appropriate. Agreement between the pronominal pre- fixes on the verb and the nominals they reference is more semantic than formal; that is, the pronominal prefixes on the verb agree more with the meaning of the subject and object</page><page sequence="8">132 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 26, No. 2 nominals than with any pronominal markers those nominals may have. A nominal may, for example, have an FI prefix and still be coreferenced by a neuter pronominal in the verb. This is particularly combnon with one frequently used class of nominals that are derived from verb stems with instrumental suffixes. TyutAhni:n he? where one buys, i.e., store, or yuthwistayAtakhwa? where one places money, i.e., bank, both have FI pronominals (where one...), but if they were objects or subjects of some verb, then that verb would treat them as neu- ters. Similarly a nominal with a neuter or FZ pronominal might be referenced in a verb with a FI pronominal. A name, for example, might have a neuter or FZ pronominal, but that would by itself place no requirement on the choice of pronominal in the verb. Or a nominal with a masculine plural prefix may be coreferenced by an FI pronominal in the verb if it is taken as a collective. LAnukwehu:we: the Oneidas is frequently refer- enced in a verb by a FI pronominal. In a sample from the WPA texts that included approximately eighty female characters a bit more than half (59%) were refer- enced by FI. When the person in the text was referred to as someone's mother, grandmother, granddaughter, or as elderly, then the pronominal used was almost always FI.6 If the person was identified simply as a woman, FZ was used about as fre- quently as FI. That was also true for characters identified as girls, wives, daughters, sisters, witches, teachers, or named individuals. Other identifications occurred too infrequently to establish any pattern. Within any particular text the femi- nine pronominal used for a character was used consistently. The only exception was in a story about a witch who had been referred to with FZ and who then turns out to be someone's grandmother, whereupon the pronominal switches to FI. If these texts are representative, then they suggest a special cultur- ally specified attitude towards mothers, grandmothers, grand- daughters, and elderly women that is relatively independent of the other semantic components in contrasting FI and FZ. Kinship vocabulary. One important semantic field of reference for understanding the feminine pronominals in Oneida is the kinship terminology. The normal choice between the two feminines is curiously restricted in the kinship vocabulary and those restrictions may be influencing the contrasts between FI and FZ outside the kinship vocabulary. Most of the kinship terms are transitive verbs but charac- teristically they do not allow the full range of transitive pronominal prefixes. For the terms for older relations the older relation is referenced by a subjective pronominal and ego by an objective pronominal. For the terms for younger rela- tions the situation is reversed (ego is subject and the younger relative is object).' The choice between FI and FZ is restricted along similar lines. FZ is used with the roots for kin older than ego and FI is used for kin younger than ego.</page><page sequence="9">Two Feminine Genders 133 So what happens to FI on roots for older kin or to FZ on roots with younger kin? For the older kin terms since the FI form is indistinguishable from the third person plural in this context, what would be the FI form is often given only a plural interpretation. For example -yA- is the root meaning the parent-child relation. With a FZ pronominal akyAha? means my mother, but with a FI pronominal (which is also third person plural) yukyoha? is usually interpreted as my parents. With the specific root for mother -nulha- the citation term uses the FZ as in sanulha your mother. Many speakers reject entirely the form with FI, yesanulha, although a few remember their grandparents having used it when they were younger. This sug- gests that the freezing of pronominal choice for the kinship vocabulary may be a fairly recent phenomenon. For the terms for younger relations to use FZ sounds unnaturally distancing. The only exceptions to this assymetry are the roots -noh- for the stepparent-stepchild relation for which the citation form uses FI in both directions and the root -enhusa- for the relation between a parent-in-law and a child- in-law which uses FI when focusing on the parent-in-law. But except for these two non-blood relations the generalization seems clear: kin terms for older relations use FZ (and the FI form is either unused or used with a plural interpretation only) and kin terms for younger relations use FI (and the FZ forms are generally not used and when encountered, they are interpreted as cold and distancing). Notice in particular that this means when one talks about grandmothers and mothers, one uses the FI as we saw in the texts, but on the roots themselves for grandmother and mother the FZ seems required. The frozen system of feminines in the kinship vocabulary, however it may have become frozen, may have an influence over how the feminine pronominals are used outside the kinship sys- tem, particularly since kin terms are frequently used. Rela- tive age is clearly a crucial factor in the kin terms and that may reinforce the legitimacy of using FZ and FI to distinguish age outside the kinship system. Although the distinction is made in the same direction (FZ for older and FI for younger) outside the kinship vocabulary the age distinction is not rela- tive to the age of ego but more absolutely defined. The other component that the kinship system may influence is the special relationship component. The kin terms provide a model for using FZ to mark close relationships. Conclusion. From the differing degrees of generality that the six semantic components have in distinguishing the two fem- inines they are clearly not all equally powerful. They can in fact be ranked in order of importance. The most important is the animacy component, for if the object being referenced is not animate, then there is no further choice. The FZ must be used</page><page sequence="10">134 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 26, No. 2 TABLE 1 animate yes no I FZ human yes no FZ indefinite yes no I FI special relationship yes no FZ FI older larger (or less graceful) yes no yes no FZ FI FZ FI The second most important component is that of humanness. If an animal is being referenced, then there are only a very few possible exceptions to the forced choice of FZ. The specificity of the referent is the next decision the speaker must be concerned with. If the reference is indefinite, then FI is required. If the referent is specific, then the next</page><page sequence="11">Two Feminine Genders 135 component is the special relationship component. If the speaker and the referent have established some choice of pro- nominal, whichever it may be, then it may well be rather rude not to observe it. Certain kinship relations seem to have a culturally prescribed choice and that must be considered at this stage. If there is no special relationship between speaker and referent, then the final two components, age and size (and/or gracefulness), have equal importance at this point. The chart above summarizes the ranking of the com- ponents. Chafe (1977) has described the historical development of agreement in the Iroquoian pronominals as a series of reanaly- ses of existing morphemes. With the number of components fig- uring into the choice between FZ and FI in Oneida it is easy to see how this process could continue. For example there is at least the potential that Oneida could develop a formal versus intimate pronominal distinction similar to those in the major European languages. It is important to realize, however, that the above chart oversimplifies a number of asymmetries in how the six components determine the choice between FZ and FI. And those asymmetries add even more options for reanalysis of existing categories. WORKS CITED Barbeau, C.M. 1915. Classification of Iroquoian radicals with subjective pronominal prefixes.

NOTES 1. This paper is based on field work in the Oneida community near Green Bay, Wisconsin. Oneida expressions are cited in utterance medial form and transcribed in the phonemic alphabet described in Lounsbury (1953) with the exception that /ts/ replaces /j/. 2. The use of the terms "subject" and "object" is an oversimplifica- tion. "Agent" and "patient" might be more accurate, but even then there are a number of complexities in how the pronominals map semantic roles that are not relevant to the issues in this paper. The terms "subject" and "object" will be used here to label whatever referents the subjective and objective prefixes refer to. 3. Given this historical development, Chafe (personal communication) offers the alternative view that Oneida even today may be better described as having not two feminine genders but none at all, with reference to females being simply distributed between a neuter gender and an indefinite gender. 4. These same two prefixes occur on nouns in related Onondaga where Woodbury (1975:18) has argued that those with ka- are perceived as more man made and those with (y)o- are perceived as more a part of the natural world. Although there are many exceptions to that generalization for Oneida, it may be enough of a pattern to have influenced the verb morphol- ogy in this case. 5. For example, with the root -yat- to name or to call the FZ prefix kuwa- can be interpreted as referring to either a FZ or a neuter object. A very typical way of asking for the name of something is the question nihte? kuwa:y~ts what is it called. But for the root -na?tukw-, which also means to name, there is a contrast between the ye- prefix indicating a neuter object and the kuwa- prefix indicating a FZ object. 6. One speaker recalled an argument in her childhood over whether a cousin who lived with grandparents should refer to her frequently absent mother with FZ or FI. The argument was ended by an adult who declared it a silly thing to argue about.</page><page sequence="13">Two Feminine Genders 137 7. Even though the morphology of these kinship terms is restricted, the syntax allows a focus on either subject or object. For example from the root -?nih- father the form lake?niha? (third person male subject and first person object) can be translated as either (he is) my father or I am his child. The choice between the two glosses is usually made clear by the syntactic use of independent pronouns (Lounsbury, personal communi- cation). Despite this flexibility, for each case one of the glosses is highly marked and the other is the normal citation form. For the above example my father is the citation form and I am his child is highly marked. Of the published lists of Oneida kin terms Ritzenthaler (1950) lists only the citation forms and Basehart (1952) lists the alternative forms (apparently supplied him by Lounsbury) but refers in his analysis only to the citation forms.</page></plain_text>
