The journal is devoted to the quick publication of analytical contributions, particularly (but not exclusively) in epistemology, philosophical logic, the philosophy of language, and ethics. Papers applying formal techniques to philosophical problems are particularly welcome. The principal aim is to publish articles that are models of clarity and precision in dealing with some significant philosophical issues. Articles in the journal are intelligible to philosophers whose expertise lies outside the subject matter of the article. It is intended that a diligent reader of the journal will be kept informed of the major problems and contributions of contemporary analytic philosophy. Copies of articles from this publication are now available from UMI Article Clearinghouse. r .A Mel &amp; Howell Co)rnpany U.M1 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 Printed on acid-free paper Photocopying.
