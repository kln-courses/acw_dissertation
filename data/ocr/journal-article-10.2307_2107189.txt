<plain_text><page sequence="1">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION1 The argument presented in this paper has one simple goal, to propose an approach to some problems in epistemology through the study of what may be called 'metalanguage.' The problems concern the use in speech and in perception of certain cognitive constructions which, if they have been learned and are not known innately, would seem on the face of it to be hard for a child to grasp. Concepts such as 'agent,' 'action,' 'object,' 'possessor,' 'place,' 'goal,' 'self,' 'transitive event,' 'intransitive event,' and others do seem to be acquired early in life, but it is by no means clear how they can have been.2 Of course all such references to the thought-forms of very young children are bound to be speculative, but assuming that there are genuine prob- lems in generative epistemology here, such that they cannot be made to dissolve by being restated in a different way, I suggest in what follows that there may be a solution obtainable through the study and analysis of metalanguage. I also ask what conditions would act as restraints on such a solution. The problems themselves will not be resolved, even speculatively; that would require a string of papers. But in principle I believe that they can be. The first point is to show what kind of solution is being proposed. I. The Diverse Functions of Language In his paper Functional Diversity in Language, (1970), M. A. K. Halliday says that it is "possible to recognize a simple, but very basic functional organization in language, one which is inherent in the grammatical system and determines the form taken by grammatical structure." (p. 2.) The three functions he discusses are as follows. The first, which we may take for granted provided language has 1. I am greatly indebted to Dr. P. J. Wexler for reading this paper in draft and for making comments and criticisms. 2 E.g., Roger Brown lists a set of prevalent semantic relations used by children during Stage I of the development of speech. This set of relations covers the majority of utterances: "1. Agent and action. 2. Action and object. 3. Agent and object. 4. Action and locative (or location). 5. Entity and locative (or location). 6. Possessor and possession. 7. Entity and attributive. 8. Demonstrative and entity." (1973. p. 173) 165</page><page sequence="2">166 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH any semantic component at all, is the experiential or ideational. We use words to convey information about experiences or ideas. Second- ly Halliday argues that language has an interpersonal function, com- menting on, or establishing, the role-relationship between speaker and hearers. Thirdly there is function which Halliday describes as the expression of texture. A sentence ". . . takes on a particular form, as a message, that is operational in the given context." When we con- trast the sentences 1/ Smith died. and 2/ The one who died was Smith. it is apparent that there is no change between 1/ and 2/ in the idea- tional and experiential function, nor in the roles of speaker and hear- er. Yet the form of the message is significantly altered. Halliday says, "It is only because we can select the desired form of the message that we can also use language effectively both to represent an experience and to interact with those around us." (p. 3.) For example, the text in one form rather than another characteristically establishes what is the theme and what the theme of the sentence. But if that is the case, it appears that the third function of lan- guage, the textual function, derives its significance from the fact that it conveys to the hearer the manner in which the speaker consciously, or perhaps unconsciously, expects him to construe what is said. It indicates what is, or what is not, an appropriate construal. As such, it would perhaps be misleading to say that it is on the same level as the other two functions; it consists of something not far removed from a commentary on them. Halliday implies as much when he writes "The textual function is instrumental to the other two and internal to language." (p. 3.) There is considerable flexibility in the operation of textual form, more than one might suppose. It can be used to imply complex com- ments on the construal of what is being said. To take just one possi- bility, the conjunction of two participants can suggest that they are members of the same class. If we already know how to classify one of them, we can now learn how to classify the other. If in addition, membership of that class normally has a particular value associated with it, the textual form can express subtle praise or insult. For example, Lyly expresses more than a hint of flattery in 3/ "Cupid and my Campaspe played at cards for kisses .. From that textual form, Campaspe is in the same class as Cupid, and therefore a love-goddess. The flattery vanishes if one rewrites it</page><page sequence="3">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY AcQUISITION 167 4/ Cupid play'd my Campaspe at cards for kisses ... and that quite apart from considerations of meter. Textual form has another major function as well as those of indi- cating themes, class membership, and associated values; it declares the mode of an utterance. To take rather obvious examples, the use of an imperative generally labels a sentence as a command; an altera- tion of word order may show that it is a question. Instances such as these suggest a point which must be very familiar, but whose consequences may not have been fully recognized: one of the major functions of any act of communication is to indicate how the message in the other functions is to be construed. What is more, it seems that the textual function of speech is, in this respect, similar to one of the functions of paralanguage. Gestures, changes of posture, intonation, emphasis, and the manipulation of context may all be used to convey information about how the ideational/experiential or role relationship components of an utterance are to be understood. The fact that one function can be realized in so many ways points to its importance as a feature of communication. It also underlines the danger of treating the verbal and non-verbal as separable systems of communication. It frequently occurs, either by mistake or on purpose, that the paralanguage accompanying a particular speech-act indicates a con- strual opposite from that suggested by the words in context. On those occasions, unless there are very strong reasons for not doing so, one normally construes in accordance with the nonverbal rather than the verbal. It is, in that sense, the more powerful method of realizing this function. To take a common example, if an acquaintance says, "My wife and I would be so pleased if you came round and had dinner with us some day," the textual form suggests warmth. But if the paralinguistic communication contradicts that suggestion, an invita- tion is unlikely to be forthcoming. It seems reasonable to guess that if the nonverbal form of communication really is generally the domi- nant form for indicating construals, it is so because it was estab- lished as a means of relationship between the mother and child be- fore he had learned to use speech. What is more, if communication has the same three functions for infants as for adults, we may take the speculation a stage further. We may say that the mother's non- verbal address towards him shows the child how he may construe the relation between them, and possibly his experience of his environ- ment also. This point is perhaps supported by the apparent skill and subtle-</page><page sequence="4">168 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ty with which any normal speaker handles the delicate signals by which he indicates to his hearers how- he wishes to be understood; it suggests that he has had long practice. On that evidence alone we would be justified in assuming that the function of indicating appro- priate construals was basic to all interpersonal communication.3 However that would still be a long way short of the claim which I wish to make, which is that this function also determines the child's acquisition of categories. II Metalanguage and Role-Relationship In the preceding section I have argued that within any one com- plex act of communication, there is a metalinguistic function realized both verbally-in the choice of words and in textual form-and non- verbally in the paralanguage and manipulation of context. Any com- munication considered in accordance with that function we may call 'metalanguage,' or in the case of a single act, 'metacommunication.' Nothing in that should be taken as implying that metalanguage is the only criterion for checking the appropriateness of the con- struals we place on the speech acts of others. As H. P. Grice points out, in cases of doubt we also tend to refer to the context (linguistic or otherwise) of the utterance. (1957. p. 59.) In practice it might sometimes be hard to draw a clear distinction between references to a context and references to the metalanguage expressed in an utter- ance. But granted that the boundaries of metalanguage in this sense are not clear, we can still say that one of the functions of both verbal and nonverbal communication is what we have claimed, and we can legitimately define metalanguage as any act of communication that fulfills this function. An utterance subjected to metalinguistic comment has two other functions, as we have already seen from Halliday. The metalanguage indicates the construals to be made in both the other two; the hearer is shown how he is to understand the experience or idea being ex- pressed, and his own role in relation to the speaker. The latter must not be overlooked. Metalanguage as I have defined it has a psycho- logical reference as well as a linguistic one. Later on in this paper I shall argue that it constitutes the common ground from which both the other functions have sprung. Meanwhile definition is necessary 3. R. D. Laing's discussion of 'insinuendoes' provides examples of this skill being used to impose guilt on others. (1961. pp. 154, 155.)</page><page sequence="5">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 169 because the term has been used in such a wide variety of senses that there is considerable confusion.4 As an example of the psychological reference, we may take the well-known paper by Gregory Bateson and his colleagues, in which they argued from the characteristic inability of schizophrenics to discriminate between different orders of message to a theory of the etiology of schizophrenia. They asserted (what has been noted above) that accompanying communication there are always expressions of the mode in which the communication is to be understood. For exam- ple we might employ as modes such labels as 'play,' 'nonplay,' 'fan- tasy,' 'sacrament,' etc. In humor, the explosive moment comes when the labelling of the mode undergoes a dissolution and resynthesis. It is possible, consciously or unconsciously, to falsify the generally non- 4. Carnap defined metalanguage as 'the language in which we speak of an object language.' (1942. p. 2.) This is similar to the definition in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, which suggests that Carnap's work may have been the source used by the lexicographers. (1961.) However by the time that edition had been published, different uses had already grown up, no two of them clearly identical. Thus Carnap's use of the term differs radically from that associated with the works of B. L. Whorf, four of whose papers were collated and published under the title Four Articles in Metalinguistics. (1950) G. L. Trager associates the term with both Whorf and Sapir (1963) as do also Meader and Muyskens (1959. p. 3n.) Whorf regarded language as determinative for the use of certain concepts. Max Black summarizes his proposals by saying that his 'linguistic relativity principle' suggested that "language or some aspects of it, partially controls mental life." (1969. p. 30.) Whorf himself gave examples of concepts such as 'time' and 'space,' asserting that they ". . . are not given in substantially the same form to all men, but depend upon the nature of the language or languages through the use of which they have been developed." (1941. p. 44.) A more psychologically orientated use of the term may be found in Wilden, who translated and commented on Jacques Lacan's The Language of the Self. (1968.) Wilden assimilates Lacan's work to that of Bateson, Carnap, and Laing, claiming that "Carnap's theory of object language and metalanguage provides an independent clarification of much of what Lacan is saying in his own terms." ". . . the notion of metalanguage and its logical consequences-that the sympton is a statement in a metalanguage about an object language-provides a solution to some of the problems of 'reflection' which have cropped up . . ." (p. 309.) Wilden is mistaken in thinking that symptoms could be metalinguistic in Carnap's sense. Lacan himself elsewhere specifically denies the possibility of any metalanguage at all, but he does so in terms which sUggest that he has misunderstood it. "The first thing to state in this context is that there is no meta- language. For it is necessary that all so-called metalanguages be presented to you with language." (1970. p. 188.) However Eugen Bar, another commentator on Lacan, seems to support Wilden's view, referring to a ". . . more general type of semiology support- ing (natural language) by instances such as moments of silence, blushes and gestures." (1971. p. 247.) He claims that Lacan holds that the semantic ambiguity of natural lan- guage could not exist without this, which certainly gives it a metalinguistic function in some sense.</page><page sequence="6">170 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH verbal signals which classify modes, and which are a higher order of communication, i.e., of a different logical type. (The reference is to Russell's Theory of Logical Types.) Schizophrenics have difficulty in three areas: in assigning the correct communicational modes to the messages they receive, or to the ones they utter, or to their own thoughts, sensations, and percepts. Thus a schizophrenic will use un- labelled metaphors. The argument goes on that his unconventional communicational habits must be in some sense appropriate to the world in which he lives. In order to explain how this can have come about, Bateson et al. proposed the theory of the 'double bind' in which the victim is subjected to three injunctions at different levels. The first is a command to do something. The second is a command not to do it. The third is an implied prohibition on withdrawal. Final- ly there is the refusal to answer the metacommunicative questions designed to elucidate what is intended. In that self-contradictory situation the victim can only remain in relation to the significant other person who is imposing the double bind by failing to dis- criminate accurately between different orders of message. It is safer for him to shift to a metaphorical order, but not to acknowledge to himself that he is doing so. (Bateson, G., Jackson, D. D., Haley, J., and Weakland, J., 1956. pp. 251-264.) Bateson and his colleagues did not use the term 'metalanguage' in their paper, though they did speak of a 'message about a sequence of messages,' and in that sense their essay was certainly a work in metalinguistics, and has been taken as such. The metacommunication they described could be said to have been understood in some cases as establishing the mode of use of an object language, and in others as denying the validity of what was being communicated in the object language. In either case it indicated the appropriate construal for the meaning of what was said. The point about the double bind is that the metacommunication forbids the hearer to place the normal con- strual on a simple command, but does not indicate any other.5 To sum up the position we have now reached, we may say: a) One of the functions of communication is to indicate the ap- propriate construals, including value judgments, to be placed on acts of communication. b) This function can be realized either in language itself, textually and in the choice of words, or in paralanguage. c) The communication which fulfills it may be called a 'meta-</page><page sequence="7">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 171 language,' even though it is generally most powerfully realized nonverbally. d) Acts of metacommunication comment on both the construal of the idea expressed, and the construal of the role-relation- ship between speaker and hearer. e) Since the function of metalanguage is to indicate the legitimate and appropriate construals in the other two functions, it takes place at a higher semantic level. IIM. Metalanguage as a Basis for Generative Epistemology The description of metalanguage as a 'function' of language is specifically intended to avoid the idea that it is a different system of communication imposed upon ordinary language. It is no more than a different function within any one of the highly complex acts by which we express ourselves. The metalanguage and the object lan- guage are one and the same; they are indivisible acts of communica- tion. But that by no means implies that hearers are in all cases ready and able to understand communication in its three different func- tions. The fact that information is available does not imply even that it is possible for the hearer to comprehend it, and certainly not that he actually does so. One may reasonably ask what a very young child can make of the flow of language and paralanguage with which he is surrounded at those times when he is related to his mother. I propose the serious possibility that when adults are communi- cating to small babies, the metalanguage that they are using goes further than the mere indication of legitimate construals: it may actu- ally establish them. A baby, if he is born without the innate knowl- edge of how he may construe the sensory input he receives, may learn to do so as a direct result of his mother's metalinguistic ad- dress towards him. That is the suggestion which I wish to explore further in the rest of this paper. It leads to some difficult claims about the nature of communication as an infant may understand it, but it does offer in principle explanations about the acquisition of the concept of the self, and about some linguistic universals, which do not appeal to the arcane mysteries of innate knowledge, but which do give full recognition to the categorical structures of thought and. speech, as stimulus-response theories fail to do. 5 Bateson distinguishes between inetalanguage and metacommunication. (1955. pp. 150, 151.) The former he takes in Carnap's sense; the latter as commentary on the relationship between the speakers. Both define, either explicitly or implicity, the set of messages about which they communicate. (p. 161.) In my view, a satisfactory generative epistemology would show both functions to be the same in origin.</page><page sequence="8">172 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The suggestion is that the most primitive function of communica- tion as far as an infant can understand it consists of the ascription of categories by means of which he may construe his environment in appropriate forms. (I.e., appropriate to the environment; we are not here concerned with the intentions of the speaker.) That is the orig- inal kind of metalanguage. It is his mother's communication which indicates to the baby that it is appropriate to construe his world as containing persons and objects, intransitive and transitive events, agents, actions, possessors, and possessions; values, places, goals, authors, and himself as a synthesis of both the active and passive aspects of personhood. Classes such as these have a special nature; not only are they primitive in the sense that even young children use them in speech, but in many cases they are hard, if not impossible, to derive directly from anything prior. Although such classes are not all categories in the strict philosophical sense of having literally noth- ing in common with each other, they still pose very real problems for a generative epistemology, problems which are not posed by other classes which are more readily derived. For example, given the cate- gory of 'place,' it is relatively straightforward to form classes of par- ticular places: houses, corners, geographical features, etc. But how does a child ever come to organize his sensory input in such a manner that he uses the category of 'place' at all? And how is it that some- thing, which is construed as a place, may also be construed as a 'goal'? The acquisition of categories is a real problem; few philo- sophers deny that we use them, and those not very convincingly. Fewer still have suggested how we might have acquired them. Hence if we propose a theory which would account in principle for a child's use of categories, it would seem that it should have definite applica- tions, and that these might constitute verification. Empiricist epis- temologies seem generally more credible than rationalism, but hith- erto they have failed to carry much conviction in their answers to this problem; at least they have not done so in respect of speech and the categories of syntax. If we can show that by use of early com- munication it is possible for the baby to acquire just those categories of perception listed above, ignoring the possibility that the list may not be complete, we shall have produced a tentative epistemology which is truly generative and of wide application. The first point to establish is that metalanguage as we have de- fined it does include the function of ascribing categories, even in adult use. It does so principally, but not solely, by nonverbal means.</page><page sequence="9">METALANGUAGOI AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 173 consider the example provided by Dr. Johnson's refutation of Bishop Berkeley. Boswell and Johnson had visited a church together, and after they came out they engaged in a discussion of Berkeley's philo- sophy, Boswell commenting that although they were satisfied the doctrine was not true, it was impossible to refute it. He goes on: "I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a stone, till he rebounded from it, 'I refute it thus.'" (0. U. P. edition. p. 333.) As an epistemological argument, Johnson's action was inappro- priate. Berkeley was not denying that there are objects of sense. But as in any other deliberate transitive action. Johnson was predicating categories: the stone was the object of his kick, and he was the agent. (At any rate, that is how we would naturally construe the categorical structure of the event.) Furthermore, since there was a third parti- cipant in the form of Johnson's foot, he was predicating that as the, instrument of the action. Any intentional event predicates categories in this way; the example of Dr. Johnson is being used only because it was an essay in epistemology. However the description of an event may indicate a different categorical construal from that which would be normal for the event itself, if it were directly perceived. The sub- ject of a sentence may be the object of the event. In fact, Boswell's textual form indicates the stone as the place at which Johnson, as agent, struck his foot as object. From his use of syntax, Boswell indi- cates as appropriate a construal which we would not normally make, and we do not even notice that it verges on the unidiomatic.6 Why would we not make it? Why do we choose between con- struals with sufficient certainty to say that one is normal? The imme- diate answer that suggests itself is that we do so on the basis of con- text; it is clear from the words, 'I refute it thus,' and from what has gone before that Johnson intends to strike the stone as object, and not his foot. But on closer examination there is nothing in the context to indicate one construal as more appropriate than another. Both are certainly legitimate. Johnson may have wished to show that his foot was a material object. Nor can we escape the question by saying that we rely on past experience, that people who kick things are generally striking the things rather than their feet. That may be true, but it simply pushes the problem further back. 6. Boswell may have been influenced to use that construction by the Biblical text "He shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone." (Ps. 91, vv. 11, 12. Also quoted in Matt. iv. 6, and Luke iv. 10, 11.)</page><page sequence="10">174 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In general, I suggest that we decide such questions by consider- ing the nature of the address accompanying the action. Johnson was, we presume, addressing the stone. We do not know, and in !his case we have no right to say that he was taking the stone as his object. If we knew instead that he had been addressing his foot-e.g., perhaps because there was mud stuck on the bottom of his shoe, and he wished to dislodge it-we would have construed the event in different categories. Information about which object was being addressed would have settled the question. Thus even in adult usage, the direc- tion of address functions as metacommunication indicating how an event, or speech act, may appropriately be construed. Indeed it may be that address constitutes the most powerful form of metalanguage that we use; it would certainly override the textual considerations of Boswell's description in our example. When the event under comment is the comment itself, the person addressed in it is placed in categories which are all the more strongly determined. As we have seen Halliday asserts that one of the func- tions of language is to comment on, or establish, the role-relationship between speaker and hearer. We are now saying that the hearer is directed to construe himself and the speaker in particular categories through the form of address. For example, the plain statement, 'Smith died,' predicates the hearer as a transitive object (because the statement was addressed to him.) 'Did Smith die?' indicates to the hearer that he may appropriately construe himself as the object of the question, and the author of the answer. It is therefore interesting because it synthesizes two different categories, and predicates both of them as appropriate construals at the same time. Another such synthetic form of address is the imperative, 'Tell your brother that Smith died.' That would predicate the hearer as both agent and ob- ject. The form of the address is a metalanguage indicating legitimate and appropriate categories for the participants. We have distinguished the metalinguistic function as it comments on the expression of experiences, and on the expression of role-rela- tionships. For purposes of clarity and convenience, we may call the former the 'indirect' use of metalanguage, while the latter will be the 'direct' use. It is likely that the direct use is more primitive than the indirect; briefly one might say that this is confirmed by the well- known tendency to think in anthropomorphic forms, but the point is immaterial to the argument as a whole, since-as will appear in sec- tion IV-it is logically necessary to say that neither use is completely primitive. To an infant, both are the same thing initially, unless he is born with some kind of innate knowledge.</page><page sequence="11">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 175 If it is true that we use metalanguage as a means of indicating categorical construals, we must now ask how a very young child can understand this function of the communication addressed to him, if he understands it at all. This is a critically important question, but it is of course dependent on the assumption that there actually is a metalinguistic function in the address he receives. If that were not the case, there would have to be some very major differences be- tween the mother's address to her baby, and her address to adults. We would have to say of the former that it did not indicate how it should be construed. Since it is impossible to imagine any adult lan- guage without that function, we can scarcely suppose that the moth- er's communication to the baby is all that different. However the fact that metalanguage may be available to him is by no means syn- onymous with saying that he can understand it. What I am proposing is that he does so, but in a manner significantly different from that of the adult. Whereas the metalanguage addressed to the latter only indicates legitimate categorical construals, addressed to the former it establishes them. IV. A Prelinguistic Symbolic System It would be possible in principle for a theory of the metalinguis- tic acquisition of some categories to be combined with an innatist view of the knowledge of others. For example, we might say that a baby is born knowing that there may be a world of objects for him to observe, and that consequently he has no need to acquire the concept of an object as an existent other to him. However he would still need to learn metalinguistically that such objects can be agents, places, goals, etc. I intend to ignore that possibility simply on the grounds that it seems to enjoy the worst of both worlds: it implies both an appeal to the obscurities of innate knowledge, and also the diffi- culties of an analysis of metalanguage. Instead I shall consider the question, "What conditions are logically necessary for an exclusively metalinguistic theory of the acquisition of categories to be true?" I shall show that the conditions are such that we would have to sup- pose a child's comprehension of communication to be so different from an adult's as to be almost unimaginable. Even so, that proposal is preferable to any of the available alternatives. Nelson Goodman, in his paper, "The Epistemological Argument" in which he criticizes the neorationalist theory of innate knowledge of linguistic universals, refers to a possibly important 'pre-linguistic symbolic system.' (1967. p. 25.) He suggests that use of this may ac-</page><page sequence="12">176 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH count for a child's very rapid acquisition of language. He does not say of what such a system might consist.7 If we are to account for the use of categorical forms in any speech at all, rejecting innatism, we must undertake an analysis of a prelinguistic symbolic system (P. L. S. S.) from the baby's point of view. Anything of the kind would have to be very tentative: very little work has been done in the field. It looks formidably easy to speculate, and even more formidably hard to verify one's speculations. But we can make some progress purely from considerations of logic. In particular we are logically bound to say that a P. L. S. S. cannot ever refer to any category or class which has not yet been generated, and therefore initially cannot refer to anything of any kind at all. We may not assume that the child can understand communication as directed 'to' 'him' unless we have al- ready accounted for both the concept that events may have a direc- tional element, and also for the identification of himself as the goal of an address. Nor may we asume that he can understand communication about things which are other to him, unless we have already accounted for the strange phenomenon of perceiving things as 'others.' The ideation- al/experiential and the role-relationship functions of language des- cribed by Halliday do both assume such powers of reference and the metalanguage, whether it is indirect or direct, insofar as it is a com- ment on the other two functions, must assume the same. Hence no communication from the mother to the child could have any of the three functions defined by Halliday, until the child has learnt to iden- tify the corresponding referents. If we are to account for the acqui- sition of categories purely through a P.L.S.S., it will initially have a function quite unlike anything we could regard as normal to adults, even in the nonverbal communication passing between them. A for- tiori, it will be a long way removed from any of the ordinary func- tions of speech. We may put the position as follows: When the mother is com- municating to the very young baby, a) He cannot understand her except insofar as he already recog- nizes to what she if referring; b) He cannot recognize to what she is referring except in terms of categories he cannot derive from the sense data. There- fore, assuming he has no innate knowledge of such cate- gories, 7. Goodman refers to ". . . gestures, and sensory and perceptual experiences of all sorts (which) function as signs." He is not more specific than that. (Op. cit., p. 25.)</page><page sequence="13">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 177 c) He acquires them by means of a P. L. S. S. which does not depend on reference, as all normal adult communication does. if that is correct, one might envisage speculatively a stage-by- stage progression in which the mother's P. L. S. S. originally estab- lished the categories. Once they were established, it could acquire reference to classes of things falling within the categories, and could indicate which categorical construal was appropriate. So it would gradually develop the functions of nonverbal and verbal communica- tion with which we are familiar. For example, the mother, having established for the baby by an early communication that it is some- times legitimate to construe objects as the goals of a transitive event, could then refer to him as a goal for her actions, and perhaps a goal for other events as well. If his cognitive development did follow this path, he would in this case be progressing from indirect to direct identifications. She would be enabling him to distinguish a world of things which could act upon him as something other to them, and that would assist him towards the individuation of his self. In such ways communication with reference would develop out of commun- ication without reference. Alternatively the same learning process could have had a differ- ent beginning. Instead of teaching the baby that it is sometimes appropriate to construe other objects as the goals of transitive events, and thus to indicate that he might be a goal, it is possible that the mother teaches him to think first of himself as the goal of her actions, and then to move from there to the general construal of other objects as goals also. That would be in keeping with the thesis that direct metalanguage is more primitive than the indirect. Either way, the process depends on the concept of communica- tion without reference. But is such a concept intelligible at all? Are we not proposing that it is possible to communicate to somebody without actually conveying a message about anything? Worse still, are we not implying that the hearer of the communication may not be able to be aware of himself as one who is addressed? If that is the case, what is left of the concept of communication at all? Indeed the problem could be put more accurately if we say that a metalin- guistic theory of the acquisition of categories depends on the concept of communication, not only without reference, but without even the immediate possibility of reference. While that idea may seem odd at first, particularly to those who take it that all communication consists of propositions, I suggest that</page><page sequence="14">178 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH there are many examples of symbols which do communicate, but do not refer. There are others which do both: a road sign invariably has reference, and it symbolizes an instruction or proposition which may be found in a Highway code. But a car is generally taken as a symbol, and so are a house, a garden, or a statue on Easter Island. These have no reference to anybody being addressed, nor are they capable of being expressed as propositions. On the other hand they can be, and are even likely to be, subjects for identification, projec- tion, and introjection, symbolizing persons and their relations in whole or in part. One of the conditions of a metalinguistic theory of categories is that a baby must pass through a stage when commun- ication consists solely of symbols surrounding him, but not address- ing him. There is an even more profound restraint on such a theory. The class of symbols is itself a category in the sense in which we have been rising the term. To put it simply, the baby recognizes things as the means of communication, but he has no way of deriving that con- cept for himself. Why should things have meaning at all? It is not obvious why they should; we even have a school of empiricists who would wish to deny the appropriateness of construing objects as symbols: B. F. Skinner is a well-known exponent of this view. If it were possible to derive the category of symbols it would surely have been done by now, and his view would have been proved wrong, unless the derivation were very hard indeed. But while Skinner has come in for some severe criticism, it has not been based on the claim that it is possible to derive the category of symbols from any other category or class. We therefore have no criterion to which to appeal to prove whether objects do, or do not, have symbolic mean- ing. If the class of symbols is an underivable category, and if it is established for the baby by his mother's use of metalanguage, that must in turn consist of an act of communication which does not it- self even have symbolic expression: it could not be mediated by things or events which the baby could in any way perceive at first. We would not only have to accept the possibility of prepropositional communication, but also of presymbolic communication. Perhaps the difficulty of that idea partly explains why it has not generally been accepted, though, as I have argued elsewhere, the alternative view is incapable of avoiding the objection that a baby should never acquire the category of symbols at all if he started from knowledge of a physical world and then proceeded to ascribe mean-</page><page sequence="15">METALANGUAGE AND CATEGORY ACQUISITION 179 ing to it. He could never make the leap into symbolic understanding, let alone symbolic activity. (1973. pp. 90, 91.) The present suggestion certainly involves us in saying that an infant's view of the world is very different from an adult's, different in almost unimaginable ways. But that in itself is not a new idea: Harry Stack Sullivan proposed no less in his classification of modes of awareness into the 'proto- taxic,' 'parataxic,' and 'syntaxic.' (1955. pp. 28 ff.) The alternatives seem to be limited. There is that form of em- piricist position which denies that we use categories in thought and speech. Such a view would eliminate too much-even at the best we should have to abandon, for example, case grammar as useful to linguistics. The loss would be severe: other forms of grammar seem less well adapted to the description of childhood speech, to name only one field of application. (Bowerman, 1973. pp. 217 ff.) More moderate empiricism appeals to innate skills and innate dispositions of an undefined nature, and involves as much obscurity as a full-blood rationalism. The approach to category acquisition by way of metalanguage has admitted difficulties, but it has logical merits as well, certainly sufficient to justify an attempt to formulate a coherent theory. One final point may be made in its favor: it would offer a single comprehensive account for the structure of both the self and language. Psychology and linguistics would find a common basis in a unified epistemology. M. N. FRANCE.
