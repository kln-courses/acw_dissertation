<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Path to Gertrude Stein in Contemporary Post-Soviet Culture Helen Petrovsky I There are at least two paths leading to Gertrude Stein. One is the physical passage from the apartment to the building where her books are stored and brought to you at your request. The daily route to the library. Should it at all be mentioned? I think it should. Because the route itself has turned into a text, if you like, into a kind of introduction. Without reading it (and each time I realize myself as reading it?at one point or another) no further reading takes place, perhaps no further reading is possible. So, each time I start moving toward Gertrude Stein. I think she would have liked the inclination. How do I move? I move through signs and fragments of a peculiar culture. Is it indeed post-Soviet? This I doubt. I wouldn't know where exactly the movement begins?each time at an arbitrary point of departure. For instance, "We'll bury you," says a bag held by a young man in the subway. The phrase is in English. How do I place it? There is another inscription on the same bag: "Hell raisers." It must be helpful? for the one who knows. I try to guess?rock? Horror movies? Is it the famous quotation so reminiscent of the Kruschev thaw, despite its chilling overtones? And as such does it return to where it belongs; where it belongs no more? Who is the author? Are not the mysterious "Hell raisers" and their threat more real than the man who once was so vital to Soviet history?quite a character, one would say. Indeed, no more than a character now. I am almost completely carried away by this confusion when suddenly my attention is caught again?this time by images of hyperhealthy men with recognizable faces. Models of body-building and machismo for Russia. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, of course. Was American culture, American mass culture, so close in those days to Gertrude Stein in Paris as it is now to Russians in Moscow? I never stop wondering. When I am again in the street I am swept by a wave of loud music, New Literary History, 1996, 27: 329-336</page><page sequence="2">330 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Soviet rock?I still prefer saying "Soviet." Anyway, this game of names, does it have any meaning? Apparently it does; be careful with names, those could be the words of Gertrude Stein. What do they sing, though? The music is so overwhelmingly loud that I cannot make it out. What comes to my mind by way of association is the face and posture of a popular rap singer Bogdan Titomir, his "3h, you, nocMOTpn Ha mchh (And I have difficulties with the translation. How would I render this line to my foreign friends, remaining faithful to the principle of translation, to the idiom, in the terminology of Jacques Derrida? But the idiom has already been transplanted; there is a clash of idioms, a hybrid idiom, you can call it post-Soviet, if you like. So I try to translate: "Hey, Tbi, take a look at me . . . ," but then, of course, I would have to explain what "tw" means. And again I wonder.) But the street is too lively, too imposing to let you alone. Too visually aggressive. I see a line of buildings being repaired?since the time Walter Benjamin was here, no doubt. I am struck by the quality of repair work in general; which today is either perfect or hopeless. Mostly hopeless. The way it is done, it can never be recognized as finished. By this poor performance it becomes everlasting and total. Total within a given fragment of whatever is closed for repairs. When the myth of the Soviet Union was still relatively intact, it allowed for much less visible disintegration; pieces were glued together even when the whole was ostensibly falling apart. Now the cracks are much more discernable; cracks, seams, ruptures are in fact the fabric of contemporary Soviet life (I still cling to the tag "Soviet"?maybe, out of nostalgia). Today (or better: once) I was so impatient to begin?writing and reading?that I forgot to take the right pen with me to the reading room on the third floor. Downstairs I was told by a policewoman standing on guard at the entrance to the inside of the library that I had to dispose of my books in order to take whatever I wanted (I needed my bag with the pen) from the ground-floor cloakroom. At first I was angry and disappointed but then I understood that it was still another lesson: one had no right to make a mistake. A mistake would mean here a flop, a minor collapse?and a new beginning. I would be punished for my absentmindedness by losing my access to Gertrude Stein. Only by being fully aware of my own identity (twice reaffirmed?in the recollection of a forgotten "personal belonging" and in the demonstration of my library pass, by all means a document of identification) could I be allowed to read. Truly a paradox: to read those very texts that insist on the loss of memory and identity in the act of writing and reading (I am still exclusively talking of Gertrude Stein). However, the unexpected vertical journey (up and down and again up and down to return finally up) gave me the encouraging glimpse of a</page><page sequence="3">THE PATH TO GERTRUDE STEIN 331 foreign exhibition under the title of "Body Shop." A concept too advanced for the local culture. But at the same time provocative, hinting at corporeality as a problem, at the demarcation line between the human and inhuman, and so on. I become completely relaxed. The initial approach to Gertrude Stein is finally over. Now I will open the books and again start moving?this time through a different time and space. II The way to Gertrude Stein lies across numerous interpretations, interpretations specifically focused on gender in the last ten years or so. Thus "Melanctha," for instance, is treated as having the potential of a feminist-oriented critique (the theme of a failed motherhood along with that of recurrent male abuse1), yet the potential, as one may say, remains a pure possibility. Each of these interpretations perhaps manages to shed new light on the subject in general, however, such an accumulation of readings is more conducive to the understanding of where we are now and how we presently identify ourselves (as students and social critics) than to a firmer grasp of the self-sufficient textual reality. Which does not mean that interpretations should be given up, of course. Gertrude Stein insisted that writing (and reading, one may add) is like total amnesia: a sudden and all-encompassing forgetfulness, an active "nonremembering" of one's identity, of the necessities and relationships that constitute our daily living. This is a provocative statement and, like everything else, it can be tackled historically: in the horizon of the entire modernist movement or at least of an avant-garde literature marked by, among other things, a keen interest in its own foundation. By turning on itself it begins to explore narrative both as genre and, therefore, as limitation. To get to know this foundation, it is really necessary to forget. To forget everything that has not been well remembered?that exists as a habit of writing and not as an event. To get to know this, it is necessary to exercise full "presence" in the act of writing-reading in order to be conscious of how writing is done. And then, as it happened to Gertrude Stein, the story is no longer a linear plot sequence but instead a "composition," that is, the inner logic of writing which governs the distribution of textual affects. She would discuss it in terms of sentences and paragraphs, of a balance between them, in terms of her "important discovery" that sentences are not "emotional" while paragraphs are. She made this discovery listening to her poodle, Basket, drinking. However, forgetfulness may even be more radical in prompting one to</page><page sequence="4">332 NEW LITERARY HISTORY "forget" the very context out of which such lack of memory it born. Perhaps, not altogether forgetting but at least displacing or relegating it to the level of composition where writing, as we have sensed, unfolds. The "remainder" then would come to be Stein's texts as well as the problems they immanently pose. So now, as it seems, I am fully entitled to start my own reading. I remember my very first impression of the attempt to read Stein's texts. Incidentally, it was one of her lectures delivered in Chicago during the famous American tour. An astonishing and yet elaborate simplicity and then?my own feeling of confusion, and a collapse. There were no punctuation marks to help one move about; the meaning of phrases and paragraphs was constantly shifting?depending on the way I introduced the absent punctuation mark. But how could I be sure that I was doing the right thing? How could I be sure that my feeling of the deliberate syntactic ambiguity was at all adequate, if not correct? Since, being a foreigner, indeed a stranger, I am doubly estranged from Stein's texts. Which is to say that the path to Gertrude Stein inevitably lies for me through my own native language, that is, Russian, and the respective cultural context in which Gertrude Stein is actually unknown. So then comes the ritual question: why Gertrude Stein in contempo rary post-Soviet culture? Is it only to fill in a gap?one of the many gaps and omissions?with regard to the modernist West? Is it just another handshake, just another gesture of acquaintance, an implicit statement that we are fundamentally alike? Yes and no. At a time when totalitarian culture is falling to pieces, losing its monopoly over space, language, and time there seems to be a drastic need for new types of languages, new forms of literature, essentially self-reflexive, capable of self-distancing. Literature is finally coming to terms with itself, rejecting its former ideological commitment (dating back not only to totalitarianism, in fact) as well as its profound functional ambiguity with regard to society and art. (What is implied here is the status of Russian literature, beginning with that of the nineteenth century, as a social driving force and, simultaneously, a substitute for any independent and more or less developed practice of reflection.) The decline of totalitarianism is the time of major disillusions and minor professionalisms. Literature is redefining its boundaries, becoming more attentive to itself as genre and, freed from the pressures of social criticism, it returns to its proper realm or for the first time truly comes into its possession. Is it not the right time for Gertrude Stein? What, then, do I find so attractive in Stein's experimental writing? First of all, the almost impossible task, in Stein's own terminology, to "recreate" the (English) language. Recreation has nothing to do with invention. "It takes a tremendous amount of inner necessity to invent</page><page sequence="5">THE PATH TO GERTRUDE STEIN 333 even one word,"2 she would remark. Recreation is a kind of reappropria tion of what has been trivialized or worn out by frequent literary use. Recreation is a special attitude to language?not unlike that of the cubists with respect to paint and painting?when the possibilities of language as artistic medium are thoroughly explored. Recreation is very close examination, indeed a scrutinizing, of individual words. So that words are set against their evident transparency as signs which always point to some reality beyond them, and it is through the questioning of this referential primacy that they acquire the quality and contours of separate dense "entities," to use another one of Stein's own definitions. I well remember how at the very start of perestro?ka random passers by were interviewed by TV reporters?they were asked to give their opinion of what was going on around them, be it changing politics or, perhaps, their daily problems. And many seemed completely at a loss: not because they had nothing to say, but because there were no words to say it with. The old media-inspired cliches, something like "we fully approve and support," were sensed as absolutely inappropriate. But this is a digression. Stein seems to be saying: language has been too mimetic, let it not be mimetic at all. Let it forget, at least for the moment, its grand communicative calling in order to focus on itself. Does it somehow not imply that there are other forms of communication besides the one carried out by neatly assembled words? For in finding her own way of approaching the name?first by totally displacing it (an overall emphasis on relational words, or shifters, such as pronouns, adverbs, copulas, and so on) and then by reintroducing it anew (through a radical disruption of syntactic ties)?Stein establishes a new type of relationship to the object, or the "thing-in-itself." Objects send reverberations that may give a vibration to words. Or rather: just as Picabia's "vibrant line" undergoes a process of becoming?together with the depicted object, being in fact the trace or diagram of its nonpsychological "emotion" ("vibrant line" and "emotion" are words chosen by Stein), the vibrant word is brought to life by the intensity of the object's presence in our perception. However, it is useless to describe. Description is story-telling and as such is only a roundabout way of reaching the object. Its intensity, if retained, is transformed into composition, be it the distribution of single words and their grammatical characteristics in a given sentence or the previously unknown structural permutations of some classical form as a whole (play, narrative, lecture, poem). If the object is to make its way into language, it will do so only by violating the conventional sentence matrix (subject-verb-object)?its established "anthropomorphic" order. If the object is to enter language, it will do so by deforming human communicative patterns and imposing</page><page sequence="6">334 NEW LITERARY HISTORY on writing a logic of its own. Hence, Stein's favorite device?repeti tion?which she speaks of as "insistence," referring both to its inner necessity and its qualitative effect. And?her special attitude to punctua tion: if a comma, for example, is simply an organic sign of breathing, what is the use of applying commas to writing, which is nonorganic in that it moves across the natural, organic flow of human life? ("Gertrude Stein said commas were unnecessary, the sense should be intrinsic and not have to be explained by commas and otherwise commas were only a sign that one should pause and take breath but one should know of oneself when one wanted to pause and take breath."3) The novelty and unprecedented audacity of Stein's project can be measured indirectly by its misunderstanding within a totalitarian cul ture. In textbooks on American literature written for Soviet students of journalism one comes across unbelievable mistakes: "Tender Buttons" translated as "Tender Buds" or an excerpt from a lecture with all the originally missing punctuation marks carefully inserted?to say nothing of a series of charges that were raised against her: racism, literary formalism, and so on. (Stein's sexual preferences, which would have appeared scandalous at that time, were never discussed.) I suspect the only reason her name was mentioned at all was Hemingway's reminis cences of his early days in Paris, Hemingway being a favorite with the Soviet reading public for several generations. (Two things in brief concerning Ernest Hemingway: first, his account of the "moveable feast" is strikingly misogynist; second, no one would have dreamed of acknowl edging Stein's influence on his realistic prose.) If Stein were to be allowed to exist in the monolith of Soviet culture, then only as a footnote to some other, more successful achievement in the history of modern American prose. And the very footnote had to be adapted to the dominant discourse: buttons by definition were never tender, repetition was evidently slack and boring, and the absence of punctuation must have been due to inattentive proofreading and typographical mistakes. And then Gertrude Stein was a woman, after all. . . . It is often that Stein speaks of "a space of time that is filled always filled with moving" and treats it as an "American thing." In my opinion, the "sense for combination within a conception of the existence of a given space of time"4 is closely linked to the "intrinsic" textual "sense" mentioned earlier. And it is not a matter of word play which in fact should not be underestimated with respect to Stein. Here we find an indication of the intensities of reading and writing, the experience of a pre- or Ur-reading, since, deprived of our guaranteed automatisms, we enter the terrain of reading as if for the very first time. Reading then is</page><page sequence="7">THE PATH TO GERTRUDE STEIN 335 a kind of stutter or sudden dumbness and at the same time a visual delight: for by destroying grammar, by introducing other than meaning ful ties, Stein frees words from their inherent symbolism and concen trates on their surface appearance, allowing, if one wishes, to recover the pictorial (root) element in them (A. Stewart),5 or the sense of tension between their representational and nonrepresentational func tions (W. Steiner).6 (A sensation, we may add, not unlike the play of figure and ground through the overlapping of the two, and thereby a general fuzziness of outline in cubist painting.) Organized into a flow and no longer being "discrete semantic carriers,"7 words produce the effect of a truly "on-going present": they are never in the past or in the future but instead are right there before your eyes; your mind opens to their immediate perception. And even if the effort is at reading through, when you want to grasp the idea or to stick to the story, even then they will arrest your eye, the repetition? large-scaled or small?bringing your attention back to them; even then the discursive will be suspended and deferred by the intrusion of the nondiscursive. However, the distribution of emphases, I repeat, the inner rhythm of poetry and prose will depend on the inherent logic of writing-reading, be it formally expressed in a novel conception of genre, a new compositional balance of sentences and paragraphs, or in the demands that are on individual words. Writing then does not produce finite totalities but rather partial objects which Stein chooses to call "entities" in opposition to the entire human practice of memory, identity, and identification?all this creating a sequential world. "Entities," thus, are the topological units of writing, fragments of an American "disembodiedness" (another of Stein's terms) which, too, is an essentially topological trait. (On Stein's writing as corresponding to the American cultural landscape see D. Sutherland; he has many other keen and valuable insights.) Stein's composition is above all exposition. To expose, for instance, "the essence of what happened" without telling the story of what happened is only one self-reflexive statement of a general idea. Since everything, whether it has its story or not, is always "in relation" (to other things and possibly to other stories), it is the story of this relation or, better, its structure that constitutes the pathos of prose. And exposition is always recreation: of language, its possibilities and limits as well as of the playful spirit in the one who writes and reads. We have gone through perestro?ka?an attempt at restructuring?and today there is an urgent need for recreation with all the implications of the word. Including a reassessment of our own culture, its marginal yet powerful languages, its "borderline" reflections?belonging now to the common history of the modern avant-garde. I envisage a dialogue?</page><page sequence="8">336 NEW LITERARY HISTORY between Stein and some Russian counterpart, at least the discussion of a problematic akin both to Stein and, let's say, the Russian formalist school. There seems to be a direct and short path leading to Gertrude Stein in contemporary post-Soviet culture.
