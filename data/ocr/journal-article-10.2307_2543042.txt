<plain_text><page sequence="1">Les Mots du Corps: Un Imaginaire Lexical dans "Les Tragiques" D'Agrippa D'Aubigne'. Marie-Helene Prat. Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 303. Geneva: Droz, 1996. 397 pp. n.p.. This is a largely successful attempt to present sytematically the corporeal poetics of a work where the body is everywhere.The author's balancing act is complex. She has studied images of the body by means of statistics, while avoiding the composition of a catalog; she has taken account of sixteenth-century context in lexis, anatomy, and imaginaire, while showing d'Aubigne's originality; she has delineated Les Tragiques as a coherent structure, while force- fully arguing its dynamic evolution. Some limitations have been necessary: for example, the object of study is images of the body as they appear through figurative use of language, rather than literal bodies. All the same, those latter bodies inevitably turn up in the discussion, if only in contrast to the other sort. Another exclusion, less understandable, is of the verse Preface to Les Tragiques.True, that text is set apart by its meter and a greater concentration of metatextual concerns than else- where in the poem, so its exclusion permits a certain homogeneity of treatment. But that methodological profit is at the expense of ignoring (at least of denying systematic treatment;</page><page sequence="2">922 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXVIII / 3 (1997) the Preface is of course mentioned in the discussion) a text where metaphoric bodies are far from absent or uninteresting. The overall structure of Les Alots du corps proposes a particular dynamic in d'Aubign6's poem.There are three main parts:"La construction du corps,""Le corps defait," and "La res- tauration du corps: Le corps en mouvement." The construction of the body means an anatomy linguistic as well as physical.The author examines the use (always for corporeal images) of the canonical tropes: metaphor, meton- ymy, and synecdoche. In the introduction she claims a similar status for simile, without treat- ing it as explicitly as the others. Among the notable elements of d'Aubign6's tropes: an unprecedented elaboration of the familiar metaphor of the body politic, a paradoxical double tendency of metonymy to both concretize and abstract, leading to both hallucination and emblem, a use of synecdoche that creates an aesthetic of the cinematic close-up. A recurring theme in this section and elsewhere is d'Aubigne's lexical innovations. Working with the admittedly incomplete evidence of historical dictionaries, the author shows, again and again, cases where d'Aubign6 uses a word in a new sense only later consecrated by usage. The gen- eral tendency of these innovations is to greatly expand the expressive use of the body's words. The physical anatomy at issue is, of course, located in the imaginaire. The author takes body parts one by one, much like a writer of blasons, organizing them under four main head- ings: the body as structure, as signifier, as actor, and as divided between interior and exterior. It turns out that apparently allied parts have clear differences in valorization. For example, the tongue is suspect. Even the testifying tongue of martyrs must be replaced by a less mate- rial and thus more spiritual organ. On the other hand, voice possesses a positive value, since it is already dematerialized. The poet's self-portrait follows the same tendency, defining him through the less "carnal" parts such as eyes, ears, voice. The properly tragic moment of this study, as of the poem, concerns the destruction of the body. The elements of that destruction are familiar to any reader of Les Tragiques: humors, excrement, blood. However, even with these familiar images there is much that is new here. Metonymy seems to be the central figure for blood, as it permits the overlap of literal and figurative senses. Moreover, studying such details as the use of the adjective sanglant and images of sucking blood suggests an element of tragic guilt in the victims. The axiological ambiguities already studied byJ. R. Fanlo are extended and concretized in the present work. In addition to those pathological elements, the workings of pathology itself receive atten- tion.This "malady without medicine" seen as a process also comes into play in the political realm, which provides, after all, the real locus of suffering bodies. Most of the pathological images occur in the first two, "diagnostic" books ofLes Tragiques. This leaves an opening for the poetic body to improve its lot in the course of the poem.The body is by nature a moving body. That movement may be vertical, upwards like the poet's body to visionary inspiration, or downwards like the anthropomorphic God on his fact-find- ing tour of earth. It may also be horizontal movement, as in the important images of walking a road or path. The dynamic interaction of body with world may also have its unexpected aspects, as when lexical examination shows that there may be a "good" violence. Coupure is valorized favorably, for example, in contrast to de'chirure. Similar distinctions hold for non- violent motion; vol and voler are generally favorable, while courir is more ambiguous. Alto- gether, images of the body in motion often possess a positivity unique in the poem.They also manifest an individuality in contrast with the generic character of other bodies. It is, in the end, figures of movement that make the poem an act of salvation for poet and reader. In summing up, the author emphasizes three themes from her abundant harvest. The poetic body of Les Tragiques is inherently dynamic; a product and participant of war, it may</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 923 also transcend war. But the body is also uncertain; it is a locus of moral ambiguity rare in the black and white universe of d'Aubign6's polemic epic. Finally, images of the body are a "vive image"; that means participating in the poetics of enargeia and related currents, taking the individualizing power of language to the point of linking inventio with elocutio. The triple division of the bibliography reflects the triple foundation of this study: poetics, rhetoric, and lexicography; images of the body; and d'Aubign6's work itself. In the second area one might wish for some recent theoretical works outside the French orbit such as E. Scarry's The Body in Pain, but such blind spots may be inevitable with such wide-ranging ambition.The volume concludes with a helpful lexical index. There is no question of an exhaustive treatment of the subject. Other approaches and other ways of organizing a critical itinerary remain possible with such a topic and such a text. But Les Mots du corps does deploy a convincing macrostructure, as well as, perhaps most admirably, a sensitive attention to detail. The author's readings clarify-that is, make more complex and more powerful-innumerable passages. In at least one case, the body's reasons illuminate establishment of the text. The author's recommendation offracasse rather than tra- casse at 3.1033, against the earlier critical editions, is vindicated by the reading in Fanlo's new edition. Stephen Murphy ............
