<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS AS ONTOLOGICAL.1 ITHE study of religion as a historical development has for its prin- cipal problem to trace the rise and evolution of the conception of Divine Being, and of the relations which this Being sustains to nature and to the human race. The lowest stage of religious belief seems to be a kind of naive, vague and unreflective spiritism. This belief attaches itself to a motley group of invisible spiritual powers, some of which are ill-disposed, and some more kindly, toward man; but all of which are mysterious in nature and more or less capricious in conduct. But under the influence of political and social changes, and by means of the reflective thinking and insight of a few, a more definitely anthropomorphic conception of the gods, and of their relations to man, is formed; and yet later, but chiefly in dependence upon the teaching of religious thinkers, reformers or 'founders' of religion-'men of revelation '-monotheism appears. In its purest form, this highest development of the religious consciousness first took place, upon a basis common to the Semitic religions, among the Jews; but it is Christianity which preeminently stands for the conception of God as perfect Ethical Spirit, as well as the 'Ground' of the world and of human life. Considered from the empirical point of view, this process may be described as man's making of the Divine Being after the pattern of the constantly improving image of man. The study of the same phenomena from the psychological point of view shows us how the impulsive and emotional nature of man 1 Brief abstract of a chapter in a treatise on the philosophy of religion.</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 9 has cooperated with his intellectual curiosity to arouse and guide imagination and intellect in their efforts to construct a worthy con- ception of God. In a word, the psychology of religions shows us what stimuli have excited, and what activities have been employed in, the task of forming the idea of the Object of religious belief and worship. This psychological study of religion, too, has for its prob- lem the construction, by the human mind, of a conception of the Divine Being in a form to satisfy man's eudaemonistic, intellectual, esthetical and moral needs. It shows us why, and how, man makes God in his own (man's) image. But now, the notable thing about this mental activity, and its resulting product, is its ontological character. For religion is, as a matter of historical and psychological fact, always metaphysical. It is always a naive or a reasoned theory of reality. It is an attempt to explain human experience by relating it to invisible existences that belong, nevertheless, to the real world. Indeed, monotheism finds in its One and Alone God the Ultimate Reality, the Being from whom all finite beings proceed, on whom they all depend, and to whom they all owe the devotion of their lives in a faithful allegiance. This, however, is ontological doctrine-somehow postulated ration- ally, or reasoned out, or superstitiously and vainly imagined. The customary agnostic or sceptical attitude toward the validity of the religious consciousness as ontological is based upon two grounds. Of these the first emphasizes the large part which feeling and imagination play in the construction of the Object of religious belief; and the second points to the dependent and evolutionary char- acter of the conception thus constructed. The conclusion is, that an idea which is so largely the result of unscientific and only half- rational impulses and motifs, and which is so plainly a dependent outgrowth of man's historical development, can not have ontological validity. It is not our present purpose to establish the objective validity, by philosophical discussion, of the conception of the Divine Being, or the Object of religious belief and worship, in any one of its sev- eral forms. It is only our purpose to note some of the character- istics of this ontological aspect of the religious consciousness in genera], when regarded chiefly from the psychological point of view. And, first, the facts plainly show that there is something uni- versal and permanent in the constitution of man which furnishes the stimuli and supplies the principles of control in this form of his creative energy. These very reactions upon his physical and social environment themselves need explanation; and the reasonable presupposition is that their complete explanation involves both man's nature and the real nature of his environment as well. This</page><page sequence="3">10 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY needed explanation religion attempts to furnish by the doctrine that God, the Ground of both nature and man's life in history, is pro- gressively making men more in His own (the divine) image. Now we can no more reasonably, and in the name of science and philosophy, quarrel with the evolutionary method in religion than in any other of the several most important forms of the complex progress of the human race. If the religious beliefs, sentiments and cult of humanity were not subjects of development, then religion could never exist in helpful reciprocal relations with man's other developments. But the data of history confirm what a study of human nature suggests as undoubtedly true-namely, that all the various forms of race-culture are most intimately and necessarily related to the activities and products of the so-called religious culture. Industry, politics, science and philosophy, art and morals, all advance or retrograde in dependence upon one another and upon the religious progress or degradation of mankind. The reciprocal dependence of all these reactions upon the spiritual unity of the race, and upon the particular stages of race-culture, is a general truth established by a study of man's religious history. But all this history shows that the development of religion always carries along with its changing beliefs a certain confidence in its own right to a metaphysics, or a theory of reality, which shall explain those peculiar experiences in which its essential nature, as religion, consists. This general truth as to the procedure of the religious conscious- ness may, as has already been indicated, be considered to involve two equally important classes of factors. The first of these is involved in all the exercises of man's cognitive faculty, and in all the growth of knowledge. The psychological principle which is applicable in religion is therefore applicable also in science and philosophy, and in all the practical life of man. The human mind inevitably regards the constructs of its own imagination and intellect as signifi- cant and trustworthy representations of the real beings and actual events of the world, whenever such constructs seem necessary for a satisfactory explanation of experience. Religion must explain itself to itself; and its explanations, like all other explanations, must take hold on reality. Physical science does the same thing; and the social sciences are no exception to the same rule. The combined work of imagination and intellect has produced many mythical entities for the explanation of man's experience with concrete things; nor can any one be sure that modern physics and chemistry will not soon find their postulated entities ill-suited to perform the office of ex- plaining the world of widening experience in a wholly satisfying way. But, on the other hand, the vain and ineffectual contortions</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 11 of the current phenomenalism in science show plainly how insistent man is upon finding a ground for his conceptions and perceptions of things in a world of reality that is not dependent upon these concep- tions and perceptions. The One Being of the World must, indeed, be more and more looked to, as it were, for the explanation, in reality, of the constructs of both the scientific and the religious imagination. What is sought by both is the completion and harmon- izing of the different factors and aspects of man's total experience with himself and with his environment. This ontological belief, or postulate, or reasoned conviction-whichever it may be, or by what- ever other name one may elect to call it-is as necessary to the par- ticular sciences or to philosophy, as it is to religion. It is as war- rantable in religion as it is in science or philosophy. The other important fact as to the mode of the procedure of the religious consciousness in its endeavor to teach truth of Reality is its 'anthropomorphizing' character. It is, indeed, customary in dis- cussing the classification of religions and the principles of religious development, to speak of one class as peculiarly 'anthropomorphic.' 'Anthropomorphism' is not infrequently considered to be a some- what definite stage in the evolution of the religious consciousness. In the more comprehensive, but quite defensible and proper use of all these terms, however, they are applied to every kind and stage of the religious idea. 'Spiritism' constructs its divine beings after the analogy of man's existing knowledge of his own spirit, and projects these constructions into the totem, the fetish, the phenom- enon of nature, or physical thing, or into the deceased ancestor. In the shamanism of the Mongolian-Tartar tribes, the nature worship of ancient Egypt, the fetishism of Africa and the South Sea Islanders, the totemism of the Red Skins, and even in the survivals of these lower conceptions and practices found to-day among civilized and Christian, as well as Mohammedan, Brahmanical or Buddhistic communities, the process is the same. Polytheism is, of course, dis- tinctly anthropomorphic in its conceptions of the gods. But so is Pantheism. The Atman of Brahmanism can be conceived of and worshiped as a World-Soul only as the result of the personifying process. Of course, the 'personal' God of Theism is anthropo- morphically conceived of; He is the construct of imagination and intellect, in a sort of combined effort to satisfy man's esthetical, ethical and more distinctly religious needs. What, however, is quite too often forgotten is that the positive sciences are all, of necessity, equally anthropomorphic. Science knows the world, and explains the world as a system of interacting and self-like existences. As I have shown2 by a searching analysis 2 In my work called 'A Theory of Reality.'</page><page sequence="5">12 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of all the so-called 'categories,' of which the particular sciences find themselves obliged to make use, every conception of these sciences is derived from an experience with self-like activities, and every relation is stated in terms, as though it were between self-like beings. Natural science is through and through anthropomorphic. Indeed, from the psychological point of view, knowing is anthropomorphizing. On this point the Kantian critical philosophy is unanswerable. But if the metaphysics of physics, and the metaphysics of religion, have their roots in the same psychological process, and stand or fall together when judged by the merits of their psychological genesis and growth, the same thing is not equally true from the ethical and practical points of view. Positivism, or phenomenalism, or agnosticism, in any one of their various forms, does not shock the sentiments and determine practice, to the same extent in science and in religion. A man may, with a certain claim to rationality and a certain satisfaction of his scientific aims, continue in the service of science, undisturbed by either a naive or a systematic, but agnostic, theory of Reality. If, however, one is convinced that one's conception of the Divine Being is only the shadow of one's own fear, or desire, thrown against the background of a wholly unknown and unknowable Reality, then one must either adore one's self, which can cast so substantial a shadow, or one must cease to adore at all. The Object of a truly religious belief and worship must find a place somewhere in the believer's and worshipper's theory of Reality. Now all this matter, as thus far discussed, concerns only the interest of a psychological investigation into the phenomena of the religious consciousness as ontological. The conclusion is that this form of man's conscious life and conscious, creative activity, is ontological; and that the important features of its ontological aspect are such as characterize the use of imagination and intellect in science and in philosophy, as well as in the so-called 'common-sense' operations of daily life. How far this ontological anthropomorph- izing, or constructing of a world of reality as a kind of super- human and yet self-like Being, is rational and critically defensible, psychology can not pronounce. That is a question for philosophy, in its branch of so-called 'Epistemology,' or critical theory of knowl- edge, to undertake. One point more, however, deserves more than a passing notice. Both scientific religion-if such a thing there be-and devout science prefer to use somewhat different terms to describe the total attitude of the rational Self toward the religious Object and toward the fun- damental entities and laws of the particular sciences. The contrast is more frequently expressed by such terms as 'faith' and 'knowl- edge.' It might even be said that the goal which intelligence seeks</page><page sequence="6">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 13 is a rational faith toward God; but toward the entities and laws of the particular sciences it is certified knowledge at which one should aim. It would be found, on further examination from the psycho- logical point of view, that such a distinction is by no means absolute, even if we confine our attention to the customary opinions and expressions of those who advocate the distinction most strenuously. Such an inquiry, however, involves another set of considerations from that before us at the present time. GEORGE TRUMBULL LADD. YALE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
