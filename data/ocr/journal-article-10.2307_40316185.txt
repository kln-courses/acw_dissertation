During the summer of 1987, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) conducted an archaeological excavation at a prehistoric dwelling structure at the head of Larsen Bay, Kodiak Island. Radiocarbon age estimates indicate that the structure was occupied for approximately 1000 years, a time frame that encompassed the late Kachemak culture phase, a transitional Koniag phase, and the early Koniag phase. Data also indicate that this site (KAR-029) was contemporaneous with Larsen Bay (KOD-145), Layer 7 at Old Karluk (KAR-31), and house floors 8 through 10 at New Karluk (KAR-1). The results of the excavation of these three sites, and comparisons between the findings, are used extensively in the development of this report. The excavation at KAR-029 served not only to add to the archaeological record of western Kodiak, but also as a training program for five native youths from the Kodiak Area Native Association (KANA). INTRODUCTION From mid- June to early August, 1987, archaeologists from the Bureau of Indian Affairs conducted an excavation at a pre- historic semisubterranean dwelling structure (KAR-029) at the head of Larsen Bay, Kodiak, Alaska (Fig. 1). The pending sale of the property containing a portion of the site prompted the excavation. In addition to the legal responsibility of the BIA to mitigate the site through data recovery before govern- ment restrictions were removed pursuant to the sale, the project was designed to add information to, and compare findings with, the impressive amount of data collected by Richard Jordan at Karluk and Larsen Bay. We were cautious in our plan, knowing that a partial excavation at one dwelling structure would not produce a plethora of new data. The history of archaeological research on Kodiak is well documented. Excellent sum- maries can be found in Clark (1974a, 1984) and Jordan and Knecht (1988:226). Site KAR-029 has also found its way into archaeo- logical reports. Ales Hrdlicka, in the 1930s, investigated and "mined" several sites in the area. He commented that the artifacts ob- served at the KAR-029 depressions were "the same as those taken from Our Point site (Uyak-Larsen Bay) only less." He also reported that, "this is a large site covering at least 3 acres... on both sides of a good stream, and reaches to beyond another small- er creek... here and there shallow depres- sions , but nothing very definite . . . deposits evidently not deep. . .probably only a large summer camp..." (1944:94-95). Hrdlicka's test excavations produced what is now re- ferred to as Koniag tradition material. A square-cornered hole, possibly a remnant of Hrdlicka' s excavation, is evident at the site. Donald Clark, in his 1965 inventory, also mentioned KAR-029 and, in 1984, two BIA archaeologists investigated the site as part of their native allotment inventory (BIA 1985) . Aron Crowell mapped the site during his 1985 archaeological survey of Uyak Bay (Crowell 1986:86-88). BIA research on Kodiak had been limited to cultural resource inventories on restricted native allotments and townsite lots plus one limited site testing program near Port Lions in 1985 (Crozier 1987). The research design for the 1987 project was derived from the pre- vious work at the large Karluk and Larsen Bay village sites. Primary research objec- tives addressed these questions: would the site offer any information pertaining to the causes behind the transition from Kachemak to Koniag cultural tradition?; would the well documented island warfare be in evidence in an outlying site?; and, would the material remains differ from those unearthed at the S.

Secondary questions pertaining to structure shape, construction methods, depositional environment, subsistence practices, and possible trade routes were also addressed. During the course of the six-week field project, we kept abreast of the research being conducted by Bryn Mawr College at KOD-145, approximately 6 mi to the east. Ongoing discussions with Amy Steffian, field director at the Uyak site, were valuable in placing KAR-029 in a cultural historical context by comparing structural data, features, and artifacts. As will be shown below, the evidence for two separate occupations is most persuasive when the upper and lower habitation floors are studied in isolation and the offsetting of the fire pit and central living area is examined. From a cultural historical aspect, it may be premature or even erroneous to use the terms "Koniag," "Transitional," and "Kachemak" phase /traditions since these analytical constructs are far from being precise cultural markers. These terms are only used for the sake of continuity with referenced publications and as an analytical tool for comparing KAR-029 with other dated sites in western Kodiak. Seasonal versus year-round utilization of this structure is also open to interpretation. The most compelling evidence for seasonal use is found in the faunal analysis (Yesner, this issue) rather than in artifacts or quantity of midden. SITE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS GEOLOGY The stratigraphic sequence consists of loess or early tephras derived from glacial outwash plains covering glacial drift. In the immediate site area, less than 1.0 m of soil, including the loess /tephra, has formed on the glacio-fluvial drift. The excavation produced no evidence of tephra from the 1912 Mt. Novarupta-Katmai eruption, although neighbor- ing valleys on Kodiak have relatively thick deposits of this volcanic ash. The prehistoric inhabitants relied heavily on stone for tools , weapons , and household implements. The immediate area has abundant deposits of laminated and silici- fied slates as well as shale, siltstone, chert, jasper, greenstone, and graywacke. Al- though the chert and jaspers have been reported to be of poor quality (e.g., Workman and Clark 1979; Jordan and Knecht 1988), the numerous cryptocrystalline flakes we collected from the site were compact and of high quality. VEGETATION The vegetation that the soil supports in the Larsen Bay area is dominated by high brush with scattered Sitka spruce and/or western hemlock. Characteristic plants include alder, willow, devil's club, blue joint and fescue grasses, lupine, Jacob's ladder, ferns, sedges, and horsetail (Larsen Bay Community Profile 1981). SOILS The poorly drained soils on valley bottoms consist of dark brown to black deposits often over a very gravelly substratum (USDA 1979:85). A representative soil/ sediment profile for the site area is composed of till overlain by approximately 30-40 cm of loess or tephra, another 40 cm of dark brown to black soil, and a 10 cm litter mat. The loess/ tephra and brown/black soil were the strata altered by human occupation. CLIMA TE Larsen Bay receives approximately 23 in of precipitation annually. Winds, which are often strong, usually come over the mountains and down the long narrow valleys. The underlying till acts as a hard pan and the soils are very poorly drained. The record rainfall encountered by the excavators, combined with a high water table, caused soil saturation to such an extent that the excava- tion units flooded from below. There is no reason to believe that some of the weather problems we experienced were not also experi- enced by the site occupants over the cen- turies. The damp weather, theoretically, could have affected the storage patterns of food resources for earlier inhabitants. FAUNA Today, sea resources are a major source of income, employment, and food throughout the Kodiak Islands. Two thousand years ago the inhabitants also were dependent on marine resources for subsistence, and in some cases, trade. Approximately 97% of all food evidence at the site was associated with sea resources. Today, Larsen Bay has recorded concentra- tions of harbor seal and the head of the bay is a known brown bear denning area (Larsen Bay Community Profile 1981). During our six- week stay, we observed brown bear, deer, beaver, harbor seal, little brown bat, river otter, tundra vole, halibut, gulls, and shearwaters .</page><page sequence="4">Crozier: Kodiak Dwelling Structure 81 SITE DESCRIPTION AND EXCAVATION KAR-029 is actually a site complex consisting of three separate groupings of semisubterranean dwelling structures (Fig. 2). We investigated two groupings that fell within the boundaries of the native allot- ment. These were designated as KAR-029 north and south and they are separated by a fairly deep stream draw. One house depression was excavated at KAR-029 north; it is located on an eroding bank at 6.0 m above high tide level of Larsen Bay. It is roughly circular or oval with a diameter of 8.0 m (Fig. 3). Two alcoves or small rooms extend east and north from the main structure. A small, square-cornered depression to the southeast appears to be the remnant of an earlier 1.0 m test excavation, possibly dug by Hrdlicka. Careful mapping of the structure indicated a somewhat ir- regular central depression at approximately 75 cm below the outer rim. The outer rim was clearly discernible except along the southern wall where slumpage had all but obliterated the house depression outline. The southern locality, consisting of three house depressions, was mapped but no exca- vation was conducted. Time constraints and the fact that we were directing a training program limited the excavation to the one house depression at the northern locality. By the evidence on the eroding bank, which included artifacts, all the house depressions are contemporaneous with one another and with the depressions excavated at Larsen Bay Village by Bryn Mawr College in 1987 (Jordan 1987). The undulating ground and numerous hummocks surrounding the house pit in the three-acre clearing made it difficult to deter- mine which, if any, small depressions were cultural in origin. By using a soil probe and shovel in the outlying pits, it was possible to differentiate cultural from natural site matrix. There was a very distinct break between cultural and stratigraphically sterile deposits. Most of the clearing displayed no subsurface evidence of cultural activity, and midden deposits were concentrated around the dwell- ing structures. The earlier report of a "large site covering at least three acres" (Hrdlicka 1944) is basically correct since the entire clearing is part of the site complex. But much of the clearing is culturally sterile. The house outline that we investigated encompasses approximately 64 m2, and of this area, 25% was systematically excavated in a cross trench pattern. This enabled the excavators to profile a 10 m east-west wall (Fig. 4) and a 7 m north-south wall. Judge- mental, rather than random, selection of excavation units was deemed appropriate due to available time and crew size. We excavated two 1.0 m x 1.5 m and six 1.0 m x 2.0 m units to the basal till. Portions of both the north and east alcoves were included in the excavation plan. Both arbitrary and natural stratigraphic levels were utilized in the excavation. At the base of each 10 cm arbitrary level or at the break of any natural or cultural layer, a six-page unit level report was completed. The deposits were screened through 1/4 in mesh. All bone remains, including fish, were collected as were whole shell and shell hinges for minimum number of individual computation, Soil/ sediment samples were taken from matrices to document the depositional history of the site. Twenty charcoal samples were collected and seven were submitted for radio- carbon age estimates. FEATURES Two of the more interesting archaeological features were a large, round fire pit, asso- ciated with both the Kachemak and Koniag occupations, and a hearth outlined with slate slabs of the Kachemak occupation and possibly also the Koniag phase. Age estimates of the fire pit, based on radiocarbon dates, range between 620±50 B.P. and 1000±110 B.P. (see Table 1). The upper part of the pit was obviously redug, en- larged, and reused during its later use. Originally, the round fire pit had a diameter of 1.1 m. During a later stage, the inden- tation was enlarged to 1.3 m and offset 10 cm to the south. The overall depth of the feature was 52 cm. The large amount of burned fish bone scattered throughout the feature indicates that it may have been used for cooking, possibly baking with hot rocks or coals, or that the fish bone was discarded in the fire. The pit was not outlined with rocks . A slab-lined hearth, at approximately 1.5 m west of the fire pit, was dug into basal till and is similar to other Kachemak hearths. An exact duplicate was excavated at the Larsen Bay Village site in 1987 by the Bryn Mawr crew. Inside the rectangular slab outline were four layers of charcoal and slate slabs. Burned bones, including human, were also encountered inside this feature as well as scattered throughout this and the adjoining excavation unit. The hearth dates between 620±50 B.P. and 1290±80 B.P. (Fig. 5). All faunal samples from the excavation unit (EU) containing the hearth (EU 2) and the adjoining unit to the west (EU 5) were sub- mitted to David Yesner at the University of Alaska. His findings are reported in this issue. The areas of bone concentrations, highest in EU 1, 2, and 5, were designated as faunal features. A concentration of clam shell in EU 5 was similarly designated.</page><page sequence="5">$2 Arctic Anthropology 26:2 Figure 2. Site Map.

Top View of Slab-Lined Hearth. Site KAR-029. A notebook drawing by Hrdlicka (1944:158) shows a somewhat similar hearth with human remains, labeled; "A fireplace with parts of a human skeleton close by." Other refer- ences to Kachemak slab-lined hearths may be found in Heizer (1956) and Clark (1966). Eight post holes were mapped (Fig. 6). Each had a diameter approximating 12 cm, and they all appeared at the middle to lower levels of excavation. No pattern to the holes was recognized, and their distribution may reflect redigging and reutilization of the depression over the centuries. HOUSE STYLES At least until A.D. 1200, the Three Saints or late Kachemak phase shows clear evidence for population increase and establishment of large sedentary or semisedentary sod houses (Jordan 1986:7; Jordan and Knecht 1988:232- 236). During that period, according to Jordan, the sod houses consisted of single rooms and were generally occupied by nuclear families, based on the calculation that they average 25 m2 in area. Whether the pre- sumed seasonally occupied KAR-029 site contained a nuclear family cannot be posi- tively determined, but the single-room house pit estimated living floor did measure about 25 m2. Midden depths in the larger Kachemak settlements, according to JordanTs research, range up to 1.0 m or more. Considerably deeper midden deposits have been recorded at large Koniag sites. The deepest cultural deposits in the house depression at KAR-029 reached 75 cm , which was also the depth of the midden deposit on the eroding bank. The living floor area of the KAR-029 structure did not change drastically during the later Koniag phase, although it was enlarged slightly, apparently offset to the east, and at least one extra room or alcove was added. This is significantly different from the tripling in house size between Kachemak and Koniag periods reported by Jordan and Knecht (1988:236). The later addition of one small room in no way suggests a shift in residence pattern from single to extended family residence as might be ex- pected at a larger village dwelling. The Kachemak period inhabitants utilized basal till for the living floor and a high percentage of the artifacts were found at this level, along with carbon- stained soil and charcoal. The Koniag period occupation floor consisted of approximately 10 cm of hard packed, culturally blackened loess or tephra, again with a higher proportion of artifacts occurring along the floor. Whole and crushed shell delineated the house rim slope that led to the central living area. This may have been the result of housecleaning by prior occupants, or perhaps was intended to stabilize the walls (Fig. 7). The two occupa- tions were separated by sterile deposits, clearly evident in units 3 and 6. This was not observed in the center of the structure where redigging by the later inhabitants obliterated the evidence.</page><page sequence="9">86 Arctic Anthropology 26:2 Figure 6. Hypothesized Plan of Habitation Floors with Location of Features and Artifacts. Midden matrices not associated with the living floors were less compacted, contained indiscriminately deposited fire-cracked rock with charcoal and ash, several gravel lenses, and a few randomly distributed artifacts. All the fauna observed or collected, with the exception of whale, are available in the bay or the surrounding hills. The inhabi- tants would have had fairly easy access to abundant food resources. RADIOCARBON AGE ESTIMATES The occupation span of the dwelling structure at KAR-029 was shorter than originally estimated. Crowell (1986:86) ob- served red ochre at the site, which is often indicative of the earlier Ocean Bay phase. Ocean Bay was not represented in the tested area of the site. The seven radiocarbon age estimates indicate that the structure was utilized between 450170 B.P. and 1310170 B.P. No historic or protohistoric habitation was in evidence. Table 1 shows the cultural association and estimated age of the seven carbon samples. The original house depression was enlarged slightly during the millennium -long occupation and the fire pit and slab -lined hearth were used over and over again. An hypothesized site chronology is shown in Table 2. The upper and lower age estimates in Table 2 are from samples collected from strata obviously associated with the first and last occupations of the dwelling. Periodic cleaning of the slab hearth and fire pit placed some samples out of stratigraphic sequence but the chronological reconstruction appears valid. The occupation period of KAR-029 is contemporary with Layer 7 at Old Karluk (KAR-31), house floors 8 through 10 at New Karluk (KAR-1), and the Late Kachemak houses (3 and 5) at Larsen Bay (KOD-145). Larsen Bay site (KOD-145) house attributes are, in most cases, similar to those at KAR-029, as are many of the artifacts. The similarities and differences between these</page><page sequence="10">Crozier: Kodiak Dwelling Structure 87 Figure 7. Whole and Crushed Shell Lenses. Site KAR-029, west wall, E.U. 5. sites are discussed in the next two sections of this report. ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE A total of 128 tools or worked objects and another 78 flakes of high quality chert, jasper, chalcedony, and basalt were re- covered. The artifacts include household goods (ulus, knives, potsherds), sub- sistence-related items (endblades, harpoon darts, net sinkers, fishhooks), items of entertainment (game disks, tally sticks), and items of personal adornment and possibly ceremonial objects (labrets, maskette) . The artifacts were categorized into three components based on depth (e.g., upper/ lower floor), C-14 dates, and the hypothe- sized association with Koniag, Transition, and Kachemak cultural units. Table 3 lists the objects and their frequencies. The reason that so few artifacts are assigned to the Transition period is that the redigging of the structure caused some artifacts to be re- deposited out of stratigraphic sequence. Also, the separation between the upper and lower occupations was not clearly discernible in the center of the house depression where some of the material from the two occupations was mixed. Flake detritis was concentrated, rather surprisingly, in excavation units 6 and 7 beyond the apparent living floor limit. No flakes were found in the upper 30 cm, where ground slate tools dominated the artifact assemblage . It is difficult at this stage to compare the artifacts from KAR-029 with those of Larsen Bay (KOD-145) since Jordanfs analysis is just beginning. But the one page devoted to KOD-145 in a 1987 report (Jordan 1987:8) does allow for several comparative statements. The Larsen Bay excavators at the Uyak site (KOD-145) uncovered large barbed bone harpoons and slate endblades with incised designs. Neither of these artifact types were found at KAR-029. Our findings do, how- ever, concur with Jordanfs statement that the manufacture of the smaller barbed bone harpoons was haphazard. Chipped stone technology in direct association with ground slate endblades and knives is well represented at both KAR-029 and KOD-145. Apparently, the earlier slate industry of the Ocean Bay II phase, where preforming by sawing, snap- ping, and scraping was predominant, gave way to slate preforming by chipping (Clark 1979:214; Workman and Clark 1979:290). There are many striking similarities between our small collection and that of Old Karluk (KAR-31), Layer 7, and New Karluk (Kar-1), house floors 8-10. As at Karluk, organic artifacts from KAR-029 outnumber lithic specimens. Tally sticks similar to those used in gaming by Northwest Coast Indians (Cutlin 1907) were recovered in quantity from all levels at KAR-1. The four sticks from KAR-029 had been fashioned from bone where- as the samples from KAR-1 were wooden. Other similar artifacts include a composite bone fishhook shank, wooden and bone dart shafts, ground slate endblades, chipped slate preform, ground slate ulus, stemmed, ground slate endblades, a small stone lamp, jet labrets, jet nose ring, and a clay pot fragment . Although the KAR-029 collection contains several artifacts not uncovered at the Karluk excavation levels noted above, similar arti- facts have been found at other levels at Karluk and/or Uyak (Larsen Bay). Two of the grooved stones are very similar to the "Pre-Koniag club-heads" from the Our Point (Uyak, Larsen Bay) site reported by Hrdlicka (1944:226). These may indeed have been used for purposes other than weighing down fish nets or lines. Tools generally associated with woodworking, such as adzes and wedges, were recovered from both Koniag and Kachemak levels.

ARTIFACTS OF THE KAR-029 COLLECTION. two pieces, was sand and gravel tempered and poorly fired or fired at a low tempera- ture. This one sherd adds nothing to the already confusing picture of distribution and differential abundance of clay pottery on Kodiak. Unfortunately, the diagnostic ground slate point collection is not large enough to indicate stylistic shifts through time. Triangular points are dominant and most have square stems. Several are long and narrow with a medial ridge which is considered a horizon marker of the transition between Koniag and Kachemak traditions (Jordan and Knecht 1988:268). Similar points were found in the top layer at KAR-31 and the lowest layers of KAR-1. The dates of occupation and point styles at KAR-029 support this horizon marker interpretation. DISCUSSION Although small in number, the material remains at KAR-029 indicate that the daily life-style of the inhabitants was a microcosm of the larger village sites. Resource pro- curement obviously was the main activity of the inhabitants, but ceremonies and gaming also had a place in the overall life-style. The few labrets could even suggest social distinction among the inhabitants. Taking into account that only 25% of the dwelling structure was systematically excavated, and projecting the artifact count to 100% exca- vation, the total number of artifacts would still be significantly lower than the totals from any village dwelling permanently occu- pied for a similar length of time (e.g., KOD-145).

The ground areas around the individual structures at KAR-029 were not intensively used. This is in striking contrast to the Old Karluk Village site where heavy concentra- tions of fire-cracked rock and bone dumps were observed (Jordan and Knecht 1988:239). With the exception of a minor modification to the structure, it would be difficult to unequivocally state that the house was occu- pied for hundreds of years based solely on the field observations. The seven radio- carbon dates blanket the late Kachemak, Transition, and early Koniag phases, but material evidence indicates a distinct cultural continuity through time. This in situ de- velopmental interpretation is strongly sup- ported by the evidence from Karluk and Larsen Bay (Jordan and Knecht 1988). The partial excavation of one dwelling cannot stand on its own in terms of defining the effect, if any, of external migrations versus internal evolution. However, if external influences were the overriding, or even contributing, cause of cultural change, one would expect that even KAR-029 would exhibit some evidence of this influx. It does not. The evidence for an occupational hiatus is only suggestive. Depositional disturbance caused by reexcavation or cleaning of the structure by the inhabitants through time obliterated hiatus evidence in the center of the depression, if indeed it ever existed. But noncultural layers of loess or tephra, in some areas as thick as 25 cm, do separate two occupations in the depression periphery. A 250-year gap in radiocarbon dates between 620 B.P. and 870 B.P. would generally be considered insignificant but, since we are dealing with an occupation of less than 1000 years, the gap could be of consequence. This is specific to the excavated KAR-029 structure and does not refer to other dated sites in western Kodiak. Interestingly, the three dates reported by Jordan (1987:8) for Larsen Bay, KOD-145, (460 B.P., 1140 B.P., and 1310 B.P.) are exact or very close to three of the samples dated from KAR-029. Radiocarbon age estimates from samples within the central structure and artifacts from one alcove corroborate field interpretations that the late Kachemak occupants utilized a single-room , one-alcove , semisubterranean dwelling structure with an off-center, slab-</page><page sequence="17">94 Arctic Anthropology 26:2 lined hearth. Shortly after the initial occupation, a central fire pit was excavated and put to use. The Koniag occupants added another alcove or side room and enlarged the fire pit. The northern alcove yielded no artifacts but did contain what is interpreted to be an entrance tunnel into the main structure. The eastern alcove, which also contained an apparent tunnel, was at one time used as a refuse area and contained broken artifacts with most of them similar to those found in Kachemak levels throughout the main living area. This enforces the belief that it was associated with the Kachemak occupation although no carbon samples were dated from the alcove. Since the north-facing and east-facing entrance tunnels probably were not used simultaneously, a shift in house orientation from Kachemak to Koniag is a distinct possibility. Encroaching erosion along the eastern bank could well have caused this change in orientation. The coincidence of human bones, some still in the hearth, mixed with sea mammal, land mammal, fish, and bird remains is a fairly common occurrence in Kachemak phase sites, but is uncommon in Koniag sites (Clark 1974b; Lobdell 1980). Finding butchered human bones, possibly as a result of warfare or the killing of slaves, is well documented on Kodiak, as are disturbed burials (e.g., Clark 1974b; Davidov 1812; Hrdlicka 1944; Jordan 1986). Cannibalism has only been rumored (Davidov 1812; Hrdlicka 1944:158; Jordan 1986:7; Reynolds 1987:24) and we have abso- lutely no evidence to suggest this practice, although the treatment of slaves and prison- ers was often quite violent (Davidov 1812). When the data from the 1987 excavations at Karluk and Larsen Bay Village have been fully analyzed and published, a clearer pic- ture of the late Kachemak to early Koniag settlement pattern and house forms will emerge. Also, evidence, or lack thereof, for expansion and the role of external influences will be clarified beyond the latest discussions offered by Clark (1988), Dumond (1988), and Jordan and Knecht (1988). The partial excavation of this small, outlying site enables us to visualize the striking similarities between village life and apparent camp life. Artifacts of a utilitarian, ceremonial, and recreational nature are sur- prisingly consistent with those from larger village sites. The single family, 5x5 m dwelling with possible sunken entrance tun- nels and a raised sleeping platform is almost an exact duplicate of the Larsen Bay Village houses excavated by Bryn Mawr College in 1987 (Jordan 1987:8). There is a relative abundance of undisturbed outlying structures in western Kodiak and they may hold far more cultural historic information than previously believed. At a time when funds and personnel are limited, perhaps we should take a closer look at these smaller, less complex habitation dwellings . Acknowledgments. The joint BIA-KANA operation was made possible through the support, enthusiasm, and dedication of Edward Deaux, formerly the Director of Planning and Program Development for KAN A. The success of the project also depended on the president of KAN A, Gordon Pullar, and the native students. Thanks to students: Leslie Ann Roberts, Robert Carter, Martin Lafever, James Chapman, and Holland Nuipok. Bill Johnson was my field assistant from the BIA for much of the project. Ricky Hoff, a permanent BIA archaeologist, directed the project for two weeks while I was away. He was ably assisted by Michele Jesperson and Beth Turcy. George Walters and Charles Bunch, my supervisors at the BIA, supported the program from start to finish. Draft copies of this report were submitted to Donald Clark, William Workman, and Richard Jordan. Their suggestions and comments were ex- tremely helpful and very much appreciated. Finally, I wish to thank my typist, Lana Roehl. REFERENCES Bureau of Indian Affairs 1985 Determination of Effect Report for Site KAR-029. State Historic Preservation Office, Anchorage, Alaska.
