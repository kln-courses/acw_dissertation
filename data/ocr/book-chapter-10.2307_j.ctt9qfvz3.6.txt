Pin e treats object relation s a s just one of wha t  he call s th e fou r psychologie s o f psychoanalysis : "th e psychologie s o f  drive, ego , objec t relations , an d self " (1988 , 571) . Pine' s discussio n o f  these realms of theory makes no effor t t o reconcile their incompatibilities .  He ignore s th e massiv e cas e agains t driv e theory .

Pine' s uncritical eclecticism  may b e contraste d t o Gedo' s cautiou s holism . Gedo , wh o lament s th e  failure o f psychoanalysis "t o produc e a  theoretical consensu s wit h regar d  to the proper place of object relation s in our conceptual armamentarium "  (1979, 362) , questions Kohut' s claim that scientifi c discipline s may legit - imately utilize uncoordinated fragment s o f theory: "If we have a choice, a  unitary theor y i s preferabl e t o a  patchwork , th e component s o f whic h  bear no discernible relation to each other" (364) .

The chil d answers , "No. I  want my own  Mummy55 (Guntri p 1975 , 146) . In the context of attachment theory , on e  can sa y tha t th e strengt h o f th e child' s tie  t o a  particula r mother —  however harsh sh e may be—infinitely outweigh s the possible desirabilit y  of any substitute figure . A s Guntrip glosse s the situation , "The devi l you  know i s better than th e devi l you do not , an d bette r than no devi l at all.55  One ca n als o sa y o f thi s ti e tha t i t i s instinctive , primar y (no t base d o n  any secondary drive , such a s the nee d fo r food) , and , i n Bowlby' s cyber - netic terminology , th e child' s behavio r (i n thi s instance , he r answe r t o  Fairbairn) "i s a product of the activity of a number of behavioural systems  that have proximity to mother a s a predictable outcome 55 (1969 , 179) , so  that i n th e presenc e o f anxiet y o r difficult y (bein g thrashed ) th e chil d  paradoxically needs the attacking object more than ever !

Bowlby himsel f rarel y put s int o pla y th e conceptua l vocabular y o f  object relations . Wh y i s that , on e ma y ask , an d whateve r happened ,  intellectually and emotionally, to Bowlby's own analyst , Joan Riviere, and  to Melani e Klein , one o f Bowlby' s supervisors ? Bowlb y doe s not neglec t  to acknowledg e hi s deb t t o the m "fo r groundin g m e i n th e object-rela - tions approac h t o psychoanalysis , with it s emphasis on earl y relationship s  and th e pathogeni c potentia l o f loss " (1969 , xvii) , yet mos t o f hi s wor k  departs radicall y from Klein's . The necessar y inferenc e fo r thos e familia r  with Bowlby's methodology and cognitive style is that in rebelling agains t  certain feature s o f contemporar y Britis h objec t relation s theor y Bowlb y  bent over backwards to avoid any inferences no t based on solid , empirica l  evidence. Yet his subjec t matter , a s distinguished from hi s methodology ,  is entirel y objec t relational . H e himsel f declare s tha t hi s mos t "centra l  concepts" ar e "objec t relations , separatio n anxiety , mourning , defence ,  trauma, [and ] sensitiv e period s i n earl y life " (xv) , a  group o f categorie s  that can be lumped togethe r withou t an y distortion a s "object relations. "  Bowlby specifie s tha t attachmen t theor y derives  from objec t relation s the - ory and has much i n common with the work of Melanie Klein , Fairbairn ,  Balint, and Winnicott (17) .

Yet eve n thoug h Bowlb y doe s no t tal k muc h abou t pathologica l objec t  relations direcdy , he does do so on occasion , one of them bein g when h e  approvingly cite s Bateson' s double-bin d theor y o f th e origi n o f schizo - phrenia (Bowlb y 1973 , 317-19). Another instance that comes to mind is  when Bowlby mentions two case s of matricide: "One, an adolescent wh o  murdered hi s mother , exclaime d afterward s [presumabl y withou t irony] ,  CI couldn't stan d t o have her leave me.' " In th e other case , "a youth wh o  placed a  bom b i n hi s mother' s luggag e a s sh e boarde d a n airline r ex - plained, C I decided tha t sh e woul d neve r leav e me again' " (1973 , 251) .  The poin t t o b e registere d i s tha t althoug h Bowlb y keep s neurosi s an d  psychosis i n the backgroun d o f his discussion i n the Attachment and  Loss  trilogy (1969 , 1973 , 1980) , and althoug h h e does no t spen d much tim e  focusing o n separatio n a s a  sourc e o f cripplin g emotiona l conflic t o r  behavioral maladaption except when discussing experiments with animals ,  a comprehensive theory of object-relational conflic t canno t possibly avoi d  attending t o th e theme s o f attachment , separation , an d loss , particularl y  insofar a s the effect s o f pathological parenting can be regarded a s compa- rable to those of separation and loss. The beginnings of such an expansion  of attachmen t theor y hav e alread y bee n initiate d b y suc h figure s a s  Ainsworth, Main and Weston, Henderson, Brown, Adam, and Parkes (al l  in Parke s an d Stevenson-Hinde , 1982) , an d Bowlby' s late r wor k (1979 ,  1988) addresse s the issues of etiology and psychopathology more direcdy  than the  Attachment and  Loss trilogy.  Guntrip's anecdot e concernin g Fairbairn' s questio n t o th e litd e gir l  implies the presence of a sexual factor when Guntrip remarks (presumabl y  paraphrasing Fairbairn ) tha t th e girl' s respons e reflect s "th e intensit y o f  the libidina l ti e t o th e ba d object " (1975 , 146) .

Attachment theory assumes they are not erotic , the  need fo r attachmen t itsel f being the primar y instinc t i n operation . What ,  </page> <page sequence="6"> 28 MODELING INTERPERSONA L RELATION S  then, may be said concerning the relation of attachment behavior to sexual  behavior, especially when Bowlby expressly declares attachment theory t o  be a n alternativ e t o libid o theor y (1969 , 17) ? Th e answe r i s tha t whil e  Bowlby jettison s th e theor y o f psychica l energy , an d whil e h e tend s t o  exclude sexual behavior from th e areas of his attention, he does not in fac t  deny th e existenc e o r eve n th e importanc e o f sexua l behavior .

CONCEPTUALIZING SELFHOO D  The nature o f selfhood i s at least as problematic a s its location. While th e  word self  doe s no t accumulat e muc h resonanc e i n Freud' s works , th e  latent importance o f the term can easily be seen reflected i n such concept s  as th e eg o ( a specialize d aspec t o f self) , th e supereg o (th e internalize d  other as part of self-structure), narcissism (self-love) , guilt (self-reproach) ,  and self-observatio n i n dream s (Freud' s drea m censor) . Th e ris e o f eg o  psychology an d identit y theory , an d th e reactivatio n o f th e theor y o f  narcissism in self psychology, may be regarded in some respects as precur- sors of the development o f sel f theory. Sel f theory a s represented b y (bu t  not confine d to ) Peterfreun d (1971) , Rosenblat t an d Thickstun (1977) ,  Stern (1985) , Basch (1988) , and Lichtenberg (1989 ) shoul d probably b e  regarded a s fa r fro m full y developed . Eve n so , an d eve n grantin g th e  difficulty o f defining selfhood , viabl e models o f self—and th e relation o f  self to other—are now available .  Freud worke d wit h a t leas t thre e model s o f selfhood : th e layered , o r  topographical, mode l (conscious , preconscious , unconscious) , a  develop- mental model (oral , anal , phallic , oedipal , etc.) , and the structura l mode l  (id, ego, superego). Various post-Freudian model s of self, in the order o f  increasing capacit y t o reflec t complexity , trea t th e sel f a s a  containe r o f  forces (libido , aggression), a container of representations (e.g. , memories,  wishes, fantasies), a  structure o f representations (id , ego, superego; inter - nalized others) , an d a  system o f system s (includin g suc h systemi c func - tions as were hitherto attributed to the Freudian ego) .  Aspects of these ways of modeling sel f may be glimpsed i n the follow - ing selection o f observations an d definitions . Hartman n make s a  point o f  distinguishing eg o from sel f (1964, 127) . Jacobson follow s Hartman n i n  using "sel P t o refe r t o th e whol e perso n (includin g th e individual , hi s  body, body parts, psychic organization).

Winnicott postulate s th e existence o f  a spectrum o f selfhood integrity . He represent s this spectrum in the for m  of dichotomous selves : the spontaneous True Sel f and the compliant False  Self (1960 , 140-52) . Erikson' s (1950 ) identit y theory , drawin g heavil y  on Freud 5s structura l and epigenetic models , presents us with a  picture o f  the sel f functioning t o provid e continuit y throug h change .

A  less biase d observe r migh t conten d tha t Kohu t simpl y fail s t o trea t th e  topic with reasonable consistency .  Schafer, who emphasizes the wholeness and integrity of individuals as  agents who must lear n t o tak e responsibilit y fo r thei r actions , includin g  their thought s an d feelings , ha s proved t o b e one of the mos t incisiv e  critics o f eg o psychology , identit y theory , an d sel f psycholog y i n hi s  efforts t o avoid semanti c confusion resultin g from model s involving spli t  selves, anthropomorphism , reification , an d various relate d error s h e en- counters in psychoanalytic writing .

Schafe r  even attacks the term "self 5 itsel f because of the multiplicit y o f meanings  attributed t o it . Worse, th e nominative phrase , "th e self,55 tends t o reif y  the concept of self: "Like the thingness and agency attributed to identity ,  'the self5 concretizes or substantializes a term whose referents are primarily  subjective o r experientia l an d whos e forc e i s primaril y adverbia l an d  adjectival55 (117) . Moreover, he adds, "in some of its usages, such as 'self- actualization,5 Hhe  self5 i s se t up no t onl y a s the existentia l referen t o f  behavior bu t as, all at once, the motor, th e fuel, th e driver, an d the end  point of the journey of existence55 (117). Elsewhere Schafer remarks , with  commendable clarity , "Sel f and identity ar e not things wit h boundaries ,  contents, locations , sizes , forces , an d degrees o f brittleness 55 (1973 , 51).  He mention s tha t individuals 5 representation s o f themselve s var y enor - mously i n scope , time , origin , an d objectivity : "Man y ar e maintaine d  unconsciously (fo r example , sel f a s phallus an d sel f a s turd), an d man y  remain foreve r uncoordinated , i f no t contradictory 55 (52) . Schafe r dis - trusts th e term self  because o f it s protean meanings : i t ca n signify "m y  body, m y personality , m y actions , m y competence , m y continuity , m y  needs, my agency, an d my subjective space . Sel f is thus a  diffuse, multi - purpose word 55 (53) . When Schafe r addresse s the concept o f self-contro l  he asks, "But just what does self-control refer to? Does it refer to a self that  controls, and if so what i s the nature o f that self ? Doe s i t refe r t o a  self  that is to be controlled, and if so what i s its nature and how does it stand  in relatio n t o the exerciser of control .  . .?55 (1978, 78) .

Inherend y dynami c i n  conception (process-oriented) , the systemic model account s for both nor - mal an d neuroti c conflict , th e latte r (les s tha n optima l self-regulation )  resulting from th e activation of incompatible programs (se e Schafer 1983 ,  82-95 regardin g conflic t a s paradoxica l action) .

Though Ster n remark s with plausibl e common sens e that "n o one ca n  agree on exactl y what th e sel f is55 (1985, 5), he himself may be numbere d  among th e man y psychoanalyst s whos e theor y i s compatibl e wit h a  sys- temic view o f self . (Th e exten t t o whic h analyst s explicidy subscrib e t o a  systemic model appear s to b e a  function o f the degree of their familiarit y  with genera l system s theory. ) Wel l befor e th e adven t o f system s theory ,  Sullivan wrot e abou t wha t h e calle d "th e sel f system, 55 which fo r hi m i s  essentially "a n organizatio n o f educativ e experienc e calle d int o bein g b y  </page> <page sequence="15"> TOWARD A  UNIFIED THEOR Y O F OBJECT RELATION S 37  the necessit y to avoid o r to minimize incident s o f anxiety" (1953 , 165).  The father of systems theory, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, insist s that moder n  views of man have in common the principle "to take man not as a reactive  automaton o r robo t bu t a s a n activ e personalit y system " (1968 , 207),  meaning, amon g othe r things , a n ope n (a s distinguished fro m closed) ,  information-processing, dynamicall y self-regulatin g system . Peterfreund ,  whose applicatio n o f systems theor y t o psychoanalysi s remain s th e mos t  comprehensive an d valuable treatment , write s tha t "self , object , an d su- perego representation s ar e highly interrelate d an d interdependent ; the y  form a  vas t system , an d each par t constand y feed s bac k informatio n t o  every other part 55 (1971 , 159) . Rosenblatt and Thickstun say that the self  system "can be conceptualized a s the superordinate system , or the organ- ism itself, encompassing all of the systems operating within the organism55  (1977, 300) . Bowlby, wh o embraces system s theory , tend s t o thin k i n  terms of groups of individuals rathe r than isolate d ones , and he seems to  be uncomfortabl e wit h person-oriente d terms . He discusse s th e concep t  of sel f (1980 , 59-64) , ye t makes littl e us e of it ; ther e is , nevertheless ,  litde o r nothin g i n hi s writin g tha t conflicts  wit h a  systemi c vie w o f  selfhood. Althoug h Stern' s book on self theory (1985 ) doe s not explicidy  refer t o systems theory , nothin g i n his focus o n epigenesis appear s to be  at odds with the systems model. Lichtenberg (1989) , whose work derive s  partly from Ster n and partly from sel f psychology, makes extensive use of  the concept of system even though, methodologically , he does not appear  to rely much on general systems theory as such. Lichtenberg, who defines  "the sel f as an independent cente r for initiating, organizing, and integrat- ing55 (12), generates a  schema of five distinct ye t interactive motivationa l  systems: a  system regulatin g physiologica l requirements , a n attachment - affiliation system , an d exploratory-assertiv e system , a n aversiv e system ,  and a  sensual-sexua l system . "A s eac h syste m self-organize s an d self - stabilizes, the needs tha t constitut e the system5s core are met or fail to be  met55 (275). Basch represents the case for a systemic view of selfhood wel l  when h e writes, cThe moder n ter m psychodynamics can be understood a s  referring to the movement o f goal-directed systems toward decisions. The  process is measured by and expressed in terms of information. Thu s is the  once-mysterious psyche taken out of the realm of the supernatural to join  science, the search for order in nature55 (1988, 58).  While alternativ e model s o f sel f will doubdes s continu e t o be formu - lated, it seems almost inevitable that the more valuable ones will incorpo- </page> <page sequence="16"> 38 MODELING INTERPERSONA L RELATION S  rate systemi c perspectives . I f systems model s o f self become increasingl y  accepted i n psychoanalysis , on e consequence wil l b e the tota l abandon - ment o f libid o theor y an d ego psychology , an d sexualit y wil l probabl y  play a more modes t role , as in Lichtenberg's formulation . To a consider- able extent the systemic model renders nul l the criticism, emanating fro m  people lik e Lacan , o f the idea of a highly coherent , specialized , centere d  self. Fo r Lacan , self , a t th e mirro r stage , i s bu t th e reflectio n o f a n  alienated othe r (1977 , 2 -6 ) ; a t a  late r stag e (th e Symbolic ) self , o r  "subject," i s a subjectivity disperse d i n language and culture. In contrast ,  the systemi c model , which represent s selfhoo d a s an operational  whole  in  spite o f th e numbe r an d diversit y o f it s systemicall y locate d "parts, "  preserves the possibility oi virtual  unity  in functioning individual s without  delimiting th e complexity wit h whic h large r environment s (culture ) can  be represented within the self system. Barratt (1984) , who quotes Adorno  as saying tha t identit y i s the prima l for m o f ideology (251) , mock s the  notion o f "a unified, albei t multifaceted , subject, " (139) , or self , or ego,  especially a s favored b y neo-Freudians an d object relation s theorists , but  his ow n ur-Freudia n mode l o f man a s fundamentall y alienate d an d ir- reparably conflicte d refuse s recognitio n o f the possibility o f functionall y  unified selfhoo d suc h a s may be said t o b e epitomized, i n the vision o f  W. B . Yeats, by the dancer who cannot b e distinguished from th e dance.  In any case, one can claim the existence of room in the systemic model for  virtually unlimite d complexit y o f th e representatio n o f self , other , an d  culture.  One ca n also claim tha t th e systemic mode l accommodate s bot h self - oriented and other-oriented perspective s on object relation s theory. Ster n  declares that he places sense of self at the center of his inquiry (1985 , 5),  yet he manages to pursue his study with ful l recognitio n o f the exten t to  which th e othe r (mother ) influence s th e developmen t o f selfhoo d i n  infants. I n contras t t o Stern , Lichtenstein' s other-oriente d versio n o f  object relation s theor y ma y be thought t o undersel l infan t individualit y  and potential for autonomy by defining identity strictly in terms of instru- mentality (sel f a s a n instrumen t o f a n all-influentia l other) . H e writes ,  "Even a s a n adult , I  believe , ma n canno t eve r experienc e hi s identit y  except i n terms o f an organic instrumentalit y withi n th e variations o f a  symbiotically structured Umwelf  (1961 , 202), identity being experienced  unconsciously b y adults a s variations on themes "imprinted " on them as  infants b y their mother s (208) . In poin t o f fact, Lichtenstein' s theor y of  selfhood, a s identity theory , focuse s a s much o n sel f a s on other .

As a  general rule , the idea tha t the developmen t o f self results i n larg e  part, thoug h no t exclusively , fro m th e interactio n o f sel f wit h othe r  appears t o b e beyond controversy .

Kohu t may be thought of as having extended the concep t  of the subjectivity of the object through his use of the term selfobject.

Ster n  calls one of the more interesting types of internalized object the "evoked  companion": 'Wheneve r a  RIG [ a representation o f an interaction tha t  has bee n internalized ] o f bein g wit h someon e (wh o ha s change d self - experience) i s activated , th e infan t encounter s a n evoke d companion "  (1985, 111) . According t o Stern , "th e evoked companion function s t o  evaluate the specifi c ongoing interactive episode" (113) , thus serving as  an internalized referenc e orientin g response . The seemingly unaccounta - ble experience by an adult of strong emotion, such as love or anger , as a  response to a  relatively trivial situation involving a comparative strange r  might b e accounte d fo r b y assumin g tha t a n "evoke d companion " ha s  suddenly bee n mobilized , howeve r unconsciously . Wher e els e could al l  that affect come from? What Bollas calls "the transformational object, " an  object "experientially identified by the infant with processes that alter self  experience" (1987, 14) , closely resembles Stern's evoked companion, the  emphasis i n bot h instance s bein g o n th e reexperienc e o f a  patter n o f  transformative interaction as distinct from a naked, unmediated encounter  with a familiar figure. Interesting in this connection is the fact that Hadley  speaks of the neurophysiology of attachment not in terms of connections  and bonds bu t in terms of process: "Attachmen t i s the internalized repre- sentation of repetitive interactions with caregivers" (1989, 358). In simi- lar fashion , Beeb e emphasize s internalizatio n a s a  proces s b y stressin g  action scheme s (interactiona l patterns ) a s precursor s o f sel f an d objec t  representations: what is internalized in the earliest representations "is not  simply the infant's own action, nor the environment5s response, but rather  the dynamic interplay between the two. To expand upon Piaget, represen- tation o f the self and the human objec t i s conceptualized a s interiorized  interaction^ rather than unilateral action per se" (1986, 28).  </page> <page sequence="20"> 42 MODELING INTERPERSONA L RELATIONS  One topi c o f immens e significanc e fo r objec t relation s theor y i s th e  internalization of personal meaning. Guntrip comments, "The significanc e  of huma n livin g lie s i n object-relationships , an d onl y i n suc h term s ca n  our lif e b e sai d t o hav e a  meaning, fo r withou t objec t relation s th e eg o  itself cannot develop" (1969, 19-20) . Marris writes about the element o f  uniqueness i n huma n attachmen t i n contras t t o th e comparativ e inter - changeability of objects implied by Freud's libido theory :  The relationships tha t matter most to us are characteristically to particular  people whom we love—husband o r wife, parents, children, dearest frien d  —and sometimes to particular places—a home or personal territory—tha t  we invest with the same loving qualities. These specific relationships, which  we experience as unique and irreplaceable, seem to embody most crucially  the meaning of our lives. We grow up to look for such relationships. If we  do not find them, our lives seem empty; pleasures, ambitions, ideals, career  tend to lose their interes t or their purpose without this context of unique  personal bonds. If we lose these bonds, we suffer grief; and in the depth of  grieving, the bereaved canno t b e consoled b y any substitute relationship .  Even the idea of such consolation is abhorrent, because it seems to deny the  unique value and meaning of what has been lost. (1982, 185)  Although Marri s suggest s tha t "meanin g i s inherently emotional " (192) ,  he does no t spea k of the meaningfulness o f object relation s simply in th e  sense tha t the y ar e emotionall y important ; h e assert s tha t attachment s  structure meanin g i n a  large r way , allowin g u s "t o mak e sens e o f ou r  experience and to direct our lives 55 (191).  Because attachment s structur e meaning , say s Marris , th e los s o f ke y  attachment figure s tend s t o precipitat e confusion : ccWhen peopl e ar e be - reft o f a crucial relationship, nothing seems to make sense any longer. The  world seem s meaningless 55 (194) . Elizabethan s wer e keenl y sensitiv e t o  images o f globa l disorder . Shakespear e use s th e wor d chaos  i n a  contex t  both persona l and global when he has Othello say of Desdemona :  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul  But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,  Chaos is come again.  (3.3.91-93)  As Marris describe s it , th e experience o f "losing someone you lov e is less  like losin g a  very valuabl e an d irreplaceabl e possessio n tha n lik e finding  the law of gravity t o b e invalid 55 (195) .
