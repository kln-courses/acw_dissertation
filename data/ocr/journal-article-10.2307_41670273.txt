<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joost Hazenbos, The Organization of the Anatolian Local Cults During the Thirteenth Century B.C. X + 358 pp. Leiden, Brill - Styx, 2003 (= Cuneiform Monographs 21). € 78,-. One of the preoccupations of the Hittite central administration was the proper functioning of all of the local cults of the kingdom. If any of "the thousand gods" were to get angry any number of misfortunes from plague to military defeat to early death could befall the state. Texts, known to Hittitologists as cult inventories, are preserved from as early as the Middle Hittite period. The vast majority of them appear to come from the reign of Tudhaliya IV, the antepenulti- mate Great King. Many of these quote earlier surveys, some on clay tablets, some on wood tablets, which have not come down to us. Additionally, testimony of local cult personnel concerning the way things were or had been done was often included. Some of our texts appear to be preliminary surveys, while others seem to be final reports, written after the changes that the government had ordered were made. Perhaps the most fascinating thing in these texts are the descriptions of cult statues. Some are anthropo- morphic and are described in considerable detail. Some are zoomorphic and some are aniconic betyls (Hittite huwaši- stones). The texts show that there was a tend- ency over time to upgrade deities' homes from huwaši - stones to zoomorphic or anthropomorphic form. Hazen- bos gives us (pp. 176-190) a chart listing the town, the deities attested for it, the form of each deity's cult object, its material, weight, and any other information known. Interestingly, one cult inventory lists deities such as the River Balili, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Babylon, and Adad of Asšur. Hazenbos plausibly sug- gests that the presence of these "can be explained by the Hittite tendency to get foreign gods over to their side." His comment that "it is not to be excluded that there is a direct relation between the occurrence of the Stormgod of Aššur in this text and the hostilities between Hatti and Assyria," rests on far shakier ground. Ištar of Babylon is also mentioned and the Hittites had good relations with Kassite Babylon, unless we would want to argue that the text was written during the period when Tukulti-Ninurta I had incorporated Baby- lon into his Assyrian empire. The texts also include fascinating information such as, "Formerly the god was (standing) [at the rea]r of the inner room and the community did not see him. Now he is standing on the alta[r]" (p. 23). A deity will usually enjoy an autumn and a spring festival. But some enjoy other types of festivals as well, such as monthly festivals or the festival of the sheaf, of the fruit, of the sickle, of the thunderstorm, of winter, etc. The total of offerings required for each festival are detailed. Sometimes it is mentioned that the cost is borne by the local appanage tamians not express love for their gods, although they expected their gods to love them? Zgoll neither asks nor answers this, in part, I think, because she tends to read these prayers in the manner of professional, courtly ceremonial, composed by a "Fachmann" (p. 272) rath- er than as authentic expressions of individual passion in courtly and ritual guise. Perhaps, in Mesopotamian thinking, mutual love tended to make partners equal, so expression of love was not suited for prayer and petition, when power was at stake. These prayers do suggest, however, that the normal parental mood for a god was at least that of not being angry with people (see p. 118), so if a god was angry, that meant something was amiss and that there had to be some way to identify and correct the problem. Failing iden- tification of the specific cause, the subject must make do with expressions of regret for what he does not understand, and fervid descriptions of how much he has suffered because of the god's anger, hoping there- by to win pity springing from paternal love, or even to arouse a sense of guilt in the punisher. Nowhere in this corpus can one find an appeal based on the subject's own love for his god or goddess and the regard such love should entail. Die Kunst des Betens is a serious, close, competent reading, on a high order, of works of Akkadian litera- ture that do not interest many readers as literature. Its author is blessed with superior analytic and reflective capacities and a strong sense of reading strategy. She shows by example and precept the shallowness of traditional judgments on Akkadian prayers, such as an oft-quoted comment of Oppenheim, who made much of just one instance of creativity he thought he could identify in "the mottled maze of what constitutes the typical Akkadian prayer, hymn or conjuration. Dull scribes have strung up [he means "together," BRF] these topoi, epitheta, etc., without much inner logic or structural connection in longwinded conglomerations of pious phraseology fit only to be rattled off by obtuse priests and to be copied painstakingly by scribes bent solely on maintaining the chain of tradition" (Analecta Biblica 12 [1959], 294). Some readers may feel that Zgoll goes too far in the opposite direction, seeing art in every wedge, but the results speak for themselves: no student of her work will read Akkadian prayers the same way there- after. This is no smooth, easy essay for the reader in search of a flashy insight, and can, in spots, be trying to the reader's patience and good will. But, like the iw///fl-prayers themselves, this book repays careful study. It opens new perspectives on how one can read and appreciate these sources and the author merits the thanks of anyone interested in Akkadian literature for her exacting labor. New Haven. Benjamin R.

A few of the deities have been given transportées or cattle to support the cult. The various texts appear to detail the cults of settlements all over the empire; many of the settlements appear to be mere villages. Hazenbos suggests: "It is possible that the authorities in Hattuša, with the king at their head, considered it of importance to get a grip on these local traditions and to incorporate them in the cult of the state" (p. 172). The work under review gives the Hittite translitera- tion and English translation of all cult inventories undoubtedly written under Tudhaliya IV in chapter 2. Chapter 3 contains "additional inventories of the cult reorganization," while chapter 4 contains "other cult inventories," which includes two middle Hittite cult inventories and the newly discovered inventories from Kuçakli (ancient Šarešša). The large cult inventories already transliterated and translated by C.-G. von Bran- denstein, Hethitische Götter nach Bildbeschreibungen (MVAeG 46/2, 1943), Liane Jakob-Rost (MIO 8 [1961] 161-217, MIO 9 [1962] 175-239) and Charles Carter, Hittite Cult Inventories (PhD Diss., Univ. of Chicago, 1962) are not reedited unless they belong to chapter 2. Chapter 5A discusses "Festival Descriptions," while 5B discusses "Divine Representations." Chapter 6A considers "The Geographical Scope of the Cult Reor- ganization" supporting Houwink ten Cate's arguments that most if not all of the country was inventoried. Chapter 6B discusses "The Role of the Central Gov- ernment." Chapter 7A is "The Stages in the Proce- dure" and Chapter 7B is "The Relative Size of the Settlements." The book is rounded out by a glossary (pp. 221-349), containing all words and names found in texts edited in chapters 2-4, a text concordance (pp. 351-352) and a list of bibliographical abbreviations (353-358). p. 14: Concerning the date of KBo 26.181 and KUB 42.100 (p. 14), it is argued that since the text mentions "His Majesty," "now," "the father of His Majesty," "the grand- father of His Majesty" and "Muwattalliš" "the only way to resolve this 'blanks exercise, is to make 'grandfather' refer to Muršiliš II and 'father' to yattušiliš III, thus making Tud^aliyas IV 'His Majesty' who is in charge 'now'. It is only natural, then, that Muwattalliš II, TudJja- liyaš' uncle and consequently not belonging to the direct line of descent, is not referred to by a genealogical term, but is mentioned by name." Hazenbos' reasoning is fine; however, this is not the only possibility. The signs only "suggest a dating on [sic] Tudfcaliyaš IV/later." Using Hazenbos' own reasoning, KUB 42.100 could also be dated to Šuppiluliuma II (or Arnuwanda III), who would be "His Majesty." His father Tudhaliya IV would then be "the father of His Majesty," his grandfather Hattušili III would be "the grandfather of His Majesty" and his grandfather's elder brother would be "Muwattalliš." Since in section i 17-21, "Muwattalliš'" contribution precedes that of the "Grandfather of His Majesty" it seems that the latter possibility is more likely. And if "His Majesty" in this text is not Tudhaliya IV, can we assume that in all other cult inventories "His Majesty" is that king? p. 45 n. Ill for "Boazkale" read "Bogazkale." p. 72 obv. 6' ALAM TUR MUNUS could with Hazenbos be "a small statue of a woman," but just as likely ALAM DUMU. MUNUS "a statue of a girl." p. 105 ii 8' and passim : I still find a Hittitologist using the word "deportee." As is quite clear in the texts in this book these are people who have been settled by the government to work in FJatti, they were not deported, that is thrown out from Hatti. If anything they are "importees" although I prefer Bryce's translation "transportée" which is both the correct English word and the literal meaning of the Hittite. What could be better? Why are Hittitologists and Assyriologists sticking to a word that reads back the ideology of our modern-day immigrant-fearing nationalist cultures but is completely alien to the realities of the ancient Near East? Oddly the word is left untranslated on p. 109: 14'- 16'. p. Ill ii 11 "fat cake" makes NINDA.Ì.E.DÉ.A sound so unappetizing. The Sumerogram literally means "bread/ cake onto which oil has been poured." It was a sweet, perhaps hai va, with Güterbock ( apud Hoffner, Alimenta Hethaeorum 197). iii 6' a bracket has been omitted before "thick." iii T If the TA was intended by the scribe, it seems difficult to understand how it could be attached to the GIBIL. Perhaps one should read "a new festival along with a great festival." p. 113 bottom: Between the line beginning "At the end of 10'" and before the line beginning "1 PARlSU " there should be a blank horizontal line and then "Obv. II." pp. 114 ii 6, 115 iii 15 for GUG read GÚG. pp. 133, 137f. i 22, 32. I wonder if the mysterious EME- woman, here untranslated, but which would presumably be "tongue woman" should actually be read MUNUSGALA, since a GALA sign is UŠ+KU, which looks rather similar to EME (= KA* ME). A female GALA priest is so far unattested, but at least gets us into the sphere of cult personnel. p. 137. The paragraph line is misplaced. It belongs between i 13 and 14 not 12 and 13. p. 158 obv. 16 "t]emple[s] they have built" as a translation for [...É.ME]Š DINGIR.ME[Š] -tma^-aš weter ignores the =ma and the -as. Perhaps one should translate something such as "but [the men of the tem]ples built them." p. 163 rev. 16 TA can mean "from" or "with" but not "of." pp. 163 rev. 20, 197 with note 69: dannatafih - does not mean "destroy" but "empty &gt; turn (a land) into a wasteland, lay waste." Perhaps the wrong English translation was chosen for German "verwüsten." p. 196 Ura = Seleucia is far from certain (see R. Beai, "The Location of Cilician Ura," Anatolian Studies 42 [1992] 65-73), but it is clearly somewhere on the central south coast of Anatolia, pp. 205 middle, 311: "holders of (the) bronze (dish)" is a literal translation of the Sumerogram LÚ MESZABAR.DAB, but why not call him what he is, "a wine steward" as the author indeed advocates after Singer in footnote 102. p. 220: There is no evidence that the temples' workforces were "mobile." Presuming that we can extrapolate from the royal funerary temple (É.NA4) to other temples, once people were donated to a temple they were bound to the land/job, with even marriages regulated so that one could</page><page sequence="3">Rezensionen 363 bring a bride(-groom) into the community but not marry one out (KUB 13.8, ed. H. Otten, HTR 104f.). The author is to be commended for bravely writing this work in a language not his own, so as to make it understandable to a wider reading public. However, it should have been proof-read by a native English speak- er, since in addition to a number of minor unimportant infelicities, there are a number of places where pre- viously unattested English words are used or where misuse of a word changes the intended meaning, pp. 3, 215, 216, 217 "dispose of" means "get rid of." Better would be "possess" or "employ." p. 21 8' Read "He who." p. 29 and passim ZÍZ is translated "spelt," a word I had to look up and found to mean " Triticum spelta ," a specific species of wheat. If this is intentional some argument or bibliography should have been cited. In the glossary and on p. 61 rev. 17! and 18!, ZÍZ is incongruously translated simply "wheat." p. 83 no. 22 for "leads up to Hattušiliš III or later as date" read "points to Hattušili III or later as the date." p. 93 and passim "deliver on the cost of" is not English nor is it clear since it is unlikely that the Hittite IŠTU X peškanzi refers to delivery charges; read instead "deliver from (the resources) of." p. 103 middle: for "rest" read "traces." p. 105 ii 10' For "It (still) stands out to inquire" read "It remains to inquire." p. 140 iii 18 The translation of "vzvhappeššar" by "member," is one of four possibilities given by HED U 113 and is somewhat acceptable according to "member's" dictionary definition: "a part or organ of the human or animal body, specifically a) an arm or leg or b) the penis." HW2 H 219- 220 translates most of the examples as either "Lende" ("loin") or "Körperteil" ("body-part") either of which is better in modern English than the archaic sounding "mem- ber." p. 145 top paragraph "well basin." While the word "well" can according to the dictionary be synonymous with "spring," in common English usage a "well" is "a shaft dug into the ground or a pipe drilled in to reach water or another liquid," while a "spring" is a "naturally occurring source of water." The sizable pool at Ku§akli seems to collect the outflow from a spring, not water that is hauled up from a well. p. 168 middle, 171 middle twice: "postament" for G,SZAG.GAR.RA. This word is not found in my una- bridged English dictionary, but is found in the Oxford English Dictionary which says it is "rare" and means "pedestal." HED s. v. ištanani and virtually all Hittitolo- gists translate G,SZAG.GAR.RA as "altar" as indeed does Hazenbos in his glossary. On p. 173 "pedestal" is (cor- rectly) given as the translation of palzaha-. p. 170 first line: "resp:" I would guess that this is supposed to be an abbreviation for "respective, respectively or respondent," none of which makes any sense. It would appear that one should read "the filling/opening." p. 171 paragraph 2: "actant" is a pretty word but even the Oxford English Dictionary has never heard of it. p. 174 top: "They made him (.vc. the god Telipinu) (in the form of) a little can of silver." Any English speaking reader will get entirely the wrong picture of what this cult Archiv für Orientforschung 51 (2005/2006) object looked like. ZA. HUM is German "Kanne." The fourth meaning of "can" in an English dictionary (pub- lished in the 1960s) is indeed "tankard," but in today's English a can is "a closed/closable metal vessel for storing food, drink, etc.," which is certainly not what the Hittite meant. One may translate ZA. HUM as "tankard," or as HED does .v. v. aššuzeri- and halwani- "drinking vessel" or as Hazenbos himself in his index translates "cup." p. 196 top: "c.q." does not mean "change of quarters" nor does it have to do with amateur radio and so should not have been used, p. 204 second paragraph, last sentence: "use to" is not the present tense of "used to." The sentence is fine without it. pp. 205, 2nd paragraph, 206 top, 207 middle: "donátor" is listed only in the Oxford English Dictionary , where it is shown to have been used to mean both "donor" (&gt; French: "donateur") and "donee" (&gt; French: "donataire") as late as the 19th c. It is thus a word that richly deserves to remain dead. "Donor" is meant here, p. 215 middle (2x): "adorated" is a fine new word, but it is unlikely to catch on since we already have the perfectly useful "worshipped." pp. 221-222 for the correct English for grammatical terms, the front matter to the Chicago Hittite Dictionary vol- umes L-N or P should have been consulted. For "Com- mune" read "common (gender)" and for "Neutrum" read "neuter (gender)." I certainly do not wish to discourage authors from writing in English. I would encourage them, however, to have a native speaker read the manuscript, because such problems can confuse the meaning the author wishes to convey, not to mention baffle non-English speakers trying to find these words in their bilingual dictionaries. It also mars an otherwise nice work. This is an interesting and most useful book. We must thank Prof. Hazenbos for it. It should find a readership not just among Hittitologists. But since it provides considerable evidence to answer an important and seldom asked or answerable question: "What's going on outside the center(s) of power?," it should be of immense value to all students of religion interested in local polytheism and its relationship to the state.
