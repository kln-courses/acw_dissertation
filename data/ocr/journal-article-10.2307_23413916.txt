<plain_text><page sequence="1">William M. Clements Catflesh in Mexican Food: Meaning in a Contamination Rumor Concern with contaminants in food remains a recurrent anxiety. Even if not a human universal, such concern does transcend cultural boundaries. Certainly its manifestations occur frequently in western expressive culture. References ranging from Greek myths about inad vertent cannibalism (such as that of the dish prepared from his own children's flesh which Thyestes was tricked into eating by his brother Atreus) to such twentieth-century works of fiction as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle reflect fears of unacceptable materials being offered as food. Oral tradition has also provided documentation of such fears, particu larly in rumors about mass-marketed foodstuffs and food consumed in restaurants. Moreover, many people worry about the potentially nega tive effects of additives which enhance taste, durability, and appearance of food, while news stories of poisons criminally introduced into patent medications and packaged food both reflect and aggravate the same worries. As part of the corpus of expressive culture concerning food contami nation, rumors can be investigated from a number of disciplinary perspectives, particularly social psychology and mass communica tions.1 The study of folklore also offers fruitful approaches to analyzing food contamination rumors. For instance, folklorists have suggested ways in which rumor interacts with and influences other genres of oral tradition, identified traditional motifs and themes in contemporary rumors, and shown how rumors reflect and respond to elements in a society's world view.2 These approaches to rumor study shed important light upon the nature of rumor formation and circulation. Meanwhile, the study of rumor can also benefit from other folkloristic methods of</page><page sequence="2">40 Studies in Popular Culture analysis. For instance, I intend to investigate a particular food contami nation rumor from the analytical stance in folklore studies that derives primarily from structuralism and semiotics. A regular feature of visits to my hometown in west Texas has been a meal at one of the restaurants "across the tracks" on the city s "north side," where most of the city's Hispanic population live. On one occasion, though, my father refused to eat at the best known Mexican restaurant; he had heard they were using the flesh of cats in their dishes. Though I had not yet encountered this particular rumor motif at the time, I had examined enough modern rumors of the "dreadful contaminant" variety to suspect that my father's concerns might be a response to a traditional, migratory folk belief. I received some confirmation of this suspicion when I noticed a reference in a folklorist's description of fieldwork in the ethnic enclaves of industrialized northwestern Indiana to an African American woman who refused to eat tacos because she had heard they were prepared from the meat of cats.3 Then when I moved to Arkansas in the early 1970s, I heard some of my students expressing similar reservations about the food in various Mexican restaurants in the state. Several students who came from the White River community of New port also recalled that a peripatetic Hispanic tamale vendor in their town was supposed to have used catflesh in his wares. Later I came across an account, dating from the 1940s, of a restaurant just across the international border from southern California that was allegedly mar keting dead cats.4 To supplement these casual encounters with a rumor tradition that had surfaced for a period of over thirty years in California, Texas, Arkansas, and Indiana, I conducted some focused research. In 1975 I mailed questionnaires to Mexican restaurants in cities throughout Arkansas and neighboring states asking if they had heard the catflesh rumor and if they had ever been its target. A couple of the completed forms from that mailing offer some interesting insights into the rumor's distribution. The vice-president of a Mexican restaurant in Dallas wrote, "I have heard this almost all over Texas," and suggested that the rumor's origins lay "back during the days of the depression when it was believed that the only thing left to eat was cat meat." He cited both restaurants and tamale vendors as targets of the rumor. Another enlightening response came from a spokesman for a chain of Mexican restaurants headquartered in Memphis. He noted, "About 3 years back there was a rumor that a restaurant in Little Rock, Ark. and [an establishment in his chain] in West Memphis, Ark. were serving Cat</page><page sequence="3">Clements 41 Meat in their 'Tacos.'" He elaborated on the rumor's effect on his own firm's restaurant: "Yes, our restaurant in West Memphis, Ark., was a target of such a rumor, which did cause some of our customers and our management some degree of concern. We requested &amp; got a Health Dept. Inspection to refute the validity of the rumor." In the spring of 1986,1 administered a questionnaire to students at Arkansas State University. Of 115 respondents thirty-three had heard the precise rumor in which I was interested. Several others had heard variations ("cat food" at Mexican restaurants, cat- or dogflesh at other, usually ethnic, restaurants), and many had heard of worms being used in McDonald's hamburgers.5 The thirty-three who had heard the catflesh rumor cited restaurants in New York City, Dallas, Memphis, Rockford, Illinois, and Eagle Pass, Texas, as well as the Arkansas communities of Forrest City and Batesville. The preponderance of responses mentioned restaurants in Jonesboro, the city in which Arkansas State University is located (ten responses), and West Mem phis (twelve responses). Most students who mentioned the latter location named the specific restaurant which had been the rumor's target over a decade earlier. Since that establishment is the best-known Mexican restaurant in eastern Arkansas and draws customers from nearby towns, its frequent occurrence in responses probably confirms what Gary Alan Fine calls "the Goliath Effect."6 Certainly my data could be augmented, but they suffice to demon strate that fears of a Mexican restaurant's serving catflesh are tradi tional. But such fears do not exist in isolation. They have diachronic and synchronic contexts that contribute to their semiotic import. My pur poses here are to investigate some of those contexts and to explore that import. I am particularly interested in three cognitive and affective contexts from which this rumor seems to derive: the general fear of contaminated food, American cultural avoidance of catflesh as suitable food, and fear and distrust of ethnic others, especially of Hispanics by Anglos in the United States. One major cognitive and affective context, the general fear of contaminated food, arises in part from legitimate health concerns. The presence of virulent effluvia in the water supply, of cyanide or other poisons in patent medications, and of glass and metal shards in packaged baby food certainly exemplifies the real threats which users of these and similar products may face. But many contamination fears invoke the presence of substances which, though posing no essential physical danger, are still regarded as inappropriate for ingestion. If, as</page><page sequence="4">42 Studies in Popular Culture a team of biologists studying the relative harmfulness of insects and insecticides in food assert, "everyone consumes unseen insects,"7 worms, kangaroo flesh, rodent parts, even catflesh should afford no additional nutritional detriment, especially if they are thoroughly cooked—a definite trait of the cuisine at the fast food restaurants which are targeted in many food contamination rumors. In a cross-cultural survey of African and Eurasian food avoidances, cultural geographer Frederick J. Simoons mentions a "striking belief of primitive Southeast Asian peoples" who assume that food is "more than simply nutrient matter." In fact, they regard food as "both mysterious and fraught with danger; if a man is not careful, the malevolent forces of nature can gain access to his body by way of the food he eats."8 Such a belief, of course, is neither "primitive" nor exclusively Southeast Asian, for most cultures perceive food has having symbolic values.9 Many of these values stem from food's ability to invade the body. As folklorist Roger Abrahams comments, "It is only human that we regard the major orifices, especially our mouths, as providing an access to our selves that must remain inviolate except in the most privileged mo ments."10 Food may be contaminated with substances which poison not our physical being, but which corrupt our social, cultural, and moral identities. The contaminants in food are "nonfood," so defined partially by objective criteria when they obviously produce bodily dysfunction, but primarily so designated by cultural conventions. At this point I am not concerned about why particular substances become culturally identi fied as nonfood, but with the tendency to create a dualism—the edible and the inedible, food and nonfood—which seems more basic to human cognition even than the opposition between raw food and cooked food.11 Several structuralists, Rene Girard quite vociferously, have argued that transgressions of the gaps which occur between the categories in a culture's classification system represent inchoate danger. For example, creatures which do not fit into a group's faunal categories such as the Old Testament "Abominations of Leviticus"12 are to be avoided because of their threat to the culture's order. Human activities such as transvestism which bridge categorical interstices may have the same effect. Girard warns of the perils of a "sacrificial crisis," wherein distinctions between acceptable violence against a ritual victim and anarchic violence may blur, consequently compromising whole sets of distinctions throughout the culture order. Girard sees such a condition as extremely serious and describes its dire results: "coherent thinking collapses and rational</page><page sequence="5">Clements 43 activities are abandoned. All associative forms are dissolved or become antagonistic; all values, spiritual or material, perish."13 Food—or, more precisely, the distinction between food and nonfood—symbolizes order, and contaminated food (the disorderly blending of food with nonfood) represents potential chaos. The eater of nonfood undermines, con sciously or unconsciously, a fundamental categorical distinction. The person who introduces contaminating nonfood into food, whether from carelessness or malice, is guilty of poisoning the individual eater's self and the entire cultural order. As such a basic symbol of a culture's order, food joins marriage partners as among the most important means of exchange between individuals and groups, both infraculturally and interculturally.14 Most societies have strongly enforced conventions concerning who is mar riageable for specific individuals. One can cite laws against incest, miscegenation, and polygamy as examples from the American past and present. Similarly, most societies have strongly enforced conventions concerning what is edible. Penalties for violating these conventions may not be a rigorous as those for breaking the marriage rules, but those who eat the inedible are often regarded as socially marginal. As Igor de Garine notes, "In ancient traditional societies, only outsiders, slaves and the mentally ill were exempt from food laws."15 Quite palpable penalties may await someone who causes another inadvertently to ingest the inedible. If death ensues as a result of contaminated food, the contaminator will be guilty ofmurder or negligent homicide. If the result is merely the disgust which arises from eating nonfood, the contamina tor will be ostracized as someone who has not operated according to the rules of the culture, who has betrayed the culture's order and suborned others to like betrayal through his perversion of the exchange system. Fear of contaminated food in general has three major symbolic valences: such food invades the self with substances that may do physical, psychological, cultural, social, and/or moral harm; it blurs what must be one of every culture's most fundamental categorical distinctions, food and nonfood, and may thus undermine the culture's order; and it perverts one of the most crucial channels of exchange and thus of establishing and maintaining infragroup and intergroup rela tionships. Why, though, does the introduction of high-protein, low-fat catflesh contaminate food in American culture? Why is meat taken from cats considered nonfood? In his food avoidance survey, Simoons includes chapters on pork,</page><page sequence="6">44 Studies in Popular Culture beef, horse, chicken, dog, and even camel, but catflesh is notably absent—perhaps so obviously a meat to be avoided that it needs no particular comment. The word "cat" does not even appear in the index to Simoons' book, though he does make passing references to the ritual consumption of tiger and lion flesh among groups in India and central Africa. Likewise Marvin Harris' more recent exploration of the "riddles of food and culture"16 cites no instances of even occasional eating of catflesh among the world's cultures. Certainly, though, many cul tures—including that of mainstream America—regard eating catflesh with extreme distaste. The reasons for that distaste are far from simple. In fact, catflesh carries a multiple load of negative symbolism. First, cats are carnivores and within the Judeo-Christian heritage are consequently prohibited. Jean Soler has argued that Hebrew taboos on eating the flesh of carnivores derives from the double guilt that would attach to the consumers. They will bear their own blood guilt for killing the animal to be eaten. While this may be assuaged through sacrifice as is done when they kill a calf or a lamb, the eaters of a carnivore also assume the animal's blood guilt. This blood guilt may not be assuaged.17 Persons eating a cat, then, would, like the madman Renfield in Dracula, become liable for all the blood the cat has shed. If Old Testament dietary logic seems too remote to explain modern American aversions to catflesh, a second level of symbolism may seem more relevant. In his speculations about the etiologies of various flesh avoidances in the Old World, Simoons cites the animals' eating habits: "the scavenging pig... eats all kind of filth;"18 eggs are "unclean because of chickens' eating habits;"19 and "the dog is a scavenger who eats dirty food."20 Cats, who eat mice and rats, may fall under the same ban. They themselves become nonfood because of the kinds of material they ingest. A third level of symbolism, relevant to explaining American aver sions to catflesh, emerges from the cat's relationship to human society. Edmund Leach has suggested that cats and dogs are treated with attitudes resembling taboo because of their status as pets, creatures who, though nonhuman, abide close to humanity.21 Once again one can draw comparisons between catflesh avoidance and the avoidance of other animals as food—especially the dog, subject of the sentiment called the "Rover complex."22 The cat, who may share much of human life, may become so much an adjunct to society that it is regarded as totally inedible. Further light on why the cat's status as pet contributes to the avoidance of its flesh as food comes from the ideas of A. Angyal regarding the emotion of disgust.23 Angyal argues that people experi</page><page sequence="7">Clements 45 ence this emotion most strongly about matter that was once a part of their own bodies (e.g., feces, spittle, mucus). As a pet, the cat is a part of the corporate social body and when cast off in death may awaken the same sense of aversion precipitated by cast-offs from the individual body. Another source of catflesh avoidance among Americans may be the tendency to view cats in highly anthropomorphic terms, assigning to them human attributes and assigning to humans catlike qualities. It may be, as anthropologist Stewart Guthrie posits,24 that humans have an almost innate tendency to perceive aspects of their environment anthropomorphically, but cats seem to be singled out especially for such treatment. For example, the comic pages of the newspapers I regularly read contain the human-like adventures of four anthropomorphic cats: Garfield, Bill (from Outland, formerly from Bloom County), Jasper (in Sam and Silo), and Hobbes (in Calvin and Hobbes). To these can be added animated (and humanized) cartoon cats such as Krazy Kat, Tom, Sylvester, the Pink Panther, Felix, and Fritz. One may also cite the use of "cat" and associated words to refer to humans. For example, the Dictionary of American Regional English lists the following meanings for "cat": "A malicious and spiteful woman;" "A prostitute or woman of questionable morals;" "A performer or aficionado of jazz music;" "A good fellow, a guy;" "An expert;" and "one who has qualities of timidity, nervousness, or furtiveness [as in 'fraidy-cat']."25 Also relevant is the use of "cat" for the female genitals, "pussy" for the same, "puss" for the face, and "cat and kitties" for the breasts.26 "Cat" and "Kitty" are also clipped and diminutive forms for certain English proper names. The anthropo morphic qualities imputed to cats as well as these linguistic data place cats in a position beyond that of pets. Eating catflesh would approach cannibalism, at least metaphorically. Finally, aversions to catflesh may be explained from the perspective of cultural materialism advocated by Marvin Harris. Speculating about the reasons Americans do not eat their pets (dogs as well as cats), Harris suggests two contributing factors.27 One is that the creatures which Americans usually choose as pets are inefficient sources of food. Com pared to cattle, pigs, and poultry, cats provide little in the way of usable nutrients, particularly in proportion to the effort required to process their flesh into food. If other sources of animal food were not readily available, Harris argues, catflesh might be acceptable in the American cuisine. But "optimal foraging theory" posits that seekers of food will choose the food sources that deliver the most product for the least labor.</page><page sequence="8">46 Studies in Popular Culture The other factor that makes catflesh unacceptable to Americans, according to Harris, is that cats and other pets perform services that make them more valuable as living beings than as dead food. He cites such services as rodent control, status indication, entertainment, edu cation, sport, protection, and companionship as some of the particularly valuable contributions which cats and other pets make to Americans' lives. "The overriding utility of pets in contemporary society is that they can substitute for people in satisfying our specific cultural lack of warm, supportive, and loving relationships," Harris asserts.28 To eat them when other, more efficient sources of food are readily available would be economically unsound. Aversions to catflesh probably arise from several, if not all of these factors, which clearly identify this flesh as nonfood for Americans. That such nonfood should be served at a Mexican restaurant to primarily Anglo customers introduces another dimension to the rumor treated here. Many modern legends and rumors have decided interethnic components: poisonous serpents in Asian-produced textiles at discount stores or Anglo children attacked in public restrooms by Hispanics or African Americans, for example. Such tales have led one commentator to identify a pervasive "distrust of anything foreign ... in modern American oral tradition."29 Many such stories, in fact, focus particularly on food contaminated by ethnic others. Examples include the accusation that Jews and lepers were poisoning Christians' wells in fourteenth century France, the frequently reported account in Britain and on the continent of a Chinese restaurant's using flesh from German shepherds, and the poem composed by Australian versifier J. Brunton Stephens, "My Other Chinee Cook," which tells of the use of puppies to make "rabbit" pie.30 Moreover, many ethnic stereotypes derive in part from the alleged eating habits of their targets. For instance, Vietnamese in America eat dogflesh, according to contemporary folk belief.31 Ethnic groups may be identified by alleged food preferences: "Krauts" for Germans, "Frogs" for French, "Spaghetti Benders" for Italians, and "Chili Guts" for Mexicans. A significant number of text types in the Polack joke cycle focus on eating habits.32 In most cases, the cuisine component in stereotyping reveals food's ability "to express tensions across cultural boundaries."33 Turning a well known proverb around, this component suggests, "They are what we don't eat." Or as Roger Abrahams has noted, "In a system in which eating lizards is forbidden, calling another group 'lizard-eaters' is to place them in a symbolic categoiy of non-humans."34 The catflesh at a Mexican restaurant rumor,</page><page sequence="9">Clements 47 though, does not suggest that Mexicans eat nonfood and are thus nonhuman, but that they Eire treacherously causing unsuspecting Anglos to eat nonfood. Studies of Anglo stereotyping of Hispanics have generated lists of traits imputed to these manifestations of ethnic otherness. A survey of the writings of nineteenth-century travelers in the Southwest found the region's Hispanic population to be characterized as "lazy, ignorant, bigoted, superstitious, cheating, thieving, gambling, cruel, sinister, cowardly half-breeds. "35 A sociological study of a south Texas town found that Anglos viewed Hispanics as "improvident, undependable, irre sponsible, childlike, and indolent" as well as dirty, prone to drunkenness and animality, "mysterious, unpredictable, and hostile to Anglo-Ameri cans."36 Laziness seems to be a recurrent feature of the stereotype, the phrase "lazy Mexican" being an almost automatic construction.37 The laziness component carries over to the image of Mexican restaurants. According to a piece in the "Psychology and Investing" section of Forbes magazine, Mexican restaurants were enjoying popularity in the 1980s partially because of their informality: "They seem to serve something besides food—tranquility."38 Hispanics are also perceived as being lower class, often linked to African Americans in this regard. A Roper survey in 1949 showed Hispanics ranked second only to Blacks in three of four areas of negative attribution.39 And Ruth D. Tuck writes, "It is a staple article of belief throughout the Southwest that the Mexican immigrant was the 'lowest' of any group to enter this country."40 The catflesh at a Mexican restaurant rumor says, in paraphrase, that lazy, lower-class ethnic others are offering a substance that is nonfood in multiple respects as if it were food to their social and cultural superiors. They thus violate the rules of food exchange while treacher ously suborning their trusting victims to undercut the culture order. As the Mexican restauranteurs trick their hapless customers into violating one very fundamental categorical distinction, they themselves violate another: that between social classes. There are situations in which nonfood may be offered and accepted without challenging the food-nonfood dichotomy. A striking example occurs in Raymond Firth's data on the Tikopia. Like most people, the Tikopia evince an aversion amounting to disgust toward human excre ment. Firth notes, "Some of the most filthy... Tikopia curses invoke the father or other kinsman to eat excrement, to eat the inedible. ... In metaphorical terms the cursed one is invited to bring together the incompatible ideas of eating and non-edible, a conjunction supposed to</page><page sequence="10">48 Studies in Popular Culture imply frustration, shame and degradation." Yet many Tikopia prayers and ritual formulas begin by announcing to the god or spirit, "I eat ten times your excrement."41 Firth's analysis of this traditional invocation emphasizes its delineation of human debasement before supernatural power. It amounts to a clear statement of inferiority and does not represent a revolutionary challenge to the culture order. In the New World, similarly, clowns at San Juan Pueblo "consume quantities of human waste to demonstrate the utter humility their calling re quires."42 Closer to the experience of many mainstream Americans is the merging of food with nonfood in the Eucharist. Most Americans avoid the consumption of blood, and cannibalism is universally pro scribed in the society. But the sacrament invites communicants to ingest the body and blood of the deity. Although it is divine, not earthly substance into which the sacramental elements are transformed,-such nice distinctions are seldom articulated. People receive the inedible from a representative of the deity and are thus reminded of their indebtedness to that deity, their subservient status. More mundane, but still relevant is a proposed theory of origin for some of the delicacies that constitute "soul food" among African Americans. Claude Brown and Al Calloway have hypothesized, "When it came down to the hog, the planters didn't know anything except ham, bacon, spareribs and chops. The rest of it was no good, or so they thought, and the slaves copped it. They came up with pig tails, pig knuckles, ham hocks, hog maws, pig ears, snout, neck bones, chitlins, tripe and sowbelly."43 Parts of the pig regarded as nonfood by the white establishment were left for their social inferiors, who accepted them as part of the normal order of affairs, not as a challenge to cultural distinctions. These examples should demonstrate that the offering of nonfood as food is permissible in some circumstances when the exchange moves from social superior down to social inferior. Such an exchange may amount to a "putting down," a reminder of inferior status. But if social inferiors make such an offer to their superiors, the social order is being challenged Hence, if a Mexican restaurant tricks its Anglo customers into eating catflesh, the conventional social order is overturned along with the basic categorical distinction between food and nonfood. The Anglo who responds with fear to this rumor expresses not just his disgust at devouring a tabooed flesh, but also his insecurity about his status as a socially superior being.44 That Hispanics have traditionally been regarded as quite low on the social scale reinforces this interpre tation. The laziness component of the Anglo stereotype of Hispanics</page><page sequence="11">Clements 49 enters when one notices that it is only through a relatively passive activity—the contamination of food—that Hispanics challenge the order of things. The catflesh in Mexican food rumor is not just about food. Instead, it addresses issues of cultural categories and the cultural order which define not only what we eat, but also where we perceive ourselves to be in the social hierarchy. The study of traditional rumors can lead to a consideration of fundamental issues in society and culture. Such study, which must go beyond just an attempt to debunk the rumors, may involve the identi fication of traditional themes in rumors, the tracing of the historical development of the rumors, and a demonstration of how the rumors reflect the immediate concerns of their cultural context. But it should also take into account the semiotic fields of which the components of the rumors are a part and suggest the roles the rumors play in perpetuating the codes and messages of those fields.
