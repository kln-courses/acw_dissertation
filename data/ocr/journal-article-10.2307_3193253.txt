INTRODUCTION: Some animals appear regularly in the visual arts of the world's cultures. Students may be familiar with Chinese dragons, Egyptian jackals and falcons, Christian doves, medieval unicorns, the placid cattle in European landscapes, buffaloes and pack animals of the American westward movement, the antelope of the African chi-wara headdresses, the she-wolf who in legend raised the twins who founded Rome, and others. It is sometimes useful, however, to use a single visual theme to explore a variety of cultures, especially a theme that no single culture has adopted as a motif. The fish is ideal for these purposes. Fish really exist, in nearly all climates, in inland and coastal cultures, as a food source. While there are some 20,000 species offish, they have some design qualities in common, and these can be reviewed with children before attempting the activities suggested here: fish are dominantly two-dimensional, with a strong rec- ognizable silhouette; their surfaces are smooth; living in water and surrounded by it, they can be shown by themselves, as "free-floating" ungrounded forms; the narrow range of facial expressions means we can avoid anthropomorphic interpretations and concen- trate on design, aesthetic interpretation, and cultural comparisons (Other animals can serve a similar purpose, and you may augment these examples). INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES: A goal of all our Museum programs is to sharpen students' ability to see: while few students go on to make art as adults, most adults continue to see all their lives. Enriching this experience is a major goal of museum education. Too many in our galleries read labels first, glancing only afterwards at the works, lacking the confidence to "read" art on its own terms. Many of our programs are efforts to remedy this situation - to enable people to "slow down and look," to become their own art critics, to enjoy works of art for their own aesthetic qualities, with or without back- ground information about them. Teachers can help younger museum visitors develop these skills early. The instructional strategies outlined here are aimed at strengthening students' perception of works of art; specifics are provided with each object. 1) Seeing and Describing: Discussion or writing activities can encourage descriptions that are "clear 26 Art Education/May 1991</page><page sequence="3">enough to help a friend imagine this piece. Help someone find this work, just from the words." 2) Imagination: "What if?" questions can en- courage students to see and interpret details. "What if this work belonged in a kitchen - what would it be for? What if it belonged in a shrine - then what would its purpose be? What if you saw two objects from places thousands of miles apart, in a store together: what tales of adventure or trade could account for their being side by side?" Cultural-contact exercises are good for older students; right answers are less important than the careful use of evidence. 3) Students' interpretations: Studio activities where students re-interpret the work encourage them to explore its design and meaning. Individual or group projects can produce results to be displayed in "mu- seum-like settings" (on walls or "pedestals") or in the everyday settings for which some works may origi- nally have been made. Three-Fish Vessel West Mexico, Colima, 200 B.C.-A.D. 300 Earthenware, 11" high Gift of Morton D. May 155:1980 The Saint Louis Art Museum Background: Long before European explorers ar- rived on this continent, complex communities and civilizations thrived in the area we now call Mexico. The Aztecs were among the most famous and last of these, with enormous cities and temples in the central area that is now Mexico City, conquered by Hemrnando Cortez in 1521. But long before the Aztecs, other native peoples thrived in communities of varying sizes. One of these centers of civilization was on the West Mexican coast, isolated by the Sierra Madre mountains. The Colima people remained indepen- dent of the rest of Mexico, developing a distinctive artistic style only slightly influenced by that of other native peoples. This three-fish vessel is an example of the Colima people's whimsical use of animals in the design of their earthenware pots. It is made of a fine, highly-polished buff-brown clay, with incised mark- ings defining the details of the fish. You can see two fish here and the tailfin of the third, behind them. They are hollow, and they surround a hollow vase form: this is a vessel for holding water or other liquids. Many Colima vessels were made for burial with bodies in deep tombs; this vessel was probably buried. It is typical of the playful use of animals in the functional ceramics of this culture. INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES: 1) Seeing and Describing: This is an unusual way to combine three fish. Write a letter to a friend who will soon be visiting the museum where this work is on view. Assume that there are several vessels of the same materials that use fish in different ways. De- scribe this work clearly enough that your friend will recognize this piece the minute he/she sees it. De- scribe the position of the fish, how they are connected, what kinds of details you see, how heavy this piece might be. What makes this work especially memo- rable? Compare this piece to Roy Lichtenstein's "Goldfish Bowl II," another three-dimensional work: which has more fish? Which would look more different from the side? in which piece are the fish more different from each other? 2) Imagination: How do you suppose the artist got the idea for this work? Would he or she ever have seen fish together like this? What other animals might the artist have used for a water vessel? If this were full of water on a table, how would you pour from it? How would you fill it? This photo is black and white: what color(s) could these fish be? 3) Students' interpretations: Pick another water animal, and draw a design for a hollow clay pot that would use three of them and hold water. Make three fish out of clay and attach them to a simple clay base in a solid construction; what would you have to do to make this arrangement hollow? Try this design with only two fish, or with four. Which arrangement do you like best, and why? Fish Swimming Amid Fallen Flowers Liu Cai, Chinese, active 1068-1085 Scroll: Ink and watercolor on silk (full size 99-3/8" long, 10-3/8" high; detail of right 1/4) Purchase: William K. Bixby Oriental Art Purchase Fund 97:1926 The Saint Louis Art Museum Background: Artists during China's Sung dynasty (960-1279) were concerned with portraying the beauty of nature. The great landscapes of this period show people as very small beings within very large scenes, existing in harmony with nature in a reverence for living things that reflected religious beliefs. The artist of this painting explores a very small corner of nature: fish, water weeds, and blossoms. This is one section of a long hand-scroll, a portable art object that tells a story from right to left as it unrolls. The quiet story is: Art Education/May 1991 27</page><page sequence="4">(0 CD ? o 00 C V' 2.- $= 0) (9 "o co cn r- LL&lt; Co.J CU} :E3r 0,, '0 EO.c &lt; C 28 Art EducationlMay 1991</page><page sequence="5">Eo 0 0 CU 8 ot "ob 0 : cm U')0 Cj S0 (V) Co Cb 1=,0 00 .,cm Art Education/May 1991 37</page><page sequence="6">pink blossoms have fallen from a twig onto water, where fish are waiting to catch them; one lucky fish catches a petal and swims to the left, pursued by other fish and passing otherwater life as it travels. The story is told in watercolor and ink; the painting is not signed, but Liu Cai was famous for his aquatic scenes and probably painted this. At various places on the scroll there are seals (made by stamps), the "signatures" of the people who owned this scroll over the years: the earliest seal is from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) palace, and dates from around 1373, about 300 years after it was painted! This scroll has had a long life. INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES: 1) Seeing and describing: Careful description would be important in telling a friend which part of the scroll this is, since there are fish and plants all along the way. What details would you describe to help your friend find this very part? Where are the fish in this section? How many? In what directions are they facing? What colors seem most important? Where is red? pale green? What are the most important com- positional elements? Compare these fish to the ones in Lichtenstein's "Goldfish Bowl II," which are also almost flat: how are the fish in the two works similar? how are they different? Which fish seem to be going somewhere? 2) Imagination: Where are these fish - in a river, a pond, what country, what weather? - and what brought them all together? What could be happening in the section of the painting just before or just after this one? How fast do you think these fish are moving, and why? If these fish could have a conversation about what they're doing, what might they say? What might they say to the fish in "Goldfish Bowl II"? to the three fish on the Mexican vessel? 3) Students' interpretations: Any narrative story can use the portable-scroll format. Have each student select a sequence of events from their own lives and portray it in a long horizontal water color scroll (per- haps moving from left to right, as we read): select a quiet, slow sequence (awalk through a grocery store, or unwrapping birthday gifts), and work in three 18- inch sections. Do the same for a faster sort of nar- rative - a car trip or a race to a finish line. Assemble the three sections with tape, roll them up togetherwith dowelling as a handle, and tie them with yarn. Pair students togetherto unroll each other's scrolls and tell the stories they portray. Salmon Clan Hat Northwest Coast, Tlinglit tribe (southern Alaska), 1850-1925 Wood, paint, abalone shell, and operculum; 15-1/3" high, fish 20" long Gift of Morton D. May 274:1982 The Saint Louis Art Museum Background: In the native tribes of the Northwest Coast of North America, every person is born into a clan, a family group with common ancestors and legendsthat referto special creatures, animals, birds, and supernatural creatures. These spirits guard each clan; their symbols decorate the possessions of clan members. Because the Northwest Coast region is rich in fish (salmon is still a major product of the Seattle region), and abundant rain produces dense forests and wood, carved wooden images of fish often appear in the art of the coastal tribes. According to Tlinglit legend, salmon are immortal supermen who live in an underwater house, become fish every year to feed the people, and are recreated from bones thrown back to the water. This painted cedar helmet has the family emblems of its owner: a raven and a salmon. The raven is carved around the surface of the cone-shaped hat; the salmon (with ferocious teeth) extends out from the peak. A person wearing this helmet in a ceremony would also paint his face to look as imposing as this fish's face. INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES: 1) Seeing and Describing: (Note: The hat is per- fectly symmetrical, the same on the other side). Pick a partner, and before this partner sees this picture, describe this hat to him or her using only words, no gestures; the partner should try to draw this hat, using crayon or other colors, according to what you say When the drawing is finished, compare it to the photograph: what did you describe best (or what did your partner understand and draw best)? What's easiest to describe (the fish? the colors? the shape?) What's hardest? Compare to the Mexican three-fish vessel: how are the details in the two works different? Which is harder to describe, and why? 2) Imagination: The salmon is a big fish, and this is almost life-size. Imagine what a hat would look like in a culture where the goldfish was the most famous fish. The hat is of carved wood: how comfortable would it be to wear? How heavy? How do you imagine 38 Art Education/May 1991</page><page sequence="7">people keep these hats on their heads? Do you think it's something they would wear every day? Why or why not? If this hat and the Mexican three-fish vessel turned up in a shop in San Francisco, how might they have gotten there? 3) Students' interpretations: Using a large paper circle cut on one radius and stapled to make a cone, design a clan hat featuring one or two animals impor- tant in your life or your neighborhood. Do one design using only two colors. Do another using as many colors (but different ones) as you can count in this example. Design a clan hat featuring a much smaller fish - a goldfish or a minnow: how could you change the design to accommodate the smaller size of the original? Goldfish Bowl II, 1978 Roy Lichtenstein (1923-), American Cast and painted bronze, 39" x 25-1/4" x 1" Purchase: Funds given by the Shoenberg Foundation, Inc. 2:1979 The Saint Louis Art Museum Background: Roy Lichtenstein is a modern painter. He has been known as a "pop artist" because he often uses images taken from popular culture, or everyday life. He is famous for his huge paintings that look like comic-book scenes, complete with the tiny color dots. But he has also made ceramics and sculpture. Al- though this object looks two-dimensional, you can see the shadow it casts: it is a thin metal sculpture, one inch thick, standing on a base. Lichtenstein was inspired by a painting by the French painter Henri Matisse called "Les Poissons Rouges" (Goldfish); he painted his own version of this painting, and then translated it into this sculpture. In both paintings, a tall round fishbowl much like this sits on a table with other objects, and there is a lot of color. This sculpture version is made of cast bronze with many coats of paint and sealer. As with a real fishbowl, you can see through this one, in the spaces the artist has left between the metal. INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES: 1) Seeing and Describing: Before giving the title or any information about the piece, ask students what it is. How do you know? Is it a painting or a sculpture? How do you know? How many fish are there? Where is the water? How many colors are there? What are the stripes? If you saw it in a museum, would you want to look at it more closely? Why? Name three ways these fish are different from the fish on the Northwest Coast clan hat, or on the Mexican three-fish vessel. 2) Imagination: This is a two-dimensional picture of athree-dimensional object that you can walk around. How would it look from the side? Describe it back- wards, as if you were on the other side of it. If you added another detail to this work (another fish, a plant), where would you put it and why? If you could remove one fish, which one would you "miss" most and why? 3) Students' interpretations: With blue con- struction paper, create a large cylindrical "fishbowl" for each student. Ask students to use cut paper, ribbons, and transparent paperand attach them to the outside surface to a) reproduce this very image in three dimensions, and then b) design their own fish- bowls with anything they want "in" them: ask students to discuss their choices and to describe the differ- ences between their "Lichtensteins" and their own designs. A follow-up activity could ask students to place one of their two fishbowls on a table and to draw or paint a flat composition that includes the fishbowl in a more complete setting (doing the reverse of what Lichtenstein did when he made this sculpture).
