How the QDR cell works with these groups varies. “The fifth group, cost drivers, is really sort of out there on their own because their work . . . is not looking at operational capabilities,” Ochmanek said. “Obviously, it’s looking at the other things that take up big parts of our resource base that aren’t tied to operations -- you know, health care, compensation, all that stuff. So that’s comptrol- ler led and we haven’t had very many interactions with them. The comptroller comes to the management meetings for the QDR; they’re cognizant of what we’re doing but they haven’t to my knowledge yet weighed in with any findings or insights.” -- Christopher J. Castelli Robust navigation sought DARPA WANTS FUNDING BOOST FOR INDEPENDENT BATTLEFIELD MACHINES The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is boosting its budget to develop advanced robotics technolo- gies that will operate more independently from U.S. forces on the battlefield, according to the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2010 budget justification documents. DARPA invested $15 million in the robust robotics program in FY-09; the agency wants to boost funding to $16.5 million in FY-10, the documents state. The program enables autonomous, unmanned mobile platforms to “perceive, understand and model their environment,” supporting warfighters in diverse landscapes, notes DARPA. It also aims to help machines navigate through complex, hazardous terrain, manipulate objects without human control, make intelligent decisions and interact cooperatively with other autonomous and manned vehicles. “A key objective is robust navigation and locomotion, since this underlies the ability to move through the difficult and unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which may include highly irregular and mountainous areas, partially-destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel,” DARPA writes. “Efforts are being made to develop learning and reasoning technologies to address specific concerns in both wheeled and legged robotic systems,” maintains the agency. “There is also interest in anthropomorphic humanoid robots that can leverage the worldwide infrastructure built for humans,” including occupying vehicle seats or climbing stairs. The program is also honing techniques to predict the future location and intent of moving objects, notes DARPA. U.S. national security will require future autonomous systems that achieve a much higher independence level when performing complex tasks, whether humans are present or not, the agency writes. The program’s FY-10 plans include developing “a mobile manipulator -- a four-wheeled mobile base and two arms, each with multi-fingered hands -- to serve as a common development platform,” documents state. Another objective is to develop a system whereby all data needed for recognition-based navigation of landmarks and topogra- phy will either be preloaded or obtained using on-board sensors. In this way, the vehicle will not receive any informa- tion from external sources. Although the Pentagon is trying to decide which traditional military tasks may be assigned to robots, the ma- chines will remain for some time in a “supervised autonomy” stage, predicted Ellen Purdy, the department’s enter- prise director of joint ground robotics (Inside the Pentagon, May 7, p1). In this phase, a robot can perform tasks without being directed to do so, but humans still are the ultimate decision-makers, Purdy told ITP. She added the intelligence associated with making a responsible decision involves a great deal of contextual information, making it an achievement that is “20, 30 years down the road.”  Peter Singer, author of “Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century,” told ITP he envisions a world mixed with robots and humans rather than one resembling the movie “The Terminator” dominated by autonomous machines. Future robots will “follow the play,” said Singer, of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, “but if they get new information, they’ll have enough leeway, enough leash, to still carry out the overall mission goal.” Robots are effective in certain roles like shooting with precision, Singer said. Military forces, however, are better equipped to figure out whether “that guy [is] a shopkeeper or is he an insurgent,” or to “have a cup of chai tea with that tribal elder and win his trust so that he tells him where the al Qaeda leader’s hiding out,” he added. Similarly, while machines can gather intelligence and act as artillery spotters in theater, working as special operators is not a subject that has been raised yet, he noted. The Pentagon often redefines “what we mean when we say humans will always be in the loop,” said Singer. “Everything’s happening so quick that our old definition of what it means to be in control of [robots] is really different,” he said. In the past, the military believed it was in charge of an unmanned aerial system because it could dictate every movement, but now the rationale is that the operator is always monitoring the unmanned aircraft and can stop it even though the system may be flying on its own, he noted. “We’re the ones slowly pulling ourselves out of control,” Singer asserted. -- Fawzia Sheikh INSIDE THE PENTAGON - www.InsideDefense.com - May 28, 2009 15 </page> </plain_text>
