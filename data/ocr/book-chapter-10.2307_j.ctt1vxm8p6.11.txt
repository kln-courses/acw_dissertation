<plain_text> <page sequence="1">     6 Comprehensibility rather than beauty  6.1 Beauty or comprehensibility? Many scientists, and some philosophers of science, have acknowledged  that aesthetic considerations play, quite properly, an important role in  influencing acceptance and rejection of theories in science, in addition to  empirical considerations. A famous example is Dirac, who went as far as  to declare: “It is more important to have beauty in one’s equations than to  have them fit experiment” (quoted in McAllister, 1996, p. 15). The view that beauty ought to influence choice of theory in science  faces, however, a serious problem. Why should beauty be a good indi- cation of truth? Unless the truth is beautiful, and unless we have valid  grounds for holding this to be the case, there can be no good reasons, it  would seem, for giving preference to beautiful theories in science. Not only may it seem dubious that we can have grounds for holding  that the truth is beautiful; there may well seem to be grounds for holding  that it is wildly implausible that the truth should be beautiful, especially  in theoretical physics. Whether we find something beautiful or ugly must depend, to  some extent at least, on our personal, subjective, emotional responses  to that thing. Aesthetic criteria have their roots deep in the human psy- che, and in human culture. But physical reality, that which theoretical  physics seeks to grasp, is utterly remote from the human psyche, from  human culture. It may well seem utterly implausible that something as  anthropomorphic, as personal, as quintessentially human and subjec- tive, as ideas about beauty, should have anything to do with the ultimate  nature of the physical universe, utterly impersonal and remote from the  circumstances of human life. Beauty may seem to be the last consider- ation to take into account in assessing the merits of rival fundamental  theories in physics. 170 </page> <page sequence="2">    An extremely interesting and original defence of the thesis that aes- thetic considerations do quite properly influence theory choice in science  has, however, been put forward recently by James McAllister (1996; see  also his 1989, 1990 and 1991). Quite independently, I have, over a num- ber of years, developed a view which resembles McAllister’s view in a  number of striking ways, but which is also different in important respects,    namely aim- oriented empiricism (see Chapters 2, 4 and 5).1 In this chap- ter I  compare and contrast the two views. My own view, aim- oriented  empiricism, has already been expounded and defended. I begin with a  sketch McAllister’s view. I then discuss how the two views resemble, and  differ from, each other. And finally, I discuss the question of which is to  be preferred.  6.2 The model of the aesthetic induction In what follows I call McAllister’s account of the role of non- empirical,  aesthetic factors in the selection of theories in science “the model of the  aesthetic induction” (MAI). Here, in summary, is his view. According to MAI, the basic aim of science is to develop a body of  theory that successfully predicts all observable phenomena. MAI holds  that from this aim of “empirical adequacy”, we can arrive at the follow- ing criteria for assessing theories: success in predicting existing empirical  data, success in predicting new phenomena, consistency with other high-  level theories, explanatory power and internal consistency. Many scientists have, however, declared that aesthetic consider- ations, in addition to the above, play a vital role in both the discovery  and acceptance of theories in science. Dirac, Einstein and many others  have stressed the importance of aesthetic considerations, such as beauty,  elegance, harmony, uniformity amidst variety, simplicity, symmetry. MAI  holds that such criteria do indeed have an important role to play in decid- ing what theories are accepted, to the extent, even, on occasions, of over- riding empirical considerations. But, according to MAI, in so far as such aesthetic considerations  exercise a rational influence over choice of theory in science, two crucial  points need to be borne in mind. First, theories must be considered to be  abstract entities, distinct from this or that linguistic formulation. Second,  what matters is not the (subjective) aesthetic judgements themselves,  but rather objective, non- aesthetic properties that theories, construed as  abstract entities, do actually possess, in virtue of which scientists make  their aesthetic judgements. coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 171 </page> <page sequence="3">    There are, according to MAI, five classes of properties of theories  that are relevant:  symmetry, invocation of a model, visualizability/  abstractness, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity (related to unity).  MAI stresses that many different properties fall under each of these  headings. There are different kinds of symmetry; different theories have  different kinds of models; some scientists, in some contexts, hold visu- alizability to be a virtue, while others, in other contexts, prize almost its  opposite, namely abstractness; scientists have upheld different meta- physical views at different stages in the development of science, in terms  of which they have sought to interpret scientific theories; and there are  many different ways of assessing the simplicity of theories, yielding quite  different results. How, then, does the scientific community decide which of these  very many different kinds of properties of theories are the relevant or  important ones to employ in order to assess the acceptability of theories  on non-e mpirical, or aesthetic, grounds? And what is the justification for  so assessing theories, in terms of the preferred properties? How, in par- ticular, can MAI do justice to the fact that aesthetic criteria in science  change over time? The answer is that, at any given stage, a scientific community  prefers those new theories that have properties which earlier theories,  which have proved to be empirically successful, also possess. If a certain  kind of theory, with characteristic aesthetic properties, has met with  empirical success in the past then, understandably enough, scientists are  influenced to give preference to similar kinds of theories, with similar  properties, in the future. This is “the aesthetic induction”. At a stroke, the  above three questions are answered. In a little more detail, we can imagine that a scientific community  can consider many different aesthetic properties of theories, P, Q, R, ....  The community will assign a different weighting, WP, WQ, WR, ... to each  of these properties, each weighting determining how influential the  corresponding property is in theory choice. The weightings are in turn  determined by what kinds of theory, with what properties, have (or have  not) met with empirical success in the past. WP, WQ, WR, ... are, in other  words, determined by the aesthetic induction. According to MAI, then, two kinds of criteria are employed in sci- ence to choose theories. On the one hand there are criteria, listed above,  arrived at by analysis of the basic aim of science of achieving empirical  adequacy. And, on the other hand, there are criteria arrived at by the  aesthetic induction. The second presupposes the first. 172 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="4">    Aesthetic criteria will tend to be conservative, based as they are on  empirical performance of theories in the past. New theories, with the  potential for great predictive success, may violate existing, conservative  aesthetic criteria. When such a theory is developed, there is a rupture  in accepted aesthetic criteria. Initially the new theory is judged to be  “ugly”; but as its empirical potential becomes manifest, aesthetic criteria  are changed to suit the new theory. This is what a scientific revolution  amounts to, according to MAI, a conception somewhat different from  Kuhn’s. In terms of this conception, neither Copernicus’s theory, nor  Einstein’s theory of special relativity, were revolutionary, because nei- ther broke with aesthetic criteria of the past. But Kepler’s laws of plane- tary motion, and quantum theory, were both revolutionary, in that these  theories broke dramatically with aesthetic criteria generally accepted at  the time. Finally, though the aesthetic induction might one day favour  some particular metaphysical world view, so far this has not happened  (McAllister, 1996, 102– 4).  6.3 Comparison of the two views What is rather astonishing about aim- oriented empiricism (AOE) and  MAI is that, though arrived at independently, and though giving what  are, in some respects, very different pictures of the scientific enterprise,  nevertheless the two views have much in common. Both seek to uphold  what McAllister calls “the rationalist image of science”. Both hold that  (some) criteria of theory choice can be justified by an appeal to the aims  of science. Both hold that non- empirical criteria of theory choice have an  enormously important part to play in science. Both hold that these non-  empirical criteria are, in practical applications, quite diverse in character.  Both hold that they change over time, as science progresses. And there is  considerable agreement as to what these non- empirical criteria are: sim- plicity, unity, symmetry and compatibility with some metaphysical world  view, are all important, for both views. Both hold that these criteria apply, not to specific formulations of  theories, but to what all possible formulations have in common. And  both give accounts of scientific revolutions that differ substantially from  Kuhn’s account. But there are also dramatic differences. MAI is, for McAllister,  “a medium- level model of scientific practice, of a scope intermediate  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 173 </page> <page sequence="5">    between the loftiest generalization and the historical study” (1996,  p. 2). AOE is put forward as a “highest- level model”, with implications  and applications for all of natural science. (Strictly speaking, it is what  I  call “generalized AOE” [Maxwell, 1998, pp.  191–2 , 185, 191, 208  and 223– 4]  – embodying the hierarchical structure of AOE, but lack- ing specific, lower- level theses of AOE – that is a model at the highest  level, applying to science throughout history; AOE is restricted to post-  Galilean science.) Again, MAI is a version of standard empiricism (SE), whereas  AOE emphatically rejects SE. That MAI is a version of SE is clear from  the way the aim of science is characterized as “empirical adequacy”. It is  also apparent in the way science can, according to MAI, establish a meta- physical world view. This can only happen via the aesthetic induction,  and has not as yet come about. According to AOE, by contrast, at lev- els 7 and 6 there are metaphysical, cosmological theses that are perma- nently accepted by science, and at levels 5 to 3, there are metaphysical  theses which are a part of current scientific knowledge, but which are  increasingly likely to require revision with the advance of science, as one  descends from level 5 to level 3 (see Figure 2.1 in Chapter 2). Whereas MAI gives to science just one aim (empirical adequacy),  AOE sees science as having a hierarchy of aims, from empirical adequacy,  perhaps, at the highest level, down to the aim to turn the best available  level 3 blueprint into a precise, true theory of everything, at the lowest  level. (And even more specific, and different, aims are assigned to differ- ent branches of natural science.) That AOE postulates this hierarchical structure to the aims of sci- ence, whereas MAI does not, leads to different treatments of changing  criteria for theory choice. According to MAI, criteria of theory choice  are of two kinds:  those that are justified by an appeal to the basic  aim of science (empirical adequacy), and those that are justified by  inductive projection – the aesthetic criteria arrived at by the aesthetic  induction. These latter are weaker than the former, and presuppose,  for logical reasons, the former (McAllister, 1996, p. 76). According to  AOE, by contrast, all criteria of theory choice are arrived at by aim  analysis:  those that evolve do so because the level 3 aim of science  evolves. Even though MAI and AOE agree that non-e mpirical criteria of  theory choice change with time, they disagree about which criteria  change, and what this change involves. According to AOE, something  close to physicalism has been implicit in the methods of theoretical  physics since Galileo or Newton; the demand for theoretical unity,  174 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="6">    associated with physicalism, has been more or less unchanging. What  has changed is the form that the demand for unity takes, as manifest in  dramatically changing level 3 metaphysical blueprints. MAI does not  claim that physicalism, and the requirement of unity associated with it,  is a part of the unchanging criteria of theory choice (since Galileo, at  least). Nor could MAI claim this, as long as it is a version of SE. According to AOE, the level 4 thesis of physicalism, and the level 3  best metaphysical blueprint, are arrived at by a quasi- Popperian process  of conjecture and criticism, the whole direction of progress in theoreti- cal physics since the birth of modern science (or since the Presocratics)  being taken into account. The claim is that these theses make explicit  what theoretical physics hopes to achieve: they are intended to be the  best conjectures as to what the basic aims of theoretical physics should  be, at different levels of specificity. These theses are intended to lead to  criteria, to methodological principles such as symmetry principles, that  will be relevant for future theories, not yet developed. Indeed, accord- ing to AOE, the activity of further articulating the best blueprint, and  solving problems of unity to which it gives rise, provides science with a    rational, if fallible method of discovery.2 All this contrasts dramatically  with criteria arrived at by the aesthetic induction, according to MAI,  which are almost bound to be conservative, and more or less inapplica- ble to revolutionary developments. AOE criteria anticipate and provoke  revolution, and judge the existing body of fundamental physical theory  as unsatisfactory because of its failure to comply with the demand for  unity (the standard model postulates too many particles and forces, and  clashes with general relativity); by contrast, MAI criteria are conser- vative, and are almost bound to be at odds with revolutionary devel- opments (McAllister, 1996, pp.  81–5  and 128–3 3). AOE criteria are  heuristically powerful; MAI criteria are the opposite. Furthermore, AOE  criteria, associated with level 3 blueprints, evolve or improve as physics  makes progress, and in a way which admits some elements of continuity  (see, in particular, Maxwell, 1998, pp. 80–9 ). MAI sees change, but no  overall progress, in non- empirical criteria, and holds, in a quasi-K uhnian  fashion, that revolutions create a rupture in aesthetic criteria, there  being no account of the modification and generalization of blueprints,  which AOE provides. MAI and AOE agree that non-e mpirical criteria apply, not to any  specific formulation of a theory, but to what all formulations have in com- mon. But there are somewhat different accounts of what this is. According  to MAI, a formulation- independent theory is an abstract entity that exists  in its own right, with its own properties distinct from the phenomena the  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 175 </page> <page sequence="7">    theory postulates (see, for example, McAllister, 1996, pp. 98–1 00). This  leaves obscure what sort of thing such an abstract entity is, and what  its relationship is with a linguistic formulation of the theory, and with  the phenomena it predicts. According to AOE, the matter is much more  straightforward: a formulation- independent theory, T, is the content of  T, what T predicts, or asserts to be the case. AOE does not appeal to the  abstract entities of MAI; it appeals only to possible phenomena, not as  actually existing entities, but merely as possibilities. The claim that T  exhibits a certain symmetry thus amounts to the claim that the phenom- ena predicted by T exhibit this symmetry. There is here no mystery about  the relationship between a linguistic formulation of T, the abstract entity  T, and the phenomena T predicts: the “abstract entity” is just what any  linguistic formulation of T asserts to be the case, the content of T. This  leads to an account of the importance of linguistic- dependent criteria  of simplicity (Maxwell, 1998, pp. 110– 3), something that MAI does not  provide. A fundamental difference between MAI and AOE, encapsulated in  the title of this chapter, is that, whereas MAI holds that aesthetic crite- ria are important in science, AOE denies this, all non- empirical criteria  for theory choice being reducible to the demand that the totality of fun- damental physical theory exemplify the level 4 thesis of physicalism or,  more specifically, the best available blueprint at level 3. For AOE, what  matters is unity or comprehensibility, not beauty. But this difference is terminological rather than substantial.  McAllister defends a projectivist, subjectivist account of the beauty of  theories. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, rather than in the the-   ory itself.3 Scientists judge certain theories to be beautiful because of  non- aesthetic properties that they possess objectively; it is these non-  aesthetic properties that are important methodologically and epis- temologically, and play the crucial role in the aesthetic induction.  One of these is metaphysical allegiance. The demand that the totality  of fundamental physical theory should exemplify physicalism, and  the best available blueprint, are special cases of metaphysical alle- giance. Comprehensibility is just one of McAllister’s aesthetic prop- erties. Comprehensibility, one might say, is beautiful. It fits perfectly  Hutchinson’s characterization of beauty (McAllister, 1996, pp. 17– 23)  as involving “uniformity amidst variety” (see the discussion of “unity  through diversity” in Maxwell, 1998, ch. 3). A more serious disagreement would seem to be that whereas AOE  recognizes only one methodologically significant non- empirical property,  namely unity or comprehensibility, MAI stresses that there are endlessly  176 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="8">    many, falling under the five headings of symmetry, invocation of a model,  visualizability/a bstractness, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity  (related to unity). This disagreement is not quite as big as it might at first appear to be.  Here, very briefly, are the similar, but also different, ways in which AOE  and MAI treat unity, symmetry, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity. Unity: AOE and MAI both recognize that the demand for unity takes  a number of different forms, but AOE alone holds that these are aspects  of just one, single conception of unity. According to AOE, dynamic unity,  postulated to exist by physicalism, can be broken in thought in a number  of different ways, this creating a number of different kinds of (relative)  disunity, and hence a number of different ways in which degrees of unity  (or disunity) can be assessed. But these different kinds of disunity all  relate to just one conception of unity, namely that which is postulated to  exist by physicalism (see Chapter 4, and Maxwell, 1998, pp. 89–9 3, and  p. 280, note 22). MAI, too, stresses that there are different kinds of uni- fication (McAllister, 1996, p. 110) but, unlike AOE, does not relate these  to one basic conception of unity. Symmetry: Here, again, AOE and MAI both recognize that the  demand for symmetry takes a number of different forms, but AOE alone  holds that these, in so far as they are methodologically legitimate within  theoretical physics, all relate to the one basic demand for unity. One of  the achievements of AOE is to demonstrate clearly how different kinds of  symmetry relate to unity, the demand that theories exhibit symmetries  itself being an aspect of the demand for unity (Maxwell, 1998, pp. 89–  103, 123– 40 and 257–6 5). MAI recognizes that theories exhibit different  kinds of symmetry (McAllister, 1996, 41–4 ), but fails to recognize that  different kinds of symmetry, in theoretical physics at least, are aspects  of unity. Metaphysical allegiance: Once again, both AOE and MAI recog- nize that an important non- empirical requirement in theoretical physics,  upheld by some physicists at least, is that fundamental physical theo- ries should accord with some metaphysical view. Both recognize that  metaphysical views associated with physics since Galileo have changed  dramatically over time; both recognize that different physicists espouse  different metaphysical views at the same time. But AOE and MAI differ  here too, in that AOE holds that diverse, evolving level 3 blueprints, in  order to be acceptable, need to accord with physicalism, whereas MAI  makes no such demand. For AOE, the requirement that a theory exem- plifies a metaphysical view, in so far as it is methodologically legitimate,  is but an aspect of the basic requirement that the body of fundamental  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 177 </page> <page sequence="9">    physical theory exemplifies the unity of physicalism (as much as possi- ble). MAI makes no such demand. Simplicity: Here, yet again, both AOE and MAI recognize that  the demand for simplicity takes a number of different forms; both see   simplicity as being related to unity, but in somewhat different ways  (compare Maxwell, 1998, pp. 111–3  and 157–9 , with McAllister, 1996,  pp.  109–1 1). But AOE alone relates the demand for simplicity to the  more basic demand for just one kind of unity, dynamic unity postulated  by physicalism. According to AOE, unity requires that a theory makes the  same assertion throughout all possible phenomena to which it applies;  simplicity concerns what is asserted for any given phenomenon, and thus  presupposes unity. Simplicity presupposes unity, but is quite distinct from  unity (see Chapter 4, and Maxwell, 1998, pp. 157– 9; 2004a, pp. 172–4 ). The difference that this reveals in the two views can be summed  up like this. AOE postulates just one basic non- empirical requirement,  unity, and relates different requirements, of different kinds of unity  –   symmetry, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity – to this one demand  for unity. MAI, by contrast, holds that there just are many different kinds  of requirements  – unity, symmetry, metaphysical allegiance and sim- plicity. Unlike AOE, MAI sees no unity in these diverse kinds of require- ments  – unity, symmetry, metaphysics and simplicity. (In this respect,  AOE might be said to give a more unified, and hence more beautiful,  account of scientific method than MAI.) More substantial differences arise in connection with the two  remaining kinds of aesthetic properties of theories which MAI holds to  be methodologically significant, which I now consider in turn. Invocation of a model: AOE recognizes that an important consid- eration in assessing a new physical theory is that it has a form similar to  existing empirically successful physical theories. Thus the acceptability  of quantum electroweak theory, and chromodynamics is much helped  by the fact that these theories are similar in form to the highly empiri- cally successful theory of quantum electrodynamics. All three theories,  despite their differences, are locally gauge invariant quantum field the- ories. According to AOE, this requirement of similarity of form or struc- ture derives, once again, from the requirement of unity (Maxwell, 1998,  p. 112). If T1 and T2 have some similar structures, then some part of T1  can be modelled by some part of T2, and vice versa. According to AOE,  having a model is only methodologically significant to this extent, and  once again this requirement turns out to be derived from the demand for  unity. (Of course, that physical reality is a model of a theory, in the sense  that the theory is true, is highly significant for AOE; but this is not what  178 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="10">    MAI means by a “model”.) MAI is, once again, much more open-e nded in  the kind of models that it is prepared to recognize as methodologically  significant, and does not attempt to derive from the demand for unity the  requirement that a theory should have some kind of model. Visualizability/ abstractness: According to AOE, neither visualiz- ability nor abstractness are methodologically significant for theoretical  physics. What does matter is that a theory can at least be interpreted  realistically, as postulating that such and such a physical entity, (or enti- ties), such as a field (or particles) exists, a stepping stone towards the  ubiquitous, unified something of physicalism. (Actually, AOE demands  more. It demands that fundamental physical theories are open to being  interpreted in terms of conjectural essentialism (see Maxwell, 1998,  pp. 141– 55.) If one has acquired an intuitive understanding of a real- istic theory, then one may well be able to “visualize” what the theory  is about:  to this extent, visualizability is methodologically significant,  according to AOE, but once again derives from the demand for unity,  via the demand for realism. MAI, by contrast, once again, is much more  open- ended about visualizability, and makes no attempt to relate it to  the demand for unity. McAllister claims that opposition to orthodox quantum theory   (OQT), by Schrödinger, Einstein and others, stemmed from the loss of  visualizability and determinism associated with the new theory. But this  overlooks the key, entirely legitimate objection to OQT, namely its loss of  microrealism, due to the failure to solve the quantum wave/p article prob- lem. Because it failed to specify a consistent quantum ontology, OQT had  to be developed as a theory which can, at most, make predictions about  the results of performing measurements on quantum systems – measure- ment being described classically. But this in turn meant that OQT is, quite  essentially, made up of two quite different parts stitched together in a  grossly ad hoc way, namely (1) the quantum part, and (2) some part of  classical physics for a treatment of measurement. Despite its immense  empirical success, OQT is still today deeply and genuinely problematic,  to the point, almost, of being unacceptable, because of its grossly ad hoc  character, due to its lack of micro-r ealism (see Chapter 8, and Maxwell,  1972b; 1976b; 1982; 1988; 1998, ch. 7). The mature Einstein was well  aware that this is the basic objection to OQT, not lack of visualizability or  loss of determinism, as we saw in Chapter 3. Elsewhere I have argued that  the grossly ad hoc character of OQT, stemming from its lack of micro-r eal- ism, provides us with a general argument against instrumentalism and  for realism (Maxwell, 1993b). I have also suggested how the quantum  wave/p article problem may be solved, and how a fully micro-r ealistic  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 179 </page> <page sequence="11">    version of quantum theory may be developed, free of any reference to  measurement or classical physics in its basic postulates, able to recover  all the successful predictive content of OQT, but also making experimen- tal predictions different from OQT for as yet unperformed experiments  (see Chapters 3 and 8, and Maxwell, 1976b; 1982; 1988; 1998, ch. 7;  and especially 1994a). (This was done in an attempt to put the rational,  but fallible, method of discovery of AOE into scientific practice.) There  are, of course, other attempts at developing fully micro- realistic versions  of quantum theory (see Bohm, 1952; Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber, 1986;    Penrose, 1986; Tumulka, 2006; and Wallace, 2012).4 Einstein’s mature objection to OQT had to do with the lack of real- ism of the theory, but he did also, especially earlier, object to its lack of  determinism. But here, too, there is a methodologically significant issue  at stake, related once again to the demand for unity. A realistic version  of quantum theory must be unified, first with special relativity, and  then, ultimately, with general relativity. This is a much graver problem,  granted probabilistic quantum theory, than it is if quantum theory is  deterministic. The demand for unity speaks against probabilistic quan- tum theory – but not decisively: nature may well be probabilistic, and  the task may be to develop probabilistic versions of special and general  relativity (Maxwell, 1985a). As for abstractness, this is, for AOE, without methodological signifi- cance, except that, as physical theory draws closer to capturing physical- ism, it is almost bound to specify entities increasingly remote from those  of ordinary experience. We begin with corpuscles, minute billiard balls,  in the seventeenth century; these then transmute into point particles that  interact by means of forces; these, in turn, transmute into classical fields,  into quantum fields, into curved space- time, into superstrings in ten-  dimensional space- time – entities increasingly remote from the familiar  billiard ball. We have seen, so far, that AOE recognizes, ultimately, just one non-    empirical criterion, unity or compatibility with physicalism,5 whereas  MAI recognizes many, and makes no attempt to show that these all  devolve from just one basic criterion. But I come now to a non-e mpirical  criterion which AOE holds to be absolutely central, but which MAI does  not even recognize as an aesthetic criterion at all: explanatory power. Explanatory power is an ambiguous concept. We may hold that T1  has more explanatory power than T2 if (1) T1 has greater empirical con- tent than T2, or if (2) T1 has greater unity than T2 even though it has the  same empirical content. Let us call these type (1) and type (2) explana- tory power respectively. 180 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="12">    We need also to recognize that criteria legitimately employed in  science to assess theories can be put into three categories: (a) empirical,  (b)  empirical- dependent, and (c) non-e mpirical. By (a)  I mean simply  the predictive success of the theory in question; by (b) I mean properties  of theories that have to do with how amenable they are to being assessed  empirically, such as testability and empirical content; and by (c) I mean  properties of theories that have nothing directly to do with empirical  success but which are deemed to be indicative of truth, or of potential  empirical success. Type (1) explanatory power is a typical type (b) property of theo- ries. But, according to AOE, type (2) explanatory power is the key type  (c) non- empirical property of theories from which, as we have seen, all  others, such as symmetry, simplicity or metaphysical allegiance, arise.  In seeking to acquire knowledge about the world, we actively hunt for  clues as to the kind of universe we are in, and hence the kind of theo- ries we need to develop. The big clue that we have (apparently) discov- ered, is that the universe is more or less comprehensible in some way or  other, it being possible to discover explanations for phenomena; this is  enshrined in theses of comprehensibility and physical comprehensibil- ity, at levels 5 and 4 of Figure 2.1. The level 5 thesis of comprehensibil- ity is the bold conjecture that the universe is perfectly comprehensible  in some way or other – the universe being such that there is some one  kind of explanation for all phenomena, couched in terms of God, a  cosmic purpose (which everything is designed to fulfil), a cosmic pro- gramme, a unified physical entity, or something else. From Galileo on,  science has, in effect, made the even bolder conjecture that the universe  is physically comprehensible, at level 4, and comprehensible in terms  of the best available blueprint, at level 3. Type (2) explanatory power,  to repeat, is the key type (c) non-e mpirical criterion of theory choice,  from which all other type (c) criteria arise. If any property of theories  cries out to be the aesthetic property of beauty, which scientists quite  properly take note of as being methodologically significant, it is type  (2) explanatory power. And yet, astonishingly, MAI does not even include explanatory  power in its list of aesthetic properties of theories, despite its open-  ended, all- inclusive approach to listing such properties (in such sharp  contrast to AOE). MAI does hold that the requirement of type (2)  explanatory  power is a permanent criterion of science, one that can be arrived at  by aim-a nalysis, taking the aim of science to be empirical adequacy  (McAllister, 1996, p.  11). It is clear that type (2), and not merely  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 181 </page> <page sequence="13">    type (1), explanatory power is intended here, for McAllister writes that  a successful explanatory theory is deemed to have “identified a pattern  or mechanism underlying the data” (1996, p. 11). But such an analysis  could only, at most, justify adopting the requirement of type (1) explan- atory power; it does not justify adopting type (2) explanatory power as a  requirement – not unless the truth, the universe that is, is permanently  presumed to have a more or less unified dynamic structure (a presump- tion which contradicts SE). McAllister provides no argument in support  of the contention that favouring theories with type (2)  explanatory  power can be justified by an appeal to the aim of empirical adequacy.  He does refer to an approach to the problem of induction, espoused  by Braithwaite and Mellor, according to which we are justified in pro- ceeding as if regularities or patterns exist in nature because this gives  us the best hope of acquiring knowledge whatever the universe may be  like (McAllister, 1996, pp. 100– 1). It is this argument, perhaps, which  McAllister assumes justifies taking type (2) explanatory power as a per- manent criterion for theory choice, arrived at by aim- analysis, taking  the aim of science to be empirical adequacy. But there are three things wrong with this. First, the Braithwaite– Mellor justification of induction does not  work, as I shall show in the next section. Second, many different kinds of explanation are possible; the uni- verse may be comprehensible (phenomena being explainable) in many  different ways, and to many different degrees, as the different theses  from levels 3 to 7 of AOE attest. Here, above all, science needs to be flex- ible and responsive, constantly modifying the kind of explanations to be  sought in the light of empirical success and failure, in the kind of way in  which the hierarchical methodological structure of AOE is designed to  facilitate. If ever there was a role for the aesthetic induction, it would  surely be here, in connection with explanatory power. But in excluding  type (2) explanatory power from the list of aesthetic properties, and in  making it a fixed, unchanging requirement of theory choice, MAI fails to  exploit this vital need for science constantly to modify and improve the  kind of explanations that it seeks. It is just this, by contrast, that is the key  idea behind AOE. Third, if McAllister’s argument were successful, so that giving pref- erence to theories that exhibit type (2) explanatory power could be jus- tified by an appeal to the aim of empirical adequacy, then this would be  a disaster for MAI, for it would obviate entirely the need for science to  consider aesthetic properties of theories, and to employ the aesthetic  182 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="14">    induction. As I have argued above, all aesthetic properties of theories that  have any methodological significance can be derived from the demand  for unity – that is, the demand for type (2) explanatory power. Once type  (2) explanatory power is acknowledged to be methodologically signif- icant, no other aesthetic properties of theories are required by science. I conclude this section by mentioning three further differences  between AOE and MAI. First, reasons given in defence of MAI for holding that aesthetic  considerations are methodologically significant in science arise from the  fact that scientists themselves have stressed their importance, and they  do indeed seem to influence what theories are chosen in science. Reasons  given in defence of AOE for holding that type (c) non- empirical consid- erations are methodologically important are much stronger:  science  becomes impossible if such considerations are not deployed to rule out  endlessly many empirically successful but grossly ad hoc theories. Second, MAI, despite being a contribution to the rationalist con- ception of science, does not provide a basis for systematically correcting  scientific practice. But AOE does. As I have already remarked, if a view  genuinely increases our understanding of science, it would be surprising  if it did not have implications for scientific practice. AOE passes this test,  in emphasizing the need for explicit articulation of metaphysical theses  at levels 3 and 4, and explicit tackling of the problems thereby generated. Third, MAI and AOE conceive of the relationship between science  and the philosophy of science differently. MAI takes the conventional  view for granted: philosophy of science is a meta- discipline which seeks  to spell out and justify methods implicit in successful scientific practice,  but which is quite distinct from science itself. AOE upholds the unorth- odox view that the philosophy of science is an integral part of science  itself, influenced by and seeking to influence science, articulating and  critically assessing actual and possible aims and methods for science, at  various levels, the fundamental aim being to contribute to scientific prog- ress. A new level 3 aim for physics, i.e. a new blueprint, plus associated  new methods, might constitute a major contribution to theoretical phys- ics, as well as being a contribution to the philosophy of physics. Einstein’s  special theory of relativity is an example. It puts forward both a modified  blueprint (Newtonian space-t ime becoming Minkowskian space- time),  and modified methods (Galilean invariance becoming Lorentz invari- ance): it is thus a major contribution to physics itself, which is also a con- tribution to the aims and methods of physics – that is, to the philosophy  of physics. coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 183 </page> <page sequence="15">     6.4 Assessment Which is to be preferred, AOE or MAI? The two views need not, of course,  be regarded as rivals. AOE is a highest- level model, whereas MAI is a  medium- level model; one could consider accommodating MAI within  AOE. This would require, however, that MAI be modified quite exten- sively, as the previous section has shown. Interpreting AOE and MAI as rival rationalist accounts of science,  my chief criticism of MAI is that it is a version of SE, and thus suffers  from the defects that all versions of SE suffer from. Given any empirically  successful theory, T, there will always be endlessly many ad hoc rivals to  T, even more empirically successful than T, which will never even be con- sidered within science, let alone considered and rejected. In persistently  rejecting such ad hoc rivals, even more empirically successful than T,  science makes a persistent assumption about the nature of the universe.    This contradicts SE – and contradicts MAI.6 McAllister might seek to evade this conclusion by arguing, as he  does in his book, that non- empirical, aesthetic criteria that rule out  acceptance of empirically successful, ad hoc rival theories, are too diverse  in character, too changeable over time, to amount to the implicit accep- tance of any persistent assumption. But such an argument collapses the  moment one takes into account radically ad hoc theories of the kind  considered in this book, in Chapters  2 and 5, and in Maxwell (1998,  pp. 47– 54). Rejection (or rather complete neglect) of such radically ad  hoc theories persists throughout revolutions and all changes in aesthetic  fashions in science. The persistent rejection of such theories unquestion- ably commits science to making a substantial metaphysical assumption  about the nature of the universe. McAllister might, at this point, appeal to the pragmatic justifica- tion of induction of Braithwaite and Mellor, already referred to above  (McAllister, 1996, pp.  100– 1). According to this argument, science  proceeds, and is justified in proceeding, as if it assumes there are regu- larities to be discovered, but does not actually assume that regularities  exist. But even if this argument is valid, it does not in any way invalidate  my point above, that in persistently rejecting empirically successful ad  hoc theories, science implicitly makes a persistent metaphysical assump- tion about the world. It should be noted that kinds of ad hoc theories  can be formulated that specify regularities, in that these theories are  invariant with respect to position and time (no specific places or times  being specified by the theories). These theories might be said to specify  ad hoc regularities. 184 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> <page sequence="16">    But, in any case, the Braithwaite– Mellor attempt at solving the  problem of induction does not succeed. Restricting science to the search  for regularities is both too narrow, and not narrow enough. Too narrow,  because it is conceivable that we can live and acquire knowledge but  not by searching for regularities in phenomena. God might get in touch  with us, explain His purposes, keep us informed about what is going  to happen. Getting in touch with God by means of prayer and medita- tion, and not by searching for regularities, might be the way to acquire  knowledge; and various other science fiction possibilities can be imag- ined (see Maxwell, 1998, p. 185). Such possibilities are excluded by the  search for knowledge as characterized by Braithwaite and Mellor; this  means these possibilities are just dogmatically assumed to be false. But  the Braithwaite– Mellor approach is also not narrow enough, because,  as I have indicated above, if science is to be possible, ad hoc regularities  must be persistently excluded from consideration. And, as we have seen,  there is no sharp distinction between the ad hoc and the non- ad hoc. In  Chapter 4 I listed eight kinds of disunity – in effect, eight different ways  in which regularities might be ad hoc, which range from the severely ad  hoc (distinct regularities in different space-t ime regions) to the scarcely  ad hoc at all (space- time and matter not being unified). What does the  policy of “inductive projection” (McAllister, 1996, p.  101) amount to?  Does it involve merely excluding permanently all theories that are type  (1) ad hoc (distinct regularities in different space-t ime regions)? Again,  this is both too narrow, and not narrow enough. Exactly the same objec- tion arises wherever the line is drawn, between regularities that are too  ad hoc to be considered by science, and those that are sufficiently non-a d  hoc to be open to scientific consideration. We cannot, at this point, simply  invoke the aesthetic induction, and declare that we discover, by induc- tion, where the line is to be drawn between the acceptably and unac- ceptably ad hoc, because, as McAllister himself has so clearly shown, for  logical reasons, the aesthetic induction can only proceed once methods  have been arrived at by aim- analysis (McAllister, 1996, p. 76). Another approach might be to favour permanently in science the- ories that are as non- ad hoc as possible, in all eight senses, but not to  draw a rigid line between the acceptably and unacceptably ad hoc. This  would allow something like the aesthetic induction to proceed in science  (although not in quite the open- ended way in which McAllister envis- ages). But even this attempt at solving the problem is both too narrow  and not narrow enough. Endlessly many universes are possible in which  we may live and acquire knowledge, and yet this inductive policy would  not be appropriate for acquiring knowledge. It biases the search for  coMPreheNSiBil ity rather thaN Beauty 185 </page> <page sequence="17">    knowledge in the direction of physicalism. But physicalism may be false;  the universe may be comprehensible in some other way, or not compre- hensible at all. My claim is that the best possible way in which we can go about seek- ing knowledge is to do so employing the hierarchical aims-a nd- methods  structure of (generalized) AOE. We must make some kind of guess as to  what kind of universe we are in, in order to proceed at all. At the top of  the hierarchy we need to put those relatively contentless guesses which  are such that their truth is required for acquisition of knowledge to be  possible at all. These are justifiably permanent items of scientific knowl- edge. As we descend the hierarchy, we need to put increasingly content- ful guesses, chosen because these seem to be the most fruitful from the  standpoint of engendering methods that seem to offer the best help with  acquiring empirical knowledge. As we proceed, we revise these guesses  in the light of the relative empirical success and failure of rival research  programmes, based on rival low- level metaphysical guesses. We try to  keep such revisions as low as possible in the hierarchy when we seem to  be achieving overall success, and only allow revisions to ascend higher  up in the hierarchy when success is not being achieved, and higher-l evel  revisions seem to be required. This hierarchical conception of scientific method enables science  to respond sensitively to what it seems to discover about the nature of  the universe, lower-l evel aims and methods being adjusted in the light  of apparent empirical success and failure, and within a framework of  fixed, relatively unproblematic, higher-l evel aims and methods. All  attempts at justifying induction pragmatically that are known to me,  along lines advocated by Braithwaite and Mellor, fail because they fail  to take note of the resources of (generalized) AOE. They all attempt to  justify methods that are demonstrably not as efficient as those of AOE  in enabling us to acquire knowledge of nature. They fail to encapsulate  the responsiveness, the flexibility, the open-e ndedness and precision,  of AOE. And this is true of MAI as well. Indeed, as we saw in section 6.4  above, the aesthetic induction has conservatism built into it, and cannot  help engender revolutionary new ideas for revolutionary new theories,  whereas AOE is designed to do just that. It embodies a rational, if fallible,  method of discovery for theoretical physics. 186 Karl PoPPer ,  Sc ieNce aNd eNlighteNMeNt </page> </plain_text>
