<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE BY TENNEY FRANK Bryn Mawr College Many years ago Ruskin, in writing "Of Classical Landscape" remarked that the Greek attitude toward nature was not unlike that of "a good, conscientious but illiterate Scotch Presbyterian border farmer of a century or two back," and a recent contributor to your journal has proved by chapter and verse that the Romans were even less sensitive to nature's spell, and in particular failed to appreciate the mountains of their country. If we assume that ancient literature adequately reflects ancient psychology, both of these statements may pass as true enough. However the facts so often repeated only raise the question why the ancients, who lived in the fairest of lands, should seem deficient in this respect. In discussing the question I shall confine myself largely to the Romans lest I be tempted to range too far. One's first impulse upon reading the nature-poetry collected from the ancients by Shairp, Palgrave, Geikie, and a score of other essayists is to conclude that the Greeks and Romans did not react as enthusiastically to nature's stimulus as the moderns because they lacked a modicum of the aesthetic sense that has apparently developed since their day. Judging a priori, however, this con- clusion would not seem to be quite reasonable. The ancients were essentially of our stock, and a mere difference of two thousand years can count for nothing in the development of the elemental human instincts and mental faculties which have been in process of growth for unmeasured ages. And if it be assumed that aesthetic appreciation is dependent upon a delicate combination of faculties which are so unstable that they vary quickly with a slight change in the composition of the stock, we have only to consider that neither Greeks nor Romans failed to appreciate what was good form and color and proportion in architecture, sculpture, and painting. 482</page><page sequence="2">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 483 This consideration suggests another possible solution of the difficulty. Lack of expression is not necessarily proof of failure to appreciate. Artistic convention is a tyrannical arbiter of themes and modes of utterance. Even if a Roman standing before Mont Blanc had felt as Byron did, it is not probable that he would have called for his wax tablet to put down the new emotion in verse. Literary fashion informed Byron that he ought to react before a lofty mountain, and literary fashions come and go. There are sonnets of Shakespeare that the poet, were he alive today, would not write, even were he to experience the same emotions that inspired those sonnets. They were written then not only because of his experiences or his imaginings but partly because of the con- ventions established by his predecessors, the Italian and English sonneteers. To take another illustration, the letters of Cicero are evidence that children like Tullia and Marcus were loved and fondled and spoiled as much as any child today could endure, but the Romans have not given us a sympathetic study of children either in art or literature. Apparently convention had not yet accepted certain themes. The revolt against the mandates of artistic convention is a slow process, as recent realists have abund- antly proved by expressing for the first time simple emotions that men have felt for ages. It would seem that we can hardly give a final estimate of the degree of imagination or appreciation involved in an ancient poet's actual reactions to nature. No poet has yet expressed all of his feelings adequately. Literary conven- tion does much in circumscribing his theme and selecting his form. However, we must deal with the record which we have. We may read what the Roman poet has said on nature and try to com- prehend his point of view in saying what he did. And for the sake of fairness we may then attempt not only to judge his expressions from the modern point of view but also to estimate the modern attitude toward nature from the position of Lucretius or Vergil. What usually stands out in the indictment of Vergil and his fellows is that they failed to express the "sense of sympathy between man and nature"', which is so prominent an element in ' See Miss Allen's thorough study entitled Nature in the Poetry of the Roman Republic in Wisconsin Philol. and Lit. Series, Vol. I, i899.</page><page sequence="3">484 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL English nineteenth-century verse, and, secondly, that they seem to have known little of that "sense of grandeur and mystery" which every modern is assumed to feel upon the contemplation of certain scenes. This sense of "sympathy between man and nature" is of course not a new manifestation of our day, though its tap-roots may draw life from a different set of instincts and persuasions at different times. In the Georgics there is not a little of it. Vergil's husband- man nurtured and fondled his tender plants as though they were living creatures. He gives them water and "the plants take courage"; he raises props on which "they learn to climb and scorn the winds"; he keeps the goats away while "the leaf is tender and innocent of hurt," and he stays his pruning hook when the vines are young and "shrink under the steel" (Georg. ii. 350 ff.). Shelley's version of the same sentiment may be better known, but the two poets have after all expressed one and the same conceit: I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet; I doubt not they felt the spirit that came From her glowing fingers through all their frame. Furthermore the joy of that sensitive plant in the presence of its mistress, the drooping away at her death, remind us at once of the joys and sorrows of trees and flowers that Vergil's shepherds sang of upon the death and apotheosis of Daphnis. Of course we recognize this sympathy at once by the term "pathetic fallacy" with which Ruskin doomed it to the sidelong glance. And we ought to know fairly well just what it is. As a matter of fact it may not be a fallacy at all. That depends upon whether the man who claims to feel it is somewhat naively primitive in his ways of thought or temporarily assumes by the exertion of his imagination the attitude of such a one. The Indian claimed brotherhood with the fox and crow. Grimm's children hobnobbed with trees and ants. The Greeks of the myth-making period remembered the time when the laurel was not a tree but was Daphne, and probably they thought the laurel could still hear what they said. The Romans of Vergil's day were not so very far removed from the same period of general intercourse between man</page><page sequence="4">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 485 and the rest of nature. In the sixth century they had had as yet no gods in human form. They worshiped the spirits of woods, fountains, and of standing corn, doubtless speaking to these spirits as though they understood even though they had not human ears. If the Greek anthropomorphic deities had not come so abruptly upon the Romans with convincing portraits done in full beards, the Romans would probably, like the Greeks, have shaped their spirits into varying forms-as happens when animism has a fair period in which to ripen. And we should then have had a myth-making period at Rome also from which to illustrate the personalizing tendencies in Vergil's verse. Even as it is, traces of animism are long noticeable at Rome, especially among the peasants. The ex-voto offerings found in springs and groves, the worship of the lares and penates, the offerings that Horace so sympathetically encourages among the simple people of the Sabine hills, the ease with which even the state officials could create "abstract deities" out of mere daylight experiences, all these prove that animism was not far off. And it is the same psychology which makes possible animism in religion and "sympathy between man and nature" in poetry. Vergil in the Georgics and Shelley in "The Sensitive Plant" are simply employ- ing imagination so as to re-experience something that we have none of us far outgrown. That the Roman poet does not often personalize the creatures of nature is quite true. It is characteristic of Vergil that he per- mits himself the illusion chiefly in his pictures of shepherds and peasants, just as he permits his shepherds in the eighth eclogue to create poetry from the more primitive emotions that are the source of magic. To Vergil himself, schooled in an atomic theory, all this was of course make-believe. The sophisticated Romans of his day-if even moderately educated-could neither be mystics nor fools. Greek myths had killed Roman animism, and Greek rationalism had killed the myths. After the "religious panic" of the Second Punic War, as Fowler calls it, the cultured Roman was no naive primitive. A gulf of cold fact soon closed in between man and nature. Every rational Roman learned that nature was a concourse of atoms, or elements, and, accordingly, it would have</page><page sequence="5">486 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL seemed childish to revive the mood of animism. He could hardly adopt the imagery of "The Sensitive Plant" without apology, for it necessarily contained something akin to bathos for him. He might, to be sure, attribute such sentiments to peasants and shepherds, or he might enliven his imagery with them when address- ing less rational beings, but to him personally they were and must be insincere and fallacious. However the modern note of "sympathy" appears in a form which is of course more characteristic of the nineteenth century in the verses that everyone knows: a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused Whose dwelling is the light of setting sun And the round ocean and the living air And the blue sky and in the mind of man. Here there is something more than the projection of one's self into child's psychology, for the emotion proceeds from a well-reasoned philosophy which Wordsworth knew how to analyze. Myers is of course not correct in saying that this is a new element which Wordsworth first brought into poetry. Wordsworth himself apparently felt that the Greeks had already caught the same spirit in their myths of the great gods, for they had indeed heard "old Triton blow his wreathed horn." In the lines quoted the poet's fusion of mysticism and "sympathy for nature" is rather akin to Stoic pantheism since it is a product of more conscious thought than the myths. Doubtless a Greek poet of the third century B.c. could have expressed sentiments not wholly unlike those of Wordsworth, had it occurred to him that they were a proper theme for verse. Indeed Vergil's sixth book has the note: Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus Mens agitat molem. But here of course it lacks the warmth of religious conviction. Vergil adopted the philosophy in his study. His intellect is per- haps almost convinced, but stoicism could never become a personal religion, a gripping human emotion, such as a modern poet must feel any religion to be.</page><page sequence="6">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 487 Even Lucretius' prooemium has the immanent deity despite the fact that his materialism verily cries out that to him such a sentiment is logically impossible. Indeed one feels the power of it even more in Lucretius, since his impulse seems to force the lines out regardless of his philosophy. But with him it is and must be a passing mood. Cold logic generally conquers. In the daylight he knows what myths are, and that they exist only because omne humanum genus est avidum nimis miraclorum So then the Latin poet seldom permits himself to express this sentiment which has become so prevalent in modern poetry. Even the modern poet who subjects the vagaries of mysticism to analysis, who thinks clearly and insists that his imagination must play within a legitimate field defined by his intellect, in a word the poet to whom thought is of more value than illusive sentiment, will gen- erally eschew the dangerous mazes of such nature poetry. To the Roman poet to whom animism and nature myth-making were a thing of the past, and to whom a mystical philosophy was after all a mere hypothesis of the study, this fact was all the more patent. He would have been utterly untrue to his intellect had he been carried away by the prettiness of a peasant's garden of sentient plants and the temporary mysticism of Vergil's' pantheism. The sophisti- cated pagan could not habitually disregard the claims of his logic to that extent. And it is not difficult to imagine a period of literary production near at hand in which this note of the nineteenth century will be judged as akin to the falsetto, when nature will again be loved simply for her charms of color and form as she was by the ancients, and indeed by Wordsworth "in the hour of thoughtless youth." Animism, actual or resuscitated by the imagination, seems to be the source of much of the sentiment in the nature poetry of today as well as in the primitive Greek and Roman myths. To this it is apparent that a hazy pantheism contributes much in I It is very possible that Vergil adopted the philosophic system of the sixth book for reasons of plot. The Heldenschau was essential to his purposes, and such a scene would have been impossible had he presupposed the Epicurean doctrine of the soul.</page><page sequence="7">488 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL periods of more or less culture. There is also another element which has been of importance historically, at least for the modern world. English nature poetry did not begin in the eighteenth century of course. There is the thread of romance and sentimental love for nature that leads us far back into lyrics like: Bytuene Mersh ant Averil When spray biginneth to springe. and When the nyhtegale singes The wodes waxen grene Lef ant gras ant blosme springes In Averyl I wene Ant love is to myn herte gon With one spere so kene. If we follow the thread farther back it leads of course across the channel into Provence. The peculiar note in all these songs that picture nature as man's friend and fellow in joy is quite simple and springs from a peculiarly naive reaction to very elementary instincts. It rests upon the observation that springtime is the season of romance in all creation; in spring the trees and flowers bud, the birds skip and sing and mate, and-here is the vital point- "In spring the young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love." This pretty fancy, that the nightingale and the rose feel in the springtime the very same impulses as the poet, when once expressed in the middle ages, apparently set whole nations of poets echoing the same conceit. It re-established a sympathy between man and nature and thus disclosed a limitless source of emotion which the church had for a time suppressed. So long as external nature was looked upon as a thing quite apart from man it could not enter into the group of subjects fit for song; for man is too self-centered to waste emotions on creatures that cannot reciprocate. Lyrical poetry has never attached itself to what is purely objective. But when a bond of sympathy is once established through supposed fellowship in joy and suffering the aesthetic sense also finds room to play. And in this case man attributed to nature not mere sensation, as in the case of animistic poetry, but the one vital and universal passion. Little wonder that the sentiment bore fruit</page><page sequence="8">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 489 in song, especially after the centuries of asceticism during which all natural passion had borne the ban of the church. Now the discovery of this sentiment or conceit was not difficult to make. Lucretius had already said the essential thing-and he was not the first: Nam simulac species patefactast verna diei Aeriae primum volucres te, diva, tuumque Significant initum perculsae corde tua vi-etc. Here is the significant connection between spring and song and love for every creature, and it is as definitely expressed as in any Provengal song. The reason why the spark was not caught up into a romantic conflagration then as later is patent enough. The rationalistic Roman recognized the sentiment as fantastic and not wholly true. He enjoyed the spring song of the bird, but he had learned beyond peradventure that a vast gulf lay between man's emotions and any animal's feelings. His science did not even allow for the historic connections that our biology has won back for us. And being thus taught he could have had little patience with this momentary outburst of Lucretius. To bear fruit in poetry the sentiment had to await an age when the intellect was less alert. And it is not surprising therefore that the suggestion of Lucretius had to await the spirit of mediaevalism, when the Romans were falling under the spell of the mystery-religions and the mind had become drowsy and apathetic. Then the pretty fancy returns again: Ver novum, ver jam canorum, vere natus orbis est. Vere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites. The new Latin poets who wrote after that-mostly foreigners- tried to prove their Latinity undefiled by repeating the classical poets. Yet the third century was apparently ripe for this romantic note, which must arise, if at all, from an unreasoned sympathy for a sentient and passionate nature. The conceit seems never to have been wholly lost again. The few mediaeval Latin poets who are not wholly bound to classical phraseology are prone to catch up the song of the "Pervigilium Veneris." Pentadius,' Venantius Fortunatus, and Eugenius are devotees of spring and the nightingale, 1 See Warren, in Modern Philology, IX, 476 ff.</page><page sequence="9">490 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL and not long before the outburst of Provengal song the thin-voiced singer of Jam dulcis amica venito ended his song with a stanza which becomes practically the stereotyped introduction of the troubadour's love song: Jam nix glaciesque liquescit Folium et herba virescit Philomela jam cantat in alto Ardet amor cordis in antro. Whether the troubadours were in direct line with the followers of the "Pervigilium" it is difficult to say with the evidence now at hand, though the rediscovery of the sentiment could not have been difficult to the mediaeval mind. At any rate it is instructive to see how a pretty conceit fondled for a moment by Lucretius but rejected forthwith by the classical poets as not quite sound became in the mediaeval lyric the source of much romantic song. So far we have dealt with the criticism that the Roman poets did not generally humanize nature. It is also held that they did not contemplate the scenes of grandeur and nature's manifestation of power in the same spirit as the modern does. But here again it cannot be said that they were untrue to their experience. To the man who must sail the seas without compass and an indomitable propeller the heaving waves could bring none but the emotions of dread. The contemplation of the stars and planets naturally sug- gested to those who had but recently begun brooding over philo- sophical problems a long series of cosmological questions rather than more obvious romantic impulses. The frequently reiterated phrase of Lucretius: naturae species ratioque will illustrate the point. The species at once suggests a search for the ratio. Thus it is that the Roman concerns himself less with nature's reaction upon the emotions and more with the philosophic meaning of the cosmic order. That loftiest of emotions that Plato called akin to `pos which overwhelms the philosopher when he has attained to the contemplation of the "idea" is what Lucretius finds in looking up into the firmament in search for universal law. It is not merely aesthetic pleasure, and it is more than the "silent influence" of Wordsworth's nature. It is both of these and in</page><page sequence="10">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 491 addition the philosophic calm of the yearning soul that has attained to the object of its deepest desire. To that poet profoundly stirred by the grandeur of nature's laws, the scene itself must seem a thing of less worth. And it was for this inner contemplation of nature that Vergil also strove: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas. In such a mood the poet must feel that the outward aspect of nature for all its enticements could only have a subordinate claim upon him. It was only when, and if, he must resign the greater theme that Rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes, Flumina amem silvasque inglorius. In the judgment of Lucretius or Vergil it would have seemed that the nineteenth-century poet of landscape scenes had chosen the lesser theme. This but illustrates anew how experience necessarily limits a poet's material. If preoccupation with the greater theme of nature's laws kept the eyes of the Roman poets somewhat averted from a more sympathetic contemplation of what lay before them, it took time and new experiences and a long cycle of poets before justice could be done Nature's obvious aspects. Indeed the ani- mistic fallacy and pantheistic-shall we say-sentimentality of the last century, both flourishing at the expense of rigid thought, did much to win nature her dues. They at least kept the eye sympa- thetically directed upon her every phase; they induced the poet to observe more closely and to analyze-perhaps sometimes to over-analyze-the soul's reaction to natural environment. The poets who felt that the solitary valleys, the broad expanse of calm sky, the grandeur of the mountains exerted a direct influence upon man's character were willing to attend more closely to the varying moods of hills and plain. Shakespeare no less than Homer would have discovered new emotions in the scenes about them a century after "Tintern Abbey." Furthermore mere prosaic experience must be taken into account. For it is apparent that the emotions awakened by a sun- rise from a lofty Alpine peak are too real to need the support of</page><page sequence="11">492 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL a peculiar philosophy-unless perchance a peculiar philosophy is required to awaken the interests that will send the poet climbing the peak whence the discovery can first be made. The Roman poets were apparently so like us that such an experience could hardly have passed in silence if they had once known it. At any rate they could hardly have continued to employ colorless epithets for the mountains after once feeling the exhilaration and grandeur of the sight from a mountain crag. The explanation of the lack of more sympathetic terms is the same I think for Vergil and Horace as for Shakespeare. They had never had the experience that would startle them out of their conventional phrase about the mountains. Those of us who have wandered much over the Italian hills can hardly find this strange. The view from Albano, Tivoli, Tusculum, and Praeneste is charming indeed: amoenus the Roman would say and said. Even Cicero loved such places. He hunted them out and when he could afford it he built a dwelling there. No one who has gone in search of his Tusculanum, Formi- anum, and Cumanum would venture to say that his love for the hills and the sea was not as intense as that of the average modem. But after all these places have the quality of amoenitas, raised some degrees, that all of Italy reveals. The same may in general be said of the Apennines. They have easy slopes, were in Vergil's day probably wooded to the tops, and furnished no striking prospects, even had they been high enough to provide that new goad to the emotions which we seek in the Alps. On an Italian mountain one is never in a scene of awe-inspiring grandeur or desolation. One is seldom out of sight of a hill or valley town. One feels more or less of the charm that the Roman always has at hand when outside the town walls. To reach the region where a wholly new emotion would be evoked the Roman must go to the Alps, a plodding journey of many days which probably no Roman poet ever took. And had it ever occurred to him out of sheer curiosity and despite the laughter of his friends to hire him a guide to climb an Alpine peak, he probably would have been met half-way up by barbarians ready with daggers to cut at least his purse-straps. Had Vergil climbed Monte Rosa he would have made a discovery such as you and I have made, and it would have left an impress upon his vocabulary, but the adventure</page><page sequence="12">FORTUNATUS ET ILLE 493 was hardly in the realm of possibilities. Whether Catullus ever sailed his pinnace up to the rocks of Riva from his Sirmio we do not know. Perhaps it was not safe to do so. At any rate the themes of his brief volume give little opportunity for us to judge what he might have said if he had written on Vergil's themes. But one stanza has music that no reader soon forgets: Montium domina ut fores Silvarumque virentium Saltuumque reconditorum Amniumque sonantum. The poet who wrote this had doubtless had his regrets that the dread valleys of the Alps were not safe ground to explore. How- ever to expect from him or from Horace the emotions of a Byron on Mont Blanc would be as anachronistic as to demand of them the sentiments of a Christian hymn. Now despite all this we can hardly hold that the ancients viewed nature wholly adequately even when we give due weight to the premises of their philosophy and outlook upon life. They might have studied the details of their landscape more sympathetically and conveyed in verse the varying moods of atmosphere and sky more often. For all the delightful pictures granted us by Catullus, Vergil, Horace, and Lucretius we have not from them such scenes of pure beauty as that for instance in the first stanzas of the "Re- volt of Islam," or the sunset scene in the "Excursion." Have we, however, the right to seek it ? Art must have time to learn, and it may learn even from illusions at times. The conceits and senti- ments and philosophies of the last century held the attention of the modern poet upon nature's habits and aspects so long and so sympathetically that he has learned to observe beauties that necessarily escaped the ancients. Yet we cannot conclude that the Romans did not love nature intensely. Numberless villas on hilltops and seaside crags and the prevalent use' of landscape paintings in the homes testify to the contrary. From the formal prose that is left us we can expect few references to the subject. Nevertheless Cicero's letters are not silent about the scenery of his country places, the waterfalls of the Liris at his ancestral home, I See Rostowzew, Rum. Mitt., 1911.</page><page sequence="13">494 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL the vistas from Antium and Asturae, the play of the light on the water near his Cumanum, the charms of the bay of Naples which he enjoys from his Puteolanum.' But it is needless to repeat what has so often been said. If the ancient did not feel all that the modern has expressed, it is in some measure because he was true to his instincts, his experiences, and his philosophy. Later men have felt more and will probably to the end of time, for they can range farther afield. Yet the day may be at hand when the critic will cease to ask why the classic poets did not write of nature as Words- worth did, and will find a more difficult problem in explaining how the nineteenth century could bring itself to express some of the sentiments about nature which are still current.
