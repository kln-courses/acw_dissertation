<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSALITY AND IMPLICATION. I SHOULD like to make some observations upon Dr. McTaggart's striking lecture on Causality. The greater part of what he says possesses, as one wQuld expect from him, an almost convincing lucidity and vraisemblance. Nevertheless I believe that the truth may be more nearly approached by considering the question from a somewhat different point of view. The main point which I desire to elucidate is whether and in what sense Causality is explanation, and whether and in what sense Causality is reciprocal. It is important that Causality is regarded ab initio as a relation of Implication. I do not propose here to pursue the quegtions raised by the addition " between terms which exist " (p. 326). In ordinary temporal conditions the terms do not both exist at once. The definition mav be construed to cover their case, but diffinulties remain. The account of Implication (p. 331) seems to me not to ne quite sufficient, and as regards that which, as based on experience, is contrasted with Implication a priori, not to be correct. Impli- cation, I should have said, invariably means a character attaching to a definite complex of terms and relations, such that some element within it can be distinctly seen, by being what it is, to make inevitable the presence of a certain other element in a certain relation to it. The insight is strictly limited to the com- plex with reference to which it is developed, and an insight based on one complex may conflict in substance with that based on another, although both are a pricri. A priori implication is, there- fore, for me, a matter of degree, and none is absolute except that, if any, which deals with the complex of experience as a whole. Whether all implication involves a character of which it can be seen not only that if it is so, a certain other is so, but that if it is not so the other is not so, is essentially the question of reciprocity of characteristics, and I will return to it under that head. The account of Implication as based on experience, I said, appeared to me not to be correct. If, as I hold, Implication a priori is a matter of degree, it will be less surprising to find it continuous in type and ground with that which has an empirical presentation. I do not think that even the latter depends " on the terms being always found together," or "has no meaning unless they occur more than once" (p. 331). The- type of Implication appears to me to be the same when the basis is what Dr. McTaggart</page><page sequence="2">CAUSALITY AND IMPLICATION. 95 would call empirical, and when it is what he would call a priori. In the former case as in the latter it seems to me to consist in the vision of a complex, within which certain elements are seen, by being what they are, to make 1 inevitable certain other elements, and, as I shall try to point out below, supposing they were not what they are, to exclude those other elements. I will take one of Dr. McTaggart's favourite examples to illus- trate my meaning, in anticipation of my argument. "Beheading implies death," because, I gather Dr. McTaggart would say, the former has so often been found to precede the latter (p. 337). That is not how the matter looks to me. You could, I should say, arrive at no such implication, unless you had before you a certain world or complex, in this case the world of living beings, within which you rightly or wrongly take for granted a set of elements and connexions. An event of a certain kind within this world, you see, I should say, selectively, to be in a relation of implication with another event within the same world, from the nature of the universal characteristics presented by the two events, considering the complex to be what you take for granted that it is. The type and machinery, so to speak, of this complication, is in my view exactly the same as that by which you see that two straight lines cannot enclose a space. The circumstances which you take for granted, are of course much more precarious in the former case; and may be more easily overthrown by experience (p. 337); 2 but the in- sight founded upon them is quite of the same kind. That the characteristics (p. 332) are universals is important for me also; but not because they can repeat themselves; rather because they are centres in which a number of conditions meet, which, given the complex, determine their natuire. 1. Now I will say something on the question whether "the discovery of a causal relation between two events explains those events, or at any rate explains the event taken as the effect " (p. 335). It is obvious that no ultimate fact or law, a priori or other, can be explained in the sense of being referred to anything beyond it. Least of all can the universal (that which explains everything) I No expression which I use is intended to convey the activity of causes. The assimilation of cause, as understood in science, to volition, has always appeared to me a most infelicitous anthropomorphism. 2 Cf. p. 337. The general statements on pp. 336-337 seem to me, unlike Dr. McTaggart's assertions as a rule, repugnant to common sense; that is, if we understand the words "apart from experience" to mean apart from special experience of certain conjunctions. And they must mean this, for apart from all experience, we could make no judgrnent and have nothing in our minds. The statements I refer to are such as this: "Apart from experience we have no -more reason to suppose that cutting off my head would kill me than that it would blow up the Taj Mahal ". If "apart from experience" here means " apart from specific experience ,of decapitating high organisms " the statement strikes me as opposed to eommon sense.</page><page sequence="3">96 BERNARD BOSANQUET: be explained in this sense. But Dr. McTaggart's point is, that anr ultimate causal law merely " asserts an ultimate connexion of two, things, that is, a connexion of which we know that it does exist, but do not know why it exists " (p. 335). He seems to draw a dis.. tinction in this respect between a causal law and an a priori impli- cation such as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space. The, latter (p. 336) is self-evident, i.e., I suppose at least explains itself; the former explainrs neither itself nor any connexion founded upon it, except so far as reference to a general rule is an explanation. Here are two points. I take the second first. How much of an explanation is a reference to "a general rule ? It is certainly somnething of an explanation. Before the general rule is discovered, we are absolutely at sea. When it is discovered, we exclude a whole chaos of possibilities, and grasp the beginning of an order. Say the wall socket of an electric radiator heats when the current is turned on. If one knows no cause, one is lost in disagreeable conjecture. The house, one thinks, may be burned down at any moment. The electrician comes, points out the cause, and shows one. how to remove it. All usage would say he has "explained" the heating (cf. the excellent passage in Bradley's. Pr'irnciples of Logic, p. 491). He has put it in relation to an order. The second point grows out of this. We saw that- even a causal law is not directly or indirectly (p. 336) a record iof experienced conjunctions, but a connexion seen within a defined complex. Therefore, accepting the complex, it does explain itself, after the the type of the a priori self-evidence referred to above. I note the recognition (p. 340) that causal laws do not always take the shape of relations of two things; and as we are now speaking of the appropriateness of their ultimate form for explanatory value, the suggestion that propositions about conjunctions of two things are always involved in them is here irrelevant, and it is itself open to our general criticilsm. What shape would the ultimate law possess to which the heat- ing of the wall-socket would be referred? Obviously, it would be the whole complex of fact, set in order by theory, which constitutes, the realm of our experience of electricity. Looking at this, we should see the implication. The law, in this form, would explain both itself and the effect. That is to say, it would enable both to be thought in relation to a whole of experience. But, in principle, no explanation can do more. The alleged distinction of type between causal and a priori laws has no existence. Both are selective visions within complexes taken for granted. That cause and etfect as such should be identical with each other (p. 336), I agree, is absurd. But is not this a misrepresentation of the view that they merge into, one another within the same com- plex, and that the distinction between them is an arbitrary line? At any rate, I take it, this is the correct view. If cause and effect are :names for terms selected within a complex, it must be so.</page><page sequence="4">CAUSALITY AND IMPLICATION. 97 Surely, in the case of a living body being beheaded, no one knows at what precise moment death sets in. We know that a process begins with a blow and goes on into death; but we cannot say, " Up to here it is all cause, and after, it is all effect ". The process is the reality. Cause and effect are shifting distinctions on its surface. The point is that cause and effect are not, as the view I am remarking upon fundamentally takes them to be, isolable terms or events, but are parts selected in- a continuous connexion, within a complex taken for granted. The complex, like every ordered whole of experience, is pro tanto an explanation of it'self and of all its details. If then to explain is to furnish the means of. thinking a detail in harmony with an order of experience, I submit that to discover a causal relation is to explain, and that there is no difference of principle in this respect between insights which are called a priori and insights which are supposed to rest on an empirical basis. I must not however diverge into the whole question of the nature of the a priori, though I suspect that the root of our difference lies really there. I now pass to the question whether Causal Implication is neces- sarily reciprocal. 2. Here again it is important from my point of. view that the relation has been brought under the head of Implication. For I believe that all Implication is as such reciprocal, and that appear- ances to the contrary depend upon the presence of irrelevance (cf. Appearance and Reality, second edition, p. 362, footnote). I will begin with a word upon this general presumption drawn from the very nature of Implication. If A coheres with or is linked to B, B, it would seem, must be linked to or cohere with A. It is not a question, we must remember, of two things, each of which is found sometimes by itself and sometimes with the other, like two friends. It is common ground that on one side the rela- tion is universal; A is never found without B. That is to say, if we recall the view which I have suggested, Implication always means at least that selective vision apprehends A, within the assumed context, as possessing the character, the coupling or point of attachment, or as participating'in the grouping of rela- tions at or in which B must inevitably be found. "If A is present, B must be present." Now if this is carefully noted, it seems very hard-I at least find it all but impossible-to conceive B, this identical B, a uni- versal characteristic, as not possessing the corresponding feature, coupling or point of attachment, which carries with it the presence of A. How can an element, united to A without exception where A exists, cut itself loose as a whole (not with part of itself only) and go about independently? Now what addition do we need ta the previous statement of our apprehension, in order to make this presumption a certainty? This, and this only. We formulatedc 7</page><page sequence="5">98 BERNARD BOSANQUET: it first in the words, " If A is, B is," which say that A implies B. If our insight extends to the contrary alternative, or negative instance, and we are able to say in addition: "If A is not, B is not," then we are assured that B implies A, that is, that the im- plication is reciprocal. For when it is true that " If A is not, B is not," then it is also true that " If B is, A is ". Throughout the whole region of insight and inference, it is ex- ceedingly hard to conceive that you have a complete vision of a connexion when you see only its positive or central thread, and not the correlative negation whicn gives its precise limit (the same in principle with the confirmatory negative instance in induction). But if you see the latter, then your insight has apprehended a re- ciprocal implication. " Concave implies convex." "Not concave implies not convex." "Convex implies concave." " Human goodness implies good will." Absence of human goodness implies absence of good will." " Good will implies human goodness." " Stoppage of the heart for good implies death." " Non-stoppage of the heart implies the absence of death." " Death implies stoppage of the heart for good." I take it we cannot say, " What are not three angles of a triangle are, not equal to two right angles," but we can say, " What are not equal to three angles of a triangle are not equal to two right angles ". That is clearly seen in the complex, and carries the reciprocal, " Two right angles are equal to what is equal to three angles of a triangle". Without the correlative negative we have not the limits of relevance; and surely the whole of implication and inference is founded upon relevance. What is relevant I understand to be that which, in the complex taken for granted, is seen to affect the connexion between A and B. If this is not fully and accur- ately demarcated, our insight is defective. (I do not say that it ever can be demarcated with ideal precision.) If it is demarcated, the implication is reciprocal. What, then, am I to say of the examples of non-reciprocal im- plication on which Dr. McTaggart relies? (pp. 333-334 and 341). They are such as "' Red implies being coloured," "Beheading im- plies death". I reply that these propositions, strictly taken, are false. Red does not imply " coloured " without distinction; it ex- eludes most cases of it absolutely, and a term cannot imply what it absolutely excludes. It contains, no doubt, something which implies coloured without distinction, but it also contains much that is irrelevant to the .implication and contradicts it. In " Beheading implies death " this is still clearer. It is like say- ing, "Eating my dinner with a white tie on implies that I am nourished ". We see this strikingly in Dr. McTaggart's treatment of one of his own examples (pp. 333-334). The passage is very remarkable. It is one of his special points that there is no non-reciprocal deter-</page><page sequence="6">CAUSALITY AND IMPLICATION. 99 mination of effect by cause, though I do not think he means that there is a reciprocal determination, but rather that it is variable; and he has to maintain this while contending that there is non- reciprocal determination between characteristics, viz. the universal qualities or relations in virtue of which events determine (imply) one another. The solution offered depends on the assertion that the de- termining characteristic may belong to " cause " or " effect " indif- ferently, and may even be removed from one of the same two events to the other by a change in the description. Here is the example. Primci facie, drinking alcohol is the cause of drunkenness and not vice versa. But the determining characteristic belongs here to the effect and not to the cause, for being drunk implies having drunk alcohol, and not vice versa. (The effect, in short, is here the antecedent and not the consequent in an ordinary hypothetical proposition.) But, the writer proceeds, if you describe the events more precisely, you reverse this relation. IFor if you specify the amount and, conditions of the drinking, you can make the drink- ing alcohol ";determine" (imply) the drunkenness, and not vice versa. But then, I add, you can return to the charge and further ,define the degree and kind,of drunkenness, until the power of im- plication (of being antecedent in the ordinary sense) will return to the "effect ". "If he is, so drunk, he must have drunk so much." Clearly the continuation of this process (I am not responsible for its nature!) must lead to the two terms being so described that each implies the other. And the less precise description must surely be false. Dr. McTaggart does not seem to admit that this process could take place with every pair of terms in causal relation. But his very point is to show that " we cannot say that the one which would generally be called cause determines the other more than it is determined by the other" (p. 334). It seems unlikely that a relation whose incidence is so transfer- able should not be universal, and if so implication is reciprocal. The first statement of what a law of universal causality would require (pp. 339-340), "Then in each case in which G occurs, a characteristic Ha can be found, etc.," with a recurrence to it on the following page (" the Ha which can be found for every recurrence of G ") does not seem to me quite reconcilable with the detail of the law as explained afterwards. I shall not lay stress on this, except to say that it looks as if the more natural statement came first, and received modification in being drawn out. The fuller statement makes G as such related to different occurrences Ha, H,8, Hfy, according to the ordinary conception of the plurality of causes (p. 341). Now surely to say that Ha and H,1/ respectively imply G, with- out inserting any condition or distinction to adapt G to these different sources of implication, is ultimately the same error as to predicate A and B of a subject G without distinction in the latter, which I take to be the very formula of contradiction. Of course</page><page sequence="7">100 BERNARD BOSANQTOET: CAUSALITY AND IMPLICATION. it may be replied that this comparison does not hold unless we assume reciprocity, which is the question in dispute. I am only pointing out how much common ground there is between the two cases.' The Law of Contradiction seems to me enough to settle the question. It is a contradiction to affirm differents as determining an identity without a distinction in the identity. Therefore, to conclude, I am forced to reject the assertion, founded upon Dr. McTaggart's examples, that "'it is clear that reciprocal determination does not hold universally" (p. 342). It- does not appear to me to be true (ibid.) that drunkenness deter- mines the drinking of alcohol, nor that red determines the redi thing being coloured. In all these cases the true implication is. disguised by an irrelevant addition, as we see immediately if we look with care at the complex within which each of them falls, and particularly if we are alive to the negative limit of relevance. The fate of the proposition about drunkenness, which we studiedi above, is enough to show that we have, in its first form, merely a. defective statement, which when the defect is remedied becomes. reciprocal. Therefore the eireflicon on page 342, which would leave some determination non-reciprocal, but open the possibility of one reciprocal determination for every characteristic, seems to me to underrate the logical necessities of the situation. The whole state-- ment, to my mind, is thrown out of gear by looking, at experience under the aspect of repeated conjunctions of occurrences, rather' than under that of a systematic complex, however imperfectly established in its particulars. 1 t pointed out elsewhere (Adamson Lecture, 1913, Appendix) that in the volume called the New Reclism the feature called by the authors, " logical priority " (the relation of condition precedent of truth occupied by the "implied" to the "implier") is maintained in effect to belong both to antecedent over consequent, and to consequent over antecedent (I do not say by the same authors). Reasons are alleged for both views, but they are of course in flat contradiction. This seems to suggest strongly that the two terms must be on a level in point of implication (cf. Dr. McTaggart, pp. 333-334). BERNARD BOSANQUET.</page></plain_text>
