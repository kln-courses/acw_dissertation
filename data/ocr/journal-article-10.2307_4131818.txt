<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yair Lorberbaum. Image of God, Halakhah andAggadah. Tel Aviv: Schocken Pub- lishing House, 2004. 544 pp. The central thesis of Lorberbaum's book is that according to the rabbis, the meaning of imago dei is that there is tangible divine presence within every human being. This concept impacted primarily upon two areas of halakhah: the death penalty and procreation. Since humans are physical representations of God, exe- cution is equivalent in some ways to deicide. Conversely, procreation is strongly mandated because it increases God's physical manifestation in the world by creat- ing more vehicles in which to embody God's presence. Importantly, as "images" of the divine, human beings function as icons in a manner similar to the way idols 165</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews function in the pagan world; they draw God's presence into themselves, blurring the borders between representation and form. Finally, the drawing of God's pres- ence into the human body dictates that human beings are embodied with signifi- cant theurgic powers. This thesis rests upon two components: anthropomorphism and anthropolo- gy. The Tannaim had an anthropomorphic conception of God. Their deity was a God with a concrete physical form and a complex personality, similar to the bib- lical conception of God. The tannaitic conception of humans as created in God's image is also an expression of their anthropology, which takes into account both the human intellectual/spiritual capacities and the body's concrete dimensions. In the first two of three introductory methodological chapters, the author sur- veys previous scholarly work on imago dei and anthropomorphism in rabbinic thought. Lorberbaum demonstrates how deeply scholars have been influenced by both the Maimonidean transcendent and incorporeal deity and by their own ratio- nal biases. Rabbis of the mishnaic and talmudic periods, according to Lorberbaum, rarely conceived of God as being incorporeal but rather ineffable. God's body may be hidden from human beings, but God does have a form. The third methodologi- cal chapter deals with the intimate connection between halakhah and aggadah. For Lorberbaum not only does aggadah impact halakhah, but halakhic rulings and bib- lical exegeses are the source through which rabbinic theosophy can be deciphered, for the rabbis shaped and expressed their theosophy through halakhah as much as aggadah. A large portion of the book is dedicated to demonstrating how the concept of imago dei affected the death penalty and modes of execution. The Tannaim shaped three out of the four modes of execution-strangling, burning, and ston- ing-so as to cause as little damage to the body as possible, for the body is an icon of God. They limited post-mortem hanging to a bare minimum of time and its ap- plicability to only a few crimes. Decapitation is the exception that proves the rule, for it is the punishment for the murderer, the very crime which diminishes the im- age of God. The Tannaim imposed radically strict requirements for judicial proce- dure and criminal conviction, which made execution virtually impossible to carry out. Their concept of imago dei led to an outright opposition of execution as pun- ishment, despite its prevalence in the Bible. Lorberbaum's work on the death penalty is familiar terrain. This is the third book to be published in less than a decade that deals with the rabbinic prescrip- tions for carrying out execution. Whereas Moshe Halbertal in Interpretive Revo- lutions in the Making (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1997) claimed that the rabbis shaped the death penalty to express the dignity of the hu- man body (a moral value), Lorberbaum attributes these exegeses and halakhot to tannaitic theosophy and theurgy. Another difference is that Lorberbaum analyzes the outright opposition to the death penalty whereas this topic is not covered in Halbertal's work. In contrast to both, Aharon Shemesh in Punishments and Sins: From Scripture to the Rabbis (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2003) emphasizes the rabbinic midrashic impulse as being a much greater con- tributor to the shaping of halakhah. The close appearance of these three books makes for fertile comparison between their different approaches. The debate over 166</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the proper setting for rabbinic halakhah, exegesis (Shemesh), encryption of val- ues/morality (Halbertal) or theosophy/theurgy (Lorberbaum) is a debate over the very identity of the rabbis themselves, a debate that is at the heart of modern rab- binic scholarship. There are two issues barely touched on in the book that deserve mention. At the end of his conclusion, Lorberbaum mentions only briefly the concept of Israel as God's chosen people, an exclusive conception of Israel which conflicts with the universalistic concept of imago dei. Most of Lorberbaum's book deals with Rabbi Akiva's first statement in M. Avoth 3:14, "Precious is adam for he was created in the image [of God]" Rabbi Akiva's next statement, "Precious is Israel in that they are called children to the Omnipresent," seems to propose a genealogical relation- ship with God, one exclusive of other human beings. The reconciliation of this sec- ond statement with the first deserves deeper exploration, and indeed the author is currently working on a book on this very topic. Similarly, the book does not deal with issues of gender. When conceiving of an embodied God, did the Tannaim con- ceive of God as engendered, gender-neutral, or perhaps dual-gendered? Lorberbaum's book is in the process of being translated into English and will hopefully be published by 2005-06. In translation, it should have impact not only on scholars of rabbinics, but also on scholars of early Christianity and Gnosticism, as well as on a wide range of scholars of religion and religious history. Lorber- baum discusses the shift in concepts of holiness from the Second Temple period to the post-destruction era. He also very briefly surveys other post-70 CE Jewish groups for whom the idea of imago dei was also central. However, since the book is about the Tannaim and not ancient Judaism, he does not develop these ideas. The ideas that the presence of God is represented in every human being and that the human being is the seat of holiness are rich concepts in the study of the various forms of ancient Judaism, including early Christianity in its various forms. When translated and available to a broader range of scholars, Lorberbaum's book should serve as a new and critical starting point for inquiry into the relationship between early Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and rabbinic Judaism.
