<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Story of a Giant Story The Winding Way of Og King of Bashan in the Jewish Haggadic Tradition Admiel Kosman University of Potsdam, Abraham Geiger College Og, the king of Bashan, is depicted in the Bible, the midrash in the Tannaitic period and by Josephus as a giant of realistic dimensions. In the Amoraic exegeses he became a figure of monstrous proportions, possibly under the influence of views that appear in the Apocrypha. One "expansion" of his image was already deliv ered in the name of Palestinian Amoraim, but it is linked to the dimension of time. This "stretching" could also have sparked the fertile midrashic imagination for the physical stretching of his body. In a later addition, Og became Eliezer, Abraham's servant. In the Middle Ages Og "returns" to his human dimensions, and the commen tators, both the rationalists and those who engaged in esoteric interpretations, struggled to explain these exaggerated expositions as allegory. The exegesis in the Zohar and in the commentary by Rashba continue to expand the interpretive direction that presents Og as possessing spiritual merits. In the hands of the aggadic commentators in recent centuries, this direction split into two interpretive options, that share their portrayal of Og and Moses as occupying two sharply opposing poles: some refused to accept that this "wicked one" had any spiritual merits. Others sought to relate the story of Og and the story of his war with Moses as a battle between two completely righteous indi viduals, with the sole decisive advantage held by Moses in this struggle as being from Israel, the people that had been chosen by God. There are instances in which a story that was related somewhere and sometime as a singular event becomes the linchpin that connects early generations with later times. In these cases the story that is transmitted in such a manner in the tradition from one generation to another functions as a sort of "frame" for several narrative materials from which each generation selects to weave its own narrative, the story that suits it in terms of the conditions under which this generation grew, its spirit, and its culture. The following is an example of such a story: the narrative of Og king of Bashan in the Jewish tradition. We are accustomed to distinguish between the storytellers, the haggadists themselves, and the commentators, whose learned comments are meant to clarify, explain, and resolve problems that arise from a reading of the haggadic text. This article, in contrast, will seek to present the interpretive process itself 157</page><page sequence="2">158 ADMIEL KOSMAN 2 as that of a retelling of the haggadic text. We will attempt to show how each commentator, even if he presents his motives as purely hermeneutical, is none other than a narrator; a reteller, who, with his distinctive narrative method, imprints the narrative with the unique seal of the time and place in which his new version was "composed.'' The major part of the following survey examines the chronological "expan sion'or "reduction" of the character of Og in this tradition, with the aim, so to speak, of presenting the story of the storytellers themselves. Or, perhaps, in other words: to set forth the Jewish commentary on the haggadah as a certain way of retelling, in accordance with the cultural context of the storyteller at any place and any time along the historical continuum. As we shall see below, in each generation the character of Og has been painted in the special colors of these commentators-storytellers, who almost never let him simply be Og, the giant presented by the biblical narrator as the rival of Israel in the war for the conquest of Bashan. Rather they added to and embel lished him with all manner of strange descriptions. They altered his character with whatever variants they pleased, and ascribed to him and his family various sorts of powers, to the extent that from a synoptic perspective it seems on occasion that as time passed the story of Og itself became no less monstrous and imaginary than the expansion of the specific character of Og into the gigantic dimensions it occupies in several of the fantastic versions of the story. On Giants in the Jewish Haggadic Tradition Before beginning a specific discussion of the Og legend, it would be worthwhile to cast a quick glance at the biblical narrative traditions that are concerned with gigantic characters in general. The earliest of such narratives, that presents the "Nephilim" as the sons of God who descended to earth and took wives from the daughters of men, who bore them offspring (Gen 6:1-4), is perhaps the source of all the haggadot of the Nephilim and Anakites in the Bible.1 This is undoubtedly a story of mythic origin, with many similar legends prevalent in world mythology of the coupling of different species, between gods and men, sometimes resulting in the birth of demigods, who are capable of challenging man's finite destiny. In the Bible, this narrative underwent a process of demy thologization, for the Bible emphasizes that "My breath shall not abide in man 1 See below, n. 32, for an expansion of this issue (see also n. 49, below); see also the comment by Jacob Licht, A Commentary on the Book of Numbers [xi-xxi] (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1991) 67, on the"Nephilim the offspring of the Anakites"(Heb.) and see: Devorah Dimant,'7J1e Fallen Angels' Angels' in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Books Related to them (Thesis; Jerusalem: The Hebrew Univ., 1974) 10 n. 24.</page><page sequence="3">3 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 159 forever, since he too is flesh; let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years" (v. 3). This myth, in its biblical adaptation, demonstrates that in this early phase such hero stories were already part of the repertoire of the Hebrew popular narrative tradition.2 The name Anak is interpreted in Josh 14:15 as if it were the first name of the founder of Kiriath-arba, "that is Hebron!'3and this name was later given to people whose sons were large in size and who dwelled especially in Hebron and its surroundings.4 The Israelites first encounter these Anakites in the nar rative of the spies, in Numbers 13, which relates that these giants instilled the spies with fear. It is related that Joshua son of Jephunneh dispossessed three Anakites named Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai (Josh 14:12-14; Judg 1:20)? It is stated of Joshua in general fashion that he forced the Anakites out of the hills of the western Land of Israel and the vicinity of Hebron, and consequently "no Anakites remained in the land of the Israelites; but some remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod" (Josh 11:22). This comment provides an opening for the Anakite stories that occupy a prominent place as a central narrative in the book of Judges, since this text alludes to Goliath and his brothers the descendants of the Raphah, the giants6 with whom the Israelites were forced to contend.7 It has been suggested, from the literary aspect, that the narrative of Davids battle with Goliath has its origins in a popular Hebrew story, in the common format of the popular epic of the youngest son who goes forth to save his brothers, struggles against a monstrous giant, kills him, and later wins the prin cess, overcoming the many obstacles that stand in his way to the conquest of the kingdom. Some add that this story was originally told about an unknown hero and was later transferred by popular storytellers to the more famous character of King David.8 Rabbinic haggadic literature made use of these motifs, at times transforming the heroes of the Bible into giant-like creatures of imaginary power and arrogant See Eli Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1999)10-11. See Shmuel Ahituv,"Anak, Anok, Anakim"Enziklopedyah MikraDit (Encyclopaedia Biblica) (9 vols.; Jerusalem; Mosad Bialik, 1972) vol.6 cols. 312-13 (Heb.);Trent C.Butler, Joshua,WBC 7 (Waco, Texas: Word Books, 1983) 159,174. Num 13:28,33; see Josh 11:21. An action also ascribed to Joshua. See below; Ahituv,"Anak, Anok, Anakim." It was said of Goliath that his height was "six cubits and a [handjspan tall"(1 Sam 17:4). See Butler, Joshua, 130, who also mentions Samson and his bravery within the context of the special treatment of the"Anakites"by the book of Judges. This is supported by the version in 2 Sam 21:19 and in 1 Chr 20:5, that relates that Elhanan son of Jaare killed the Philistine giant; see Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale, 22; see also Yassif, 64-65, for the hypothesis that this story was originally a magical tale.</page><page sequence="4">160 ADMIEL KOSMAN 4 behavior, similar to the biblical Samson or the Hercules of Greek mythology.9 Thus, for example, the haggadah attributed such characteristics to individuals such as Joab son ofZeruiah, Davids military commander.10It should, however, be stressed that the great strength of such characters, even if the narrative is of popular origin and makes use of magic means, is eventually subordinated, already in the biblical narrative — and certainly in the rabbinic haggadot — to the Divine force that directs the world in accordance with the Lords plans.11 Prom inent in the background of both the biblical narrative of David and Goliath and the narrative of Moses' war with Og, following the haggadah set forth below, is the presence of a supportive God, a fact that is eventually decisive, unlike the widespread literary format in non-Jewish legends of the clumsy and malicious giant who is bested by the cunning and valor of the hero.12 An additional dif ference between the giant tales in world literature and the haggadot of giants in the rabbinic literature is that the latter lacks the widespread motif of giants who cause geological upheavals, and whose very existence constitutes a perilous danger to the physical existence of the world.13 The common element seemingly shared by the various giant tales, including those in the Jewish tradition, is that in all the versions the struggle with the giants demands of the hero who battles with them a degree of spiritual elevation and psychological strength.14 As we shall see (below), Moses also was required to contend with the fears that assaulted him before his war with Og. 9 For folkloristic stories related to giants in general, see the classification by Stith Thompson, Motif Index Motif Index of Folk-Literature (Copenhagen - Bloomington: Rosenkilde and Bagger - Indiana Univ. Press, 1959) chaps. G100-G199.

We found an haggadic tradition relating to Joab son of Zeruiah, that he seized Abner and bound him with a"coil of threads" (Yalkut Shimoni, Jeremiah 285), and by kefitzat ha-derekh (the miraculous shortening of the way) he traveled a tremendous distance (Bereshit Rabbah 59:11 [J(udah) Theodor and Chanokh Albeck, eds., Midrash Bereshit RabbaRabba (Jerusalem: Wahrmann, 1965) 68 ]; b.Sanhedrin 95a); see also Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of of the Jews (7 vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1913)4:100-101. 11 The Bible also takes care to transmit this message, when it teaches us that none of the Anakites could stand up to the Israelites, for it is the Lord who crosses before them (see Deut 9:1-2); see Ahituv,Ahituv, "Anak, Anok, Anakim,"312. 12 For the giant legends in world literature and the common motif of the hero who defeats them with cunning and courage, see Hans Biedermann, Dictionary of Symbolism, Cultural Icons and the the Meanings behind Them, James Hulbert, trans.

Thus, for example, the nature of the dispute be tween Judah and Joseph is presented in such a light.15 In such instances, the haggadah haggadah turned the extended biblical narrative into a folktale, that envelops the nucleus of the biblical narrative with a humorous atmosphere that results from the crude behavior of the heroes together with the fear of threatening and monstrous creatures.16 If the haggadah occasionally acts in such a manner with positive heroes, it obviously can be expected to afford similar treatment to the negative characters in the Bible. This short introduction sheds some light on the background of the fantastic literary development that transformed Og, in some of his metamorphoses in the sources, from a lofty man of impressive dimensions to the threatening monster of the haggadah (see below). The Biblical Og The first biblical mention of the Israelite victory over Og king of Bashan consists of a short report that appears in Num 21:33-35: They marched on and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan, with all his people, came out to Edrei to engage them in battle. But the Lord said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I give him and all his people and his land into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon." They defeated him and his sons and all his people, until no remnant was left him; and they took possession of his country. Additional details concerning this war are to be found in Deuteronomy, in the speech by Moses (3:1-13): We made our way up the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with all his men took the field against us at Edrei. But the Lord said to 15 See Bereshit Rabbah 93:6 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., 1157-58); Ginzberg, Legends of the jews (1913) 2:103-10. 16 See Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale, 85. For the folk beliefs connected with giants, see Yassif, 481 n. 16. Yassif also suggests that heroic stories of contemporary figures could not develop after the destruction of the Temple and the failure of the Bar Kokhba rebellion, when the Jewish people lacked any military force, and the natural need by the public for such tales turned the imagina tion of the popular storytellers to the distant biblical heroes; see Yassif, 85.</page><page sequence="6">162 ADMIEL KOSMAN 6 me: Do not fear him, for I am delivering him and all his men and his country into your power, and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. So the Lord our God also deliv ered into our power Og king of Bashan, with all his men, and we dealt them such a blow that no survivor was left. At that time we captured all his towns; there was not a town that we did not take from them: sixty towns, the whole district of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan — all these towns were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars — apart from a great number of unwalled towns. We doomed them as we had done in the case of Sihon king of Heshbon; we doomed every town — men, women, and children — and retained as booty all the cattle and the spoil of the towns. [... ] Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaim. His bedstead, an iron bedstead, is now in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by a man's forearm. [... ] all that part of Bashan which is called Rephaim country. Jair son of Manasseh received the whole Argob district (that is, Bashan) as far as the bound ary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and named it after himself, Hawoth-jair — as is still the case. This victory over Og by Moses' troops is briefly mentioned once again in Deut 4:47: "They had taken possession of his [Sihon's] country and that of Og king of Bashan — the two kings of the Amorites who were on the east side of the Jordan." Three tokens of Og's exceptional size remain in the biblical tradition. The first: according to the verse in Deut 3:47, Og was an Amorite,17and in other passages in the Bible the lineage of the Amorites is traced to the Rephaim, an ancient people of giants (the early meaning of the name Refaim is apparently "heroes").18 The Amorites themselves also are depicted in the Bible as being tall 17 In contrast to this, however, he is also mentioned as the non-Amorite king of Bashan (Num 21:33, and more). For this see Chaim Rabin,"Og?Eretz-Israel 8 (1967) 251 (Heb.). For the conjee tures concerning the purpose of the biblical narrative in attributing Og to the Amorites and to the Anakites the descendants of the Rephaim, as an attempt to thereby denigrate the tainted origin of these peoples, from the flawed coupling with the sons of God, see Baruch J. Schwartz, The The Holiness Legislation (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1999)157-58; also see below, n.32. 18 Samuel E. Loewenstamm,"Refaim,"Enziklopedyah MikraDit, vol. 7, cols. 404-6 (Heb.). See also Rabin,"Og,"252 n. 24, who proposes understanding the meaning of this word as"the tall ones."Also see Shemaryahu Talmon,"Rephaim in the Bible and rpu/i/(m) in the Literature of UgaritUgarit "Beit Mikra 30 (100) (1985) 16-27 (Heb.). Goliath the Philistine also was considered to be a descendant of the Rephaim (1 Chr 20:4-8; 2 Sam 21:19-20). For "Rephaim"in the traditional commentary, see the summation of Yehudah Nahshoni, Hagut be-Parshiyot ha-Torah (Studies in the Portions of the Torah) (2 vols.; Benei Berak: Sifriyati, 1986) 2:722-24 (Heb.).</page><page sequence="7">7 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 163 and stout (Amos 2:9: "whose stature was like the cedar's and who was stout as the oak").19 The second: between the lines of the biblical portrayal we understand that Moses was apprehensive of the encounter with Og, and God had to encourage him with heartening promises, in a pattern that recurs both in Numbers and in Deuteronomy: "Do not fear, for I am delivering him into your hands."20 The third such indicator appears in the references in other biblical sources that incidentally stress the degree to which the importance of this war was im pressed in the consciousness of later generations. It appears from these refer ences that this victory (like the triumph over the army of Sihon) was inscribed in the consciousness of the later generations as a special, and even unique event (Josh 2:10; 9:10; 12:4; 13:12, 30-31; 1 Kgs 4:19 ff.; Neh 9:22; Ps 135:11-12; 136:20). Ogs singular size, however, that instilled fear in Moses and the Israelites, is not perceived in the Bible itself in mythical terms, but rather as being totally realistic. As we have seen, Deut 3:11 uses an intriguing "archaeological" report to describe his height, claiming that "only Og king of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaim. His bedstead [arso], an iron bedstead,21 is now in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by a mans fore arm." This report is to be understood literally: Og was about twice as tall as a normal person, and that is all. The Character of Og in the Tannaitic Literature A study of the material that survived in the tannaitic midrashim also shows the lack of any evidence that in that period, in the Land of Israel midrashim that 19 Jubilees 29:9 (O. S.Wintermate, trans., in James H. Charlesworth, ed., The Old Testament Pseude pigraphapigrapha [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1985] 111) even relates of the Rephaim that their height "was ten cubits, nine cubits, eight cubits, or down to seven cubits." 20 For the close similarity between the versions in Numbers and Deuteronomy, see Alexander Rofe, Introduction Introduction to the Composition of the Pentateuch (Jerusalem: Academon, 1994) 99-100 (Heb.), and his conclusion, following a painstaking comparison, that the narrative in Deuteronomy precedes that in Numbers; see also Licht, Book of Numbers, 211-12. 21 The traditional commentaries understood that in most instances, eres has the meaning of "bed" (although Rabbi Samuel ben Meir is of the opinion that this is the"cradle"of Og, that had remained there from when he was an infant! This idea was also raised in She'eilot u-Teshuvot ha-Ramaha-Rama mi-Pano, par. 3. Another view, however, maintains that eres means "fortress"; see Hizzekuni to Deut 3:11; Rabbi Isaac ben Judah Halevi, Pa'ane'ah Raza (Sefer Paneach Ruzu) [Warsaw: Alter, 1931] to Deut 3:11,394). Among the modern scholars who sought to view eres as a a basalt dolmen tomb, see Rabin,"Og,"251. For such dolmens, see Yehudah Ziv, "An Echo of the Ancient Ones in Nahal Gamla"Eretz ha-Golan 14 (1979) 14-17 (Heb.); see also Allan Millard, "King Og's Bed and Other Ancient Ironmongery," in Lyle Eslinger and Glen Taylor, eds., Ascribe to the Lord — Biblical and Other Studies in Memory of Peter C. Craigie, JSOT Supp. 67 (Sheffield:</page><page sequence="8">164 ADMIEL KOSMAN 8 were composed until the end of the third century, Og was perceived solely as a giant of completely realistic dimensions. One tannaitic tradition (Sifrei, Num. 101 [Hayyim S. Horovitz, ed., Siphre de'be Rab (Leipzig: n.p., 1917) p. 99]) also, in my opinion, clearly demonstrates that this exegete believed that Moses was even taller than Og: "Now Moses was a very modest man" [Num 12:3] — modest in his mind. You ask: modest in his mind, or modest in his body? Scripture teaches: "You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites" [Num 21:34]. He [Moses] bent over (ירד) upon Sihon and killed him, he [Moses] bent over (ירד) upon Og and killed him. According to this tannaitic midrash, Moses was of humble disposition, although his body was in no way humble, since his physical size and great strength enabled him to "descend" upon Sihon and Og and kill them.22 This is also indicated by Josephus' description of Og:23 Og himself had a stature and beauty such as few could boast; he was withal a man of a doughty arm, so that his exploits were on a par with his superior gifts of height and a handsome presence. Of his strength and stature they had evidence on capturing his bedstead in Rabatha, the cap ital of the Ammonite country: this was constructed of iron and was four cubits broad and double as much, with a cubit over, in length24 The Character of Og in the Amoraic Literature Two branches that are concerned with the character of Og can be identified in the amoraic traditions. One tradition, that also appears in midrashim by JSOT Press, 1988)481-92; Millard,"King Og's Bed — Fact or Fancy VBible Review 6/2(1990) 16-21,44. 22 The reference to Og in the Tosefta (Sabb. 17:19, Saul Lieberman, ed., Seder Moed [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1962] p. 84) as well indicates that the tannaim who maintain this do not recognize Og as a creature of monstrous proportions, since he is cited there as a simple example of a large person (cf. what is said regarding Og in b.cErub. 31a; 48a). 23 Ant. 4:98, H.St. J.Thackeray, trans. (LCL, 1930) 525. Philo does not mention Og at all, see Feld man's assumptions about that: Louis H. Feldman,"The Portrayal of Sihon and Og in Philo, Pseudo-Philo and Josephus,"//S 53 (2002) 267. 24 Rabin,"Og,"251 n. 6 questions this: Why did the Israelites need this bedstead,"for they could have seen his body when he fell in battle." If, however, we explain that the "they" in Josephus "who had evidence"refers to those who lived in later times, Josephus' statement poses no difficulty. It should be noted, however, regarding the biblical text itself, that this wording provides a proof against the traditional conception of Mosaic authorship, that at least this part of the book of Deuteronomy was not written in the time of Moses, for in that period there was no need to bring an "archaeological" proof for Og's dimensions. It is plausible, therefore, that this</page><page sequence="9">9 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 165 Palestinian amoraim,25 "lengthens" Og, not necessarily in terms of his physical size, but as regards his outstanding longevity. This tradition places Og in an early period, and connects him with the pri meval Rephaim who are mentioned in Gen 14:5, in the context of Abraham's war with the kings, for even the verse in Deut 3:11 asserts that Og "was left of the remaining Rephaim." The time connection in this tradition seeks to be even more precise, and identifies the precise time when Og appears in the biblical narrative in Genesis. Since the exegete maintains that Og is "the fugi tive [ha-palit]"26 mentioned in Gen 14:13, who came to tell Abraham that his nephew Lot had been taken captive by Amraphel and his allies ("A fugitive brought the news to Abraham the Hebrew..."), the time frame is even more precisely defined, and patently occurred on Pesah. Why? Because the exegete associatively connects his name,"Og," with the "cakes [ugof]"27that, as he under stands it, in a second associative leap, Abraham had Sarai bake as the matzot ofPesah (the "unleavened cakes"of Ex 12:39): "A fugitive brought the news..." — R. Simeon ben Lakish, in the name of Bar Kappara: This is Og, and why was he named Og? For he came and found Abraham sitting and engaged with unleavened cakes. He did not have pure intentions, but rather said,"This Abraham is jealous. Now I say to him that Lot has been taken captive, he will go forth to war and be killed, and I will take Sarai." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Your life, the reward for the steps that you take [to Abraham] is that you will live long in the world. And for your thought to kill the righteous one, you will see a thousand thousands of his descendants, and it will be your end to fall to the hands of his descendants, [as it is said,] "But the Lord said to Moses, 'Do not fear him, for I give him [... ] into your hand'" [Num 21:34].28 was written in a later period, by those who never saw the "other Rephaim."See Rofe, Compo sitionsition of the Pentateuch, 12. For the Islamic adaption of this talmudic haggadic tradition, see Moshe Sokolow,"Goliath and Og in Midrash and Hadith"Sefunot 16 (1980) 55 (Heb.). 25 The midrash from Bereshit Rabbah cited below is by Resh Lakish in the name of Bar Kappara, a Land of Israel sage (the son of the Tanna Rabbi Eleazer ha-Kappar) who lived in the transit ional period between the time of the tannaim and that of the amoraim. 26 Although the definite article heh in the Bible itself usually is indicative of previously mentioned matters or people, the Rabbis frequently regarded it as an allusion to what the Bible would later relate. See Yitzhak (Isaac) Heinemann, Darkhei ha-Aggadah (The Methodology of the Hagga dah)dah) (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1954) 117 (Heb.). For the linkage between different characters in the midrashic literature, see Jacob Elbaum,"Rhetoric, Motif and Subject-Matter — Toward an Analysis of Narrative Technique in Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Folklore 13-14 (1991-1992) 121-22 and n.49 (Heb.); see also 120-21 and nn. 47-48 for the midrashic linkage between events mentioned in the Bible. 27 For the etymology of the name "Og,"see Rabin,"Og,"251-54; for the Hebrew ugah, see Rabin, n.27. 28 Bereshit Rabbah 41(425:13 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., pp. 413-14). It should be noted regarding</page><page sequence="10">166 ADMIEL KOSMAN 10 This midrash also incidentally ties a hidden cunning plot to the announcement by the "fugitive." The exegete assumes that Og had designs on the beautiful Sarai, and therefore is interested in inciting Abraham to go forth to war, so that he will be killed, thus enabling Og to marry the new widow. Thus this Land of Israel haggadah fashions an intriguing literary structure: according to this midrash, the "fugitive" (palit) wants to turn Sarai into a "peleitah" [i.e., a "remnant" from Abrahams possessions] like himself, so that he can take her for himself! The "fugitive" therefore plots to take advantage of Abraham's innocence and moral integrity in order to win the latter's wife; accordingly, the "fugitive" himself is the "jealous one," and not Abraham, who sets forth to rescue Lot. Continuing this exegetical line, a baraita in b.Nid. (61a) presents, in the name of of R. Johanan, a midrash29 that identifies our "fugitive" with an earlier period; according to this, Og was the sole survivor of all the generation that perished in the Flood.30 the extant version that Saul Lieberman (ed.) assumed, in the edition of Devarim Rabbah based on MS Oxford 147 ([Jerusalem: Wharman Books, 1950] 32 n. 1), that the midrashim disagree on the question of whether Og's telling Abraham about the captivity of Lot was for altruistic purposes or not. I, however, am not convinced of the correctness of Lieberman's assumption, because the silence of several midrashic sources does not mean that they do not rely on that ancient idea, that Og did this in order to win Sarai. 29 This exposition concerning Og, as well, came from the circle of Tiberian sages composed of Rabbi Johanan and his pupils (see above, n. 25, and below, nn. 31,32; it should be noted that the discussion in b.Zebah. 113b [see n.30, below] incidentally indicates that the discussants were aware of the haggadah of Og being a refugee from the Flood generation, and the discussion there centers around the dicta of Rabbi Johanan and Resh Lekish from Tiberias). For this circle and the place occupied by the study of haggadah in it, see Wilhelm Bacher, Die Agada der palaestinensischenpalaestinensischen Amoraer (3 vols.; Strassburg: Truebner, 1892) 1:vii-18,esp. 17-18. An additional comment by Rabbi Johanan (b.Nid. 61a),"From the answer that was given to that righteous man, you may understand what was in his mind," is attributed to Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai (fourth generation Tanna), but we possess no other tangible tannaitic testimony for such an early tradition besides this attribution in the Babylonian Talmud; see n. 37, below. Devarim Rabbah,Rabbah, Lieberman, ed., Devarim, par. 29 (pp. 31-32) also ascribes the two traditions concerned with Og to Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish; it should be stressed, however, that we do not see from the two that Og was perceived as a figure of nonrealistic physical size (the second tradition, that maintains that"Og king of Bashan was disfigured" is only of the opinion that his physical dimensions were not proportional). 30 See Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen 14:13:"1hen came Og, who had escaped from among the giants who died in the Flood" (Michael Maher, trans., Targum Pseudo-Jonathan: Genesis [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1992], and Avigdor Shinan, The Embroidered Targum: The Haggadah in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan Pseudo-Jonathan of the Pentateuch [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1992] [Heb.] nn. 32, 34, below). The term Palit, "the fugitive" that in a certain phase was applied to Og may have been responsible for the associative birth of the exegesis in Pseudo-Jonathan in regard to Og, since we have found the term peletah used in reference to the survivors of the Flood. Thus, for example, Be reshit Rabbah 38 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., p. 355) states: "rather, the Flood generation were</page><page sequence="11">11 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 167 This position, that is first presented in Babylonia, albeit in the name of a Land of Israel sage, seems in my opinion to be a turning point in the history of the exegeses of the character of Og, since the presentation of this exegetical direction created an opening for future exegetes to view Og as a character of monstrous proportions. There is a simple reason for this: if we regard Og to be a fugitive who survived from the Flood generation, then it is plausible that it was his height (the only characteristic of his of which we know from the written sources) that saved him. If this was the case, then his height had to be completely imaginary, since he had to be taller than the highest moun tains, that were covered by water during the Flood (Gen 7:20-21).31 In another Babylonian Talmud passage we can identify a haggadah that also could constitute a basis for this exegetical turning point (see below) that enlarged Og to gargantuan dimensions. The discussion in b.Nid. 61a contains a tradition that Sihon and Og were the sons of Ahijah son of Shamhazai.32 totally immersed in robbery [... ] and therefore no remnant [peleitah] was left of them"; and similarly in other sources. This is connected to the attributional statement in b.Nid. 61a: "This is Og, who escaped the fate [she-palat] of the Flood generation."According to those engaged in the discussion in b.Zebah. 113a-b, the Amoraim of the Land of Israel disagreed as to how Og was saved: Resh Lakish was of the opinion that Og was tied to the Ark and was thereby saved (see the following note), while, according to Rabbi Johanan, Og survived because he stayed in the Land of Israel, that was unscathed by the Flood. 3r It should be emphasized, counter to this, that from the systematic, fundamental aspect, this assumption does not necessarily require our stating that Og was an imaginary giant. Thus, for example, Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23 asserts that Og was saved because he "sat down on a rung of (one of) the ladders of the ark. He swore to Noah and to his sons that he would be their servant for ever. What did Noah do? He bored an aperture in the ark, and he put (through it) his food daily for him" (Gerald Friedlander trans., Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer [New York:Hermon Press, 1965] 167). But see Rashi to fe.Zebali. 113b, q.v."Afes" ("Because of his height he did not drown like the re^m [wild-ox]"; for the boiling waters of the Flood mentioned there, see Shinan, The Embroidered Targum, 141); Rabbi David Luria, in his commentary on Pirkei Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer (Warsaw: Bamberg Press, 1852) 113b, par. 29; Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews Jews (1925) 5:181 n.35: that according to many other midrashic versions, Og was saved by his height; some went so far as to say that the water only came up to his ankle! Thus, too, in the Islamic legendary tradition; see Sokolow,"Goliath and'Og,"'53. It should be realized that we cannot offer any source that states that, according to Palestinian Amoraim from the circle of Rabbi Johanan, Og is explicitly depicted as monstrous; we have shown in clear fashion only his longevity, and his being from the generation of Abraham, or even that of the Flood. It is noteworthy, however, that one midrashic source (Midrash Tehillim 136:12) preserves such an opinion, in the name of Rabbi Johanan, although it is difficult to de termine if it is reliable on this point. Midrash Tehillim 136:12 (see also Devarim Rabbah 1:29) states that, according to Rabbi Johanan, Og's legs alone extended a length of eighteen cubits. 32 For the identification of Sihon and Og as brothers and the problem created by this identifi cation, see Tosafot Nid. 61a, q.\."Zeh Og." As regards the background of this tradition concerning the lineage of Og: we already com mented above, at the beginning of the article, regarding the statement in Gen 6:4:"It was then,</page><page sequence="12">168 ADMIEL KOSMAN 12 The Talmud explains that even though Sihon was a giant like Og, Moses did not fear him, because his physical size did not daunt Moses; however, Moses did fear Og possibly because "the merit of our father Abraham will stand for him" and protect him (the intent being to the good deed that was to his merit, namely, according to the above midrash, his being the "fugitive" who informed Abraham of the captivity of Lot). At this phase of our discussion we can address the primary sources that quite clearly portray Og as a monster of fantastic size, these are Babylonian amoraic sources. Thus, b.Ber. 54b depicts the encounter between Og and the Children of Israel:33 and later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth — when the sons of God cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore them offspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown." Various haggadic tales were woven around this mysterious verse (see above, at n. 1).The names Shamhazai and Azael appear in 1 Enoch 6:7. For Shamhazai in the traditional sources, see Rashi on Num 13:33, who presents this tradition, according to which "Anakites, who were the descendants of Shamhazai and Azael, who fell from Heaven in the generation of Enosh"; see YalkutYalkut Shimoni on the Torah, Genesis, par. 44, that these angels were corrupted with the daugh ters of men who were beautiful; see also Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (1913) 1:124, and notes. This midrashic development as well might possibly tend to assume that Og was an imaginary creature. 1 Enoch 7:2 states that those women bore these angels "great giants whose heights were three hundred cubits" (E. Isaac, trans., in Charlesworth, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, 16). Incidentally, it was even further related that this Shamhazai engaged in illicit relations with the wife of Ham, and she became pregnant from this liaison. In order to conceal this, Ham had to engage in relations with his wife in the Ark, so that it would be thought that he was the father of the child; see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (1925) 5:183 n. 54. For the licentious behav ior of these angels, and their illegitimate children, see also Zohar, Midrash ha-Ne^lam, Vayere 117b-118a, and see below, n. 49, for the identification of Nimrod with the Nephilim, and see also Ephraim E. Urbach, The Sages, Israel Abrams, trans. (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1975) 177 and the discussion of Dimant, Fallen Angels, pp. 175-182. It therefore could cautiously be proposed that the amoraic haggadot treating Og as a mythical giant have their beginnings in an external, inward-directed penetration, into the beitbeit midrash (study hall), of haggadic material that originated in apocryphal works that related that Og was a descendant of the angels who had relations with the daughters of men. For the traditions that entered the rabbinic literature in a later period and that have their basis in the Apocrypha, see the comment by Menahem Kister, Studies in Avot de-Rabbi Nathan: Text,Text, Redaction and Interpretation (Jerusalem: Hebrew Univ.-Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 1998) 177 n. 301 (Heb.). Following what I wrote above, n. 29, this could also be connected with what is known to us from other sources that the Tiberian beit midrash of Rabbi Johanan had a certain knowledge of the views to be found in the Apocrypha. See Menachem Elon, Jewish Law:Law: History, Sources, Principles (Philadelphia - Jerusalem: Jewish Publication Society, 1994) 103335־• For a possible connection between those haggadic sources and the Manichaean Book of of Giants (a group of Aramaic fragments from Qumran also referred to by the researchers as the "Book of Giants") see John C. Reeves, "Giants, Book of," in Lawrence H. Schiffman and James C. Vanderkam, eds., Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls (2 vols.; Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2000) 1:309-11. 33 This is the interpretation of the baraita cited in b.Ber. 54a. It should be stressed, however, that it has no parallel in the tannaitic literature, as it has come down to us, nor in the Palestinian Talmud.</page><page sequence="13">13 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 169 He [Og] asked: How large is the camp of Israel? Three parasangs. I will uproot a mountain the size of three parasangs and I will cast it upon them and kill them. He went and uprooted a mountain the size of three para sangs and placed it on his head. But the Holy One, blessed be He, sent locusts who bore through the mountain, and it fell on his neck. He wanted to pull it over his head, but his teeth protruded on each side, and he could not remove it. This is the meaning of what is said," You break the teeth of the wicked" [Ps 3:8], and as Resh Lakish expounded, for R. Simeon ben Lakish said: What is the meaning of what is written: "You break [shibar tah]tah] the teeth of the wicked"? Do not read "shibartah" but "shirbabtah [You have lengthened]." How much was [the height of ] Moses? Ten cubits (aprox. 15 ft.). He took an ax ten cubits long, jumped ten cubits into the air, struck him on his ankle, and killed him.34 Interestingly, these babylonian traditions, perhaps specifically because of their questionable authenticity, repeatedly stress the fact that they were received from an early tradition. Thus, in the fantastic story from b.Nid. 54b cited above, it is emphasized at the beginning of this tradition that "this has been handed down by tradition,"35 and so this tradition is afforded standing in a seemingly 34 For this story and its versions, see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (1928) 6:120 n. 695; Shinan, The The Embroidered Targum, 172 (and for a similar mountain that served as a weapon in battle, see 139 and n.190). For the measure of three parasangs specified here, see Rashi, q.v."Mahaneh Yisrael','Yisrael',' that refers to the dictum by Rabbah bar Bar Hana in b.cErub. 55a. According to this, it would seem that we could conceive of the intriguing possibility of some connection between the exaggerations of Rabbah bar Bar Hana cited there and the source of our hyperbolic nar rative (see below, n. 52). It should also be noted that the lack of clarity concerning what happened to Og with that mountain and the protrusion of his teeth could be somewhat resolved by the version of Pseudo-Jonathan on Num 21:35, that explains that that creeping thing bored through the mountain, and then Og's head fell into it, and he could not extract it because of his protruding teeth. See also Shinan, The Embroidered Targum, 172 (incidentally, the version in the Babylo nian Talmud speaks of locusts, while Pseudo-Jonathan mentions a caterpillar. The version pos sessed by the Spanish apostate Petrus Alfonsi, however, speaks of a small bird. See below, n. 67). Another possibility for relating what happened there appears in Midrash Temurah, included in Adolf (Aaron) Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (2 vols.; Jerusalem: Bamberger 8! Wahrmann, 1938) 2:112, in the wording:'"A time for throwing'— corresponding to 'Ogking of Bashan' [Ps 135:11] — the Holy One, blessed be He, threw that mountain that he had placed on his head in order to throw upon Israel; it was thrown on his neck and divided [ve-nehelak]" (perhaps the intent is that the mountain split, and in that manner fell on Og's neck; or perhaps it should read: ve-nehnak— ve-nehnak— he was choked?). 3535 "Gemara gemiri lah"■, for gemiri and gemara as an expression for transmission by tradition, see Wilhelm Bacher, Die Exegetische Terminologie der Jüdischen Traditionsliteratur, 2, Die Bibel-und traditionsexegetische traditionsexegetische Terminologie der Amoräer (Leipig: Hinrichs, 1905) 29; Chanokh Albeck, Introduction to the Talmud, Babli and Yerushalmi (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1969) 4-7, 599-601 (Heb.).</page><page sequence="14">170 ADMIEL KOSMAN 14 babylonian baraitaf6 since it is extant only in the babylonian tradition, but it nevertheless also left its imprint upon the halakhic system, and not only in the haggadah: Our masters taught: If one sees the place of the crossing of the Red Sea, the fords of the Jordan, the fords of the streams of Arnon, hailstones in the Beth-horon descent, the stones that Og king of Bashan wanted to throw at Israel, the stone on which Moses sat when Joshua waged war with Amalek, Lots wife, or the wall of Jericho that was swallowed by the ground — for all of these he must give thanksgiving and praise to the Omnipresent (b.Ber.(b.Ber. 54a; see Shulhan Arukh, Orah Hayyim 218:1). Additionally, b.Nid. 24b presents the following amazing tale in the name of the Tanna Abba Saul:37 It was taught: Abba Saul said (or, some say, R.Johanan said), "I was a gravedigger. Once I was running after a deer, and I entered the thighbone of a corpse, I ran after it for three parasangs, but I did not reach the deer, nor did I come to the end of the thighbone. When I returned, I was told that this was [the thighbone] of Og king of Bashan."38 36 For seeming baraitot in the Talmud, see Louis Jacobs,"Are There Fictitious Baraitot in the Babylonian Talmud," HUCA 42 (1971) 185-96; Bejamin De-Vries,"Baraita, Beraitot,"£/4 (Jeru salem, 1971) cols. 189-93. 37 There as well, however, there are voices attributing this tradition to the Amora Rabbi Johanan. Abba Saul was a third-fourth generation Tanna, the young pupil of Rabbi Akiva. At this juncture we should add a cautionary note that the manner in which I choose to present this is nothing more than conjecture, one that in my opinion is plausible, and a case could certainly be made for the babylonian attribution of the early sources of these traditions. Those disagreeing with me could join to these two references the tradition of the stone that was cast by Og, that is brought in the Babylonian Talmud as a baraita, and the tradition transmitted in the name of Rabbi Johanan in the name of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai, that identifies the"fugitive"with Og (above, n. 29), in an attempt to argue against my hypothesis that the haggadah relating to Og's legendary height had already developed in the time of the tannaim. I, however, elected to present this in such a manner because I do not regard these babylonian attributions to be certain, and they are challenged by the fact that those traditions are not attributed to tannaim in the literature of Land of Israel haggadot, and the explicit midrash cited above concerning the modesty of Moses proves that the exegete-tanna did not maintain such a view, at least not according to what appears in Sifrei, Numbers. 38 Incidentally, it is related there, regarding the dimensions of Abba Saul himself: "And, perhaps, you would say that Abba Saul was a dwarf? Abba Saul was the tallest person in his generation, and Rabbi Tarfon reached to his shoulder; Rabbi Tarfon was the tallest person in his genera tion, and Rabbi Meir reached to his shoulder; Rabbi Meir was the tallest person in his gener ation, and Rabbi [Judah ha-Nasi] reached to his shoulder; Rabbi was the tallest person in his generation, and Rabbi Hiyya reached to his shoulder; Rabbi Hiyya was the tallest person in</page><page sequence="15">15 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 171 It is noteworthy that, parallel to all these traditions appearing in the Babylonian Talmud, Targum Onkelos on Deut 3:11 contains an allusion to a conception that enlarges Og. Onkelos renders the words "and four cubits wide, by a mans fore arm [amah, either: 'forearm'or cubit']"as "ve-arba amin putiyeh be-amat melakh," that is, according to this Og's height is to be measured by "amat melekh [the cubit/forearm of the king]," perhaps intending to Og himself, as appears in Pseudo-Jonathan Pseudo-Jonathan on this verse: "be-amta de-garmayh [by his amah]!'39 In Tractate Soferim, which might possibly be a bit later than the time of the redaction of the Talmud,40 we find an additional development that comes from the babylonian direction of these traditions appears. This tradition connects Abraham and Og:41 Og is Eliezer,42 and the feet of the Patriarch Abraham would fit in his palm43 One time the latter rebuked him, and, due to his fear, one of his teeth fell. The Patriarch Abraham took it, and made beds of ivory from it, and he would sleep there. Some said, he made of it a chair, in which he sat all the days of his life. And who gave him [i.e., Og] to Abraham? Nimrod. Og went and built sixty towns, the smallest of which was sixty mil high, as it is said: "sixty towns, the whole district of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan" [Deut 3:4]. And what did he eat? Sixty oxen, and every species of beast. And what did he drink? One thousand measures. And what was a drop of his semen? Thirty-six litres his generation, and Rav reached to his shoulder; Rav was the tallest person in his generation, and Rav Judah reached to his shoulder; Rav Judah was the tallest person in his generation, and his attendant Adda reached to his shoulder."See Krauss,"Heroes and Giants in Israel,"291-93. 39 See Shinan,771e Embroidered Targum, 144 and n. 224. Rashi cites this interpretation in his com mentary on Deut 3:11:'"A man's forearm'— Og's forearm."See the discussion of this point in the supercommentaries on Rashi (Rabbi Elijah Mizrahi; Siftei Khakhamim; Gur Aryeh) and Nahmanides on the verse. It is a distinct possibility that the extant Targum Onkelos was influ enced by the Babylonian amoraic sources, see Avigdor Shinan, The Biblical Story as Reflected in in Its Aramaic Translations (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1993) 38-40 (Heb.); for the late dating of the redaction of Pseudo-Jonathan to the eighth century, see Shinan, The Embroidered Targum,Targum, 198 and the entire chapter (193-204). 40 See Michael Higger, ed., Masekhet Soferim (New York: Devei-Rabbanan, 1937) 78-81. 41 Tractate Soferim, Hosafah 1,1:2,366-67. For more on the midrashic connection between Abra ham and Og, see Bereshit Rabbah 53:8 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., 565), for the provocative presence of Og at the banquet that Abraham held on the day that Isaac was weaned; Kohe let let Rabbah 7: "Og went to the banquet of Abraham...." 42 Interestingly, Rabbeinu Bahya notes in his commentary on the Torah (Charles B. Chavel, ed. [2 vols.; Jerusalem: Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1974] 3:159-60) that some sought to understand this dictum not in accordance with its simple meaning, taking pains to explain that the intent here is merely to state that Og was descended from Eliezer, but Rabbeinu Bahya does not agree with this understanding. 43 I could not understand this sentence, and the editor, Dr. Michael Higger, did not explain this</page><page sequence="16">172 ADMIEL KOSMAN 16 The connection between Og and Eliezer, Abrahams servant, gave birth, on the one hand, to interesting developments in the late haggadah, but also, on the other hand, left the interpreters of the haggadah with several difficult problems of har monization between these various haggadic figures. Thus, for example, Pirkei de-Rabbi de-Rabbi Eliezer44 relates that Abraham warned Isaac concerning the behavior of the servant Eliezer, since he feared lest Eliezer have relations with Rebekah on the way; Isaac consequently examined Rebekah's virginity immediately upon her arrival, to see that her hymen was intact, and only then did he marry her. The midrash states of Eliezer: The steward of Abraham's household was his servant Eliezer, and whence was his servant? When (Abraham) went forth from Ur of the Chaldees all the magnates of the kingdom came to give him gifts; and Nimrod took his first-born (son) Eliezer and gave him to (Abraham) as a perpetual slave. When (Eliezer had thus) dealt kindly with Isaac, he set him free, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him his reward in this world, so that there should not be a reward for the wicked in the world to come; and He raised him to kingship, and he is Og, king of Bashan. We learn from this formulation of the haggadah that the linkage between the character of Eliezer and that of Og led, on the one hand, to the enhancement of Og's merits, since he now boasted the special merit of having served Abraham in the past, and even that of being the emissary guided by the Lord on his search for the intended wife for Isaac, to the house of Bethuel, the father of Rebekah;45 while, on the other hand, this tie led to the shaming of Eliezer, since we now understand, inter alia, that Eliezer had been suspected by his master of licentious sexual behavior.46 vague point. The version in Yalkut Shimoni 765 is:"Og is Eliezer, his foot was forty mil, and Abraham would place it in his hand." Does this midrash mean to say that Abraham was a giant, so many times as large as Og that the latter could put his huge feet in Abraham's hand? This understanding is puzzling, because the continuation of our text asserts that Abraham slept in a bed that he made from a tooth that fell from Og's mouth! The version that appears, however, in Mahzor Vitry (par. 524) proves that this is how the midrash was understood: "The man who was larger than the Anakites was Abraham. [... ] For his height was as that of seventy-four men. And his eating and drinking, correspondingly so, like a total of seventy-four men. And his strength was certainly so." 44 Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chap.16, pp.110-12; and see Yalkut Shimoni, Hayyei Sarah 109. 45 Yalkut Reuveni (by Rabbi Abraham Reuben ha-Kohen Sofer, Poland, seventeenth century), HukatHukat 39, expressly mentions this merit of Og: "For he benefited the Patriarch Isaac by bringing him Rebekah." 46 From the viewpoint of the exegetical methodology of the midrash, we have before us the com mon mechanism of the identification of two biblical characters, events, or places. See Elbaum, "Rhetoric, Motif and Subject-Matter," 120 nn. 47-49. It should also be noted in regard to this</page><page sequence="17">17 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 173 According, however, to this midrashic expansion, the different associative directions taken by the exegetes already lead to a striking contradiction:47 Abrahams servant Eliezer is mentioned in the midrashim as entering Paradise together with Abraham, and according to one view, Eliezer did not die, and merited entering Paradise together with his master while alive48— so how could it be asserted that Eliezer, who is described in many midrashim as so very righteous,49 is Og king of Bashan?50 The Og Narrative in the Medieval Jewish Commentary Obviously, the haggadic character of Og, as set forth in the above midrashim, could have caused great discomfort to the interpreters of the Talmud and hag gadah in the medieval period. These legends seem childish and baseless,51 midrashic technique the great similarity it bears to the"Verdichtung' (condensation) in dream language of which Sigmund Freud speaks. For the similarity between the workings of dreams and the methodology of midrashic interpretation, see Maren Niehoff,"Associative Thinking in the Midrash Exemplified by the rabbinic Interpretation of the Journey of Abraham and Sarah to Egypt," Tarbiz 62 (1993) 339-59 (Heb.), and see my comments on this in my article: "More on Associative Thinking in the Midrash," Tarbiz 63 (1994) 443-50 (Heb.). 47 As was already noted by Rabbi David Luria, Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 16,38b, par. 53. 48 See the relevant narrative in b.Bat. 58a; this was stated explicitly in Tractate Derekh Eretz 1:18 (Michael Higger, ed., The Treatise Derek Erez [New York: Debe Rabanan 1935] 69); and in Midrash Aggadah on the Pentateuch edited by Solomon Buber (Vienna: n.p., 1894) on Gen 24:64, p. 60. See Daniel Sperber, ed., Masechet derech Eretz Zutta (Jerusalem: Tzur-Ot Press, 1982)95-96 (Heb.), with references to additional parallels. 49 Bereshit Rabbah 60:31 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., p. 647) states that Eliezer's face resembled that of Abraham, and therefore was called "Blessed of the Lord"; in b.Yoma 28b he is depicted as an elder who was seated at the scholar's council. Also see Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah, Hayyei Sarah Sarah 109. Incidentally, the Og-Eliezer identification might have given rise to the tradition that maintained that Eliezer was the son of Nimrod. See Shinan, The Embroidered Targum, 163 n. 340. For the connection in the haggadah between Nimrod and the Nephilim, see Ginzberg, Legends Legends of the Jews (1925) 5:201-2 n. 88. For the sources identifying the father of Eliezer with Ham, the son of Noah, see Ch. Merchavia, The Church versus Talmudic and Midrashic Liter ature [500-1248]ature [500-1248]ature [500-1248] (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1970)144 n.69 (Heb.). 50 In order to resolve this difficult problem, that led the exegetical imagination ad absurdum, Rabbi David Luria (above, n.47) finally proposes a response that appears in the writings of various commentators, that there were "two Ogs" (!). But here, too, we find ourselves stymied, as Luria himself attests in his commentary, because "From the midrashim [... ] it is understood that the Og who was killed by Moses is the one who was Eliezer the servant of Abraham, and therefore Moses feared him." 51 "This teaching is foreign and distant, difficult to conceive, greatly confusing" (Hiddushei ha GeonimGeonim on Ein Yaakov,Berakhot 54a, q.v. "Even"). See below, in the discussion of the commen tary by Rashba, concerning the confusion strewn by this haggadah.</page><page sequence="18">174 ADMIEL KOSMAN 18 forcing many sages to engage in the "holy work"of the symbolic interpretation of these haggadot, in order to "redeem" them from their fantastic context.52 This body of interpretation, as we shall see, not only served the needs of those within the Jewish community who found these haggadot difficult, it also pro vided defense for Jewish positions in polemics with Christians concerning the standing of the Talmud. Along the winding path that we follow in wake of the character of Og in the Jewish literature, we find that those commentators occupied in discovering the simple meaning of the biblical texts restored the biblical Og to human size, while those engaged in allegory explained the imag inary haggadot about Og in the Babylonian Talmud as somehow symbolizing lofty and highly significant spiritual matters.53 The limiting scope of this article does not permit detailed presentation of the many and varied commentaries and homilies that were proposed for the war of Moses and Og. I will, therefore, just set forth, in very concentrated form, the key approaches. One direction present in the medieval commentary sought to emphasize that the haggadot in the Talmud are not to be accepted as an authoritative inter pretation for what is described in the Bible. Thus, for example, Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra (1089-1164) teaches us in his commentary on the Torah (Deut 3:11) that we are to understand in literal fashion the biblical report of the size of Og s bed, that Og was twice as tall as a normal person, and no more. To this end he attacks the interpretation offered by Targutn Onkelos, that the "arnat ish" specified in Deut 3:11 in regard to the length of Og's bed means "the cubit of the king," a cubit that is not the usual unit of measure. Ibn Ezra states, in oppo sition to this view: 52 For general discussions of hyperbolic tales in the rabbinic literature, see M.B. Lerner,"Exag geration by the Rabbis ,"Mahanayim 69 (1963) 68-73 (Heb,); Dina Stein,"Believing Is Seeing: A Reading of Baba Batra 73a-75b," Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature 17 (1999) 9-32 (Heb.). 53 For the symbolic interpretation of the haggadah that began in the Geonic period, see Yonah Frankel, Darkei ha-Aggadah ve-ha-Midrash (The Ways of the Haggadah and the Midrash) (2 vols.; Givatayim: Masada, 1991) 2:501-31 (Heb.), who surveys the development of this interpre tive tradition. Note should be made of the position taken by Maimonides, that served as a central milestone that influenced many medieval commentators: he was of the opinion that whoever understood the haggadah literally, when this does not meet the rational test of seeing the reality, is one of the fools who cause the honor of the sages and that of the Torah to be sullied (see Maimonides, Commentary on the Mishnah, introduction to chapter Helek of Sanhedrin [chap. 10], Rabbi Yosef Kafah, ed.

It is not possible that this could be in accordance with his [Og's] forearm, for what, then, would Scripture come to teach? Moreover, he would not be (in the form of) a human being at all! This was also explained clearly and at length by Maimonides (1135-1204) in his Guide for Guide for the Perplexed (2:47) :54 However, what the Torah literally states about Og does not belong to this group: "Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead feres] of iron, and so on." For ceres is bed: "Also our bed farsenu] is verdant" [Song 1:16]. Now a man's bed is not exactly his size, for it is not a garment, which one puts on. The bed is rather always bigger than the individual who sleeps on it. And the usual and well-known thing is for it to be longer than the individual by a third of his length. If the length of the bed in question came to nine cubits, the length of him who slept on it must, according to the usual pro portion of beds, have come to six cubits or a little more. And its dictum, "after the cubit of a man," means according to the cubit of an individual from among ourselves — I mean to say from among the rest of men — and not according to the cubit of Og. For all individuals have mostly propor tionate members; accordingly it says that the length of Og was twice that of other men or a little more. This is doubtless anomalous for the individuals of the species, but is by no means impossible.55 That is to say, these commentators emphasize that, according to the simple meaning of the biblical text, all the imaginary exaggerations in the Talmud are not to be accepted. Og's size was approximately twice that of a normal person. This special height is mentioned in the tradition in Deuteronomy with a great deal of amazement, with testimony of this extraordinary size surviving in the iron bed of Og that remained in Rabbah of the Ammonites. How, then, are we to understand the incredible tale in the Talmud concerning his tremendous size? Is it to be curtly discarded as being unsuitable for an intel ligent person? Most of the medieval commentators are of an allegorical bent. They assume that we are to view Og's strength and his "giant size" as a symbol of another power, not necessarily physical, as we would imagine when we read the 54 Shlomo Pines, trans., The Guide of the Perplexed (Chicago and London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1963)407-8. 55 See Rabin,"Og,"254 n.44, that refers to the estimation by archaeologists that the average height of the inhabitants of the Land of Israel in the prehistoric period was approximately 1.50 meters.</page><page sequence="20">176 ADMIEL KOSMAN 20 biblical story according to its literal meaning.56 Thus, in the later commentaries, even if this is only implicit, and is not stated explicitly, this war is transformed from an earthly-historical war, as it appears in the Bible, into a mythical contest in the realms hidden from the eye. Prominent milestones in the interpretive tradition of this medieval symbolic reading that are deserving of our attention are two outstanding commentaries that influenced the later interpretations of this legend, one esoteric and kab balistic, and the other allegoric. The first is an exposition in the Zohar (Hukat 3:184[a]): "But the Lord said to Moses, 'Do not fear him [oto]'" [Num 21:34] — there are two instances of the whole [word] "oto" [i.e., with plene spelling], with two vav's.vav's. This is one, and the other is "until your fellow claims it [ofo]" [Deut 22:2].57 What is the meaning? That these are an actual of [sign]. "Until your fellow claims" [... ] This is how the of of that lost article is to be under stood. Here, too,"ofo" is Og, who adhered to Abraham, and was a member of the latters household. It was decreed [that he be] with him, and [because of this, Og] accepted upon himself the holy sign [i.e, of circumcision].58 56 Exceptional and relatively late is the commentary by Maharal (Judah Loew ben Bezalel, ca. 1525-1609; On him as a commentator of the haggadah see Jacob Elbaum, Openness and In sularitysularity (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1990) 105-118 [Heb.]) in Hiddushei Haggadot on b.Nid. 24b, who interprets in symbolic fashion the talmudic haggadic Og narrative, while repeatedly stressing that "all of his [Og's] strength was material, and similarly the strength to which he adhered, while the strength of Israel is separated from the material, because they adhere to Him, may He be blessed. Consequently, Og was distinguished by a quality that is [solely] material, namely, the expansion of which the material is capable." In another place, however, Maharal himself sets forth the position that was more widespread among the commentators. And so he states in his supercommentary Gur Aryeh on Rashi, Gen 14:13, that according to the talmudic tradi tion that "they [Og and Sihon] survived the Flood [and] that they were among the descen dants of Shamhazai [...] and he possessed an especially divine quality. [Consequently,] it was not fitting, considering his own nature, to die from the water, but rather by the hand of Moses, the man of God, who bested him by force of his divine attribute, since the water was on a lesser level, and was not intrinsically suitable to nullify the power of Og." See also Maharal's commentary in Gur Aryeh on Num 21:35. As regards additional commentaries on this haggadah, the reader is referred to the commen taries published in Ein Yaakov on the haggadic text in b.Ber. 54b, and the detailed list of com mentators who related to it in this text that was compiled by Zechariah Porto in the book Asaf ha-Mazkirha-Mazkir (Venice, 1680) 38a, 299b. 57 In both instances oto (אתו) appears in our Sifrei Torah today with defective spelling, but see KennicottKennicott Bible (Numbers, 322; Deuteronomy, 409) that mentions at least one manuscript in which both are written with plene spelling. 58 As explained in the commentary at the beginning of the exposition (in the part not quoted here), that is based on what is written in Gen 17:27: "and all his [Abraham's] household, his homeborn slaves and those that had been bought from outsiders, were circumcised with him."</page><page sequence="21">21 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 177 When Og saw that Israel were approaching him, he said: "I certainly shall be first with my merit, and this [the merit] I shall place opposite them." At that time Moses feared, how could [he] uproot the sign that Abraham had impressed on him. He said [to himself]: Undoubtedly his [Moses'] right[-hand]59 died, for the right is supposed to be victorious over him. The Holy One, blessed be He, immediately said: "Do not fear oto" — do not fear that sign of his, and you will not need even the right- [hand]. "For I give him into your hand" — your left hand shall uproot him from the world, since he tarnished his sign, and whoever tarnishes that sign deserves to be uprooted from the world, and certainly your left hand, that is "your hand," will uproot him from the world. According to this exegetical orientation, Moses was apprehensive of some spiritual merit that the Divine accounting attributed to Og, a merit connected with the "sign" that was imprinted in him in the period that he was Abrahams servant (i.e., the merit of circumcision). It should be recalled, once again, that we have already encountered, in the midrashmidrash from Gen. Rabbah 41(42):13, the essence of the idea that Og had accu mulated some "merits" in the past for good deeds that he had performed. That midrash midrash states that God promised Og, as recompense for his good deed in informing Abraham of Lot's being taken captive, that "Your life, the reward for the steps that you take is that you will live long in the world." The midrash in Num. Rabbah (19:32)60 connects this with Moses' fear of Og that is reported in the Bible (Num 21:34: "But the Lord said to Moses, 'Do not fear him'"), assum ing that even if Moses was not aware of Og's detailed history, he nevertheless understood that there was cause for his apprehension: When Moses came to do battle [with Og], he feared him, saying: "I am 120 years old, and this one is more than five hundred.61 If he did not have merit, he would not have lived all those years." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: "Do not fear him, for I give him [... ] into your hand" — with your hand kill him. As we have seen, over the course of time the various midrashim formulated several possible explanations for Moses' fear of Og due to some spiritual merits, 59 In his commentary Ha-Sulam to the Zohar, vol. 16, Hukat, p. 29, Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag argues that the Zohar alludes here to Aaron, Moses' brother. 60 For the late redaction of this midrash, see Hananel Mack,"Numbers Rabba: Its Date, Location and Circulation," TeDuda 11 (Studies in theAggadic Midrashim in Memory of Zvi Meir Rabinowitz) (Tel Aviv:Tel Aviv Univ. Press, 1996) 91-105 (Heb.). 61 For the different counts in the haggadah of the years of Og's life, see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (1928) 6:118-19 n. 684.</page><page sequence="22">178 ADMIEL KOSMAN 22 namely: the merit of the announcement that he transmitted to Abraham concerning Lot's fall into captivity; the merit of having served Abraham in the past; and the merit of his having been circumcised by Abraham. The second interpretation of the Og narrative that wielded considerable influ ence over the interpretations of later commentators is that of Rashba, Rabbi Solomon ben Adret of Barcelona (thirteenth century).62 It may be assumed that Rashba was quite disturbed by the alien nature of this haggadah, since it was frequently mentioned by Christians in their attacks on the irrational manner of thought of the talmudic legends. Rashba faced these attacks, and attempted to resolve the difficult aspects of the talmudic haggadot in a man ner that would be acceptable to the educated people of his time; according to one opinion, he even engaged in a face-to-face dispute with one of the lead ing opponents of the Talmud at the time, Raymond Martini.63 Our specific haggadic tale regarding Og was among the leading haggadot employed as a weapon by those Christian disputants who sought to impugn the Talmud. Testimony regarding this has come down to us in the words of Nicholas Donin in his debate with R. Jehiel of Paris.64 This haggadah is also cited, and presented as lacking all reason, by Petrus Alfonsi,65as it was similarly attacked by Petrus Venerabilis (Peter of Cluny)66 in the claims he raised against the Talmud. Alfonsi makes the following calculation: by a rough estimation it may be learned from this narrative that Og's head was ten cubits; accordingly, that hagavhagav (locust)67 had to penetrate ten cubits so that the mountain could land on Og's neck! How, then, was this possible? 62 The commentary by Rashba appears in Ein Yaakov on Berakhot 54b, q.v. "Akar Tura." Rashba was a rabbi and posek (decisor of Jewish law) in his city, Barcelona, and wrote collections of novellae on the Talmud and many legal responsa. For Rashba as haggadic interpreter, see Carmi Y.Horowitz,"Kabbalah and Philosophy in Rashba's Commentary to the Aggadah,"Daaf 18 (1987) 15-25 (Heb.); Leon A.

Following the dispute with Rabbi Jehiel, the Talmud was burnt, apparently in 1242.

We can understand from this that this haggadah greatly troubled Rashba, also be cause of the fact (that we shall clarify) that he completely rejects the simple meaning of the textual stratum in b.Ber. 54b. This interpretive method, that of the extreme rejection of the literal meaning, was acceptable to Rashba only in special cases, in which he sensed that these legends served as a target for attacks by the Christians.68 Rashba Rashba adopts an intriguing interpretive strategy concerning this haggadah. On the one hand, he is not willing to forgo the totally realistic description of Og as a regular person, even if he was patently extremely tall and big, and therefore was considered to be a "giant"; but, on the other, Rashba naturally does not regard the talmudic haggadot to be empty and baseless exaggerations. The solution that he proposes is to distinguish between the two texts before us; between the baraita (b.Ber. 54a) that assumes that it is still possible to find the stone that Og sought to throw at the Israelites, and the wondrous tale that appears on the following page of the Talmud (54b), of Og who uprooted a mountain. He sees the "stone" in the first text as a completely realistic stone, that certainly suits the depiction of Og as a person of especially large dimensions. The follow ing tale, in contrast, about a "mountain," is not, in his opinion, a story that can be accepted on the level of peshat (the literal meaning), but rather is to be viewed as a story that is solely allegorical. Rashba Rashba asserts that this "mountain," that was Og's weapon, alludes to the merit of the Patriarchs, whom some exegeses connect with mountains;69 he 68 See Horowitz,"Attitude of the Geonim,"25. 69 Rashba mentions an exposition connected with a verse in Micah (6:1):"C0me, present [My] case before the mountains." Such an explicit exposition on this verse from Micah appears, to the best of my knowledge, only in the late midrash known as Alpha-Betot that was copied by Shlomo Aaron Wertheimer (in the additions of Abraham Wertheimer) in Batei Midrashot (2 vols.; Jeru salem:Mossad Harav Kook, 1973) 2:443 (Heb.): '"Come, present [My] case before the mountains, and let the hills hear you pleading'—,mountains' refers solely to the fathers of the world [... ] and hills, only to the mothers" (see n. 41 by Wertheimer). The idea itself, however, is undoubtedly to be found in the Talmud. Although Rashba does not expressly mention this, we hear in Rashba'Rashba'Rashba's commentary here, that mentions the jumping (dilug) in this context (see our expla nation, below), an echo of the well-known verse in Song of Songs (2:8): "Leaping [medaleg] over mountains, bounding over hills." See b. Ros Has. 11a: '"Hark! My beloved! There he comes, leaping over mountains, bounding over hills': 'leaping over mountains' — by the merit of the Patriarchs; 'bounding over hills' — by the merit of the Matriarchs." See also Tanhuma, Balak 12: "He [Balaam] began, saying, I was from the lofty ones, from the camp of the Patriarchs" (by the way, mountains are a kabbalistic symbol for the Sefirot of Hesed, Gevurah, and Tif°eret</page><page sequence="24">180 ADMIEL KOSMAN 24 does this in order to state that Og relied upon the merit of what he had done for Abraham, who was one of the "Patriarchs," and who was considered to be a "mountain." In consequence, Moses feared Og. The locusts, an allusion to the prayer of Israel ("whose power is in their tongue"),70 "bored through" the merit of this "mountain." After this, Moses also joins this war, as he assem bles against the merit of Og three different merits: the merit of the Patriarchs to which the jumping of ten cubits alludes — a seeming jumping back, to the past, to take from there the merit of the Patriarchs to aid the Children of Israel;71 Moses' own, independent merits, to which his height of ten cubits alludes; and the merit of the people of Israel as a whole, to which the ten cubit long ax in Moses' hand alludes ("they were compared to the tool that was placed in his hand, that he used"). All these were the weapons that Moses arrayed against the merit of Og, by means of which the latter was eventually vanquished. Due to the special difficulties raised by this part of the talmudic text, Rashba accordingly applied to it — in contrast with the preceding baraita — all the alle gorical tools known to him for such difficult instances, and argued that this tale bears no relation to what occurred in the physical reality, but was connected only to the metaphysical reality. The Og Narrative in the Commentary of the Ahronim Although it was already rooted in the Jewish tradition that Og was not simply a giant with great physical strength,72 some of the later commentators, in the period known as that of the Ahronim (the period following the codification of the Shulhan Arukh in the sixteenth century), refused to take this idea at face that correspond to the Patriarchs; see Rivka Schatz Uffenheimer, Hasidism as Mysticism: Qui etistetist Elements in Eighteenth Century Hasidic Thought, Jonathan Chipman, trans. [Princeton - Jerusalem; Princeton Univ. Press - Magnes, 1993] 162 n. 46). 70 See below, n. 79. 71 For the sources of the theme of jumping, see above, n. 69. 72 The haggadic commentary of the Ahronim is distinctly eclectic. Different interpretive methods are mixed together in it, and are presented as an integral unit (for the general phenomenon, see Frankel, Darkei ha-Aggadah ve-ha-Midrash, 2:527-31). At times the Ahronim explain certain haggadothaggadot in allegorical fashion, while nonetheless emphasizing that, beyond the allegorical interpretation, these expositions are also to be understood according to their simple meaning. MaharshaMaharsha as well acts in this manner on occasion (see Frankel, 530; for Maharsha and his haggadic commentary, see below). Nonetheless, it is significant that for the current haggadah, he does not say this. It may be assumed that these tales exercise the imagination to such extreme lengths that even Maharsha is of the opinion that it is not fitting for an intelligent person to believe them literally. Maharsha acted in this manner when explaining especially difficult haggadic texts, such as those touching upon anthropomorphism in their depictions. See: Frenkel, Midrash and Agadah, 3:895-96.</page><page sequence="25">25 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 181 value and simply assume, as what seemed to be generally axiomatic from the early midrash to the late medieval commentary, that the "wicked" Og possessed spiritual merits. Thus, we see two main directions in the various exegeses and interpretations that were proposed in the interpretive period of the Ahronim for the struggle between Moses and Og. One direction seeks to understand Og's supernatural power as being mainly demonic;73 while the other continued the orientation known from the medieval period, and although the commentators adopting this direction attribute to Og power that ensues from his spiritual merits, it is evident from their teachings that they searched for a logical and systematic structure that could explain all the separate Og legends in a manner that would, on the one hand, provide us with a comprehensive and uniform picture; but that, on the other hand, would also succeed in explaining these narratives in symbolic fashion, as possessing moral-religious significance.74 Beyond, however, this classification of the commentators, they seemingly share the desire to place the story on a totally contrasting, black-and-white, diametrical structure. For until then, the narrative had lacked this: on the one hand, it presented a righteous individual such as Moses, but he was not faced by a wholly wicked person, but rather by someone whose merit was insufficient to defeat the righteous Moses. We will now present these two interpretive directions,75 and in light of what we propose, the reader will now easily understand why these two directions 73 As Maharsha, for example, stresses (see n. 76, below): it cannot possibly be assumed, he asserts, that Og's strength ensued from purely spiritual merits, for Og knew that Moses possessed special merits before God, and how could Og have engaged in such a struggle with Moses from the outset, since "he did not rely on having the merit of forefathers possessed by Moses [the intent is to his serving Abraham in the past], more than Moses [himself] had." We therefore should assume that certainly regarding Og, as the son of Ahijah son of Shamhazai, descended from those angels who came down to the sons of men, "their power came from the side of impurity"(see also below). 74 And thereby clarify how this non-Jew came to possess such tremendous spiritual powers that threatened the merits of Moses. This direction will be presented below specifically from a late hasidic source (see n. 81), even though it could already be found in the above-mentioned commentary by Rashba and in the Darash Moshe commentary cited in Hiddushei ha-Geonim, because I chose to present what seemed to me to be the most sophisticated symbolic devel opment, in terms of aesthetics, that I found in the exegetical texts. 75 For a partial list of the interpretations by Ahronim of the Og midrashim, see Moshe Tzuriel, OtzrotOtzrot ha-Aggadah [The Treasures of the Haggadah] (2 vols.; Benei Berak: Mishor, 1969) 2:43, 404,433-34 (Heb.). Since I do not intend to offer any historical argument here, but rather to suggest a funda metal typology of the late exegetical thought, I allowed myself to choose these two representative examples, despite the distance of place and time, and the cultural expanse, from which they come; because these two central exegetical directions are expressed in their commentaries</page><page sequence="26">182 ADM1EL KOSMAN 26 finely hone the opposing poles of the narrative of the war between Moses and Og: one "blackens" the character of Og and presents this battle as a clear-cut struggle between the forces of impurity and those of sanctity; and the other transforms Og into a total righteous one, on the very same level as that occupied by Moses, but argues that the opposing poles in this war story mark the dis tinction between the people of Israel, that was chosen by the grace of God to be His children, and the non-Jewish peoples, who were removed from this sphere. The first interpretive method is clearly formulated in the commentary by Maharsha?6 He attempts to explain that Ogs power could not be a consequence solely of the merit of his good deeds, for no one could conceive, so he writes, that in the realm of merits, Og could compete with Moses! We should therefore explain that his power came mainly from the demonic side,77 as a power that emerges from the aspect of impurity that he inherited from his forefathers, the angels who had relations with the daughters of men78 According to this explanation, Moses would not have feared Ogs power of impurity for its own sake, if this had not been united with the special merit the king of Bashan possessed for having informed Abraham that his nephew Lot had been taken captive. Maharsha understands that the mountain uprooted by Og that was of three parasangs (12 Roman miles), is representing the 12 impure forces of the Zodiac that Og desired to cast upon the heads of the Israelites, that is, on Moses, who was considered to be the "head" of the people. The locusts, in contrast, symbolize, according to the above interpretation by Rashba, the merit of the Patriarchs, for which Maharsha finds an allusion in the associative linkage to the Patriarch Jacob, who at times is referred to as "worm Jacob";79 accordingly, in the sharpest and clearest manner that I found, while in the other commentaries, these matters often appear in the form of incidental comments, and at times the different methods are indiscriminately intermingled. 76 Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels (1555-1631), in his commentary published in the Vilna edition of the Talmud, Hiddushei ha-Aggadot on b.Ber. 54b. For his commentary on haggadah, see the survey by Frenkel, Midrash and Agadah, 3:876 ff, 895; Elbaum, Openness and Insularity, 135-142. See also Aaron Ahrend,"Hiddushei Aggadot by Maharsha','Mahanayim, 7 N.s. (1994) 166-75 (Heb.). 77 Maharsha develops here his own interpretive direction, that diverges on this point (the addi tion of the demonic theme) from the above-mentioned interpretation by Rashba. The printed Hiddushei Hiddushei ha-Geonim on Ein Yaakov includes an additional symbolic interpretation (Darash Moshe),Moshe), that identifies Og's demonic nature as an attempt to seduce and incite Israel by the Evil Inclination that, according to him, is represented by the stone that Og sought to cast upon them ("You already know that it is the Evil Inclination that is called in their language,'stone'; see b.Sukkahb.Sukkah 52b:'If he [the Evil Inclination] is of stone, he will dissolve'"). 78 On this point, Maharsha bases his interpretation on what is stated in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, chap.22 (in the 1852 Warsaw edition: 50a-51b).This source, however, contains only a collection of views concerning the power and evil deeds of these angels. But see the sources we listed in n.32, above, relating to these midrashim. 79 Maharsha unconsciously identifies tola^at (worm) with hagav (locust). His explanation is based on the comparison by the Rabbis of Israel to a worm, and their stating that "This worm's might</page><page sequence="27">27 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 183 the boring through the mountain by the locusts expresses the undermining of Og's demonic power by their prayer. And when Og saw that he did not succeed in casting the mountain on them (killing them by his power of impurity), he attempted to at least save himself by utilizing his remaining merit for the good deed that he had performed for Abraham; this is the meaning of what is stated in our story, that Og wanted to pull the mountain over his head, but "his teeth protruded." Teeth are a symbol of evil, since the wicked tear apart the righteous with their teeth, and they "are pulled to adhere to the power of impurity, that he had from his forefathers." Consequently, Og was not successful in using for his salvation the remaining merit that he possessed. In this moment of total weak ness, Moses could jump up and strike him on his ankle, that is to say, cancel for him "the merit of his walking with his ankles" (to tell Abraham of the cap tivity of Lot) and prevail over him.80 I found the second direction, that acknowledges Og's spiritual power and explains it in a manner that is plausible to the reader, in the teachings of the hasidic interpreter of haggadah Rabbi Zadok ha-Kohen of Lublin.81 On this topic Rabbi Zadok sets forth an orderly and detailed teaching, that presents the Og narrative and the surrounding mythoi as a single uninterrupted narrative with profound symbolic content, that expresses hidden spiritual struggles that are not revealed to the reader at first glance. In contrast with Maharshas placing Og at the extreme end of the side of impurity, facing Moses who stood against is only in its mouth." Maharsha apparently referred to the exposition in Midrash Tehillim 22:2022:20 (Solomon Buber, ed. [Vilna: n.p., 1891] 191):"'But I am a worm, less than human' [Ps 22:7] — just as this worm has only a mouth, so, too, Israel has only the prayer of the mouth. Just as a worm uproots the tree with its mouth, so, too, Israel with their mouth and their prayers uproot evil decrees that the [non-Jewish] people of the world plan against them.This is the meaning of what is written,'Fear not, O worm Jacob'" (Isa 41:14). For the biblical phrase "worm Jacob" in the midrash, see, e.g., Bereshit Rabbah 100:3 (Theodor and Albeck, eds., 1286). 80 All that remains now for Maharsha to explain is the symbolic significance of the "ten cubits" of Moses; he maintains that they allude to the ten cubits height of the Tabernacle. That is, the nar rator thereby sought to say that by the merit of the establishment of the Tabernacle, Moses was capable of striking and killing Og. 81 Rabbi Zadok ha-Kohen sets forth this line of reasoning in two main passages in his books: TzidkatTzidkat ha-Tzaddik (Lublin: n.p., 1913) par. 93, pp. 27-28; Resisei Laylah (Lublin: n.p., 1903) par. 44, pp. 84-86. Rabbi Zadok ha-Kohen (1823-1900) served as the admor (hasidic rabbi) for his followers after the death of his teacher, the Seer from Lublin, beginning in 1888. Rabbi Zadok devel oped a unique exegetical method, that combined vast halakhic and haggadic knowledge with psychological and philosophical conceptions in a kabbalistic-hasidic spirit. For his exegetical principles, see the recent article: Sara Friedland,"'Proximity'and 'Shelter': On Two Homiletic Principles in the Writings of Rabbi Tsadok Ha'cohen from Lublin," Akdamot 8 (1999) 25-42 (Heb.). For another interesting development, that proceeds in a different direction, see Rabbi Samuel Bornstein, Shem mi-Shmuel, Numbers (6 vols.; Jerusalem: Sochotchover Yeshiva, 1974) Hukat, 40-41 (see also Bornstein, Genesis, 1:344-48).</page><page sequence="28">184 ADMIEL KOSMAN 28 him at the other extremity of the side of sanctity, Rabbi Zadok positions both on the same end of the spectrum: he maintains that both are totally righteous, since, in his opinion, "by the standard of the sons of Noah, they [Og and his brother Sihon] were completely righteous, for there were none comparable to them in the generation of the children of Noah."82 Consequently, in this sphere of pure "struggle," Moses and the Israelites could not win a clear victory. Two prominent subjects are at the center of this interpretive method: the Torah and the "observance of the covenant [shemirat ha-berit]" i.e., taking care that the seed of the male not be wasted, a theme that is completely absent from the early interpretations of the character of Og. Rabbi Zadoks exegetical method explains the source from which Og drew his great merit, that the Baby Ionian Talmudfb.Md. 61a)claims instilled fear in Moses. According to Rabbi Zadok, Og was an "observer of the covenant"83 who "never saw nocturnal pollution in his life." He was unparalleled in his exceeding taintlessness from any sexual craving,84 and this gave him such unique merits that Moses feared to struggle with him.85 The fact that, according to the midrash, Og was a "fugitive" who had survived from the generation of the Flood is also connected by Rabbi Zadok with the sexual theme. The sin of wasting seed is con nected in the dictum by Rabbi Eliezer (b.Nid. 13a) with the sin of the Flood: "Rabbi Eliezer says: Whoever holds his membrum [sexual organ] while urinat ing, it is as if he brings a flood upon the world." Rashi explains that "this trans gression was [common] among them, as it is written, 'all flesh had corrupted' [Gen 6:12], and they said: 'with the heat [of passion] they sinned'"; the following page of the Talmud (13b) applies the appellation "deserving [destruction by] the Flood" to those males who engage in sexual relations with children "by way of limbs."86 Thus, according to this conception, one who was saved from the Flood 82 Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86. 83 It may be assumed that Rabbi Zadok was influenced on this point by the idea set forth in the Zohar concerning Og's "covenant" merit. 84 That, according to Rabbi Zadok, might be rare among the non-Jews, but "we have also found those among the non-Jews who were free of this." 85 In the spirit of the same interpretive orientation that maintains that Og's power was not nec essarily physical, he stresses: "the praise of the great and powerful kings lies solely in their height and strength, that is, in their spiritual attributes and their might in the conquering of their [evil] urge" (,Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86). 86 This refers to a sexual game involving the sexual organs of the children, but this does not in volve anal penetration, and therefore such activity as well is regarded as a form of mastur bation. See Rashi ad 10c., q.v."Derekh Avarim"; for an additional clarification of this issue, see ElimelechElimelech A. Halevi, Erkhei ha-Aggadah ve-ha-Halakhah le-Or Mekorot YevaniJim ve-LatinPim (The Values of the Aggadah in Light of Greek and Latin Sources) (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1982)306 (Heb.); Daniel Boyarin,"Rabbis and Their Pals; or, Are There Any Jews in'The History of Sexu ality'?"Zemanim 52(1995)52 (Heb.).</page><page sequence="29">29 the story of a giant story 185 must be completely free of the sin of masturbation and the sexual desires that were totally unbridled in that generation (that was matched by the spread of the Flood throughout the physical world in the same wild and unrestrained manner). Rabbi Zadok finds additional proof that Og controlled his sexual desire in that the land of the latter, Bashan, was given (together with other lands) as the portion of the descendants of Manasseh (the half-tribe of Manasseh), who are descended from Joseph — who was already mentioned by the Torah for his peerless ability to control his sexual desire, when he withstood the test and did not fall prey to enticement by the wife of Potiphar.87 To the data assembled until this point, Rabbi Zadok now adds a midrashic allusion that appears in the Babylonian Talmud (b.Hul. 139b) from which Rabbi Zadok learns that Moses, too, was a "fugitive," a survivor from the Flood gen eration;88 since Moses was also known as one who "abstained from women,"89 he therefore, according to Rabbi Zadok, also was completely free of any sex ual desire.90 We now can understand the dimensions of the struggle between Moses and Og, not as an earthly battle, nor even as a contest with one who possesses perilous demonic power, but rather as a "title fight," a sort of wrestling match between two spiritual giants, whose control of their sexual urge reached the level of a special art, thus imparting each with special righteous merits. This, then, Rabbi Zadok maintains, is why Moses was so apprehensive of Og the "giant"; God therefore had to assuage Moses' fear of Og with special words of encour agement: "Do not fear him, for I give him [... ] into your hand" (Num 21:34). In another place Rabbi Zadok also adds the argument that Og had a tangible affiliation to spirituality and Torah study. Here Rabbi Zadok plays with the con cept of "water,"connecting the waters of the Flood with the power of the Torah. 87 For Rabbi Zadok ha-Kohen's general psychological theory concerning the relationship be tween sexuality, on the one hand, and narcissism and egocentrism, on the other, see, for now, mine: Admiel Kosman, Men's Tractate (Jerusalem: Keter, 2002) 58-63 (Heb.). 88 The talmudic passage states only that the book of Genesis already alludes to the name of the yet-to-be-born Moses:"Where is Moses indicated [in the Torah]? In [the verse]:'Since he too [beshagam] is flesh'" (Gen 6:3). Rashi explains:"Beshagam (בשגם) has the same numerical value as משה, and it is written there [in Genesis]: 'let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years,' and so was the lifetime of Moses. That is to say: Someone beshagam, Moses, will be born." Rabbi Zadok, however, maintains that this is to be understood as Moses already being alive during the generation of the Flood, adding to this the allusion "I drew him out of the water" (Ex 2:10), that was stated about Moses. 89 See Sifrei, Numbers 99 (Horovitz, ed., 98); see also Joshua Schwartz and David Elgavish, eds., Me-PeirotMe-Peirot ha-Ilan (From the Fruits of the Tree) (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan Univ. Press, 1998) 426-27 (Heb.). 90 See also the passage in Rabbi Zadok, Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86; see also below, n. 92.</page><page sequence="30">186 ADMIEL KOSMAN 30 This same force, that was so copious in the time of the Flood, was misused, and violently turned into the drowning waters of the Flood. According to this reasoning, Og would not have been saved from drowning in the waters of the Flood if it were not for "his necessarily having some association with the Torah."91 Rabbi Zadok finds support for this thesis in the fact that the above passage in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer contains the identification between Og and Eliezer, and it is said that Eliezer "drew and gave to drink" to others from the Torah of his master (Abraham).92 The question now arises: if Og really possessed so many merits, as someone completely righteous in his own right, what then tipped the scales in favor of Moses, and against Og (and was at the basis of the divine words of encourage ment to Moses), if, in the final analysis, these two antagonists possessed equal spiritual merits? Rabbi Zadok responds to this: This is the main element of the eternal grace of God: once the Torah had been given and Israel had been chosen, it was impossible for any other nation to draw close before him [the Lord,] may He be blessed; as it is written in the beginning of the Mekhilta:93 "Until they were chosen... ."94 And even if [the non-Jew] were to observe all the commandments of the Torah [this would be of no avail, and he could not adhere to the Lord, rather] he must convert and be called by the name of Israel. Otherwise, [he would be within the category of] "an idolater who engages in the 91 Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86. For water as the Torah, see the preceding note. 92 See above, n.49. Rabbi Zadok bases this symbolic interpretation of water in the rabbinic sources. Since "water" symbolizes the Torah, then the Flood generation possessed great capabilities in the spiritual realm, but "by their sin, the bounty of the water of the Torah was turned into the water of the Flood." Moses, however, was saved from these sins and therefore could survive and in the future bring down the Torah to the people of Israel, and even Og — as we are forced to say, according to Rabbi Zadok's understanding — "possessed some neces sary affiliation to the Torah." Regarding the metaphor of water in the rabbinic literature as symbolizing the Torah see: Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale, 487 n. 44; Ivan G. Marcus, Rituals of Childhood: Jewish Acculturation in in Medieval Europe (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1996) chap. 4, n. 84. 93 Rabbi Zadok alludes here to (Hayyim S. Horovitz and Israel A. Rabin, eds.) Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael,Ishmael, Pis-'ha, Bo, par. 1 pp. 2-4. 94 This exposition in Mekhilta contains a list of things for which the moment of selection by God invalidated the others from fulfilling that same spiritual role. Thus, for example,"until the Land of Israel was chosen, all the lands were fit for dabarut [prophecy]; once the Land of Israel had been chosen, all the other lands were excluded."A perusal of this midrash, however, reveals that the selection of Israel, specifically, and the invalidation of the non-Jews are absent from this list.</page><page sequence="31">31 THE STORY OF A GIANT STORY 187 Torah is liable...For this is the heritage of the congregation of Jacob [see Deut 33:4],96 specifically.97 In other words, according to this line of reasoning, Moses' spiritual power is insufficient to prevail over the spiritual power of Og, and it is solely the choos ing by the Lord in His grace of the people of Israel that determined, beginning from the time of the Revelation, that the non-Jew cannot personally adhere to God (even if he observes all the commandments of the Torah); it is only this fact that eventually tipped the scales.98 95 This is an allusion by Rabbi Zadok to the dictum by Rabbi Johanan in b.San. 59a: "A Gentile who studies Torah is liable for the death penalty, as it says,'Moses charged us with the Torah as the heritage [of the congregation of Jacob]' (Deut 33:4) — a heritage to us, and not to them." Incidentally, for the opinion of Maimonides on this subject, see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 10:9, and She'eilot u-Teshuvot ha-Rambam, par. 149; for the position of Rabbi Menahem ha Meiri in Beit ha-Behirah, see Israel M.Ta-shma, Talmudic Commentary in Europe and North Africa:Africa: Literary History, Part Two: 1200-1400 (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2000) 167-70 (Heb.), who provides a lengthy explanation in light of the positions of other Rishonim (medieval authorities). 96 For the entire quotation to which Rabbi Zadok refers, see the preceding note. 97 Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86. Cf. what Rabbi Zadok wrote in Kuntres Divrei Khalomot (printed at the end of the book Resisei Laylah) par. 25, pp. 195-96, where he adopts a different approach. 98 The selection of Israel by God, in light of this thesis, has no logic or reason, it rather is a gesture of divine grace (fiesed):"Regarding this it is said,'His steadfast love [hasdo] is eternal' [in numerous biblical passages], for the Torah of hesed that the Lord, may He be blessed, gave to Israel is eternal; for one who is not of them — it is nothing" (Resisei Laylah, par. 44, p. 86). For the question of whether Jewish tradition ascribes value to any moral act that is not based on compliance with the laws of the Torah, see Moshe Halbertal, Interpretive Revolutions in in the Making: Values as Interpretive Considerations in Midrashei Halakhah (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1997) 22-30 (Heb.); see also the sources set forth by Moshe Weiss,"'This Is the Book of the Generations of Adam,"' Bikkurim 2 (1985) 57-65 (Heb.). The idea of selection, in its extreme formulation by Rabbi Zadok, that completely negates the significance of the actions by "Og" (the righteous non-Jew) since he was not chosen by God, is somewhat reminiscent of predesti nation, and like other ideas in the teachings of Rabbi Zadok is related to sexuality. There is, in my mind, a faint resemblance between his positions and those of Paul in his epistles, but such a discussion would exceed the scope of the present article. For predestination, see David Flusser, Jewish Sources in Early Christianity (Tel Aviv: Sifriat Hapoalim, 1979) 318-19 (Heb.); Flusser, The Judean Desert Scrolls and the Essenes (Tel Aviv: Ministry of Defense Press, 1985) 39-43 (Heb.); Urbach, The Sages, 541-54, with a discussion of the positions in the rabbinic literature (see also Friedlander, Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, 177, that presents the surprising stance that the choice of Israel was a matter of chance fate, and no more: "The lot of the Holy One, blessed be He, fell upon Abraham and upon his seed"); for the idea of chosenness in general, see the articles collected by Shmuel Almog and Michael Heyd, eds., Chosen People Elect Nation and and Universal Mission (Jerusalem: Shazar, 1991) (Heb.); and for the sense of'chosenness" in the religious perception on the whole, see Mircea Eliade, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, Phillip Mairet, trans. (New York: Harper, i960) 79-81.</page><page sequence="32">188 ADMIEL KOSMAN 32 It would seem for a moment that we hear in this recounting of the war with Og by Rabbi Zadok the argument of the innovators — the Reform and their like — who dared at that time to assert that "righteous ones" who engage in good deeds and have good thoughts are also to be found among the differ ent nations and religions; and, according to this view, we, the members of the Jewish nation, must open up to them in order to learn spiritual paths from them, in a cooperative manner. Rabbi Zadok's response to this, by the vehicle of this story, is one of total negation, arguing that these good deeds by Gentiles have no true value outside the Jewish system of commandments, unless those "Og-righteous""Og-righteous" were to convert, and would from this time on be called "Israel." Thus we repeatedly learn the correctness of the insight by Zunz, who wrote more than a century and a half ago that the way in which the haggadah works is "[a mode of] action for the moment, and not for generations."99 Consequently, all commentary on the haggadah is a sort of continuation of this great creative work, that in actuality tells one long story, with each of the themes in the Bible constituting a basis for the personal improvisation of each storyteller, in every generation. Every commentator is therefore, to a certain degree, a storyteller as well: an artist who continues the story of the Jewish haggadah; a storyteller who adapts this story from anew for his generation and the spiritual context in which he was raised, in accordance with the conditions of his environment. Thus acted the haggadists, the artists of the talmudic period with their fantastic imaginations; thus acted Maimonides, who restricted the narrative to its real istic dimensions, in accordance with his rationalistic method; thus acted his successors, who interpreted the talmudic tale as allegory; and thus acted the hasidic commentary of the nineteenth century, that contended with the Og story as a seemingly current narrative, a story that was intended to provide a response to those who maintained the existence of religious and spiritual mani festations among the non-Jews in which the Jews could join, and that could be integrated in the Jewish life of the people of Israel. The Og narrative is there fore an "elongated" story from every aspect. Summary The assumption that was the starting point for this article is that the interpre tation of the haggadic story is itself a manner of retelling. The Og narrative was presented in this light as a sort of haggadic "shell story," from which each generation, through its singular interpretation, creates a story - either by direct 99 Leopold Zunz, Die gottesdienstlichen Vortrage der Juden: historisch entwickelt (Frankfurt a.M.: Kauffmann, 1892) 61 (see the additions by Chanokh Albeck in the Hebrew version: Ha Derashot be-Yisrael ve-Hishtalshalutan ha-Historit [Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1974] 32).</page><page sequence="33">33 the story of a giant story 189 continual addition, or by means of indirect "learned" interpretation — the suitable narrative improvisation necessary to present the narrative in its time and cultural environment. From this point of departure, the article examined the convoluted metamor phoses of the Og narrative, from a very concise and quite marginal description of his character in the biblical narrative to the narratives of the modern period; from the expanded mythological form of the tale in the Babylonian Talmud, continuing with its presentation as a story expressing an allegoric idea in the medieval Jewish-Christian confrontation, and concluding with its transforma tion in the modern period into a partisan argument of the chosenness of Israel in the Orthodox ideology of hasidic Jewry. We shall now summarize in short the permutations of the changing Og story; the king of Bashan, who is patently depicted in the Bible as a giant of realistic dimensions, and who was portrayed in a similar light by the sages of the midrash in the tannaitic period and by Josephus, became a figure of monstrous proportions in the amoraic exegeses (that appear in quite distinct fashion in the Babylonian Talmud), possibly under the influence of views that appear in the Apocrypha. One "expansion" of his image was already delivered in the name of pales tinian amoraim, but it is linked to the dimension of time (this "stretching" as was noted above, could also have sparked the fertile midrashic imagination for the physical stretching of his body, that would later turn him into a giant of nonrealistic dimensions): the exegetes maintained that Og was already alive in the time of the Flood, and survived as a "fugitive" from the war of the kings in the book of Genesis, and that he was the one who came and told Abraham about the captivity of his nephew Lot. Some even went so far as to maintain that Og was a descendant of those angels who came down to earth and had relations with the daughters of men. In a later addition, Og became Abrahams servant, and it is he who is Eliezer the servant of Abraham, who is known to us from Genesis. In the Middle Ages Og returns to his human dimensions, and the commen tators, both the rationalists and those who engaged in esoteric interpretations, struggled to explain these exaggerated expositions as allegory. The exegesis in the Zohar and in the commentary by Rashba continue to expand the interpretive direction that presents Og as possessing spiritual mer its. In the hands of the haggadic commentators in recent centuries, this direc tion split into two interpretive options, that share their portrayal of Og and Moses as occupying two sharply opposing poles: some refused to accept that this "wicked one" had any spiritual merits, and therefore oriented their writ ings so that those "rights" were mainly magic-demonic powers that Og inher ited from his forefathers the angels who in primordial times had engaged in</page><page sequence="34">190 ADMIEL KOSMAN 34 relations with the daughters of men. Others sought to relate the story of Og and the story of his war with Moses as a battle between two completely righteous individuals, with the sole decisive advantage held by Moses in this struggle being his membership in Israel, the people that had been chosen by God as an act of Divine grace, with no rhyme or reason. Moses' victory is therefore the triumph of this conception of chosenness, that assumes that the Divine aid extended to Moses proves that the selection of Israel ensues only from the Divine love of Israel, with no apparent reason or cause.
