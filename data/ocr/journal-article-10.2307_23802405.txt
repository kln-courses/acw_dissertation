<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTARIES BERTRAND RUSSELL'S A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY BOOK TWO CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHY A Critical Analysis of Russell's View of Catholic Philosophy This part of Russell's History will be discussed in three sections. First, we must consider the relation that Russell sees between Catholic philosophy and medieval culture; secondly, his exposition of the general nature and development of Catholic philosophy; and then we will be in a position to examine and weigh the treat ment accorded to particular representatives of Catholic philosophy. I. Catholic Philosophy and Social Causation The reader who comes upon Russell's work with a recollection of Will Durant's best-seller of two decades ago will not expect to find more than a few pages covering the gap between Plotinus and the dawn of Renaissance philosophy. Nor would Russell's own fundamental contributions to recent philosophy lead one to expect him to devote a substantial portion of his book to the period of Catholic ascendancy in the history of thought. However, fifteen chapters or one-fourth of the History is given to Catholic philosophy, provisionally described (301) as that line of European thought which was dominant from Augustine to the Renaissance (more precisely to Occam). In addition to discussing the Fathers of the Chufch and the Schoolmen, Russell feels required to trace the religious development of the Jews and the Church of the first 1.

Moreover, conditions in the Mohammedan world during the Middle Ages are also touched upon for their bearing on Western life. At first glance the presence of this section lends an appearance of comprehensiveness to the History which is desirable in these Alexandrian days of summaries and surveys. A closer inspection reveals that only four complete chapters are given to a formal consideration of the Christian philosophers (Augustine, John the Scot, Aquinas and the Franciscan Schoolmen). Other philosophers treated are introduced almost incidentally in connection with Russell's account of general cultural trends. Well over half the pages alloted to the Catholic period deal with the place of the early Church in the Roman Empire, its responsibility for the Dark Ages and its policy towards the barbarians, the growth of eccle siastical power and the medieval conflict between Church and State (the Holy Roman Empire), the position and varying fortunes of the papacy in the new world order, the moral condition of medieval Christendom and the factors leading to the sixteenth century revolt. What is usually taken to be general history thus holds a more prominent place in Russell's volume than in any previous study of medieval philosophy. And the proportion of cultural to philosophical material is greater in this section of the history than in his treatmen of either ancient or modern philoso phy It would not be difficult to point out historical and theological inaccuracies or a biased spirit in these pages. They present the viewpoint of an educated Englishman who has conveniently at hand his Cambridge Medieval History, Gibbon, Lea, White, Cumont, Lecky, some edition of Ueberweg and the Encyclopcedia Britannica. Obviously this line of criticism does not belong to the philosopher. Something more is at stake in this section than whether there are only four Doctors of the Western Church (334, 381), or whether the sacraments are miraculous and magical (408-409), or whether devotion to learning was any part of St. Dominic's original intention (451), or whether St. Jerome's famous account of his dream fully expressed his mind upon the reading of pagan literature (343-Russell would perhaps be scan dalized at the chapter entitled "Saint Jerome The Humanist," in</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTARIES 195 E.K. Rand's Founders of the Middle Ages). Mistakes of this sort are frequent enough to undermine confidence in the author as a guide to medieval history, but his central conception does not stand or fall with these particular points. This central position is a properly philosophical one, and can be dealt with only in a philosophical way. Unlike many authors who have written histories of philosophy, Russell is himself an eminent philosopher. Nor did he step out of character in composing the History, for it approaches its subject matter from a definite philosophical standpoint. It is true that the Russell who collaborated with Whitehead is not much in evidence, except for the insistance upon a logical ground and control of mathematical reasoning. But ever since the First World War, Russell's thought has been tending in the direction of logical analysis, semantics and social theory. For a full appreciation of his approach to Catholic philosophy, the reader should take into account the following writings: Philosophy; Religion and Science; Power: A New Social Analysis; The Meaning of Truth. In these books are set forth his general views on the nature and limits of philo sophy which are implicitly brought to bear upon the history of Christian philosophy. I will draw upon them for what light they can shed upon Russell's notion of the relation between medieval philosophy and its social milieu. That in Russell's own mind there is a grave problem precisely here is evident from his attempts to justify the subtitle of this History. He does not feel called upon to offer any special ex planation of the connection between ancient or modern philosophy and the political and social circumstances of the times. With regard to the medieval period, however, it is impossible to include such a great amount of extra-philosophical material without some defense. Russell maintains (ix, 305-307) that so much social and political history was included because people are presumably un familiar with this obscure medieval period. Apart from under estimating the prevalence of high school and college courses in medieval history, Russell has not made evident the relevance of his numerous and extensive excursions into the byways. It is not the business of the author of a one-volume history of philosophy to instruct the common reader in the apochryphal and pseudepi</page><page sequence="4">196 COMMENTARIES graphical literature of the Bible, the Lives of the Desert Fathers, the details of the investiture controversy and of the drive against simony and concubinage, the dissolution of the Templars, the career of Cola di Rienzi, and the intricacies of the conciliar movement. This is specially not his office when considerations of space oblige him merely to mention without explaining the contents of the Rule of St. Benedict and Gregory's Pastoral Rule, and when he has no space even to mention fhe medieval educational curricu lum and institutions or the dissemination of manuscripts. Even with some judicious pruning and additions, Russell still would consider it necessary to concentrate attention upon social and political matters. In order to appreciate this orientation of his treatment of Catholic thought, Russell's conception of philoso phy must be made explicit. In his introductory remarks (xiii), he states that all definite knowledge belongs to science, whereas all dogma about what is supposed to surpass definite knowledge belongs to theology. The No Man's Land of philosophy lies some where between these extremes. As can be gathered from his other writings, Russell does not admit any essential distinction between science and philosophy. What alone is proper to philosophy is a more critical arrd general outlook. Its task is to analyze the findings of science, to state them accurately and to harmonize the various statements in a general account Philosophy in this strict sense is a technical matter very largely independent of social circumstances. Although even here some reciprocal causality is detectable between society and philosophy, scientific methods are available for insuring common agreement on the basis of public evidence. So understood, genuine philosophy is sharply set off by Russell from what customarily goes by that name. There are a number of problems traditionally associated with philosophy, but which belong to this discipline only in an organic historical way. Meta physics, for instance, discusses the existence of God, the freedom of will and the immortality of a substantial soul. But the revolution in modern physical theory and the advances in syntactical analysis are held by Russell and the logical empiricists to have discredited metaphysics and rendered its problems literally non-sensical. If men are still seeking insight along these lines, it must be gained by extra-scientific methods which cannot be recognized in philo</page><page sequence="5">COMMENTARIES 197 sophy. In actual practice metaphysics is closely allied with the realm of values, with the complex body of vital decisions which constitutes a man's "philosophy of life." Russell has long maintained, however, that ethics and axiology contain no assertions, in the strict sense of statements expressing scientifically ascertainable truth. Value judgments only give expression to a man's personal desires, to a difference in individual taste — concerning which there is proverbially no disputing and no settling. Since there is no objective standard to which appeal can be made, questions of value lie wholly outside the donjain of knowledge. Russells general position on metaphysics and values has had direct bearing upon the form which his account of the Catholic period in philosophy has taken. It is only due to ambiguity in the term that most of the thought during this period is called philoso phy. Preoccupation with the objects of metaphysics is due to the influence of "revealed" dogma, and is a mark not of scientific philosophy but of religion and theology. The response of Catholic thinkers to matters of vital concern lies beyond scientifically controllable discussion by philosophy. "Philosophy" of the medie val sort is subject to the laws of social causation, and can be explained for the most part in institutional terms through an analysis of the social forces at work during that age. Here is Russell's justification for the apportioning of his material, and for his repeated assertions that "Catholic philosophy is essentially the philosophy of an institution, namely the Catholic Church." (306; cf. 785). As such, it can be best understood and evaluated in terms of the institutions, modes of thought and customs which shaped this philosophy in a determining way. Russell's presupposition concerning philosophy and the writing of its history is not altogether clear or free from difficulties. This becomes evident in his attempt to distinguish his own teaching from that of Marxian Materialism (785-787), whose outlook on history he has construed in a narrow sense inacceptable to a critic like Sidney Hook. Russell observes rightly that social circumstances other than economic are quite important for determining a philo sophy in the wider sense. But his own notion of political and social causes fails to take into account other areas of social pat</page><page sequence="6">198 COMMENTARIES terning — notably, educational and artistic forces — in his study of Catholic thought. The religious motive never emerges in its own right, but is consistently interpreted in terms of ecclesiastical power. Thus the Church's opposition to divorce among royalty is understood primarily as a matter of policy (395-396), and the deeper motive at work behind ecclesiastical reform in the eleventh century is divined to be a search for power on the part of the clergy (407). In another section of the book (xiv), Russell under lines the reciprocal causality which must be expected between a man's philosophy and the times in which he lives. But apparently he looks upon medieval philosophy as an inexplicable exception to the rule, since he everywhere portrays its relation to the Church and the clerical mind as a one-way affair. Catholic philosophy is moulded and dominated by ecclesiastical institutions, but never seems to interact in an independent and mutual way. This makes for a simpliste recital, but it does not provide good history. Even Russell implicitly admits that philosophy had a decisive influence at least upon medieval political institutions, since he explains the political failure of the Albigenses as due to the absence of a philosophy which could reconcile heresy with royal claims to dominion (447). Russell's statement that a genuine philosophy based upon logic and science tends to escape social causation has plausibility only so long as a quite restricted sense of social cause prevails. Neither the psychology of scientists nor the history of science bears out this purist standpoint. Russell himself seeks to explain John Dewey's scientific philosophy in its industrialist and collectivist setting, and is somewhat taken aback at Dewey's counter-reference to the aristocratic antecedents of Russell's own scientific philosophy (826-827). The logic of science does not differ only in degree from the procedure of philosophy: otherwise all contemporary philosophical tendencies would indeed be converging upon the position taken by Russell and logical analysis. When illustrating the way in which social causation is dimnished as soon as a problem becomes detailed and technical (786-787), Russell cites the long history of philosophical disputes concerning the problem of universals, the ontological argument " for God's existence, and materialism. This is very puzzling. Such</page><page sequence="7">COMMENTARIES 199 questions figured prominently in medieval discussions. The solu tions offered in the age reaching from Augustine to Occam were not merely matters of temperament, nor did they merely reflect social conditions. The investigations was carried on then just as technically as it is today by a logical analyst. This would require of the historian of Catholic philosophy that he forsake the easy path of gossip, social history and topical survey for the more rigorous method of careful analysis and criticism. The double standard treatment of medieval, in contradistinction to ancient and modern, philosophy still persists in Russell's History. A study of the power motive in medieval institutions is no adequate subs titute for a truly philosophical history of medieval philosophy. It is Russell's contention that medieval thought is called philo sophical only by courtesy. In support, he would adduce his well known views on metaphysics and values. Concerning the problem of values, I find myself in material agreement with the American naturalists, although from a widely different standpoint. Unani mity is not a criterion of what is truly philosophical, and hence is not a sufficient ground for dismissing ethics and the natural bases of religion from the field of philosophy. The naturalists would argue that we have only made a beginning in the applica tion of scientific method to values, and that Russell's attitude is unwarrantedly obstmctionist. But I fail to see how they can advance their case a step without falling into psychologism. The basic reason for Russell's banishment of ethics as an assertive discipline is his reduction of philosophy to science. For the same reason he has maintained the meaninglessness of metaphysics. Consequently, for him the technical discussions of medieval philo sophy are based on an appeal to an extra-philosophical mode of cognition fostered by theological power. It is then his univocal understanding of "definite knowledge" and of "public experience" which leads Russell to this method of dealing with Catholic thinkers. They in turn would maintain that Russell's own position involves an appeal to the extra-philosophical criterion of the phy sical sciences. Within the limits of a history of philosophy, there is no obligation to justify the theoretical principles which guided its composition. But those principles are at least rendered suspect</page><page sequence="8">200 COMMENTARIES when found to be incompatible with the more immediate require ments of historical thinking. No one has stated these requirements better than Russell himself. He remarks (39) that our initial attitude in studying a philosopher should be neither reverence nor contempt, but hypothetical sympathy. By the use of historical imagination we should try to understand how a line of thought could seem to be true, before we take up the subsequent task of determining whether in fact it is a true report. Undeniably, it seemed to the medievals that their thinking on certain problems was philosophical thinking, and that their inferences were rigor ously and verifiably carried out. Whatever the changes in our prevailing notion of verifiability, then, the historian of philosophy is bound to convey an accurate and sufficiently detailed account of a man's work to evoke that initial sympathy and shared insight which will enable us to know and judge a philosophy accurately. The remainder of this paper is intended to show that Russell has not successfully fulfilled his duty as an historian of Catholic philo sophy. Hence there is some empirical presumption that his under lying position on metaphysics and values is itself unsound. II. The General Notion and Development of Catholic Philosophy. The older version of Western philosophy, that the intellectual lights of Europe were dimmed for a millenium until the harbinger notes of the Discourse on Method, undergoes some modification at Russell's hands. For him philosophy went into decline after the death of Aristotle and continued in a parlous state until the Renaissance and Descartes. Among the Greeks, posh-Aristotelian philosophy lost the spirit of originality and enterprise, catering to the weakness and personal needs of the people rather than pushing the investigation forward on its own merits. Catholic thought inherited the individualist and subjectivist bias of late antiquity. Its striking success during the patristic era is attributed by Russell to the consolatory value of its other-worldly dualism. The greatest among the Fathers was Augustine, who assured the triumph of Plato and the mathematical-mystical outlook among Christian thinkers until well into the thirteenth century. Aquinas' impor</page><page sequence="9">COMMENTARIES 201 tance lies mainly in his substitution of Aristotle for Plato, a preference which has characterized Scholasticism to the present day. This choice of the more empirically-minded Aristotle ultim ately proved disastrous for the medieval synthesis. Since Occam there have been no great minds among the Scholastics. The epigoni have been content to transmit faithfully the tradition of the medieval Schoolmen, adding only minor embellishments. Russell is unwilling to allow that even the greatest Catholic thinkers are genuine philosophers, or that they can be placed in the same class with first-rate moderns. Aquinas, for instance (463), has the merit of an exact knowledge of Aristotle, but has little of the true philosophic spirit. Like other Catholics, he does not set out on the philosophical inquiry regardless of where it may lead, but always has an apologetic intent primarily in mind. The medievals thought they knew the answers in advance through revelation. Their search for particular arguments in support of foregone conclusions was not a philosophical activity, but rather a piece of special pleading. Independent and disin terested philosophizing had to await the liberation of the Western mind from Catholic dogma. This judgment by Russell probably will be more widely approved in America than any other stand taken in the History. It conveys the common estimate concerning Scholasticism, and points to the chief obstacle in the way of the advancement of Scholasticism here. Unfortunately, Russell assumes this position throughout the book without taking up in a formal way the histo rical and theoretical questions which it raises. We have already seen that he gives only a chronological description of Catholic philosophy without betraying any acquaintance with contemporary discussion on the problems inherent in such a notion. Since the revival under Leo XIII, there has been considerable controversy among Catholic thinkers themselves about philos o phi a Christiana. Hence it should not be made to appear that the fact and concept are considered self-evident and without a problematic aspect for the Catholic mind. It is the historian's tack, moreover, to trace the relations between reason and revelation through the succes sive phases of medieval thought. This has not been done by Russell, who touches only obliquely on this question in connection</page><page sequence="10">202 COMMENTARIES with Origen's work Against Celsus (328), and in allusions to Aquinas and the Latin Averroists (453-454). There is no synthetic study of the complicated topic, its development in the Christian tradition, and the effect of contact with Moslem theology and philosophy. Closely connected with this lacuna is the charge made by Russell (xviii, 302) that any study relying upon medieval philo sophical sources must inevitably be one-sided. This lack of balance is due to the exclusively clerical authorship of the literature upon which the student must draw, with a consequent writing of philo sophy from the viewpoint of the Church alone. This line of reasoning is hard to reconcile with Russell's own admission that ecclesiastical power was not imposed from without but rested upon solid popular support. If the vast majority fo people held for the truth of the Catholic faith, then the writing of philosophy by the clerks (some only in minor orders) was simply a case of functional initiative on the part of the educated portion of the community. Russell on occasion (446-447) presumes that plain people were inclined to heresy, and that popular feeing is most authentically expressed in heretical writings. As a historian, he had ample opportunity to illustrate dissident opinion from the field of philosophy. Yet the Almaricians are absent from these pages, while a single parenthetical phrase (455) is bestowed upon David of Dinant. Nor can any amount of interesting "background material" redeem an explanation of thirteenth-century intellectual life which completely ignores the movement of "Avicennizing Augustinism" during the first part of the century. According to Russell, Avicenna's influence was felt in the Mohammedan world, Averroes' in the West (424). It is understandable, then, why the very names of Gundissali nus, William of Auvergne, Alexander of Hales and John of Rochelle are missing from this History, and why Albert the Great is only mentioned in passing. The reader is given not the slightest hint as to the existence and importance of Augustinism in the period before Duns Scotus. A paragraph each is devoted to St. Bonaventure and Matthew of Aquasparta, in which we are told only that the former followed St. Anselm and never quoted from the Arabian philosophers, and that the latter mentions Avicenna,</page><page sequence="11">COMMENTARIES 203 Anselm and Augustine. Apparently, Russell considers it a sufficient characterization of these philosophers to note the authors they cite. Not a word is said, however, about divine illumination, rationes seminales, the plurality of forms in man, the temporal creation of the world, spiritual matter, or the other distinctive theses upheld by the Augustinist masters. Little wonder that there emerges a wooden account of St. Thomas, who is completely divorced from his historical setting and from the issues which determine his true significance. It is strange, however, that more is not told about the Latin Averroists beyond a cryptic reference to "a large body of unprofes sional free-thinkers, who denied immortality" (427), and professed the doctrine of the two truths (453). In a History of Philosophy which admits the names and exploits of a thousand lay figures, Siger of Brabant would seem to deserve a page or two of accurate doctrinal exposition. Russell might have found in him a quite professional philosopher and educational power, and in his move ment a good deal more than a denial of personal immortality. More important for the main thesis of his section on Catholic philosophy, however, is the failure to analyze what would be a representative concrete instance of papal influence upon university life and the course of philosophical development. Not a subtle principle of selection but lack of first-hand acquaintance with medieval sources explains this oversight. Even though Lea and White were uninterested in Latin Averroism (not a very satisfac tory term for a position containing so many Avicennian and "pure" Aristotelian elements), the historian of philosophy might rectify any onesidedness in the record and might test whether medieval Christian thinkers have any philosophic spirit through a study of this movement and the opposition which greeted it in Scholastic quarters. One such definite investigation would be worth all the colorful irrelevancies with which Russell has padded his text. A confusing equivocity hampers his theoretical description of Catholic philosophy as a major factor contributing to the increasing "subjectivism" of the Western mind. Careful semantic analysis is required to distinguish the various senses in which Russell uses this term. Historically, they are all connected with his admiration</page><page sequence="12">204 COMMENTARIES for the pre-Socratic scientific outlook. I have always considered Russell's emphasis upon philosophy as a search for the truth about the world for its own sake and not merely as food for our whims and prejudices to be a sound corrective for the abuses of epistemo logy and Lebensphilosophie. But it has also seemed to me that Russell over-stressed cosmic piety to the point of forgetting that not the cosmos but only man is pious, and that neither "subjective" nor "objective" have meaning apart from man the knower. This impression is only confirmed by the present polemic against Catho lic subjectivism. Russell holds, however, that modern philosophy is far the greater sinner in this regard, due chiefly to the growth of idealism. Hence he forthrightly prefers the cool logic of Aqui nas to the sentimentality of Rousseau (694), and the older apolo getics to William James' will-to-believe (818). Among the elements in Russell's conception of medieval sub jectivism, three will be mentioned here: the cosmological, the teleological and the ethical factors. What is said about the epis temological and metaphysical aspects can be left for the special discussion of his treatment of Augustine. In his exposition of Aristotle's physical doctrines, Russell notes that the earth is at the center of the universe, and also that the upper regions are more divine than the lower (206-207). Over against his view he sets the Copernican view which displaces the eath from its central position (526, 537-538). Russell repeats the conventional obser vation that as a result man was dethroned from the place of pre-eminence accorded to him in medieval cosmology. It has often been pointed out that man's primacy was not based by medieval philosophers upon the place of the earth in the Ptolemaic system, both because the earth's central position was also the lowest and because the Ptolemaic explanation which, moreover, was not con sidered to be the only way of saving the appearances. Angels, being higher kinds of intellectual substance, were assigned by the medie vals as movers of the superior heavenly bodies. To read back the passions and stupidities of the Renaissance conflict into the ordinary medieval cosmology is to substitute a history of sensibilities for one of philosophies. But at no time in its development would Scholas ticism be cowed by the physical insignificance of our planet into</page><page sequence="13">COMMENTARIES 205 abandoning a measured humanism founded upon the primacy of spirit over the entire order of matter. Related with this issue is a further consequence of the new scientific procedure: the banishing of purpose from the physical universe (538). Russell sees a marked affinity between the modern scientific outlook and the atomism of Democritus (67, 73). The backwardness of the medievals in scientific research, on the con trary, is accounted for by their adherence to Aristotle in favoring final cauie as the basic scientific concept. This explanation is not to be attributed solely to the mathematical-physical standpoint of Russell, who is mainly concerned with those sciences in which the mechanistic hypothesis has proved most useful. Significantly, he shows little imaginative sympathy with the biological studies of Aristotle. Yet the fact is that classical physics did not in practice distinguish sufficiently between philosophy of nature and the natural sciences. This led to considerable anthropomorphism and a premature sense of completeness in the medieval cosmology. But it also holds a pitfall for the historian of philosophy who may be led into a similar confusion between philosophy and the particular sciences from the side of science itself. Russell would eliminate finality entirely from philosophy because of the actual success of mechanism as a methodological convenience in certain sciences. This argument stands or falls with his identification of philosophy and science, and his reduction of other sciences to mathematical physics. Russell is more endebted to Descartes than is apparent from his approach to this philosopher. The most important facts adduced by Russell in determining Catholic subjectivism are its moral preoccupation and its indi vidualistic ethic. In accord with his general principles, Russell writes off the moral philosophy of the Middle Ages as a straining after edification at the expense of truth. The true grounds of dispute are apt to remain obscured due to Russell's concentration upon the socially beneficial results by which moralists are supposed to be guided in their thinking. The agnostic heroism of "a free man's worship" still dominates the author's, outlook, leading him to confuse edifying with expedient consequences. The moralist aims at a true reading of man's ethical situation, whatever the direction it takes. The results are not always pleasant or satisfying</page><page sequence="14">206 COMMENTARIES or socially useful in a normative science, but neither are conclusions which do promote virtuous behavior disqualified by that reason alone from the field of disinterested inquiry. Moral agnosticism has no monopoly upon the philosophical attitude unless it can be shown that human reason cannot arrive at a knowledge of God through ordinary cognitive means, and that a study of the good is resolvable into linguistic analysis (93). In this extreme position, Russell has been followed by few contemporaries. He would doubtless decry the existentialist claim that the true for me is the edifying. But he can scarcely claim to speak for philosophy itself in disowning ethics as part of practical philosophy. To support the thesis concerning a Catholic predilection for subjectivism in ethics, this History is forced to do violence to its matter. A claim is made that whereas the classical Greek philo sophers always though of man as essentially a member of a com munity, the Stoics and Christians were individualistic (598). Christianity is primarily an ethic of individual salvation; for this reason, St. Francis is unique among the saints in placing the welfare of others before his own salvation (450). Because virtue is internal and can be acquired by a man in spite of external circumstances, "there is therefore no need to seek a just social system, since social injustice affects only unimportant matters" (177). Due to their insistence upon humility and the virtuousness of the poor and humble, Christian thinkers completely rejected the intellectual virtues taught by Aristotle {ibid.). Not the social and intellectual virtues, but only the personal moral virtues are inculcated by Christian ethics (178, 297). Hence the Schoolmen took no notice of the political writings of Plato and Aristotle (509). What speculation they did upon political philosophy was directed exclusively towards a political justification of Pope and Emperor {ibid., xviii-xix). Although a later development added a theology of the Church to the theology of the individual (346), the incorporation of men into the Church as a social institution and into the imperial state is an external addition prompted by the desire for power on the part of the clerics. — It will be most effective simple to present this amazing catena aurea without comment. The sources cannot instruct a historian unless he con sults them.</page><page sequence="15">COMMENTARIES 207 Finally, Russell advances his conception of that phase of Catholic thought called Scholasticism. It began toward the end of the eleventh or the beginning of the twelfth century with Roscelin (407, 418). This late beginning is required because Scholasticism is defined by Russell as an Aristotelian movement (435). Although he lists as another mark of Scholasticism its confidence in dialectic and syllogistic reasoning, Russell gives no history either of the Scholastic method or of the development of Aristotelian logic. He does inform us that Bœthius translated Aristotle's Categories and De Emendatione (sic; 419), but from his references to Porphyry and to the problem of universals (435, 472), it is not clear whether Russell appreciates the continuity of the Aristotelian tradition in the West. The inadequacy of his clearcut division of Catholic thinkers into Platonic Fathers and Aristotelian School men is also evident in his remarks on medieval Platonism (143, 418). To say that everything was omitted from the known Plato except what was obviously religious dœs indeed make the Timaeus seem a silly source, and also makes the Chartrian cosmogony and humanism seem quite unintelligible and unworthy of mention. Russell is handicapped throughout by his omission of all the Greek Fathers except Origen, by his apparent ignorance of pseudo Dionysius (to whose "work" he refers rather darkly, 403-404), and by his failure to recognize the direct influence of Proclus' Elements of Theology and the Liber De Causis upon the Scholastic mind. The history of Catholic philosophy comes to an abrupt close with William of Occam who is called here the last original mind among the Scholastics (475). The only later Scholastic honored with personal mention is Bellarmine. Hence no account is taken even of the later development in political philosophy. More serious for the continuity and proportion of this History, it is made to appear that modern philosophy made a clean break with Scholas ticism and owed nothing to its predecessors. Thus no comparison is made between the Scholastic background and the problems and concepts found in Descartes or Spinoza or Locke. It is hardly sufficient at the present stage of scholarship to remark that all sorts of scholastic maxims are found in Descartes' positive theory of knowledge (567), or that some people questionably consider</page><page sequence="16">208 COMMENTARIES Spinoza to have been influenced by Maimonides (428). Gilson and Koyrê and Sirven, Wolfson and Dunin-Borkowski and the Guttmanns have written in vain, so far as any change in the popular account of philosophy can be detected in this History. Nor is there any recognition of the part played by the Fons Vitae, Maimonides and other Jewish sources in the growth of Scholastic philosophy itself. III. Russell and Three Catholic Philosophers. The ultimate test of a history of philosophy is the quality of its treatment of individual thinkers. In order to give a fair sampling of Russell's performance, I will consider briefly his chapters on Augustine, Boethius and Aquinas. These philosophers are chosen both because their text is well-established and because translations of their major works are available. There are a sufficient number of reliable studies upon these three figures to determine the outlines of their doctrine and historical position without more than ordinary effort. Moreover, they are all key thinkers in understanding the development of thought during the Catholic period. Hence what is said about them is a touchstone for determining the worth of a study on medieval philosophy. a) Augustine. As might be excepted, Russell devotes some interesting pages to as much of the colorful life of Augustine as can be gathered from the Confessions. He does not attempt to trace the various sources and development of Augustine's thought, although this task would be quite pertinent to the purpose of the book. He gives no indication of having consulted any writings of the bishop of Hippo other than the Confessions and The City of God. This may account for the fact that his biographical pages represent so many lost opportunities to convey something more than the well-known but always fascinating tale of the great saint's youth. Russell is vastly amused at the spectacle of Augustine devoting several chapters to the theft of worthless pears. Taking this as a sign of morbidity, Russell theorizes about the origin of the sense of sin, "Which was very strong in his day" (345). Thereby the point of the incident is lost, for Augustine was probing into the mystery of evil sought and done for its own</page><page sequence="17">COMMENTARIES 209 sake. It would indeed be an instance of abnormal preoccupation with "a boyish prank," were not Augustine pointing the way towards the real source of evil in the intention of a deliberate will. Quite naturally, this passage might have led to a discussion of the problems raised in such a treatise as the De Libero Arbitrio, but the reader will search in vain here for a study of libido, will and God as man's true good. Similarly, Russell censures Augustine (347) for not advocating gentler pedagogical methods in conjunction with his recounting of schoolboy beatings. Russell goes on to infer that a schoolmaster's blows are both a desirable and a logical part of education for one who is obsessed with sin. But Augustine draws his own con clusion in the magnificent passages in the De Magistro which defend the primacy and integrity of the learner over the human teacher, and which outline the doctrine of the inward truth and the magister interior. An historian's mettle is tested by his acquain tance with his sources and by the judgment which he exercises in their use. Russell has failed to follow through from a passage in the autobiography to some really significant exposition of Augustine's philosophy. From his testy remark that Augustine (the author of a five-fold refutation of the Manicheans and one of our chief sources for a knowledge of this sect) ought to have gone into detail about the Manichean beliefs instead of merely stating that they were wrong, the reader will draw the inevitable con clusion that Russell himself might study with benefit the details of Augustine's writings. The doctrinal study of Augustine first takes up his "pure philosophy." It turns out that for Russell "the best purely philo sophical work in Saint Augustine's writings is the eleventh book of the Confessions" (353). It cannot be denied that this passage contains one of Augustine's most penetrating analyses, but Russell confines his discussion of Augustine's pure philosophy entirely to the problem of time as set forth in the Confessions. No attention is paid to the philosophical writings of the years 386-390, which contain at least as good philosophizing as the famous inquiry into the nature of time. Due to this arbitrary limitation of Augustine's philosophy to the doctrine on time, Russell's exposition is singul arly unbalanced. The great and characteristic Augustinian themes FRANCISCAN STUDIES — 7</page><page sequence="18">210 COMMENTARIES find no place in this History. The answer to the Academics, the problem of truth and certitude, the relation of sense and reason, exemplarism and illumination, the divine will and memory, the eternal law and immortality, the conversion of the soul to God and beatitude, the existence and nature of God, the relations of reason and faith — all these pillars of Augustine's philosophy and of Christian thought for a whole age are passed over in silence. If some proportion had been maintained in the presentation of St Augustine, it is doubtful whether Russell's charge that the doctrines on time and the Cogito minister to an extremely sub jectivistic outlook (354-355) could be even plausibly advanced. It is not clear what theory of time is considered by Russell to be objective and scientific. In any case, he labels as subjectivistic any theory which admits a relational factor in time. Russell con fesses that he cannot understand why Aristotle should consider numeration essential to time (206). Consequently, he is unable to characterize the Augustinian teaching on time as distentio animi otherwise than as a doctrine which makes time only an aspect of our thoughts. Even more unhappy than this overlooking of the duration which is measured, is the assimilation of Augustine's doctrine to that of Kant. Both here and in the assertion of a simple identity between the Augustinian and Cartesian views of the Cogito, Russell omits decisive differences whose full weight could be appreciated by the reader only on condition that something more than a few quotations from the eleventh book of the Confessions and one passage from the Soliloquies were provided for compar ison. After an eight-page exposition of The City of God, Russell fears that "from the above summary, the importance of the work may not be clear" (362). His fear is justified from the philoso phical standpoint, for he has managed to make this summary without ever explaining how the two cities are constituted. This feat is accomplished by failing to recognize the importance attach ed by Augustine to the dynamism of will, the corporative power of love, the specification of ends, and the central significance of the Incarnation for time and history. Such recognition would suppose some study of the psychological and moral investigations</page><page sequence="19">COMMENTARIES 211 conducted by Augustine under apparently unrewarding theological headings. The best that can be said about Russell's account of the theology of St. Augustine is that the Pelagian controversy was an involved affair, and can be best understood in the light of the entire theory of grace. It is somewhat improbable that textual justification can be found for the statement that "all who die unbaptized, even infants, will go to hell and suffer unending torments" (365). Perhaps the main trouble is that Russell is erroneously convinced that for Augustine the City of God and the Catholic Church are coterminous, and that membership in the Church is considered to be a guarantee of salvation. b) Boethius. It is quite refreshing to find genuine admiration for Boethius in the few pages devoted to him in this History (370-373). This admiration, however, is called forth because Boethius appears to Russell as the last representative of the pagan attitude in a Christian age. Bravely ignoring the scholarship of half a century, Russell revives the Boethius familiar to readers of Gibbon. Doubt is cast upon the authenticity of all the Opuscula Sacra, which are set aside as spurious and purely theological in content. No hint is given of the logical or other writings of Boethius or of his method, although two of his translations of Aristotle are cited elsewhere. His only influence upon the medieval world is said to be in the transmission of a Platonic doctrine. The designation of Boethius as the first of the Scholastics by Grabmann and Rand would therefore make little sense to the writer of this History. I do not doubt that Russell has made a careful study of at least the Consolations (sic) of Philosophy. Yet he explains that it is written in alternating dialogue, Bcethius, in his own person, speaking in prose, and Philosophy replying in verse. Russell terms pantheistic the famous equation of God, goodness and beatitude which was already an Augustinian commonplace. There is no reason, then, to be surprised that this did not shock Christian readers. Ironically enough, Russell quotes the very passage which belies a pantheistic interpretation: "Everyone that is happy is a god, but by nature there is only one God, but there may be many by participation." The third of the Theological Tractates would</page><page sequence="20">212 COMMENTARIES have aided in the exegesis of this crucial passage, which evokes a memory of St. Peter and prepares the way for the Thomistic theory of participated and unparticipated being. I hesitate to disturb the picture of Bcethius' classic calm as portrayed here: "There is no trace of the superstition or morbid ness of the age, nor obsession with sin, no excessive straining after the unattainable" (371). Here, apparently, is the perfect antithesis to the passionate sin-ridden Augustine. Yet one need not go to the opposite position of Hildebrand and Carton in order to upset this neat contrast. The dignified style of Boethius at first reading may tend to conceal his deep involvement in the problem of evil and his need for a theodicy. But we cannot fail to detect the grave concern behind the ubi sunt verses, which echo the transiency of all things temporal down the archways of the Middle Ages. Traces of astrology and even references to magical practices have been found in Boethius by Bonnaud; Klinger has detected the influence of Christian sacred hymns upon his metre. The Boethius who counsels us on the need for purification and prayer to a personal God, on friendly commerce with a beatifying God and humility before Him, takes us beyond the merely nominal Christian of Gibbon and Russell. His Christian humanism included all that was best in pagan thought. If he did not strive for the unattainable, it was because for him the goal of all striving is no other than the God under Whose providential care we live and move. c) Aquinas. A truly formidable impression of St. Thomas is produced in this History. He is pictured as being just as purely Aristotelian as Boethius and the whole Middle Ages before him were Platonic. Even the Neoplatonism of Augustine is thought to have been distasteful to the Angelic Doctor, who almost single handedly transferred the official Catholic allegiance to Aristotle. Under this powerful patronage, Aristotle has become so revered a figure that Catholics think it impious for anyone to criticize him. No liberty of thought now remains to Catholic thinkers, for Aquinas' "system has to be taught as the only right one" (452). Aquinas showed originality only in adapting Aristotle to Christian purposes: his forte is rigid systematization of Catholic belief. He argues fairly, but the conclusions at which he is to arrive are</page><page sequence="21">COMMENTARIES 213 foregone. Propaganda, not philosophic merit, has placed him where he is. The responsibility for such a caricature lies mostly with Catholics themselves, not with Russell. They too often approach Aquinas in a thoroughly unhistoricai and uncritical way. They tend to simplify issues to the point of eliminating the many Platonic Augustinian features in his thought; they play him treason by treating Aristotle with something less than the philosophical in tegrity behind St. Thomas' treatment of him; they think it scan dalous that in the present day there should be vigorous Scotistic or Suarezian schools among Catholics. Their own repetitious and Islamic spirit has reflected unfairly upon Saint Thomas and upon those who are truly seeking to advance philosophy in the light of Thomistic principles. Russell alone, however, must be held accountable for refusing in any true sense to join issue philosophically with Aquinas. Taking the Contra Gentiles to be his most important philosophical writing, Russell considers his duty as a historian discharged when he gives a précis of the more important chapters in this work. In the medieval section of this History, there are all too many samples, abstracts and summaries, all too much talk about influences and authors cited, and all too little coming to grips with a theory in the way that Russell does come to grips with Berkeley and William James. With respect to Aquinas, Russell seems to have taken too much to heart his own advice to readers that they can come to know Spinoza without bothering to master the details of his demonstrations (572). But a Cook's tour of the chapter-headings in the Contra Gentiles is not the same thing as a philosophical treatment of the Thomistic synthesis. From among all the basic doctrines of Aquinas, Russell chooses three for his criticism. He devotes a paragraph each (462) to the indissolubility of marriage, the existence of God, and the predication of abstract and concrete terms to God. His aim in each case is to show that the reasons adduced by Aquinas in support of his teaching are demonstrably false or improbable, but that this would mean nothing to a mind which is really reliant upon faith rather than upon any reasoning which might be tactically advanced.</page><page sequence="22">214 COMMENTARIES In order to prove his point with regard to the indissolubility of marriage, Russell has recourse to a questionable expedient. The two arguments which he says constitute the ground for Aquinas are taken from the chapter on the natural character of matrimony (C.G. Ill, 122). He neither mentions nor discusses a single argument advanced in the chapter (C.G. Ill, 123) which is formally concerned with the indissolubility of marriage. In addition, his statement of these arguments is trimmed to the refutation which is to follow: "The father is useful in the educa tion of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment" (462). Aquinas did not need to wait for the modern educator to learn that men in general are not "more rational" than women, in the sense of having greater intellectual capacity for learning. From the context, however, it is evident that by ratio Aquinas here means the kind of prudent wisdom and experience which a mature man ordinarily brings with him into married life. The unique masculine contribution is not made at the expense of the woman's own special gifts, but Aquinas holds that a chid should not be deprived of the distinctive guidance and character formation which come from the father as the head of the family. When Russell adds that the modern educator would "point out that fathers, in the modern world, have scarcely any part in education," (loc. cit. ) I am at a loss to know whether he is thereby attacking Aquinas or deploring modern home life. Similarly, it is at least debatable whether the disciplining of youthful passions (and not merely corporal punish ment) is not essential to chid training. Aquinas dees not suppose, especially in moral matters, that all his arguments convey apodeic tic proof. One would gather from Russell that only insincerity can prompt a thinker to advance probable arguments even in moral philosophy. By passing over the formal problem of faith and reason, Russell wrongly implies that the relation between the natural and the supernatural teaching on marriage is a clandestine one, now at last exposed. Concerning the Thomistic proofs for God's existence, Russell has this to say: "All of these, except to one from teleology in lifeless things, depend upon the supposed impossibility of a series</page><page sequence="23">COMMENTARIES 215 having no first term. Every mathematician know that here is no such impossibility; the series of negative integers ending with minus one is an instance to the contrary" (462). This is as much discussion as we are vouchsafed on this cardinal point in Thomistic philosophy. Russell prefers to postpone his major discussion of arguments for God's existence until he takes up Leibniz, whom he considers to have expressed these arguments better than any previous thinker. In this latter context (587), he again draws upon a mathematical example in order to disprove the impossibility of an infinite series, appealing this time to the series of proper fractions having no first term. Russell's entire refutation suffers from an ignoratio elenchi. Aquinas does not maintain that every series must have a first term, for he makes it clear that this would not be impossible if the members were only accidentally related. He is considering only a series of essentially subordinated mem bers. Moreover, every philosopher should know that the argument attempts to account for a series of entities in the real order of existence, not for a series of mathematical terms. Both here and in a previous statement (455), Russell completely misses the meaning of the argument from purpose, which concerns purposive activity not in lifeless things only but in non-intelligent things, and indeed in all beings that are directed to an end. In the final paragraph of his criticism, Russell states: The contentions that God's essence and existence are one and the same, that God is His own goodness, His own power, and so on, suggest a con fusion, found in Plato, but supposed to have been avoided by Aristotle, between the manner of being of particulars and the manner of being of universals. God's essence is, one must suppose, of the nature of universals, while His existence is not. It is not easy to state this difficulty satisfactorily, since it occurs within a logic that can no longer be accepted. But it points clearly to some kind of syntactical confusion (462). The reader who is not altogether cowed by this pronouncement from the acceptable new logic incarnate will probably wish to examine the whole matter more thoroughly. He will naturally turn first to the Thomistic treatment of the divine names, where the sense in which God is concretely good is distinguished from the sense in which He is His own goodness. Then, perhaps, in order to learn why Russell should think that God's essence (which alone of all real essences is subsistent to be) is of the nature of universals, he will refer to Russell's previous chapters on Aris</page><page sequence="24">216 COMMENT ARIES totle's logic and metaphysics. There Russell is seen to be some what puzzled about the relation between universals and first and second substances (163,200), and concludes that the Aristotelian notion of essence is a most muddle-headed affair (165, 200). Unfortunately, not much more is said in clarification of these concepts by Russell, for he dees not conceive it to be within his province to trace their development from Aristotle to Aquinas. We are left with the dictum that since Aquinas merely adopts the Aristotelian philosophy, he must stand or rather fall with his muddleheaded predecessor. An unusually persistent reader may at last summon up the courage to inquire about the inadequacy of the old logic which underlies all Thomistic philosophy like a foundation of sand. Russell's reply will be found scattered throughout his History and his other works. The indictment begins with Plato, who is censured for succumbing to the infantile disease concerning relative terms, and is carried down to Leibniz (cf. 129, 202, 595, 732-733, 745 746). Indeed, no philosophy antedating Russell's own logical analysis is basically sound from the new logical viewpoint. Its thesis is that language contains three sorts of words — substan tive, adjectival and relative— which traditional logic mishandled. This older logic illegitimately transferred the first two kinds of words into descriptions of the world-structure in its theory of substance and accidents. Corresponding to this was the assumption that every proposition has a subject and predicate. As a conse quence, relative terms were overlooked, relational propositions were declared impossible, and the reality of relation itself was attacked. The subject-predicate logic leads inevitably to monism. Here I will be concerned only with the charge that traditional logic maintains the unreality of relations. The older philosophers were not unaware of the linguistic problem in connection with the doctrine of substance and accident, and in this regard they were not so naive as Russell has made them to appear in his many routine attempts to discredit metaphysics. Concerning relations, however, Russell is constantly generalizing upon the logical usage of Spinoza and Hegel. A subject-predicate logic would necessarily issue in monism only if it must hold with Spinoza "that every proposition has a single subject and a single predicate" (577),</page><page sequence="25">COMMENTARIES 217 meaning thereby that the predicate is unique and exclusive. And why must such a logic either ignore relations or seek to prove them unreal? Russell's contentions on this score cannot even be appreciated apart from the special terminology of Bradley. Is it so that if every fact consists in having some property, then "relations cannot be real, since they involve two things, not one" (733) ? In the first place, Russell has experienced great difficulty with the term "property". In his treatment of Aristotle he seems to identify it with the substantial essence (164, 200). But if such an identification is unfounded, then a thing need not consist only in having a property. Even if we retain Bradley's usage, the con sequence for relation would follow only if property is taken in an unduly restricted sense. Russell himself distinguishes between that sort of property which does not involve any other thing (quality), and that kind of property which does involve one other thing (relation). The subject-predicate logic would be antagonistic towards relation only if always took "property" in the sense of quality. Monistic logic does precisely this in the theory of internal "relations". Aristote lian philosophy, on the other hand, has always maintained the distinction between the two meanings of "property". It is em bodied in the important distinction between absolute and relative accidents, between the esse and the esse ad of accidental being. This is a problem taken up in the Aristotelian discussion of the categories. Unfortunately, it is evident from his treatment of this part of Aristotle's system (199-200) that Russell has neither sympathy with, nor understanding of, the complete Aristotelian doctrine on the categories. He does not follow the development of Aristotle's thought from the Categories to the Metaphysics, and has no notion of the Thomistic advance in the theory of categories. He fails to note that the categories are not only logical con cepts but are also classes of real being. Hence relation is matter not only for traditional logic but also for traditional metaphysics, which is at pains to defend and to explain in what precisely consists the reality of relation. Only a failure to familiarize lead Russell into the position he has taken. Here again he has been deceived by the term "theological" applied to the De Trini</page><page sequence="26">218 COMMENTARIES tate of Augustine, the Tractates of Boethius and the Summa of Aquinas. In works such as these he would have come upon the magnificent medieval treatments of the philosophical concept of relation as an aid to the understanding of the Trinity. Medieval theologians who held that the Trinity is constituted by the relation of origin among the Divine Persons would be somewhat non plussed by hearing it charged that the kind of logic they employed must necessarily lead them to ignore relations or prove them unreal. Russell has said and left unsaid other things about St. Thomas. He finds a hint of the contract theory of the origin of government in Aquinas (630); he would like to equate what Aquinas says about natural law with what Locke holds concerning the state of nature (623); he assimilates Leibniz to St. Thomas on the relation between the divine actions and the laws of logic (585). Yet he has set some sort of record in explaining both Aquinas and all other Catholic philosophers without a single mention of the notion of analogy! The nearest approach to any awareness of this con cept (not to speak of its theoretical importance and its essential bearing upon the connection of medieval philosophy with political and social circumstances) are two passing references to symbols (155, 405). Russell's final judgment upon Aquinas is that he made an epochal mistake in choosing Aristotle over Plato (478). To abandon the religious temperament of the latter for the empirical bent of the former was unwittingly to prepare the way for modern scientific naturalism. It would have been better to retreat amidst Platonic dreaming than to open the sluiceways to empirical reality. This evaluation depends for its force upon Russell's special theory of the nature of theology. For him, theology is the off spring of mathematics, a dogmatizing about the eternal and immutable truths revealed in mathematics. Every religious philo sophy must therefore pattern itself upon mathematics: it cannot base itself upon empirical evidence, but must have recourse to a so-called higher way of a priori intuition and innatism. Science, on the contrary, is based upon evidence and perception rather than upon intuition or authority (37, 269, 478, 527, 610, 835). This view is not without its historical difficulties even on</page><page sequence="27">COMMENTARIES 219 Russell's terms. It is not consequential to stress the contrast be tween the Platonic and Aristotelian outlooks, when Aristotle is declared to be only a watered-down version of Plato (162). Further, when classifying the various philosophers, Russell is forced to include Aquinas (because of his religious teaching) along with Plato among the mathematically-minded or mystical philosophers, in contradistinction to Aristotle and the other empir icists (828). We might fairly expect Russell to defend his thesis with an analysis of the actual relations between the mathematical method and Christian theology as found in Boethius, the Char trians, Aquinas, Lull and other medieval thinkers who faced the problem. Failing this, Russell ought in any case to have offered sufficient evidence to support and interpret his statement that innatism was supported throughout the Middle Ages. That it had its supporters is not to be denied; that is was by no means always the prevailing theory can only be determined by going beyond the limits of this History. Russell would leave the impression that in a religious philosophy perception must be depreciated, and mystical intuition substituted for ordinary ways of knowing. In addition, he simply assumes that all intuition must be a priori, non-empirical and even non-evidential. Hence it is understandable why Aquinas is something of a scandal and stumbling-block for this preconceived theory. This report upon Russell's section on Catholic philosophy is severely critical. I do not think it to be unduly severe. He came to the writing of this section with many preconceptions, but with little familiarity with the sources. This accounts for his many errors, important omissions, and unbalanced general estimates. These pages do not give a reliable account of philosophy during the Catholic era.
