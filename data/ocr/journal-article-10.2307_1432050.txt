<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW ideas in Kant, Buffon, and Werner. Finally, while limiting his arguments to variations between the Weimarand Leopoldina volumes, Finkprovides no comments concerning other recent editions. Such criticisms are, however, minor. Goethe's History of Science displays excellence of scholarship and superb argumentation. Provocative and innovative, Fink's book distinguishes and justifies Goethe's role in the scientific community and establishes new directions for Goethe scholarship in the field of science and literature. LORI WAGNER, University of Pennsylvania R. H. Stephenson. Goethe's Conception of Knowledge and Science (Edinburgh Studies in European Romanticism, 1). Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1995. Pp. x, 117. Cloth $69.50. Although Stephenson's preface claims "an attempt to identify the cultural significance of Goethe's scientific writings" (vii), the book seems to define itself more accurately as a defense of traditional European Goethe scholarship and terminology, rather than as a cultural study of Goethe's place in the scientific community or reception of his ideas. Broad in scope, lacking depth, and reviewing much of previous research, one realizes already in the first chapter that the book is not written for Goethe scholars, but is a polemical treatise aimed outside the discipline. A supporter of Popperian method, Stephenson seeks primarily to refute and correct misinformed ideas about Goethe's science prevalent in History of Science scholarship (21). However, the book also raises oppositions to Karl J. Fink's recent publication, Goethe's History of Science, and to recent challenges of defining "science" in the Kuhnian sense (18, 94, footnote 15). Stephenson sets out to identify Goethe within a "rationalist mentality of modern scientific thought" (3), emphasizing his morphological ideas of Bildung and process as the cornerstones of his "science." Aligning Goethe's approach to science with that of Karl Popper's empirical standpoint of tested hypotheses and problem refutation, Stephenson's arguments center primarily on Goethe's opposition to Newtonian scientific method and his synthesis of "polarities" in science and culture. Following a brief overview of Goethe's ideas on history of science, language, communication, contemplation, and aesthetic perception (chapters 3-5), Stephenson closes with a good, solid chapter discussing Goethe's distinction between "amateurism" and "dilettantism," the importance ofAnschauen in scientific method, and the view of art and science as a "whole activity" (91). The valuable points in Stephenson's study are unfortunately obscured for most part by inadequate definitions of terms, vague simplicities, ambiguities, and blanket labeling. Many arguments are not successfully supported, others are prone to 378</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS misinterpretation due to lack of clarity (such as a comment made concerning Goethe's "embrace of Vulcanist theory"[ 9]). Using "culture" as a catchword for his own agenda, Stephenson tends to systematize Goethe within a mass of terminology and labels, sometimes out of context; other terms, such as "modern," "science," and "symbol" remain undefined and nonspecific. Supportive quotes are frequently overemphasized or distorted (such as comments on quantitative methods [3, 4, 86]), and terms such as "dynamism," "mechanism," and "progress" are given questionable definitions (37). Chapter 6 identifies "knowledge" and "science" as the "two poles of culture," while maintaining that "science aspires to knowledge" (92). Finally, Stephenson critiques and misinterprets Karl Fink's Kuhnian approach, yet he goes on to support similar premises within his own text, such as Goethe's need for history of science within science (36, 39), his anthropomorphism (44), identification of language as metaphorical (45), cultural (26), and as medium of expression (63), narrative as communication (68), and science as value-laden (44). Although the bibliography is extensive enough, most of the quoted references on Goethe and science are pre-1985 with the exception of Amrine, and Stephenson rarely quotes primary sources other than Goethe. Problematic despite good intentions, Stephenson's overpriced text promises more than it delivers. While serving perhaps as a "corrective" to History of Science scholars, the book offers little to current Goethe research. LORI WAGNER, University of Pennsylvania Katharina von Hammerstein. Sophie Mereau-Brentano: Freiheit-Liebe-Weiblichkeit. Trikolore sozialer und individueller Selbstbestimmung um 1800. Beitrage zur neueren Literaturgeschichte, Dritte Folge, Band 132. Heidelberg: Universitits Verlag C. Winter, 1994. Pp. 325. Cloth DM 98.00, OS 764.00, Sfr 98.00. Katharina von Hammerstein, editor of Sophie Mereau-Brentano's Werkausgabe (Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1995) as well as of the forthcoming new edition of the writer's novellas, originally began exploring Mereau's literary and personal writings in her UCLA dissertation. Now the latest critical monograph on Mereau-Brentano (1770-1806), the study provides a thematic literary portrait of this until recently neglected woman writer. Inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution but trapped in a German political climate that pushed her, like most of her peers, into a merely contemplative role, Mereau naively expected love to act as a utopian force towards freedom and social change. In her tripartite study, Hammerstein first analyzes Mereau's concept of freedom, then looks at her male and female protagonists in order to see whether these accept or rebel against the gender roles of their time, and finally examines how Mereau's idea of freedom determined the heterosexual love relationships in her fiction. 379</page></plain_text>
