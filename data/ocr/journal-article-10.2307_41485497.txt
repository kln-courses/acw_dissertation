His research interests include philosophy of social theory, discourse theory, decon- struction, and theories of International Relations. Is social theory possible without a positive ontology? Do we need ontology as the very first step toward/of theorisation? Is or isn't ontology a consequence of the theo- risation process? Is a meta-theory/theory delineation nothing more than a rhetorical/ discursive artifice? If that were the case, why should we give priority to one assump- tion/consequence (for example, ontology) over others? What are the conditions of possibility and/or limitations for giving priority to any ontological assumption? It is almost unthinkable among social scientists nowadays to envision a formulation of social theory that does not posit an ontological beginning point, that is, by making explicit/implicit assumptions on the most basic entities - subjects, objects, agents, structures, and/or processes - that one takes to be the foundations of the (world-) view being explored or posited. This is usually considered a theoretical necessity of, as much as a desire for, soundness driven by our conception of what theorising means, or should mean. The issue is even put at the heart of what politics is, or is about. 'Politics is the terrain of competing ontologies', says Wight.1 He, and, well before him, Walker,2 and Wendt,3 as well as most of today's social scientists, all assert that theories necessarily presuppose a basic positive ontology upon which all other con- siderations are built and that there is no social theory without ontology . This article recognises that we need to speak of the ontological for social theory to be possible. Yet the article rejects the dogma of positive ontology (termed as onto- logismi) and raises the question: Is it possible to speak of the ontological without ontology ? Is it possible to formulate social theory without ontology? The answer is a qualified yes; a yes based on a logic which neither negates nor affirms ontology, all the while rejecting ontologism. As strange as this position might sound I think that although ontology is always a discursive construction it is not possible to formulate a social 1 Colin Wight, Agents, Structures and International Relations: Politics as Ontology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 2. 2 R.

The issue then is not that we jettison ontology. I propose that we instead forego ontologism, which means that we need to rethink ontology qua ontological discourse without positing ontology qua ontolo- gism. We thus need a logic of thinking about the ontological which retains ontology ' without ' ontologism, a sort of ontological without the 'essence' of ontology. Draw- ing on Derrida, I call this logic the logic of 4 without ' {sans). I am thus calling for a displacement of the logic underpinning our thinking about the ontological toward a logic of the ontological 'without' ontology.4 Yet, if there is no ontologism, what then defines the ontological? I suggest that we need to replace what the critical realists take as ontological entities/processes with something which is neither an ontology nor non-ontology and is a little bit of both at the same time. To this end, I suggest that we focus on the presuppositions in terms of which it is possible to speak (or not speak) of ontology as a discourse. I explicitly propose to think of the ontological as khôra , a pseudo-notion which does not possess any determination of its own except by assuming the role of a 'receptacle' (of sorts) to determinations and which operates through the logic of 'without'. The first section of the article provides a brief summary on the issue of ontology as presented by Wight.5 The section also briefly discusses the position that Bhaskar takes on ontology in his 1993 book Dialectic .6 Bhaskar rejects ontologism - termed as the dogma of ontological monovalence - and makes absenting absence (real nega- tivity) the ground of any ontological foundation.7 The next section of the article goes beyond Bhaskar's suggestion through a questioning of the very logic of the existence (or non-existence) of ontological foundation either as negativity or positivity. I argue that Bhaskar's focus on real negativity is a thinking of ontology based on a mode which is reminiscent of negative theology.8 The next section discusses the mode of negative theology and its Derridean deconstruction which instead of completely re- jecting negative theology generalises it using the logic of 'without' and the notion of khôra. Building on this I suggest a new way of thinking the ontological in social theory as khôra- logical, which allows us to go beyond the 'via negativity' and 'via ontologism' modes of theorising. I end the article by addressing the issue of relevance 4 The logic of 'without' functions through the expression 'without without without' which is a translation of the Derrida pseudo-concepts of 'pas sans pas' and ' sans sans sans' Jacques Derrida, Parages (Paris: Éditions de Galilée, 1986); Jacques Derrida, The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1987); Jacques Derrida, The Truth in Painting (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1987). 5 Wight, Agents, Structures and International Relations. 6 Roy Bhaskar, Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom (London: Verso, 1993). 7 Bhaskar does not reject his previous work since, as summarised by Patomäki, 'in Dialectic (or Plato etc.) there is no systematic reassessment of earlier concepts and arguments but rather an indication that dialectical CR is simply a new and fully consistent layer added on top of the foundation of CR (i.e. Realist Theory and Naturalism).'' I thank the reviewer for alerting me to this aspect of Bhaskar's oeuvre. Heikki Patomäki, 'After Critical Realism? The Relevance of Contemporary Science', Journal of Critical Realism, 9:1 (2010), pp. 59-88, 62, fn. 11. 8 My task is in some ways similar to Patomäki who states that 'the point is not to replace CR with another philosophical position, or to launch an overall attack against the arguments of Realist Theory and Naturalism, but to show important ambiguities and limitations of CR and indicate a non-sectarian and future-oriented way forward'. Patomäki, 'After Critical Realism?', p. 62. Although I sense the importance of his critique, I do not think that he is going far enough from the 'Bhaskarian' spirit or path since he seeks to re-place all Bhaskarian adoptions of 'science' with more contemporary ones. I think that this is overdue but yet still doesn't go far enough to raise the questions that I pose in this article, questions that, for example, some physicists are raised nowadays (see, for example, Bernard d'Espagnat, On Physics and Philosophy (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006).</page><page sequence="3">Khôra as the condition of possibility 193 to International Relations (IR) research of this way of rethinking ontology via a decon- struction of a taken for granted delineation of philosophical ontology from scientific / social ontology. Critical Realist ontology and Bhaskar's dialectic Critical realists (following Bhaskar)9 argue that IR theorists have for the most part either followed a positivist approach in theorising or fallen into the trap of an epistemic fallacy by conflating ontology with epistemology in the sense that 'only that which can be known can exist.' Instead, critical realists argue that there is a reality 'out there', even if humanity did not know it. In Bhaskar's terms, we have 'intransitive' objects that are independent of, and transcend human knowledge of them.10 Thus, reality is made up of transitive and intransitive objects, with only the former contex- tually dependent on human knowledge. Critical realists seek to reinstate to intran- sitive objects - that is, ontological entities - their due role in IR theory. Yet this should not lead us to an ontological fallacy which fails to recognise 'the construc- tional role of discursive elements in relation to ontology, (and thus the discursive rela- tivity of social ontologies and ontological features)', and which insists 'on the search for ontological features independent of discursive knowledge.'11 Is it possible to avoid simultaneously both the epistemic and ontological fallacies? Yet, why do we feel obligated to avoid these fallacies in the first place? Perhaps, we can also ask: Is it possible to sustain both 'fallacies' and that instead of having an 'either-or' situation we might have a 'both-and' situation? Is it possible to fall neither in the ontological fallacy nor the epistemic fallacy and perhaps accept bits of both at the same time, that is, a situation of ' neither-nor ' and ' both-anďl This line of questioning is definitely not logical if one adheres to the logic of inquiry that rejects contradictions as unacceptable, as illogical. The 'logic' behind rejecting something as being a 'fallacy' is at stake here. Perhaps what conventionally counts as fallacy is instead a source of deep insight that, if adequately rethought, might help us conceptualise better social theory as a discourse. This indeed is the task, or at least motivation, of this article. Instead of rejecting this or that 'fallacy', I argue, following Derrida, that we need to deconstruct the conven- tional either-or logic underpinning the notion of fallacy by showing how under a more generalised logic of ' neither-nor ' and ' both-and ' - a logic that combines both mutual exclusion and participation - we would not have to and cannot prioritise ontology over epistemology, or vice versa for that matter. We need a different logic, a logic that does not from the outset reject contradictions and where, more generally, aporias do have a role to play. In such a logic, contradictions, paradoxes, inconsis- tencies, and aporias could be thought of as constitutive of conceptuality, argumenta- tion, and the discourse. Bhaskar's thinking on the possibility of naturalism in social 9 Roy Bhaskar, The Possibility of Naturalism (Sussex: Harvester, 1979). 10 I think it worthwhile mentioning Patomäki's recent work in which he quite persuasively uses a Bhaskarian scheme (so to speak) to refute Bhaskar's lack of attention to contemporary science, thereby shaking the ground beneath Bhaskar's approach to the possibility of naturalism in social sciences by raising fatal questions about Bhaskar's intransitives.

Rejecting what he termed as dogmatic ontological monovalence,12 that is, taking positive ontological entities as foundations, Bhaskar asserts that 'negativity is consti- tutively essential to positivity . . . Non-being is a condition of possibility of being.'13 Bhaskar argues that 'non-being exists' and that 'non-being has ontological priority over being'.14 Bhaskar hence considers real determinate absence, or, as he also terms it, absenting absence and negativity, as a foundational property of the ontological status of reality itself.15 This makes reality one where 'negativity is a condition of positive being.'16 Although Dialectic Critical Realism is to some extent the state of the art in Bhaskar's approach, it has yet to find its way into the discourse of IR critical realists, give or take a very casual reference here and there.17 Yet Bhaskar has intended to generalise and deepen his approach to social science - the 1979 possibility of naturalism - with his dialectical critical naturalism,18 which makes negativity or the absenting absence as the ground for everything else . This raises a serious problem for critical realists who still advocate (positive) ontology. It indeed would mean that what comes first (that is, a positive ontology) is not really first after all. It is missing something, which, because it is missing, is not ontological, since we are talking about ontology as a first ground. Ontology in the 1993 sense of Bhaskar, as origin, is thus not originary enough for it needs something else - a non-being - to be as such. Non-being is con- stitutive of being and is its ground of ontological existence as such. Yet Bhaskar is still falling prey to a serious problem - that of resorting to the thinking mode of negative theology (of sorts). While Dialectic Critical Realism is not a negative theology per se, it however shares some of the dangers and weaknesses that negative theology falls prey to. I next summarise the general contours of nega- tive theology and then present Derrida's deconstruction of it. The mode of negative theology and the logic of 'without' Negative theology is a mode of thinking and speaking - or, more appropriately, of how to avoid thinking and speaking - about God, without falling into the error of 12 Ontological monovalence is based on the premise that 'any instance of real negation can be analyzed in purely positive terms', Bhaskar, Dialectic , p. 7. 13 Ibid., p. 46. 14 Ibid., p. 39, emphasis in original. 15 Ibid., pp. 4-5. 16 Ibid., p. 47. 17 As pointed out by Patomäki, who is by no means an enemy of Critical Realism (CR), 'many of those students who become interested in CR do not apply CR ideas to doing better substantive research but, rather, are content to iterate Bhaskar's criticisms of positivist and post-positivist approaches, in spite of contrary advice', and that 4o a significant degree, the foundational, texts of CR - Realist Theory and Naturalism - have indeed, been beyond philosophical and scientific criticism within the critical realist, camp.' It is remarkable that Patomäki is presenting one of the strongest 'internal' critiques of Bhaskar's Critical Realism in this article (Patomäki, 'After Critical Realism?', pp. 60-1). This is to be contrasted with his 2002 book which falls more squarely within more conventional readings of Critical Realism (although one should mention that Patomäki does bring in elements from Habermasian and Foucauldian thinkings in an attempt to go beyond certain Bhaskarian strictures).

The only path which is left as a way of speaking and thinking of God is negation. Critics charge that negative theology is nihilistic, empty speech, that it defeats the purpose of speech, and that 'the pushing of negations to their hyperbolic limit, the compounding of the negations of negations ends up, in Hegelian style, at God or some kind of asymptote, as the guarantor of negativity leading to truth.'21 Negative theology is one example of a general mode of thinking and speaking wherein we speak of what the thing cannot be or is not. The thing in itself is thus a pure transcendental, extra-linguistic, and cannot be appropriated through any dis- course or language. The claims that this mode makes by negating them are every- thing that the thing in itself cannot be. This leads to major conceptual, logical, and linguistic difficulties since 'every claim to the "things themselves" is a claim within and by means of the resources of certain semi-systems, linguistic and otherwise, situated within the framework of a complex set of contextual presuppositions which can never be saturated.'22 Negative theology has as a result become 'a reserve of language, almost inexhaustible in so few words.'23 The literature of negative theology thus 'holds desire in suspense, and always saying too much or too little, each time it leaves you without ever going away from you.'24 Much of the controversy on/in negative theology revolves around the issue of whether by stating that God is a Being that is beyond beings negative theology ends up jeopardising the very 'negativeness' that it uses to define its own discourse. This is the issue that Derrida sought to address in his deconstruction of negative theology, and, more generally, the via negativae in any discourse. Derrida's line of attack addresses the core question of 'how to avoid speaking?' Because speaking, writing, and thinking are all expressed in a language and because language always precedes us, this leads Derrida to conclude that 'at the moment when the question "how to avoid speaking?" is raised and articulates itself in all its modalities - whether in rhetorical or logical forms of saying, or in the simple fact of speaking - it is already, so to speak, too late'25 One has already spoken, if only to affirm that one is not speaking. Derrida makes it clear that 'there cannot be an absolutely negative discourse: a logos necessarily speaks about something; it cannot avoid speaking of something; it is impossible for it to refer to nothing.'26 How can negative theology then pretend to be speaking of 'not speaking of God and of the beyond of being' even if it portrays these as unspeakable?

When negative theology engages in a 'sweet rage against language', when it shows a 'jealous anger of language within itself and against itself', when it demon- strates a 'passion that leaves the mark of a scar in that place where the impossible takes place',27 this amounts to a 'wounded, breached, auto-deconstructing' discourse which is nothing but an affirmative end, an end that is affirmed and not negated.28 This makes negative theology fall prey to the logic of the double bind of negation / dénégation. On the one hand, negating the name of God, and, on the other hand, simultaneously negating everything else except the name God. Not surprisingly, negative theology is thus a positive onto-theology - it refuses to positively attribute determinations to God but only as a way of affirming a super-essentiality of God.29 Negative theology seeks to negate without negating and to affirm without affirm- ing. There are thus, says Derrida, two movements within the discourse of negative theology: On the one hand ... the principle of negative theology, in a movement of internal rebellion, radically contests the tradition from which it seems to come . . . Negative theology uproots itself from there after the fact [après coup], in the torsion or conversion of a second movement of uprooting . . . But on the other hand , and in that very way, nothing is more faithful than this hyperbole to the originary ontotheological injunction . . . when one says: 'God is not', 'God is neither this nor that, neither that nor its contrary' or 'being is not', etc., even then it is still a matter of saying the entity [étant] such as it is, in its truth, even were it meta-metaphysical, meta-ontological.30 This logic of 'without' is what makes it possible for negative theology to always say 'too much or too little' and to leave 'you without ever going away from you.'31 The logic of 'without' is best represented in the simultaneously negative and affirmative meaning that the term without is given in the following statements on God by St. Augustine: 'God is wise without wisdom'; God is 'good without goodness'; God is 'powerful without power.' What is the effect of this logic of 'without' that seems to empty out the meaning of terms all the while affirming them, but yet without com- pletely turning them into empty signifiers? Derrida argues that the 'without' in St. Augustine's statements 'does not merely dissociate the singular attribution from the essential generality: wisdom as being-wise in general, goodness as being-good in general, power as being-powerful in general.'32 The strange logic of 'without' 'does not only avoid the abstraction tied to every noun and to the being implied in every essential generality.'33 What also happens is that 'in the same word and in the same syntax', the 'without' acts so that 'it transmutes into affirmation its purely phenomenal negativity.' The logic of 'without' seeks to account for what 'the principle of the good' which not only is beyond being, but also simulta- neously 'transcends the good.' We thus get a notion of God as 'the good that tran- scends the good and the being that transcends being.'34 27 Derrida, On the Name , pp. 59-60. 28 Caputo, Prayers and Tears , p. 43. 29 Arthur Bradley, 'Thinking the Outside: Foucault, Derrida and Negative Theology', Textual Practice , 16:1 (2002), pp. 57-74, 59. 30 Derrida, On the Name , p. 68. 31 Ibid., p. 85. 32 Jacques Derrida, Psyche : Inventions of the Other.

Or again, a reply without reply? The same word and the same thing seem removed from themselves, taken away from their reference and their identity, while continuing to be left to traverse, in their old body towards an entirely other [tout autre], dissimulated in them. But not [pas] more than in pas; this operation does not consist simply in depriving or denying, it is necessary in itself. It forms the trace or the step [pas] of the entirely other about which it is concerned, the retreat [re-trait] of the pas, and of the pas without pas?1 The logic of 'without' is characterised by three main features. First, although there is no repetition of meaning without change, it is also true that no change could completely eradicate the trace of previous meanings. There is always a process of simultaneous iteration and change. As put by Bradley, 'every word or thing ... is without itself, that is, in a process of play between its old body and an entirely new other.'38 Second, Derrida explains that the without 'marks neither a privation, a lack nor an absence ... it has the double and ambiguous meaning of what is above in a hierarchy, thus both beyond and more. God (is) beyond Being but as such is more (being) than Being: no more being and being more than Being : being more.'39 This is expressed in French as ' plus d'être9 . Third, the logic of 'without' is neither one of reversing a meaning to its opposite, nor one of double negation which takes us back to the original term. Nor is it one of Hegelian dialectic sublation that progresses towards a higher notion. The logic of 'without' is a sort of a tripartite negation of 'without without without', 'step without step', 'not without not', ('pas sans pas');40 it is 'a negativity without negativity [sans sans sans]';41 it is a 'conjunction-disjunction.'42 Negative theology tries to escape the logic of 'without', which always breaches and ruptures its discourse, by attempting to eject the 'transcendental' from the front door but only to bring it from the back door in a even more 'purified' or 'essentialised' version, in the form of a super-essentiality, thereby practicing a logic of contraband against its own discourse. Deconstruction seeks to save negative theology from seek- ing such a closure,43 that is, saving negative theology from the ultimate goal of negative theology. The solution consists in moving negative theology from the logic of contraband to a grammatology that would inscribe it and exceed it without return.44 This is what Derrida suggests through a reading of Plato's Timaeus from which he takes the notion of khôra (receptacle), but as expected, by displacing it 35 Ibid., pp. 178-9. 36 Arthur Bradley, 'Without Negative Theology: Deconstruction and the Politics of Negative Theology', HeyJ , XLII (2001), pp. 133-47, 136. 37 Derrida, Parages , p. 90. 38 Bradley, 'Without Negative Theology', pp. 136-7. 39 Derrida, Psyche: Inventions of the Other.

Derrida's purpose in deconstructing negative theology is neither to negate it, nor to jettison it, nor is it to affirm it. The goal is to probe into the presuppositions and conditions of possibility and limitations of the discourse of negative theology. Khôra qua receptacle Plato's Timaeus presents khôra as neither being a form nor a sensible thing. Rather, it is the place wherein 'the demiurge45 impresses or cuts images of the intelligible paradigms, the place which was already there, which, while radically heterogeneous with the forms, seems to be as old as the forms.'46 Khôra , termed as a place of a third kind, belongs 'neither to becoming, nor to non-being (the khôra is never described as a void), nor to Being.'47 The khôra is quite unique in its singularity for it defies our common sense of thinking and speaking of 'things' in this world, as either ideal or material. Neither does 'is' apply to it, nor can it be used with khôra , nor does its logical opposite 'is not' apply to khôra either. 'This nonbeing cannot but be declared , that is, be caught or conceived, via the anthropomorphic schémas of the verb to receive and the verb to give' says Derrida.48 Khôra is not 'a support or a subject which would give place by receiving or by conceiving, or indeed by letting itself be conceived', states Derrida.49 Nor is khôra a sort of super-sensible that can be referred to through a play of metaphors. The discourse of/about khôra is neither a metaphor nor does it deploy metaphors as logical or rhetorical tools. Khôra is a Greek word. Yet khôra , as used in Plato's Timaeus , does not have a meaning (at least not in the usual sense of the term meaning). Khôra is a receptacle , but one which is radically different from the usual sense of the term. Having no meaning in itself, no essence, and no identity, it nonetheless 'receives all without becoming anything.'50 If khôra is a receptacle, does this make khôra a location, a place? Are we speaking of 'a place of a place'? Derrida argues that ' khôra is over there but more "here" than any "here".'51 In arguing so, Derrida is in fact displacing the meaning of 'place' as we are accustomed to using the word in a positive (or even negative) sense.52 Derrida explains that this 'place' 'is not that in which is found a subject or an object. It is found in us.'53 However, khôra 'will always already be occupied, invested, even as a general place, and even when it is distinguished from everything that takes place in it.'54 Khôra , not a place, 'marks a place apart, the spacing which keeps a dissym- metric relation to all that which, "in herself", beside or in addition to herself, seems to make a couple with her.'55 If khôra is always occupied, can we temporally 'dis- tinguish' khôra from what occupies it? Derrida proposes that 'in order to think 45 Demiurge - joining together demos (people) and ergos (worker) - is in Platonism what shaped the material world. 46 Caputo, Prayers and Tears , p. 35. 47 Derrida, 'How to Avoid Speaking', p. 105. 48 Derrida, On the Name , p. 95. 49 Ibid. 50 Caputo, Prayers and Tears , pp. 35-6. 51 Derrida, On the Name , p. 56. 52 Derrida, 'How to Avoid Speaking', p. 105. 53 Derrida, On the Name , p. 57. 54 Ibid., p. 109. 55 Ibid., pp. 124-5.</page><page sequence="9">Khôra as the condition of possibility 199 khôra , it is necessary to go back to a beginning that is older than the beginning, namely, the birth of the cosmos, just as the origin of the Athenians must be recalled to them from beyond their own memory.'56 This implies that khôra is neither historical nor temporal. Although there is khôra , 'nothing happens through it and nothing happens to it' in time, in history, which makes it completely absent from historical change and not an agent of historical change; it is ahistorical and atemporal.57 Does the khôra have any determination at all? According to Plato 'khôra is "amorphous" ' at the level of its 'beingness'58 since the very 'beingness' of khôra is neither being nor non-being, let alone any other determination that the khôra might be thought to have. That the khôra 'must remain without form and without proper determination' is required for the khôra to be able 'to receive all and allow itself to be marked or affected by what is inscribed in it.'59 Yet, khôra does have what can be termed as pseudo-determinations. Khôra is selfless, escapes the realm of metaphors, and follows the logic of 'without'. First, a pseudo-determination of the khôra is that it 'receives' determinations without possessing or appropriating them. It gives place to determinations without turning them or experiencing them as its own properties, hence the name of receptacle .60 However, although the khôra receives as receptacle it does not become, nor could it be likened to, 'its sensible imprints, which vanish from it without a trace' in it.61 The khôra is a working receptacle that receives without having a receiving self, a self as receptacle. A second pseudo-determination of the khôra is that metaphors cannot be used to determine it, the reason being that it would mean attributing some borrowing from the 'sensible' or 'intelligible' forms. This would not work because these borrow- ings are themselves inscribed in the khôra , which is neither sensible nor intelligible. Derrida explains that the reason has to do with the fact that 'the discourse on khôra is no longer a discourse on being, it is neither true nor probable and appears thus to be heterogeneous to myth.'62 Derrida also explains that 'if khôra is a receptacle, if it/she gives place to all the stories, ontologie or mythic, that can be recounted on the subject of what she receives and even of what she resembles but which in fact takes place in her, khôra herself, so to speak, does not become the object of any tale , whether true or fabled.'63 A third pseudo-determination of the khôra is that it cannot be spoken of within an Aristotelian logic of 'either this or that', 'yes or no'. All attempts to describe it or understand it can only be done using the phrase 'neither this . . . nor that'. 6Khôra' says Derrida, 'seems to defy that "logic of noncontradiction of the philosophers" . . . that logic of "binarity, of the yes or no".'64 The khôra follows a logic that might, for example, accept as a principle or axiom the invalidation of the principle of non- contradiction as well as the principle of contradiction. Derrida explains that 'at times 56 Ibid., p. 126. 57 Derrida, 'How to Avoid Speaking', p. 107. 58 John D.

The logic of khôra is the logic of 'without'. Because khôra does not possess anything proper to it, in order to 'work (in French: travail )' as receptacle it has to borrow 'tools' - concepts, ideas, discourse, etc. - from whatever is being received in the khôra. The khôra is deployed as infrastructure in a discourse and 'the discourse on khôra thus plays for philosophy a role analogous to the role which khôra "herself" plays for that which philosophy speaks of, namely, the cosmos', in Plato's Timaeus .66 Hence, to be deployed, for example, in negative theology, the khôra would have to use 'tools' from negative theology itself. The khôra , which is a desert of sorts, becomes 'the site where "negative theology" and its "analogates" happen.'67 Note that although the discourse on the khôra seems to be forming an inversion of the Platonist discourse on the Good as beyond Being and Christian Neoplatonist discourse of God as beyond Being, it is not strictly speaking an inversion. Although it seems that we have, on the one hand, in the Platonist and Christian Neoplatonist discourses, 'a hyper-essential sur-reality for which words fail us, of which words fall short' and, on the other hand, in the discourse on the khôra , 'a hypo-essential sub- reality, an almost unreal, indeterminable indeterminacy which seems rather to fail words, to fall short of word or meaning',68 this opposition is however misleading. The khôra is the 'place' that makes possible the discourse on the Good and God, on the hyper-essentiality and the hypo-essentiality, receiving all without making any as its own. Likewise, I argue, the khôra is the receptacle and the 'place' for Bhaskar's real negative and for the positive ontology of the critical realists.69 65 Ibid. 66 Ibid., p. 126. 67 Caputo, Prayers and Tears , p. 54. 68 Caputo, Deconstruction in a Nutshell , p. 96. 69 As pointed out by the reviewer, Bhaskar's book ' From East to West ' addresses the topic of God and related metaphysical issues. I think that this work deserves more than just a mention in a footnote. Indeed, in this work Bhaskar engages Bhaskar against Bhaskar for another more or less different Bhaskar; a call for a work of deconstruction. Roy Bhaskar, From East to West: Odyssey of a Soul (New York: Routldge, 2000). Without pretending to be able to explain herein the full play of logic, grammar, rhetoric, and concepts that Bhaskar is struggling to clarify, it seems to me that he is both stuck within a hyper-essentiality mode of speaking of man and God and, at the same time, seeking to go beyond (see, for example, p. x and p. 47). Yet Bhaskar (p. ix) had nonetheless already retreated and circumscribed his task by declaring upfront in this book that 'the essential thesis of this book is that man is essentially God (and therefore also essentially one, but also essentially unique); and that, as such, he is essentially free and already en-lightened, a freedom and enlightenment which is overlain by extraneous, heterono- mous determinations which (a) occlude and (b) qualify this essential fact. To reclaim and realise his essential freedom, man has to shed both the illusion that he is not essentially Godlike and free and the constraining heteronomous determinations (constituting an objective world of illusion, duality and alienation) which that illusion grounds. To become free or realize his freedom man must thus shed both the illusions that he is not (essentially) and that he is (already, only and completely) free!' I think that Bhaskar is trying to reach closure too soon too fast and thereby falling back into the metaphysics of presence (or absence for that matter). It seems that in this book Bhaskar is a hyper-Hegelian, more Hegelian than Hegel or any of his disciples. I think that ultimately many of these tensions in Bhaskar's thinking, as it has always been the case, are in part related to the fact that he has not developed a philosophy or theory of 'sign', 'language', and semiotics' (ironically, despite his opposition to what he terms as 'linguistic fallacy', (pp. 25, 26)). As put by Nellhaus, 'the critical realist philosophy of Roy Bhaskar has not provided an adequate account of signs. Indeed, in two of his recent books (1993,</page><page sequence="11">Khôra as the condition of possibility 201 Khôra as the condition of possibility of the ontological How are we to think that the khôra is the receptacle for Bhaskar's discourse on real negativity (or non-being as the foundation of being) and for the critical realists' dis- course on the intransitives of positive ontology? First, the logic of 'without' blurs, on the one hand, the delineation between non-being and being, and, on the other hand, the delineation between intransitives and transitives. Bhaskar can speak of non-being only by using speech, which is a being. This means that we have a non-being without non-beingness since it is within a being (a speaking), a part of a being. Likewise, critical realists' intransitives are intransitives without intransitivity (at their core if we can term it in this way) since they can only be spoken of within transitive discourses. Second, is it possible to generalise Bhaskar's discourse about non-being so as to displace the hierarchy that he creates between non-being and being? He states that 'if there was a unique beginning to everything, it could only be from nothing by an act of radical autogenesis.'70 Yet he does not address the seeming contradiction between speaking of the possibility of a unique beginning to everything and speaking of an act of radical autogenesis. Is the latter part of 'the everything' that uniquely begins through autogenesis? Isn't he positing a beginning, or a condition, that 'is' before the unique beginning to everything? Or perhaps, more accurately, isn't he saying that the possibility of an act of autogenesis has to precede the possibility of a unique beginning to everything? For the possibility of an act of autogenesis to be possible before the possibility of everything, the possibility of such an act 'emerges' in a 'place', a 'receptacle' which does not 'exist', in a receptacle which 'is' without being a being. Isn't this precisely how khôra works in a discourse about beginning, just like in Timaeus' s discourse on the evolution of the cosmos? Khôra is thus the condition of possibility that is presupposed in Bhaskar's discourse on real negativity (or non- being) as the condition of possibility of being. Bhaskar further clarifies that ' if there was an originating Absolute, nothing would be its schema or form, constituted at the moment of initiation by the spontaneous disposition to become something other than itself.'71 The italicised 'г/" is probably meant to emphasise that Bhaskar is speaking of a potentiality not actually affirming that this is what happens. However, this reading cannot be accurate since real nega- tivity will not be the unique beginning. Yet if we were to assume that Bhaskar thinks that this is a plausible scenario then he runs into trouble because in the very same statement he is speaking of 'disposition to become'. Doesn't this imply that the 1994) Bhaskar devotes merely a diagram and two pages of sketchy text toward analysing the sign struc- ture, even though without signs, meanings are literally unthinkable. The undertheorisation of signs results in theoretical and political difficulties. For example, the exact ontological status of signs and meanings is unclear, which casts a shadow over Bhaskar's larger ontological framework, especially since he holds that society is 'concept-dependent.' Tobin Nellhaus, 'Signs, Social Ontology, and Critical Realism', Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour , 28 (1998), pp. 1-24, 1. Moreover, Bhaskar makes 'categorial realism' (pp. 33-9) an indispensable element of Transcendental Dialectic Critical Realism. Yet he never engaged in a sustained analysis/deconstruction of the very concept of 'category', or, more precisely, 'the category of category' or 'categoriality'. In this respect Bhaskar remains very Aristotelian in his approach to language, despite the fact that his philosophy is a sustained practice of continuous linguistic/categorial bifurcation upon bifurcation, even when augmented with borrowings from East Asian languages/systems of belief and thoughts (for a deconstruction of 'categoriality' see: Jacques Derrida, 'The Supplement of Copula: Philosophy before Linguistics', in Jacques Derrida, Margins of Philosophy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 175-205. 70 Bhaskar, Dialectic , p. 46, emphasis in original. 71 Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">202 Badredine Arft Absolute is not absolutely the beginning? Where does the disposition come from, or perhaps, where is it located? One solution to this difficulty is again to resort to khôra. As noted by Derrida, khôra 'marks a place apart, the spacing which keeps a dis- symmetric relation to all that which, "in herself", beside or in addition to herself, seems to make a couple with her.'72 This means that within a discourse on real nega- tivity, khôra would have been a receptacle wherein there is a dissymmetry between the real negativity and the discourse that speaks of it in terms of Absolute and dis- position to become. The khôra works within such a discourse as the deployment of a discourse of originary performativity which speaks of a retroactively-positing of an autogenesis of the Absolute and its spontaneous disposition to become something. There is no Absolute or disposition to become qua discourse prior to or outside this double discourse about real negativity - an originary performative discourse which deploys a discourse of as-if the Absolute emerges through autogenesis. Therefore, khôra works through the event of 'saying the non-being'. And 'saying the non-being' is all there 'is'; all what there 'is' is a discourse of/on the non-being. The key feature of the event is discursively equipped with a khôral quality in the sense that the event occurs in a receptacle which does not possess any determinations of its own. The receptacle or khôra is the mode of 'saying' which is constitutive of the event of 'saying real negativity' and which does not exist apart from 'saying real negativity'.73 In sum: I propose that we think of the ontological as neither positive nor negative but as one which is both at the same time without assuming a sublation that would generate a Hegelian unity of higher order. How? I propose to rethink the ontological in terms of its ontologicality, that is, the presuppositions that form the conditions of possibility of the discourse on the ontological. I suggest that these can be thought of in terms of khôra. We should thus think of the ontologicality of 'the ontological without ontologism' within the logic of 'without', the logic of ' neither-nor ' and ' both-anď - a logic that combines both mutual exclusion and participation. There is a sort of partial emptying and erasure of the property 'ontology' from the 'ontological', with the result that it is neither a real negativity in the 1993 sense of Bhaskar, nor a positive intransitive in the sense of the critical realists; rather, it is the condition of possibility to real negativity and positive intransitives. Relevance to Concrete' IR research and more What is, some might argue, the relevance of this way of thinking for 'concrete' re- search in IR?74 This is an important issue. Yet I think that there is another question that needs to be addressed first. Indeed, raising the issue of 'concrete' research seems to be taking for granted the possibility of delineation between philosophical ontology 72 Derrida, On the Name , pp. 124-5. 73 There are some similarities and differences with Žižek's interpretation of Schelling's notion of beginning. Space limitations do not allow for more than this brief comment. Slavoj Žižek, The Abyss of Freedom (Ann Arbor, Michigan: The University of Michigan Press, 1997), p. 91, fn. 11. 74 As put by the reviewer, 'I am doubtful whether the Derridean pseudo-logic of "neither-nor" and "both- and" can lead to anything but self-reflexively critical dead-end (deconstructionism provides an important moment for critical thinking, but without a wider system such as CR it is hard to see how this kind of a perspective might enable concrete research on international relations or political economy).' I thank the reviewers for raising this issue.</page><page sequence="13">Khôra as the condition of possibility 203 and (scientific or) social ontology with the conventional (and Critical Realist) (CR) understanding that 'a philosophical ontology' is 'an inquiry into which is logically prior to the development of any scientific or social ontology.'75 This view is in fact almost a 'given' in IR literature (and most of social theory). The argument then goes that instead of concentrating on pursuing 'self-reflexively critical dead-end' we must decide on a certain frame/framing; that is, we must enframe IR research (using CR or any other philosophical system/frame). One purpose of this article is to suggest new ways of thinking how to go beyond this dualistic framing of theory. Thus, I support more or less Patomäki's insightful view that:76 Philosophy can no longer claim the role of a general regulator of conceptual work that is part of all scientific research. Although philosophical reflection and criticism have their legitimate moments in the dialectics of science, the capacity of these philosophical moments to enlighten and guide practices and understandings is limited. Moreover, philosophy has no monopoly over the deepest questions, and often seems unable to pose them ... It is best to conceive philosophy not as a separate academic field but as part of all scientific activities.77 Likewise, in an effort to go beyond dead ends that seemingly plague IR theory on this issue, Jackson provides an elaborated and thorough discussion of this issue in his 2010 book. Agreeing with how Patomäki and Wight approach the issue of delineation, Jackson explains that:78 I have termed the basic philosophical components of a specific scientific methodology 'wagers' or 'commitments'. . . although they are foundational to particular modes of knowledge- production, they are themselves incapable of being definitively justified . . . and thus require of their practitioners a commitment that is like nothing else so much as an existential leap of faith . . . Talking about such wagers of philosophical ontology requires a vocabulary that is precise enough to permit significant differences and similarities between scientific methodologies to come to the forefront. This vocabulary is not a framework for evaluation; it is, rather, an instrument of clarification, helping to make explicit what is ordinarily tacit.79 Is the underlying philosophical ontology/social ontology demarcation sustainable when thought in terms of ontological qua АЛога-logical? This is a question about the issue of 'framing', or more precisely, framing via philosophical ontology - wagers in Jackson's term - of the process of theorising. Critical Realism and Jackson's pragmatism/analyticism (or any other enframing) would want to settle down (even if only in principle or methodologically) the issue of what constitutes both the frame for concrete IR theory. Yet this way of thinking ignores the role of 'enframing' in the 75 Heikki Patomäki and Colin Wight, 'After Postpositivism? The Promises of Critical Realism', Inter- national Studies Quarterly , 44:2 (2000), pp. 213-37, 215. 76 Patomäki, 'After Critical Realism?', p. 85. 77 However, even if one were to accept such a view, it does not diminish the importance of the question on the logic of such an approach. That is: this article can be understood as proposing another logic, a logic different from customarily adopted Aristotelian or even Hegelian logics. It would, for example, be worthwhile pursuing Patomäki's exploration to new possibilities that an adoption of quantum logic (more than just quantum physics as a science) would open up for/against/beyond Critical Realism. Such a venture (drawing, for example, on Plotnitsky's work in this regard) would go far in emphasising the issues that I raise in this article. Arkady Plotnitsky, Reconfigurations: Critical Theory and General Economy (Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1993); Arkady Plotnitsky, Complementarity : Anti-Epistemology after Bohr and Derrida (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1994). 78 Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, The Conduct of Inquiry in International Relations: Philosophy of Science and Its Implications for the Study of World Politics (New York: Routledge, 2010), pp. 197-8. 79 Although Jackson refuses to call it a 'framework', the vocabulary that he develops is indeed an enframing of what he believes is ordinarily tacit in the conduct of IR inquiry.</page><page sequence="14">204 Badredine Arft formulation of theories. I thus not only heed Patomäki's call that 'recent develop- ments in cosmology, physics and biology, including astrobiology, as well as theories of emergence and complexity, have made CR out-of-date in some important regards.'80 I also call for a rethinking of the relations of both 'philosophy of ontology' (à la CR, Jackson, or otherwise) and whatever insights we learn from contemporary sciences as a frame or parergon of the process of theorising social theory without ontologism. The delineation between philosophical ontology and social (scientific) ontology is, I argue, unsustainable due to the logic of parergonality , which can only be ignored through an act of violent silencing of one or the other side of the parergon/ergon. In this endeavour I draw insights from Derrida's statement on art when he writes that this permanent requirement - to distinguish between the internal or proper sense and the circumstance of the object being talked about - organizes all philosophical discourses on art, the meaning of art and meaning as such, from Plato to Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger. This requirement presupposes a discourse on the limit between the inside and outside of the art object, here a discourse on the frame.81 And when he also states that philosophical discourse has always been against the parergon. But what about this against . A parergon comes against, beside, and in addition to the ergon, the work done [fait], the fact [le fait], the work, but it does not fall to one side, it touches and cooperates within the opera- tion, from a certain outside. Neither simply outside nor simply inside. Like an accessory that one is obliged to welcome on the border, on board [au bord, à bord]*2 Before explicating my argument, let me briefly discuss Derrida's notion of parergon and the logic of parergonality. As put by Derrida, the parergon is neither work [ergon] nor outside the work [hors d'oeuvre], neither inside nor outside, neither above nor below, it disconcerts any opposition but does not remain indeterminate and it gives rise to the work. It is no longer merely around the work. That which it puts in place - the instances of the frame, the title, the signature, the legend, etc. - does not stop disturbing the internal order of discourse on painting, its works, its commerce, its evaluations, its surplus- values, its speculation, its law, and its hierarchies.83 We can paraphrase this text and apply it to CR's or Jackson's enframing of IR almost verbatim, that is: the enframing is neither inside IR theory nor outside it, neither above nor below; the enframing disconcerts any opposition but does not remain indeter- minate and it gives rise to the work of IR theory. The enframing is not merely around IR work. That which the enframing puts in place does not stop disturbing the internal order of IR discourses. Derrida also explains that: The parergon inscribes something which comes as an extra, exterior to the proper field . . . but whose transcendent exteriority comes to play, abut onto, brush against, rub, press against the limit itself and intervene in the inside only to the extent that the inside is lacking. It is lacking in something and it is lacking from itself 84 This can be translated onto IR as: CR (or any other approach) qua the parergon or enframing of IR inscribes something which comes as an extra, exterior to the proper IR field. Yet the transcendent exteriority comes to play, and press against the limit of 80 Patomäki, 'After Critical Realism?', p. 62. 81 Derrida, Truth in Painting , p. 45. 82 Ibid., p. 54. 83 Ibid., p. 9. 84 Ibid., p. 56.</page><page sequence="15">Khôra as the condition of possibility 205 IR itself and intervenes in the inside only to the extent that the inside (IR theory) is lacking in something. Moreover, the frame, according to Derrida, has a surface which separates [it] . . . not only . . . from the integral inside, from the body proper of the [work], but also from the outside, from the wall on which the painting is hung . . . from the whole field of historical, political inscription.85 Translated in terms of IR theory, we would say that CR (and other philosophical ap- proaches) is a discourse which separates itself not only from the integral inside, that is, IR theory, but also from the outside of IR theory (all other fields of social theory, etc.) and from the whole field of historical, political inscription in IR and elsewhere. The paregonal frame thus does not obey the logic of 'either this or that' and does not respect any border delineations. As Derrida put it: The parergonal frame stands out against two grounds [fonds], but with respect to each of these two grounds, it merges [se fond] into the other. With respect to the work which can serve as a ground for it, it merges into the wall, and then gradually, into the general text. With respect to the background which the general text is, it merges into the work, which stands out against the general background.86 This means that in the case of IR theory, on the one hand, CR (and any other enfram- ing) serves as a 'ground' for IR theory and as such merges in what constitutes the philosophical context of IR theory and then gradually into theories of knowledge. On the other hand, CR (and other enframings) merge into IR theory and are consti- tutively impossible to demarcate from IR theory when contrasted against the general background of knowledge beyond IR. As such, according to Derrida, 'the parergon . . . disappears, buries itself, effaces itself, melts away at the moment it deploys its greatest energy.'87 This means that any enframing of IR theory disappears, buries itself, effaces itself, and melts away at the moment it is deployed. Yet the ergon or IR theory cannot be as such without an enframing (CR or anything else). What makes enframing and the enframed work essentially enmeshed and inseparable is what is lacking in both the parergon (enframing) and the ergon (IR work), or more precisely, as put by Derrida, against what is lacking in it; not against the lack as a posable or opposable negative, a sub- stantial emptiness, a determinable and bordered absence (still verifiable essence and presence) but against the impossibility of arresting différance in its contour, of arraigning the heterogeneous [différance] in a pose, of localizing, even in a meta-empirical way, what metaphysics calls . . . lack , of making it come back, equal or similar to itself ... to its proper place.88 That is, what is lacking in both the enframing (of IR) and the work (IR) is the impos- sibility of arresting the play of différance in its contour, the supposed contour between the frame and the framed, a contour which never stops différantially disappearing and appearing into both the outside and the inside of IR work.89 As nicely put by Harvey, 85 Ibid., p. 61. 86 Ibid. 87 Ibid. 88 Ibid., pp. 80-1. 89 Différance , explains Derrida, 'is what makes the movement of signification possible only if each element that is said to be "present", appearing on the stage of presence, is related to something other than itself but retains the mark of a past element and already lets itself be hollowed out by the mark of its relation to a future element.' This means that différance is a differing and a deferral relationship between 'terms' which turns these 'terms' into a concatenation of presence and absence. Each term contains within itself both the mark of a past element and the mark of the relation with a future element. This is the effect of</page><page sequence="16">206 Badredine Arft The parergon/ ergon distinction is one which floats, oscillates and ultimately can be shown to be a mirroring yet distancing relation of différance. It is a relation of doubling which belies the linear temporality of an origin/copy relation. The ergon is not simply prior (temporally or historically) to the parergon. Rather, they 'come into existence,' or are 'given' simultaneously. It is this simultaneity, however, that within the structure of parergonality presents itself as a temporal contingency of before and after which thus entails a certain attachability and in turn a detachability of parergon to an ergon already fully formed.90 I believe that this undecidability of the parergon/ergon distinction is what prompts Jackson to declare: let me now offer a methodological principle and a provisional set of distinctions that, when combined, form what I believe is a useful typology for the discussion of the philosophy of science in IR. The methodological principle is that we should regard positions on the character and conduct of science to rest on provisional commitments - wagers - about matters of philosophical ontology that can really never be settled definitively.91 Wagers which are, as quoted up above, grounded on an 'existential leap of faith', nothing more and nothing less. This undecidable relation between ergon and parergon , between the frame and the enframed is what deconstruction problematizes ... in order to reveal that which grounds both ergon and parergon and makes the relation possible, which is evidently neither term, but rather parergonality. What parergonality entails includes the parasitic contamination of inside and outside, internal and external, interior and exterior distinctions.92 The relation between the enframing (of IR theory) and the work (IR theory) is one of parergonality, which is not, as explained by Harvey, simply the law of the relation between parergon and the ergon , but it opens out onto the lack that inhabits the ergon in order to make the parergon possible and makes its appearance as essential effaceable. That is, the lack in the ergon (the work) cannot as lack be recognized, cannot as such be named . . . Rather, it is in evidence only by effect: the effect of the parergon which 'fills it', albeit inadequately, incompletely and inappropriately, and this 'in' is of necessity. The ergon as ergon offers itself as complete, as not lacking, and hence the status of the parergon can reduced to an extrinsic appendage, detachable and inessential. It is the hiddeness and the clandestine operation of filling the hidden lack which organizes the relation of ergon to parergon which will be analyzed here as the 'central' issue of parergonality.93 Paraphrasing Harvey,94 the relation between IR work and its enframings is a double one. IR work is never fully complete, never fully finished, never fully independent, but rather entails an inner lack which calls forth the enframing to complete it. The work or IR theory is never without a frame. The relation between the enframing (of IR) and the work (IR theory), which is one of parergonality 'is always of necessity double; appearing as externality, in fact internally connecting.'95 the trace, which, according to Derrida, 'relates no less to what is called the future than to what is called the past, and it constitutes what is called the present by this very relation to what it is not, to what it absolutely is not; that is, not even to a past or future considered as a modified present.'

Not only does this imply that the customary practice of seeking a more 'concrete' IR theory/research is not possible, which is unsurprisingly seen in the continuous proliferation of new ways of approaching IR without any rest or respite. It also means that any cut or interruption is but a temporary one which is necessarily doomed to be replaced by more movement. We can interrupt and cut but this is only a deferral and a temporalisation toward more difference to come, which ineluctably remains haunted with traces of past theorisation and pushed forward through the promise for more.</page></plain_text>
